 SMOG WARS: Ventura County wants to target stinky old cars as a way to clear 
the air. It's all part of an anti-smog plan endorsed Tuesday by county leaders 
(B1). . . . But Julie Hernandez wonders how the owners of old cars feel about 
that. "I'm concerned about how that would impact low-income people," she said. 
Hernandez is a member of a board that advises supervisors on how to spend 
industry donations to a special clean-air fund. . . . Not to worry, say the 
plan's architects: Low-income people will help shape the air cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG BUCKS: OK, so it wasn't exactly a windfall. But Simi Valley officials were 
handed a big check Monday. . . . Southern California Edison representatives 
presented a jumbo-sized check for $6,164 to the Simi Valley City Council -- the 
amount that the city has saved by installing energy-saving equipment. . . . 
Edison officials later handed over a real check for the city to deposit. "We'll 
try to cash both of them," City Manager Lin Koester quipped. Camarillo 
officials expect their $33,812 check tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDDING VOW: John and Mary Cimino remember it like it was yesterday. He was in 
the Air Force, she was at the Pentagon. He asked her to dance at an Easter 
party, and they were married a little more than two months later. . . . The 
Simi Valley couple joined more than a dozen others Tuesday in celebrating their 
wedding vows at the Ventura County Fair (B1). . . . The key to their 52-year 
marriage: "Loving and sharing," Mary Cimino said. 
</P>
<P>
 URBAN REFUGE: Ventura County remains a favored place for Angelenos fleeing 
big-city crime and quakes (B1). . . . Los Angeles County sent about 16,000 
licensed drivers this way during the last fiscal year. Only about 10,000 
drivers went the other way. . . . "It's an awfully nice place to live," said 
Carolyn Leavens, president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
"The beaches, the mountains and climate. In fact, we're afraid to say it too 
loud."

FIGHTING NUCLEAR SMUGGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chilling evidence suggesting that nuclear material is being smuggled out of 
the former Soviet Union for illicit sale on world markets has prompted a new 
agreement between Germany and Russia for closer cooperation to combat movement 
of the contraband. In the last four months three such shipments have been 
intercepted in Germany, the most recent on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow to 
Munich two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Western scientists who examined that 10.5-ounce cache of plutonium-239 believe 
it originated in Russia. But Moscow has emphatically denied any official 
laxity, and in last week's agreement Germany diplomatically refrained from new 
finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 National pride is clearly very much at issue here, and some in Russia have 
also hastened to charge that worries over smuggled plutonium have been 
fabricated to justify Western intrusion into Russian nuclear facilities. But 
the widespread breakdown in order and controls in Russia and the rise of 
organized crime, graphically described by Times correspondent Richard Boudreaux 
last Sunday, indicate that the theft and smuggling of nuclear material 
represent an all too plausible threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event there's no denying that German authorities have intercepted 
plutonium within their borders. How much smuggled material may have escaped 
detection is almost too scary to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 Such nuclear-ambitious countries as Iran and Libya are believed to be in the 
market for plutonium, a laboratory-created element not found in nature. But 
plutonium's great toxicity -- a small amount could poison a major city's water 
supply -- makes it a weapon coveted by terrorists as well as by states. Germany 
and Russia have agreed on closer intelligence cooperation and tighter border 
controls to try to curb the traffic in plutonium. But Germany isn't the only 
entry point for nuclear contraband. Other nations should be enlisted in this 
grim anti-smuggling effort, for the stakes are literally a matter of life and 
death.

ZEDILLO'S BIG CHALLENGE: THE 5 NORTHERN 5 NEIGHBOR; THE MEXICAN 
PRESIDENT-ELECT'S FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ernesto Zedillo is sworn in Dec. 1 as Mexico's president, he will face 
domestic issues different from those faced by any of his predecessors. But in 
foreign policy he will confront one big challenge that every Mexican president 
has confronted -- getting along with a friendly but sometimes intimidating 
northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, in dealing with the United States Zedillo can count on a deep 
reservoir of goodwill built up by his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
the most pro-U.S. president Mexico has had in a generation. Salinas' 
willingness to work closely with Washington was exemplified by last year's 
historic North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA was significant in its own right, as the initial surge in U.S. trade 
with Mexico proves, but it was also symbolically important. It showed that a 
new generation of Mexican political leaders like Salinas and Zedillo was 
willing to put aside the misunderstanding that often has marked U.S-Mexican 
relations and work for a mutually beneficial future. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say NAFTA is flawless. Indeed, fine-tuning it is high on 
Zedillo's agenda. Although large Mexican companies can hold their own against 
the U.S. firms now free to do business south of the border, Zedillo is 
concerned that small businesses and farmers may need temporary protection from 
the buffeting of economic change. Washington should hear him out, because bad 
business conditions in Mexico add to the flow of Mexicans seeking work in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexico's economy and migration to the United States are closely 
related, the link too often is ignored. If border-arrest statistics are true 
indications, half of the U.S. illegal immigration problem could be solved if 
some way could be found to better regulate the influx of Mexican workers. 
Despite the fears of those who think those people are coming to the United 
States to stay, most serious research indicates many migrants return home after 
working here for a time. Zedillo has expressed an interest in discussing with 
Washington a cross-border labor agreement similar to NAFTA. The Clinton 
Administration too should be interested in such a discussion, which among other 
things might cool the overheated debate in this country over illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem that Zedillo must not lose sight of is drug trafficking. 
Salinas was admirably candid in publicly acknowledging that illegal drugs are a 
problem not just for the United States but for Mexico too. Zedillo, during his 
political campaign, promised to root out official corruption and to make 
Mexico's justice system more trustworthy. Both tasks will be made all the 
harder by the dirty money that drug barons spread around. Zedillo will need all 
the allies he can get -- including U.S. law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Washington should do what it can to help Zedillo make sure that as 
many of Mexico's 92 million people as possible benefit from the wealth 
generated by NAFTA and Mexico's rapidly modernizing economy. Zedillo, a former 
minister of education in Salinas' Cabinet, believes that better schools and 
other education programs are key to that. Here too Washington should do what it 
can to assist him, if only out of enlightened self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Zedillo is at ease with his occasionally overbearing northern 
neighbor not just because he grew up in the border city of Mexicali but because 
of the time he spent at Yale on a Mexican government scholarship. Those are two 
more portents, we hope, of good U.S.-Mexico relations during the Zedillo years.

FIRE WATCH; SAFETY FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, a smoldering cigarette tossed from a passing car touched off a 
one-acre fire near the ignition point of last October's devastating Laguna 
Beach fire. Last weekend, a rifle bullet fired at a metal target ignited a 
brush fire that blackened 180 acres in the Cleveland National Forest.And the 
worst of the Southern California fire season is not yet upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 One top official of the Los Angeles County Fire Department warned last week 
that dry weather and brush have created a potential for disastrous fires. The 
traditional fire season will not begin until next month (it continues through 
November) but already there have been flare-ups that are worrisome, 
particularly at a time when memories of last year's fires in Altadena, Malibu 
and Laguna Beach are so fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cleveland National Forest blaze, a firearms instructor told 
investigators that one shot from a rifle at a metal target set off sparks that 
ignited the fire, which spread from private property to the federal forest. The 
no doubt unintentional disregard of the dangerously dry conditions resulted in 
the need to call in hundreds of firefighters and three water-dropping 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. County officials on Tuesday wisely authorized a 30-day test of the 
water-dropping "Super Scooper" airplane. Wildfires can be put down more quickly 
with a Super Scooper's help -- but there's nothing like an ounce of prevention. 
After a year of little rain and with the Santa Ana winds on the horizon, it is 
especially important now to clear brush and use common sense.

BETTER MATH, SCIENCE GRADES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed at the chronically dismal performance of American youngsters in 
science and mathematics, educators all over the country have been beefing up 
basic programs in those areas for several years. Solid national evidence that 
all this is working came with the latest biennial report from the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress. It found that science and math skills of 
elementary and high school students had risen substantially since the 1983 
report "A Nation at Risk," which described a dangerous downward spiral in 
proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 While welcome, the news is hardly cause for great celebration. There were no 
similar gains in reading and writing skills, and the gap between white and 
minority students remains stubbornly wide. 
</P>
<P>
 California, which ranks at or close to the bottom among the states in almost 
every statistical indicator of educational investment in science and math 
curricula, cannot find much to brag about in the report. Slightly more than 
half of California fourth-graders fell below even basic math proficiency 
levels, compared to 30% for Massachusetts and 41% for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found a sharp decrease in the amount of reading materials such as 
encyclopedias, books and magazines in homes over the last two decades. Also, a 
third of 17-year-olds reported they were not required to do any homework at 
all. Thus this generation is getting an education significantly inferior to 
their parents' -- at a time when the global industrial economy demands ever 
more sophisticated technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the report does show that stricter requirements and more complex 
courses in science and math do work. This page has called for the bolstering of 
science teaching and higher minimum requirements, particularly in California if 
it is to produce a technically skilled work force that will attract industry 
essential to economic recovery. We call on all parents, teachers and political 
leaders to join this effort.

HEALTH REFORM DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Why Health Care Reform May Be Beyond Saving" (Opinion, Aug. 14) is right on 
target. Health reform, as being proposed, won't sell because the majority sees 
it as taking more than it can ever give. The article's clear logic gave me an 
idea worthy of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government believes it must provide health coverage, I propose a tax 
credit (not a deduction, a credit at the bottom line) equal to the amount of 
health insurance premium paid by any taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it would cover all taxpayers, this plan would be as close to 
"universal" coverage as we are likely to get. Because no government bureaucracy 
would be involved, this plan would be cheaper than any now proposed. Because it 
is a tax credit, it costs nothing for the individual taxpayer; the individual 
who needs coverage breaks even. Because it is a break-even plan, it would need 
to apply only to those individuals who really need it. Those who already have 
coverage (government, employer, etc.) would not have to do anything. Best of 
all, it would leave health care with those who know something about it, and not 
have the government get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 On the negative side, this plan would only take a page or two to document, so 
no self-respecting representative is likely to vote for it.

 * I, age 73, join other members angry over the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons' stand in favor of the Clinton health plan (Aug. 12). Seniors, whose 
Medicare is already 75% subsidized, want working people to give them even more, 
regardless of the recipient's ability to pay. Our generation, which should be 
"the responsible generation," is outdoing "the gimme generation," at the same 
time it is predicted, "Entitlements Seen Taking Up Nearly All Taxes by 2012" 
(Aug. 9).

 Why, if Medicare is such a success, does not Congress enlarge this program to 
include everyone? Why have not dental costs risen as rapidly as other medical 
costs? Why do doctors who accept Medicare-approved amounts submit bills of more 
than twice that amount? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, if certain lifestyle choices (i.e., smoking, drugs, promiscuity) are 
known to cause outlandish expenses, should those who act responsibly pay the 
same for health insurance?

<P>
 * In February of 1989 my 7-year-old son Jonathan was diagnosed with leukemia. 
Within a month of his diagnosis we received notice from our insurance carrier 
that our entire group's (not just our family's) medical insurance was being 
canceled in 30 days. Having to handle the emotional stress and needs of my son 
and then being threatened with potential financial ruin at the same time were 
just a little hard to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jonathan had a "catastrophic illness" and was totally uninsurable at any 
cost, federal legislation called COBRA forced the insurance company to give him 
our policy -- full coverage of $1 million for one year. However, after one year 
Jonathan's coverage dropped to $100,000, lifetime. Jonathan's premium soon 
jumped from $160 per month to almost $600 per month! Plus, the rest of the 
family had to obtain and pay for separate medical insurance . 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for us, California implemented a program paid for by tobacco and 
liquor taxes to provide insurance at reasonable rates for uninsurable people 
like Jonathan. However, the annual coverage limit is $50,000. Jonathan is doing 
fine, but if he falls out of remission, $50,000 wouldn't last 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Today many people cannot change jobs because of fear of losing their medical 
insurance. The medical insurance industry only wants to insure healthy people. 
The politicians need to stop trying to be Democrats and Republicans looking at 
the next election and do what is good for the country by passing a 
comprehensive new health care plan.  
</P>
<P>
 RAYMOND H. MILLER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I am delighted that the majority of Republicans in Congress are opposed to 
employer mandates for health insurance, as this means that we are certain to 
see income tax refunds to those of us who are now contributing to the 
2-million-plus federal employees' health care payments. 
</P>
<P>
 I only want to know just when Sens. Bob Dole and Phil Gramm and Rep. Newt 
Gingrich will be canceling their employer-mandated insurance policies and 
returning the premium to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 CAROL BIRKENHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 * It is fascinating to me, though not surprising, that every single person I 
hear say that our health care system is not in crisis is a fat cat. Sen. Dole 
certainly never has to worry when he gets sick. I have yet to hear someone from 
the ranks of the middle class or below say that we have the best health care 
system in the world. Most of them live in abject fear of getting anything more 
serious than a head cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Antoinette proclaimed, "Let them eat cake." In our time, it is the 
Republicans saying, "Let them take aspirin."

FIREFIGHTERS' ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Thursday happened to be an emotional day for me. I reside in Pismo Beach 
(just south of San Luis Obispo and the recent devastating Highway 41 fire). My 
oldest daughter and I had occasion to witness during the morning the countless 
convoys of Southland firefighters traveling back home. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter asked why I was crying. I explained to her that I was very proud 
of the firefighters who left their communities and families to help save our 
community. I also cried for the sense of relief that I felt. I also explained 
to her that I cried for the families who suffered losses in this fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day I had to travel north on Highway 101 and was able to view some 
of the damage. Ironically, a "Smokey Bear" sign with the phrase "Thank You" was 
along the roadside, partially charred and broken, one victim of the fire. 
However, there were also a number of handmade signs throughout San Luis Obispo 
and Atascadero, attached to overpasses and fences along the highway. These 
signs each had a message thanking the firefighters for their help. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope all the firefighting crews traveling down the highway had a chance to 
see the signs, and if not, please know from this note that the citizens of 
these communities sincerely appreciated your help. We thank you all for helping 
save our community and giving us peace of mind. As one sign along the roadside 
read: "God bless each and every firefighter." Amen. 
</P>

 * They must be giants, these men and women who stand in front of a roaring 
wall of destruction with a shovel and a trickle of water and say "not this 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 The mobilization of firefighters and equipment from El Monte, Sierra Madre, 
Covina and every other community in California is an awe-inspiring sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The stamina and courage of those that put themselves in harm's way will long 
be remembered in this county. There have been some tragic losses, but there 
were many more wins. It has been a Paul Bunyan effort. California is proud. San 
Luis Obispo is grateful.

DR. CLAUDIA HAMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Claudia H. Hampton died Aug. 13 in Los Angeles. She had served as a 
trustee of the California State University for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the privilege of working with Dr. Hampton when I was general counsel of 
the CSU, and she was in her first term as a trustee. We have remained friends 
ever since. She dedicated her life to serving the educational needs of the 
young people of California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a trustee, and as a two-term chair of the board, Dr. Hampton came to know 
the system personally. She refused to rely on reports at monthly meetings. 
Instead, she got out to the campuses, not occasionally but often. She came to 
be known and respected by literally thousands of students, faculty and 
administrators throughout the state, as well as by several generations of 
colleagues on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hampton was initially appointed by Gov. Ronald Reagan. She was reappointed 
by Govs. Jerry Brown, George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson. She was a credit to 
all of them. This consistent and unbroken record of recognition for her ability 
is unique in California. I will miss her friendship, and higher education will 
miss her dedication, her ability to forge consensus and her grace.

 Re "Fighting Back," editorial, Aug. 14:

 I can't believe the state of California has made ads insulting Texas, the 
state that has led the nation in creating jobs for the past three years.Sure, 
Texas may have mosquitoes, hurricanes and humidity, but that is nothing 
compared to California's earthquakes, fires and droughts. Californians should 
really be saying how good their state is instead of bashing others.

COMING SOON FROM SYRIA: PEACE WITH ISRAEL; MIDEAST: ASSAD MAY SEEM RELUCTANT, 
BUT WITHOUT A DEAL WITH RABIN, HE'D BE ISOLATED WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN.

 The Israeli-Jordanian peace accord raises a critical question: Will it 
persuade the Syrian regime to be more flexible and reach a settlement with 
Israel?  
</P>
<P>
 The key to a Syria-Israel peace breakthrough lies in Washington. An effective 
U.S. approach toward Syrian-Israeli peace must focus on economic and political 
dimensions as much as on territorial concessions. Syria's cooperation depends 
not only on Israel's willingness to give up the Golan Heights, but also on a 
U.S. commitment to improve relations with Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria's President Hafez Assad will not sign a peace agreement with Israel as 
long as Syria is subject to economic sanctions because the State Department 
lists it among the countries supporting terrorism. To Assad, the normalization 
of U.S.-Syrian relations, along with the recovery of the Golan -- which Israel 
captured in 1967 when Assad was defense minister -- is a prerequisite for a 
breakthrough in negotiations. As Assad put it, achieving peace "requires a 
qualitative move" in the relations between Washington and Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their Egyptian, Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian counterparts, the 
Syrian leaders hope to receive considerable economic aid directly from the 
United States and indirectly through multinational channels, as a reward for a 
bold move toward peace. To the Syrians, economic security is as important as 
strategic security. The Assad regime urgently needs Western aid since the 
demise of its superpower patron, the Soviet Union, and the drying up of migrant 
remittances and financial assistance from the oil-producing Gulf states. Hence 
the promise of U.S. financial rewards will reinforce the perceptions and 
beliefs of the Syrian ruling coalition that it must make peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the need to reap the benefits of peace, Assad is not constrained by 
internal political considerations. Unlike PLO chairman Yasser Arafat or 
Jordan's King Hussein, the Syrian leader does not face any credible domestic 
opposition to peace. The bloody 1982 suppression of Islamists in the city of 
Hama silenced Assad's main opponents and consolidated his political authority. 
With the Palestinian and Jordanian breakthroughs, Syria is isolated; Assad can 
no longer pose as the representative of a united Arab front. Although he might 
give the impression that he is in no rush for an "incomplete" peace, he is 
fully aware of the new realities of Middle Eastern politics and his dwindling 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 By dragging his feet and sticking with his hard-bargaining strategy, Assad is 
playing hard to get, hoping to win further concessions from Israel and induce 
the United States to recognize the strategic role of Syria in regional security 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Syrian leader cannot afford a return to the status quo that would pit 
him against a new alliance of Israel, Turkey, the United States and most of the 
Arab states. Assad is also conscious of the intricacies of Israeli domestic 
politics: Collapse of Syrian-Israeli peace talks would bring to power a far 
less accommodating Likud-led government; that prospect should give both Assad 
and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin an incentive to compromise. A number of 
developments suggest that the Syrian regime is moving slowly but steadily 
toward closing the final bloody chapter in Arab-Israeli hostilities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Assad has embraced the formula "full withdrawal for full peace." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Syrian official has confirmed that indirect contacts with Israel have been 
established. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Syrian government has undertaken a deliberate effort to prepare the 
public for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assad has shown restraint and moderation by not opposing the Palestinian and 
Jordanian accords with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no breakthrough has yet occurred, the effort has produced significant 
progress: Assad and Rabin both now accept the basis for a settlement -- 
territory for peace -- and Rabin seems to be edging toward accepting Assad's 
"full withdrawal for full peace" formula. Hence the deadlock in Syrian-Israeli 
peace talks is more tactical than strategic and will yield to U.S. intervention 
and tangible assistance to the socioeconomic and political development of the 
area . 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is clearly courting Assad, coaxing him to make a 
deal. The President has gone out of his way to reassure Assad that he is 
"personally committed to the objective of a comprehensive peace" and recognizes 
that "Syria is the key to the achievement" of this goal. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher has been shuttling between Damascus and Jerusalem, 
committing the political weight and prestige of U.S. diplomacy to the 
attainment of a treaty between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 For all these reasons, a breakthrough in the Syrian-Israeli peace talks is 
imminent.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; GETTING A JUMP ON HEALTH CARE; DO AWAY WITH PRIVATE 
INSURANCE, MAKE THE STATE THE 'SINGLE PAYER' -- THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST 
CONSUMER REVOLT EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL ZIMMERMAN and PACY MARKMAN, The authors are principals in the Santa 
Monica political consulting firm, Zimmerman & Markman. They are working on the 
campaign to pass Proposition 186. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a stealth bomber, Proposition 186 is headed our way. It's packing a 
mighty wallop and approaching rapidly, but it has yet to appear on news media 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
 If it passes in November, Proposition 186 will provide cradle-to-grave 
health-care coverage for all Californians, coverage that can never be taken 
away, including medical expenses, long-term care at home or in a nursing home, 
prescription drugs, mental health and dental benefits, even eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 would accomplish this by eliminating the hundreds of private 
health insurance companies, each with its own duplicative forms, salespeople, 
advertising, executive salaries and profits, recovering the 27% of our 
health-insurance premiums that is wasted on these nonessential and non-medical 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 would put the $40 billion-a-year California health-insurance 
industry out of business, and use the more than $10 billion in consumer savings 
to pay for expanded coverage. A new state agency would collect tax money 
instead of premiums and pay 100% of medical bills. Individuals would never see 
a medical bill or insurance form for covered care again. 
</P>
<P>
 This is arguably the biggest, most important, most far-reaching initiative 
ever placed before voters. Its financial impact would far exceed that of 
Proposition 13. Even Proposition 103, the strongest initiative attack on 
insurance to date, stopped far short of so drastic a solution, seeking only to 
regulate, not dismantle, its target. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite its importance, Proposition 186 has received scant press 
coverage. Unless that changes substantially and soon, voters will be left at 
the mercy of sound bites and unreliable advertising. Hardly the best way to 
make a decision with severe financial and health implications for us all.  
</P>
<P>
 To get the debate under way, let's look at some of the claims and 
counterclaims. Proponents of Proposition 186 argue that what we already spend 
on health insurance could buy complete coverage for every Californian. We don't 
get that coverage because of the $10 billion a year gobbled up by insurance 
company overhead and profit. Under a single state agency, the industry's 27% 
overhead could be reduced to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents scoff at this claim, but supporters counter that Medicare runs on 
exactly that margin, and is the one government program most like a "single 
payer" plan. In any case, Proposition 186 sets an absolute maximum of 4% on 
administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say that Proposition 186 is the only way to preserve our private 
health-care system. Insurance companies are placing increasingly stringent 
limitations on which doctors patients may see, and what treatments doctors may 
prescribe. Under Proposition 186, every Californian would receive a benefits 
card that could be used to get care from the doctor, hospital or HMO of his or 
her choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 makes health insurance, but not medicine, a publicly 
administered function. Any doctor could maintain a private practice, any 
hospital could remain privately owned, and all HMOs would be free to offer 
care; all health providers would have to compete on the basis of quality, not 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that Proposition 186 would create a vast, impersonal and 
unwieldy state bureaucracy, leaving us with a health-care system that combines 
the efficiency of the post office with the humanity of the Internal Revenue 
Service. Savings would be eaten up by government waste; state bureaucrats would 
come between us and our doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents counter that it is the bureaucracy and duplicative paperwork of the 
insurance companies that would be eliminated. And while the health-insurance 
system would be streamlined and made more efficient, the health-care system 
would be left intact. The single state insurance agency would collect new tax 
money and use it to pay everyone's bills, after negotiating fees with all 
health providers to control costs. The agency would not tell doctors what 
services they may or may not provide, as health insurance companies now do. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents complain that Proposition 186 includes the largest tax hike in 
history: a 2.5% surcharge on taxable income, a payroll tax ranging from 4.4% to 
8.9% depending on number of employees, and a $1-per-pack cigarette tax. 
Businesses would be hurt, jobs would be lost, and California's economy would go 
into an even deeper tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents complain that opponents never reveal that these new taxes are more 
than offset by the fact that no business or individual would ever pay insurance 
premiums again. All premiums, all deductibles, all caps on expenditures and 
most co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses would disappear. Businesses would 
benefit because the new payroll tax would be less than their current 
health-insurance costs, just as the new income tax would be less than what most 
families now pay for health insurance.Businesses also would benefit from 
reduced workers' comp premiums, since a third of that coverage is 
health-related. Opponents say that Proposition 186 would be an open invitation 
to medically indigent immigrants and out-of-staters to come to California for 
free care. Proponents point out that only California residents (as defined by 
the Legislature) would receive benefits cards. While there may be some minor 
abuse, the advantages of granting health insurance to the 5 million 
Californians currently without it far outweigh the disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that Proposition 186 is too good to be true. Proponents say 
that they are biased, and cite official disclosure reports revealing that 92% 
of their funding comes from the same health-insurance lobby that is spending so 
heavily to block reform in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Congress changes our health-care system or not, voters across the 
nation will ponder reform for a long time to come. But only in California will 
they actually make the decision about the kind of reform they want.

THE HARDEST PART IS LETTING GO; A MOTHER LISTENS TO THE WEDDING MARCH AND HEARS

 It wasn't in my plans to cry at my daughter's wedding. I cry when I hurt and I 
laugh out loud as often as life lets me. I am proud of having learned to 
express the emotion appropriate for life's moments, and I could not see 
anything to cry about: My daughter was marrying a young man who respects her 
and makes her laugh, whose ambitions and interests parallel hers. They like 
each other. What was there to cry about? This is an occasion to smile, to be 
proud and happy, as I was when she played a sugar plum in the Oakland Ballet 
production of "The Nutcracker." In photographs commemorating her high school 
and college graduation, there I am, cheeky grin, full of righteous maternal 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter certainly did not expect me to cry. I was looking forward to this 
wedding and the reception, dancing all night to '70s soul, the incidental music 
of her childhood. Kelley and I exchanged secret smiles as we sat through our 
respective hair appointments just four hours before the ceremony. We laughed 
out loud during the pre-wedding photography sessions in my mother's living 
room. And when I saw her in the church sanctuary, my temporal-mandibular joint 
ached from grinning. I felt no sorrow. At worst, I was anxious for the evening 
she had planned for nearly a year to go smoothly, for the glitches to be minor 
and the night to be memorable. "Goodby, unmarried daughter," I said to her in 
the sanctuary. "The next time we talk, you'll be a married lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps giving voice to that particular reality triggered the tears that took 
me by surprise. When the bridal march swelled out of the church organ, we all 
stood and turned our attention to the rear of the left aisle of the church. 
There she stood beside her stepfather, confident and happy, clutching her 
bouquet, fairly gleaming. My throat caught at her beauty, my heart actually 
leapt in my chest and I felt the swift sting of tears. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, I cried for a host of reasons. My thoughts at the moment went 
something like: This moment is the proof that we don't own our children. This 
moment changes our relationship forever. If he is not good to her, I will take 
her back. She is beautiful, objectively speaking. I was overwhelmed, and I 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 The host of reasons? Once, the bride was a little girl who turned cartwheels 
in the middle of conversations and wished that I would wear high heels like 
other mothers, instead of clogs. The stately bride, gliding toward the altar 
slowly enough to give all the amateur photographers a fair opportunity, had 
identified the man at her side as my future husband when she was 12. It took 
him and me another four years to see things her way. This woman grew out of the 
teen who, in lieu of endless sorrow, decided to attach spiritual significance 
to the death of her beloved grandfather on the evening of her 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crying seemed appropriate, suddenly. Not just because of the child I could see 
beyond the bridal veil, but because I know all the aspects of this 
girl-I-raised-to-womanhood, and how savvy, tough, optimistic and well-educated 
she is. Her marriage is the first road that I am sending her on alone. It hurt, 
for an instant, to think that marriage means the girl is gone, in a way made 
evident by no other milestone in her life. I missed her already. I have been 
married for nine lovely years, and I knew the work ahead of this fairy princess 
in bugle beads and borrowed pearls. I knew the hard work I had done, how much 
of myself went into getting her grown, and if she will take this man, my work 
appeared finished. I knew how to be mommy, but could not imagine, in that 
instant, how I could forge any other kind of connection with this person 
gliding down the aisle toward her future. 
</P>
<P>
 After allowing myself the momentary luxury of feeling sorry for my loss, I 
took a deep breath and felt better. I have always told her that feeling better 
is the point to crying when you hurt. She married, and I cried as mothers will. 
There was still the dancing all night to do, and lifetimes of possibilities for 
a woman-to-woman relationship with my daughter.

HENLEY CAN TRAVEL, ON $1-MILLION BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley can travel with the Rams if he posts $1-million bail 
and is accompanied by a court officer everywhere but on the field, a judge 
ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, 27, is free on $200,000 bail while awaiting trial for allegedly 
running a nationwide cocaine network.Under conditions of his previous bail, he 
could not leave the federal Center District of California, which includes Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley must pay the entire cost of having a U.S. marshal accompany him, will 
be restricted to the team hotel or game site and will have his salary put in 
escrow while he is on the road, U.S. District Judge Gary Taylor ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said Henley can either pay a bondsman $100,000 to secure the bail, 
or have someone else put up the $100,000 and guarantee the balance if Henley 
flees. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Chaleff, one of Henley's lawyers, said he did not know whether the Rams 
would guarantee the $1 million. The team would get the $100,000 back if Henley 
complied with the judge's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley signed a one-year, $400,000 contract with the Rams last month after 
nearly a year's leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are scheduled to play a preseason game against the Chargers in San 
Diego on Thursday.

 'Traumatic' Depiction: Indian film director Shekhar Kapur drew a packed house 
at Scotland's Edinburgh Film Festival on Tuesday to introduce his controversial 
new film about India's brutal exploitation of women. " 'The Bandit Queen' is a 
traumatic movie," Kapur said of the true story of Phoolan Devi, a low-caste 
woman whose cruel mistreatment by men turned her into an outlaw of almost 
mythical status among India's dispossessed. "If you decide to walk out, it is 
understandable." Nobody walked out, but many movie-goers expressed shock, with 
one viewer calling the film "stomach-churning." The film, commissioned by 
Britain's Channel 4, gives an unflinching portrait of a world in which 
pre-pubescent girls are sold into marriage and forced sexual degradation. It 
has not yet been approved by Indian censors. STAGE

 Alex Schedule: Glendale's Alex Regional Theatre Board has booked a touring 
production of "Dreamgirls" as the second production of the Alex season that was 
interrupted when the financially troubled Theatre Corp. of America withdrew as 
the series producer. The "Dreamgirls" tour is produced by Barry Singer of New 
York and New Jersey. It doesn't use a contract with Actors' Equity, the stage 
actors' union, and an Equity official said that any non-union substitute for 
the union shows that had earlier been sold as the subscription season will 
probably result in informational picket lines in front of the theater. 
"Dreamgirls" -- scheduled for Sept. 24-Oct. 9 -- and the third, 
yet-to-be-selected show of the current season are expected to be financed with 
a $600,000 loan from the Glendale Redevelopment Agency. POP/ROCK

death certificate knowingly lied about the cause of death. Medical examiner 
Jerry Francisco, who said that the singer died of heart disease, has long been 
accused of suppressing the role that drugs played in Presley's death. Davis, 
brought in by the Tennessee Department of Health, said he will report his 
findings within two weeks. . . . Meanwhile, about 40 Presley fans finally got 
refunds Monday for the king of rock 'n' roll's Aug. 22, 1977, concert at New 
Jersey's Nassau Coliseum. Presley died six days before the scheduled show. In 
all, about 150 fans gathered to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the concert

 But lawyer-haters will be glad to know that lawyers had it bad back then too. 
It turns out that Courtois underestimates how grody these villages (and 
villagers) can be. Abbeville is ruled by the Seigneur (Nicol Williamson), a 
merchant who specializes in pinched smiles and glazed gazes. He purchased his 
title -- it's kind of like buying a black belt in karate -- and the rule of law 
along with it. His prosecutor, Pincheon (Donald Pleasence), has that groggy, 
on-the-payroll look. When he squares off with Courtois in court, it's a tossup 
to see if he'll nod off before Courtois storms off. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about Middle Ages movies that almost always provoke giggles? Maybe 
it's the way all that clanking and posturing clashes with modern acting styles. 
Maybe it's because Monty Python has made it just about impossible to look at 
the 15th Century on film without expecting John Cleese to totter about in 
armor. "The Advocate," written and directed by Leslie Megahey, makes the 
mistake of taking itself seriously -- but not quite seriously enough. It makes 
a fuss about the conflict between civil and religious law, it tries for a You 
Were There quality. It keeps flashing title cards, for that Important Movie 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also seems as campy as those old Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe pictures, 
with Williamson in the Vincent Price role. Courtois just happens to be boarding 
in what turns out to be a sort of hostel-brothel, which provides the 
opportunity for some explicit medieval nookie. Cleavage was big back then. 
There's also the requisite banquet eating scenes, with platters of cooked game 
and a sultry (is there any other kind?) Gypsy girl doing a dance of veils. You 
half expect Victor Mature and Anita Ekberg to show up. When Courtois and the 
Gypsy (Amina Annabi) have one of those it-can-never-be-I-am-not-of-your-world 
romances, we wait for the inevitable A Part of Me Stays With You parting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The underpinnings of the plot concern the fact that, under medieval law, 
everything created by God was subject to his laws. So we're subjected to scenes 
in which Courtois calls rats to testify in a murder trial, but not the Jewish 
surgeon, without rights in this world, who discovered the body. (You half 
expect him to bemoan, "Hath not a Jew whiskers?")  
</P>
<P>
 It's not always clear if Megahey is aware of how risible this stuff is -- if 
he was, why didn't he just turn it into a comedy? The actors do their best to 
keep their faces uncracked, but Williamson has a high old time acting parched 
and smarmy, Pleasence is ingratiatingly rheumy, and Firth holds the screen even 
when there's nothing to hold (which is often).  
</P>
<P>
 Ian Holm plays a priest who unofficially disbelieves the village's 
superstitions, and he's good enough to make you wish he was in something more 
amenable to his talents -- like Shakespeare. Lysette Anthony, who was Sydney 
Pollack's airheaded squeeze in Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives," is lively, 
with a bright, quacking laugh, in her role as the Seigneur's unmarriageable 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have noticed that the ads for "The Advocate" are dredging up that old 
"don't tell the secret" chestnut from "Crying Game" fame. (Miramax released 
both.) Audiences and critics are supposed to keep quiet about who the Courtois' 
chief client is. Miramax would be wiser encouraging audiences and critics to 
refrain from revealing how mediocre the film is. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the identity of the client would appear to be the film's biggest -- only 
-- selling point, the marketing ploy seems particularly dunderheaded. And 
since, in any event, the identity is signaled from the opening credits, and 
revealed not long after, this "secret" business seems like a not terribly 
subtle way of coercing the press into pumping up the film's wanna-see quotient. 
</P>
<P>
 But we'll play along anyway. We just wanted to you to know that this 
ham-fisted attempt to squelch squealers is not strictly kosher.

TV RATINGS; 'HOME IMPROVEMENT' KEEPS ITS LOCK ON TOP SPOT 
</P>

<P>
 On the day when ABC announced that "Home Improvement" would be moving from 
Wednesdays to Tuesdays this fall, the reigning No. 1 TV show in the land showed 
up in its familiar spot atop the national ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures compiled by the A. C. Nielsen Co. showed that "Home Improvement," 
starring Tim Allen and Patricia Richardson, was seen in about 15.7 million 
homes last week, with "Grace Under Fire" right behind, just as it is on the 
current ABC schedule, and just as it will be when the pair moves to 9-10 p.m. 
Tuesdays next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they will still finish atop the ratings is anybody's guess, but the 
odds would seem to be against them. On Wednesdays, they had no competition from 
other comedy shows; on Tuesdays, the viewer in search of laughs will be able to 
choose between them and the tandem of "Frasier" and "The John Larroquette Show" 
on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Frasier," the "Cheers" spinoff, certainly has a devoted following. It 
finished No. 3 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moves can be beneficial, of course. CBS reported that "The Nanny," which 
earlier had been languishing on Wednesdays, won its Monday night time slot for 
the fifth week in a row. Southland Ratings

EVERYTHING OLD NEW AGAIN IN BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball owners had to delve far into the past in order to find the solution 
to problems they say threaten the future of the game. As long ago as '81 -- 
that's 1881, not the strike year of 1981 -- one of the most prominent figures 
in the National League warned that unless player expenditures were curbed, 
"bankruptcy stares every team in the face." The remedy of Albert Goodwill 
Spalding and his management peers in the latter stages of the 19th century was 
a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no idle threat, either. NL owners implemented the ceiling at the start 
of the 1889 season. Angered though they were, players decided not to strike. 
Instead, they got even -- at least temporarily -- by forming their own league 
the following year. Although the Players' League outdrew the established 
circuit, the upstarts were unable to weather the financial losses and folded 
after one season. So the owners won in the end and celebrated by slashing 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a century later, baseball's labor relations are as rancorous as 
ever. Eighteen months after owners' representatives began drawing up a proposal 
for a new collective bargaining agreement, they finally put an offer on the 
table in June. It called for increased revenue-sharing among member clubs but 
only if the players agreed to a salary cap. When management insisted upon it, 
the players' association walked off the job after games of Aug. 11. They have 
yet to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport as practiced in 1889 bore little resemblance to that played in 1994. 
The pitcher's mound was only 50 feet, 6 inches from home plate, such 
specialists as pinch hitters and relief pitchers were unheard of and there was 
no American League. But, by God, there was a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalding was at the forefront of the new economic order. An outstanding 
pitcher for Boston and Chicago, he took a management role with the White 
Stockings (forerunners of the Cubs) and became club president upon the death of 
William Hulbert. He was a tougher competitor as a businessman than he was in 
uniform. Not only did the sporting goods company he founded supply the league 
with baseballs and other equipment, but it published Spalding's Baseball Guides 
that promulgated the man's philosophy while promoting his products. He was the 
real power behind the throne, much like White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf today. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Never Just a Game," Robert Burk's history of baseball economics 
up to 1920, Spalding's blueprint proposed a salary classification system that 
encompassed all professional leagues and limited compensation at the very top 
to $2,000 per season. The National League eventually adopted a less 
comprehensive plan proposed by John Brush of Indianapolis that classified 
players in five categories determined by the owners. A class A player could 
receive no more than $2,500 while a class E player was limited to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not calculated to please the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball 
Players, a "fraternal organization" founded in 1885 that enlisted many stars of 
the sport. Its leader, John Montgomery Ward of the New York Giants, had 
succeeded in forestalling such measures in the past but in the offseason 
between 1888 and 1889 he was in no position to object. 
</P>
<P>
 "Underscoring the suspicions of Ward's brotherhood toward the owners' 
intentions was the fact that the Brush plan had been adopted while Ward and 
many other union leaders had been diverted overseas on a postseason all-star 
tour," Burk wrote in his book published earlier this year. "Sponsored by the 
clever Spalding, the tour had taken the all-stars around the world to Honolulu, 
Australia, Egypt and Britain..." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's attempts to obtain a preseason conference with Spalding were rebuffed 
and a labor panel, with Spalding serving as spokesman, declined to negotiate 
with the brotherhood at a June meeting. On July 14, the 100th anniversary of 
the French Revolution, delegates from various chapters of the brotherhood met 
secretly at a New York hotel. "Ward talked about instituting a new league," 
wrote Michael Gershman in "Diamonds," "and introduced trolley mogul Albert 
Johnson of Cleveland, the league's main financial backer." 
</P>
<P>
 Brotherhood members declined to sign contracts for the following season and in 
November, Ward announced the formation of the Players' National League of 
Baseball Clubs in which players and owners shared power and revenue under a 
10-year charter. The new league included seven clubs in direct competition with 
existing NL teams, plus an eighth team located in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, remarkably, the PL set up shop in Brotherhood Park, constructed 
underneath Coogan's Bluff adjacent to the Polo Grounds. The new team also 
called itself the Giants. This created quite a scene on Opening Day when the 
teams scheduled simultaneous games. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 3:30 PM," The Sporting News reported, "bands struck their first notes in 
both parks. A world title pennant went up the staff in each place. For one day, 
side by side, there were two champions of the world ... The fans could take 
their pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the Giants' stars had aligned themselves with the new league, 
the Players' team attracted 12,113 fans to 4,644 for the established team. 
Before the season ended, the old Giants would need $80,000 from Spalding and 
three other NL owners to stay afloat. "Initially, the Players' League outdrew 
its elder by as much as 50 percent," according to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
50th Anniversary Book. "Soon, however, both circuits, struggling to persuade 
customers of their staying power, started to paper the houses and wildly 
inflate figures." 
</P>
<P>
 The National League was in trouble but the capitalists recruited by the 
players to underwrite their effort had no stomach for a fight. They persuaded 
Ward to negotiate for peace and a common circuit at the end of the season. 
Spalding represented the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been playing two games all through -- baseball and bluff," the owner 
was quoted in Gershman's book. "At this stage, I put up the strongest play at 
the latter game I ever presented." The players' delegation conceded their 
league had lost a bundle, music to Spalding's ears. "I informed the bearers 
that 'unconditional surrender' was the only possible solution ... To my 
surprise, the terms were greedily accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 All the major players were accepted back with no reprisals nor incentives. 
Baseball survived and prospered for the next 100 years until another 
Chicago-based owner led the push for another salary cap against the wishes of a 
union whose members now are wealthy enough to bankroll their own league. Stay 
tuned.

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; THE LEARNING CURVE HELPS NORTHRIDGE, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Tuber caught the scent of victory the moment he took the mound Tuesday, 
and the Northridge right-hander had hitters from Middleboro, Mass., whiffing at 
his pitches for six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber, grandson of former Brooklyn Dodger and National League batting champion 
Pete Reiser, struck out 13, leading Northridge to a 6-4 victory, the team's 
first in Little League World Series play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked onto this field I had been dreaming about for so long, and it just 
smelled so good," Tuber said. "I felt relaxed and pitched my game." 
</P>
<P>
 After being held to one hit in a 4-2 first-round defeat by Brooklyn Center, 
Minn., on Monday, Northridge scored four runs in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After Spencer Gordon had driven in the first run with a single off the center 
field fence, first baseman Matt Cassel hit a three-run homer with one out. 
Cassel, who had sat out the Western Regional final Friday because of a cut on 
his left hand that required seven stitches, also had Northridge's first hit of 
the game, a single in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first hit gave me confidence and when I came up again I knew we needed a 
big hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro came back with three runs in the fourth, but Northridge second 
baseman Justin Gentile countered with a home run on the first pitch of the 
bottom of the inning. Northridge added a run in the sixth on a run-scoring 
single by Gregg Wallis. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (18-1) will complete pool play today against Springfield, Va., the 
Southern Region champion, at 4:30 PDT. Springfield, the only unbeaten U.S. 
team, defeated Brooklyn Center, 4-1, on Tuesday and defeated Middleboro, 2-1, 
in eight innings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge can advance to the U.S. championship game Thursday two ways. If 
Middleboro defeats Brooklyn Center today at 10 a.m. PDT, Northridge must defeat 
Springfield, enabling Northridge and Springfield to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brooklyn Center defeats Middleboro, Northridge must defeat Springfield by 
more than six runs and allow three fewer runs than Brooklyn Center does in its 
victory over Middleboro. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced and, at one point, struck 
out five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The league in Middleboro prohibits pitchers from throwing curveballs, which 
means the league's hitters never face breaking pitches. Tuber showed them what 
they had been missing, and miss they did, flailing away at his breaking balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber ran into trouble only in the fourth. Middleboro strung together four 
hits in a row with one out, including consecutive doubles by twins Kevin and 
Brandon Brower. Gentile made a nice play to his left on a ground ball for the 
second out, but a run scored to cut the Northridge lead to 4-3. Tuber then 
struck out Jake Kutzy to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The runs in the fourth and fifth innings gave Tuber some breathing room. 
Brandon Brower hit a home run to lead off the sixth, but Tuber kept his poise 
and struck out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they hadn't seen many curveballs, and Peter really had command of his 
curve today," said Northridge Manager Larry Baca, who calls the pitches from 
the dugout. "I didn't even consider having anyone come on in relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Little League Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In second-round games matching foreign teams, Maracaibo, Venezuela, defeated 
Taiwan, 4-1, and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, defeated Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, 6-2. 
Pool play will conclude today with Taiwan (1-1) playing Dhahran (1-1) and 
Maracaibo (2-0) facing Nova Scotia (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 With its victory, Maracaibo emerged as the favorite to represent the foreign 
teams in the championship game Saturday. Cesar Hidalgo pitched a two-hitter, 
striking out 15 and walking three, and Elio Perez homered for Maracaibo.

 Augusto Duquesme, a Cuban basketball player at the recent World Championships 
in Toronto, was supposedly being carefully watched by Cuban security officials 
to make sure he didn't defect. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't stop the 6-foot-6 forward from strolling out of his hotel and 
into a waiting van provided by Alfredo Jordan, a Toronto businessman who has 
helped many Cubans escape, according to the Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Duquesme, who was the second Cuban to defect during the tournament, 
get past the security? 
</P>
<P>
 He caught them Dreaming.

 Letter bomb: The death of Jack Sharkey stirred the New York Times' Robert 
McG.Thomas Jr. to write about a 1927 fight between Sharkey and an aging Jack 
Dempsey, who had lost the heavyweight title to Gene Tunney the previous year. 
The bout provided a moment reminiscent of the recent Riddick Bowe-Buster Mathis 
Jr. late-hit fracas. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . (I)n the seventh, Dempsey, swinging furiously, landed a low right and 
Sharkey, clutching his midriff, turned to the referee to complain. While he was 
looking away, Dempsey landed a haymaker that knocked Sharkey into the middle of 
the previous morning. After he revived, Sharkey reminded his manager that he 
was to fight Dempsey that night. . . .

 "For Dempsey, who retired after losing the rematch with Tunney two months 
later, the knockout was the last victory of his career, and he did not 
apologize for it.

NEWSWIRE: CHRISTIE WINS 100 METERS IN 9.91

 Linford Christie completed a spectacular return to the Commonwealth Games in 
Victoria, Canada, on Tuesday, winning the 100 meters with the sixth-fastest 
time in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie, 34, won the gold medal in 9.91 seconds, his third games record in as 
many races over the past two days at Centennial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Age is in the mind," Christie said. "Everyday they keep telling me I'm old, 
but I'm still going out here and mixing it with the young ones and beating them 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Christie, the world champion and 1992 Olympic gold medalist, won his 20th gold 
medal in an international competition and repeated as games champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie was the oldest entrant in the 100 meters. The second-oldest, Horace 
Dove-Edwards, 32, of Sierra Leone, was a surprising second in 10.02. The bronze 
medal went to Michael Green of Jamaica in 10.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie won his semifinal heat in 9.98, breaking the games record of 10.02 he 
set in New Zealand four years ago and tied in Monday's quarterfinals. 
Christie's winning time matched his wind-aided 9.91 of earlier this year.

BULLFROGS LIGHT IT UP LATE, BEAT THE BLADES; ROLLER HOCKEY: THEY SCORE FOUR 
GOALS IN FOURTH TO WIN, 9-6, AT ANAHEIM. GAME 2 OF PLAYOFF SERIES IS TONIGHT AT 
FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs have found their On switch. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored four goals in the fourth quarter to break open a close game and 
beat the Blades, 9-6, in a Roller Hockey International playoff game before 
8,310 Tuesday night at The Pond. Yuri Krivokhija and Victor Gervais each scored 
twice for the Bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will play Game 2 of the Pacific Division finals at 7:30 tonight at 
the Forum. If the Bullfrogs win Game 2, they advance to the Western Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Blades win, the teams will play a 12-minute mini-game immediately 
following Game 2 to determine the series winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be another barn-burner tomorrow," Blades Coach Bobby Hull Jr. said. "We 
knew it was going to be a war. We broke down at a couple of points and Anaheim 
played well. They deserved to win tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the playoffs began last week, the Bullfrogs have looked more like the 
invincible RHI champions of 1993. Last season, the Bullfrogs rolled through the 
league, winning 17 of 18 games. This season, they rolled over down the stretch, 
winning only once in their last six games to finish third in the division while 
the Blades finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 But the playoffs have been a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais, who has seven goals in three playoff games, started off the Bullfrogs 
by scoring on a first-quarter power play. Krivokhija provided the finishing 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Krivokhija tied the score, 4-4, notching a goal with 2 minutes 47 seconds 
remaining in the third. He gave the Bullfrogs the lead for good, breaking a 5-5 
tie by scoring a goal with 9:15 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bullfrogs got contributions from everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring insurance goals in the fourth quarter were Kevin Kerr, who had a goal 
and an assist, Darren Perkins, who had a goal and two assists, and Savo 
Mitrovic, who had a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cook, Rick Judson, and Steve Beadle each had two assists, and goalie Rob 
Laurie continued his strong play, making 27 saves Tuesday night to win his 
third consecutive playoff game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bullfrogs finally got something past Blades goalie Max Mikhailovsky, 
who was named most valuable player and goaltender of the year by the RHI 
earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhailovsky had 97 saves in the Blades' two previous victories over the 
Bullfrogs. He stopped only 31 of 40 shots Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wilson had two goals and two assists to lead the Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After leading Los Angeles to the Pacific Division title, Blades Coach Bobby 
Hull Jr., a resident of Seal Beach, was named Western Conference Coach of the 
Year. . . . RHI President Dennis Murphy presented a plaque to Bullfrogs owners 
Maury Silver and his sons, Nelson and Stuart, honoring the club for leading the 
league in attendance. The Bullfrogs averaged 10,155 in 11 regular-season games 
at The Pond. . . . Bullfrogs forward Ken Murchison missed Tuesday's game 
because of a hand injury, Coach Grant Sonier said. His status is day-to-day.

FISH REPORT: SUMMER WANES, BUT FUN HASN'T AT BIG BEAR LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The high-profile activity at Big Bear Lake this weekend will be the National 
Mountain Bike Championships, but Cliff Fowler of Big Bear Sporting Goods 
advises that the fishing -- unusually good for so late in the summer -- 
shouldn't be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," Fowler said. "You would think by the trout activity that 
they aren't looking at the calendar. Normally, we'd be singing the summer 
blues. We're still nailing 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlight of the day, Fowler said, is the crowd that gathers on the docks at 
Gray's Landing on the north side for the hot evening bite.

LOS ALAMITOS; SUCCESS ON ARABIANS MAKING LAMBERT FORGET THE GOLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Jerry Lambert and Arabians continue to be a successful combination at 
Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejuvenated at 53, Lambert has 15 victories during the current meeting on 
Arabians, having added to his total last week with victories aboard T C Tomtyr 
A on Saturday and Seyvilla Tribaske the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored against a field that included Magna Terra Smokey, who has 35 victories 
in 79 starts, T C Tomtyr A, who is trained by Yancey Carter Jr., won for the 
17th time in 26 outings. And it was his second consecutive victory over Magna 
Terra Smokey. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also trains Seyvilla Tribaske, a 3-year-old filly who followed up an 
11-length maiden victory with an 11 1/2-length triumph over allowance rivals 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 She paid $2.80 as the favorite, covered the six furlongs in 1:23 1/5 and has 
to be considered one of the choices for the $175,000 Daughters of the Desert 
Futurity on Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 If Seyvilla Tribaske wins that race, the victory would be more lucrative for 
Lambert than any of his three in a row aboard Native Diver in the Hollywood 
Gold Cup from 1965-67. The purse for the Gold Cup in those days was only 
$162,100. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 16 trials for the $2-million All-American Futurity, which will be 
run Sept. 5 at Ruidoso Downs, were held last Friday at the New Mexico track. 
</P>
<P>
 Major Rime, who is undefeated, posted the fastest qualifying time, running the 
440 yards in 21.395 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fling King, the fastest qualifier for Los Alamitos' Kindergarten Futurity, 
won his trial heat and his time of 21.610 seconds was the seventh-fastest. He 
was ridden by Henry Garcia for owners Dutch Masters III. 
</P>
<P>
 In his trial, The Fling King defeated San Mateo Handicap winner Check This 
Reb, who wound up qualifying for the All-American consolation. First Down 
Hussey, who has also competed locally, was another consolation qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-American Futurity, which will be simulcast at Los Alamitos, was won by 
California-based A Classic Dash in 1993. A Classic Dash was ridden by Eddie 
Garcia for trainer Connie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first of two days of trials for the Sam Houston Futurity will be held 
today at Sam Houston Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The five fastest qualifiers today and Thursday will advance to the finals and 
the sixth- through 10th-fastest times will move to the Futurity consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Contested at 400 yards, the Sam Houston Futurity has an estimated purse of 
$500,000 and will be run on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running 870 yards for the first time in his career last Friday night, Really A 
Secret responded with the fastest qualifying time for the $62,000 Gold Rush 
Derby on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the second of two trials, Really A Secret ran the distance in 45.87 
seconds, ending a five-race losing streak and winning for only the second time 
in 16 starts. He paid $12.20 and beat Oh Oh The Signature by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Oh The Signature wound up being the second-fastest qualifier, then came 
Foggy Meadow, who won the other trial in 45:96 seconds, Citation Five, Skippa 
Dashing Star, Chicks Response, Tis A Little Dol and L.C. Tern. 
</P>
<P>
 Foggy Meadow, a 9-2 shot, avenged consecutive losses to Citation Five in their 
trial, upsetting the 1-5 favorite under jockey John Creager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting away from Down With Debt, who upset Refrigerator in the recent Go Man 
Go Handicap, Stick N Picky scored an easy victory in the $20,000 Bobby Doyle 
Memorial Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh behind Down With Debt in the Las Damas Handicap in her most recent 
start, the 6-1 Sticky N Picky scored a 1 1/4-length victory over favored Be 
Real Now in the Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Bob Gilbert and ridden by Steve Treasure, Sticky N Picky has won 
six of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Be Real Now, who had a rough trip when fourth in the Las Damas, was fractious 
in the gate, then stumbled at the start and did well to beat Newport Fancy by a 
neck for second. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Creager, third in the all-time jockey standings at Los Alamitos, is 
approaching 1,800 victories there. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory aboard Petite Azure in Sunday's fourth race left Creager, 43, with 
1,792. He trails only the retired Danny Cardoza, who won 2,513, and Kenneth 
Hart, who is at 2,196. Currently riding at Ruidoso Downs, Hart, 46, is expected 
to return to Los Alamitos after Labor Day.

Handicap in his last start, June 26 at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the Tom Fool, Virginia Rapids went seven furlongs in 1:22 1/5 to

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; THIS KICK-RUSHING DRILL GOES TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The drill was testing outside defenders' ability to rush during field-goal 
attempts, so when Andy Colbert flashed in front of holder Kevin Walker, he was 
doing what he was supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was kicker Bjorn Merten's right leg, which hit Colbert in the 
helmet Tuesday afternoon. Colbert walked away, but Merten, an All-American as a 
freshman, suffered a gash that required bandages and ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert suffered the wrath of Coach Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not supposed to go after the kicker!" he yelled. "Don't try to ruin 
our season by going after the kicker!" 
</P>
<P>
 Merten made 21 field goals in 26 tries last season, the longest from 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back as an All-American adds pressure, Merten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's really no different," he added. "Everybody puts pressure on a 
kicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Merten has missed only five times in more than 50 tries in the last 10 days of 
practice, and has made several from 49 yards. On the play on which Colbert hit 
him, Merten was successful from 43 yards. He then kicked two more field goals 
from 43, and missed one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was a new kicker at practice Tuesday, Hiaitham Kahwaji, from Israel by 
way of John Marshall High in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahwaji says he has kicked field goals of 57 yards in high school practice and 
has kicked off through the goal post several times. His biggest problem Tuesday 
was kicking off the ground, rather than a tee, for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 His tardiness in reporting to practice at UCLA can be traced to an ankle 
injury suffered when he fell over some trash on the steps at John Marshall a 
few days before graduation. 
</P>

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; PAPADAKIS FOLLOWS FAMILY TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taso Papadakis, a redshirt freshman linebacker-fullback, apparently was 
destined to play at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis' father, John, lettered in 1970 and '71 as a linebacker and was 
voted USC's most inspirational player in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "He coached me on weekends," Papadakis said of his father. "We were always in 
the living room on weekends, going through the plays and knocking furniture out 
of the way. He taught me how to read plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the younger Papadakis was set to go to Cal because USC hadn't recruited 
him until Coach John Robinson returned last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Robinson called me two weeks before the signing date and told me that he 
wanted me to come here and I couldn't pass the offer up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only two true freshmen who played for USC last season, Papadakis played 
in the Trojans' first two games before suffering a season-ending wrist injury 
against Houston. He was granted an extra year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 One of USC's strongest players, Papadakis, 6 feet and 240 pounds, can bench 
press 390 pounds and can squat 500 pounds. An exercise science major, he worked 
out three times a day this summer while recuperating from wrist and shoulder 
injuries. He ran with a track coach in the morning, did kick-boxing in the 
afternoon and lifted weights with a personal trainer at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis' training regimen probably helped prepare him for his role this 
season. He is the only Trojan who will play both offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally an inside linebacker, he will play fullback in goal line situations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently displeased with the way the afternoon practice was going, Robinson 
threatened to extend practice unless the team displayed more intensity. . . . 
ABC has already committed to televising four USC games. The Trojans' season 
opener against Washington on Sept. 3 will be shown, as will the Penn State game 
Sept. 10, the Stanford game Oct. 15 and the season-ending game against Notre 
Dame on Nov. 26. Other TV games will be determined later. CHRIS BAKER

<P>
 Carlton Haselrig, a Pro Bowl guard only two years ago, won't play football 
this season, and his future with the Pittsburgh Steelers is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers severed ties with Haselrig for at least this season by placing 
the three-year starter on the reserve-left camp list.He cannot be reinstated 
for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time Pro Bowl kicker Gary Anderson, who wants his contract renegotiated, 
was placed on the reserve-did not report list. His $350,000 base salary won't 
count against the salary cap, and he can return to the roster only by 
requesting reinstatement from the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Haselrig, treated twice last year in drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, 
hasn't been seen by the Steelers since watching their Aug. 13 preseason game 
against the Raiders. He was to resume practicing last week after missing nearly 
three weeks with a broken wrist, but never returned to camp. The only public 
sighting of Haselrig, 28, since his disappearance was at an East Liverpool, 
Ohio, nightspot last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Meola, the goalkeeper for the U.S. soccer team, was waived by the New 
York Jets, losing out to veteran Nick Lowery, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola, dubbed "Captain Hook" by Jets teammates early in camp for his tendency 
to shank kicks, was signed as a possible designated kickoff man who could learn 
from Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of Meola's five preseason kickoffs reached the end zone, but Coach 
Pete Carroll said the team hopes to keep him on the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Haselrig, a Pro Bowl guard only two years ago, won't play football 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers placed the three-year starter on the reserve-left camp list. He

<P>
 Defensive end Lee Williams, trying to come back from off-season knee surgery, 
failed his physical on Tuesday and was waived by the Houston Oilers, who hope 
to resign him at a lower salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, scheduled to earn $1.125 million this season, has spent the 
preseason rehabilitating his knee but hasn't been able to practice with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Memphis, Tenn., acquitted Philadelphia Eagles lineman Bernard 
Williams of disorderly conduct charges from an incident in which police sprayed 
him with pepper gas in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6-foot-9, 315 pounds, was sprayed and arrested July 9 after police 
said he cursed and threatened them while they searched his car, parked in front 
of his mother's home. 
</P>
<P>
 He testified that he never raised his voice in asking officers why they were 
searching his car without a warrant.

 Cornerback Darren Anderson, a second-year pro who performed mostly as a nickel 
back and on special teams last season, was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for 
an undisclosed 1995 draft pick. . . . Despite reporting to camp nearly three 
weeks late because of a contract dispute, Browns' No. 1 draft pick Antonio 
Langham was named Cleveland's starting left cornerback over Donald Frank, 
acquired in a trade with San Diego. Langham was picked ninth overall in this 
year's draft. The Browns also released eight players, the best known being 
offensive lineman Mike Withycombe, a six-year veteran who played with several 
teams. . . . The Denver Broncos cut former USC running back Deon Strother. He 
was third on the depth chart at fullback behind Reggie Rivers and Leonard 
Russell. . . . Arizona, which released quarterback Will Furrer on Monday, 
signed Shawn Moore, released last week by Denver. . . . New England released 
Ervin Collier, a third-round draft pick. The 6-3, 287-pound nose tackle from 
Florida A&M was the 78th player chosen in this year's draft. . . . Linebacker 
Darin Jordan, a fifth-year veteran who battled back from a serious knee injury, 
was among five players waived by the San Francisco 49ers. Jordan, 29, the 
former Northeastern standout who was special teams co-captain last year for San 
Francisco, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the final 
1993 regular-season game and was released in February.

NORTHRIDGE IS LIFTED BY TUBER; BASEBALL: RIGHT-HANDER STRIKES OUT 13 IN 6-4 
VICTORY OVER MIDDLEBORO, MASS., IN LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Tuber caught the scent of victory the moment he took the mound Tuesday, 
and the Northridge right-hander proceeded to make hitters from Middleboro, 
Mass., whiff at his pitches for six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuber struck out 13, leading Northridge to a 6-4 victory before 10,000 at 
Howard J. Lamade Stadium. It was Northridge's first victory in Little League 
World Series play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked onto this field I had been dreaming about for so long, and it just 
smelled so good," Tuber said. "I felt relaxed and pitched my game." 
</P>
<P>
 After being held to one hit in a 4-2 first-round loss to Brooklyn Center, 
Minn., Monday, Northridge broke loose offensively in the third inning, scoring 
four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 After Spencer Gordon drove in the first run with a single off the center-field 
fence, first baseman Matt Cassel smacked a three-run home run with one out. 
Cassel, who missed the Western Regional championship game Friday because of a 
cut on his left hand that required seven stitches, also had Northridge's first 
hit, a single in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first hit gave me confidence and when I came up again I knew we needed a 
big hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro came back with three runs in the fourth, but Northridge second 
baseman Justin Gentile countered with a home run on the first pitch of the 
bottom of the inning. Northridge scored in the sixth on a run-scoring single by 
Gregg Wallis. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will complete pool play today at 4:30 p.m. PDT against Springfield, 
Va., the Southern Region champion. ESPN will televise the game. Springfield, 
the only unbeaten U.S. team, defeated Brooklyn Center on Tuesday, 4-1, after 
beating Middleboro, 2-1, in eight innings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge can advance to the U.S. championship on Thursday two ways. If 
Middleboro defeats Brooklyn Center today at 10 a.m. PDT, Northridge must defeat 
Springfield, enabling Northridge and Springfield to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brooklyn Center defeats Middleboro, Northridge must defeat Springfield by 
more than six runs and allow three fewer runs than Brooklyn Center does in its 
victory against Middleboro. That would also enable Northridge and Springfield 
to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off its first setback in two months of tournament play, Northridge 
(18-1) needed a solid performance from Tuber, who retired 10 of the first 11 
batters and at one point struck out five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The league in Middleboro prohibits pitchers from throwing curveballs. Tuber 
showed them what they'd been missing, and miss they did, flailing away futilely 
at the 5-foot-9 hurler's breaking pitches. Mixing in fastballs that registered 
66 m.p.h. on a radar gun, Tuber ran into trouble only in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro strung together four hits in a row with one out, including 
back-to-back doubles by identical twins Kevin and Brandon Brower. Gentile made 
a nice play to his left on a ground ball for the second out, but a run scored 
on the play to cut Northridge's lead to 4-3. Tuber struck out Jake Kutzy to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The runs in the fourth and fifth innings gave Tuber some breathing room. 
Brandon Brower hit a solo home run to lead off the sixth, but Tuber kept his 
poise and struck out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they hadn't seen many curveballs, and Peter really had command of his 
curve today," said Northridge Manager Larry Baca, who calls the pitches from 
the dugout. "I didn't even consider having anyone come on in relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning provided the entire Northridge contingent with an overwhelming sense 
of relief. The fact that the game was played so early -- it ended at noon PDT 
-- enhanced the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sunny out, life changes day to day," Coach George Saul said, looking 
skyward and squinting. "Yesterday we were hurting, but now we have all day to 
enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>
 In second-round games matching foreign teams, Maracaibo, Venezuela, defeated 
Chinese Taipei, 4-1, and Dhahrain, Saudi Arabia, defeated Glace Bay, Nova 
Scotia, 6-2. Pool play will conclude today with Chinese Taipei (1-1 in series 
play) facing Dhahrain (1-1) at 7 a.m. PDT and Maracaibo (2-0) facing Nova 
Scotia (0-2) at 1 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 With its victory over Taipei, Maracaibo has emerged as the favorite to 
represent the foreign teams in the World Series championship Saturday. Cesar 
Hidalgo pitched a two-hitter, striking out 15 and walking three, and Elio Perez 
homered for Maracaibo.

WOODS EASILY ADVANCES IN U.S. AMATEUR GOLF; TOURNAMENT: HE QUALIFIES FOR MATCH 
PLAY AFTER FINISHING TWO ROUNDS FIVE STROKES BEHIND KIM, WHO SETS A RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hank Kim shot a 4-under-par 68 Tuesday and bettered the medalist record by two 
strokes with a 36-hole total of 132 in the stroke-play qualifying at the U.S. 
Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, 21, of Jonesboro, Ga., finished two rounds over the Stadium and Valley 
courses at the TPC Sawgrass at 12-under 132 to break the record set by Bobby 
Clampett in 1979 and matched by Sam Randolph in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," said Kim, a senior at North Carolina State, who birdied 
two of his last three holes. "This is the biggest thing I've done in my life. I 
started thinking about being medalist when I got to 16. To tell you the truth, 
I just wanted to make the cut here. This changes my thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Jones, a 35-year-old car salesman and reinstated amateur from 
Greensboro, N.C., had a 66 Tuesday and was at 134, one stroke ahead of Ed 
Fryatt, 23, of Las Vegas, who had a second-round 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods, 18, of Cypress, was one of three tied at 137. Woods shot par 72 
on the Valley course to join Trip Kuehne, 22, of McKinney, Texas, and Tim 
Jackson, 35, of Germantown, Tenn. Kuehne had 68 Tuesday; Jackson a 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine golfers were still on the course when play was suspended because 
of darkness. They will complete their second round this morning and the field 
of 312 will be trimmed to 64, who will continue on to match play later in the 
day. The cut for match play will fall at a record 2-over 146. 
</P>
<P>
 Others assured of qualifying for match play were defending champion John 
Harris, 41, of Edina, Minn., at 142, and 17-year-old Ted Oh (144) of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Talt of Laguna Beach shot 72 for a 146 total and is the only Orange 
County player other than Woods who has finished 36 holes and has a chance to 
make it to match play.

President Milton Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Saltzstein, committee chairman, said it will be Gordon's decision to make 
after the recommendations are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be able to check them out further before a selection is made," 
Saltzstein said. A selection can be expected within two weeks, said Saltzstein, 
who declined to name the three finalists.

NOTEBOOK; THIS TIME, BURROUGHS DOESN'T FACE THE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former major league most valuable player who has been a familiar face here 
the past two years has shown up again. Actually, he looks different this time: 
Jeff Burroughs left his game face in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to come here just to enjoy the atmosphere," said Burroughs, coach 
of the Long Beach Little League world champion 1992 and '93 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs, who played 16 years in the big leagues and was the American 
League's most valuable player in 1974 while with the Texas Rangers, played in 
an old-timers game Saturday in Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa. His wife and son, 
Sean, a standout in the past two Little League World Series, are with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised Sean we'd come back so he could trade pins," Burroughs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs likes what he sees in Northridge, which has replaced Long Beach as 
the World Series representative from the Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really good," he said. "People are always going to compare teams to 
us. That's part of the fun of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Burroughs: Northridge ace Nathaniel Dunlap has thrown the hardest of any 
pitcher in the tournament, registering 74 m.p.h. once on a radar gun Monday and 
consistently hitting 70-72 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sean Burroughs threw "80-81 m.p.h. pretty regularly," according to 
his father, Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, insist Corey Wright and Paul Alesse, volunteers who have worked the 
radar gun at the World Series since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burroughs topped out at 68 m.p.h.," Wright said. "He had a hellacious hard 
curve. That's what really made him." 
</P>
<P>
 Alesse said the fastest that a pitcher from the U.S. has been clocked is 78 
m.p.h., although they couldn't remember the boy's name. Several pitchers from 
the Far East, they said, have thrown 80 m.p.h., with 83 being the fastest pitch 
recorded at Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing back: Cleanup hitter Spencer Gordon perhaps best exemplified the 
range of emotions Northridge players have gone through the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon made the final out of Monday's 4-2 loss to Brooklyn Center, Minn., with 
two runners on base, capping a hitless game for him. He softly knocked his head 
against the dugout wall afterward, visibly dejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen my son so despondent," said Eric Gordon, Spencer's father, 
who along with Spencer's mother, Bonnie, tried to console their son outside the 
team barracks. "He hugged his mother longer than I have ever seen him hug her. 
He told us, 'I let the team down and blew the game,' and nothing me or the 
coaches could say could change that thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday brought a new day and new game for Northridge, which defeated 
Middleboro, Mass., 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Who broke open a scoreless game in the third inning with a line drive off the 
center field fence hit so hard he was held to an RBI single? Spencer Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters later, Gordon trotted around the bases ahead of Matt Cassel, who 
smashed a three-run home run to give Northridge a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night in the barracks, a lot of the guys were really down," Cassel said. 
"This game picked up everybody's spirits." 
</P>

<P>
 No-show: An appearance by Michael Jordan has been canceled because he is 
recovering from a shoulder injury, said Dennis Sullivan, a Little League 
spokesman.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; CITING SELF-PRESERVATION, GORE ESCAPES WILDCAT TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Make a list of golfers who seem most likely to become the white-knuckle, 
ulcer-plagued, teeth-gnashing type and Jason Gore of Valencia would rank dead 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore won friends easily, always had a wisecrack, a one-liner, a quip. He was 
magnetic, laughed and joked his way through rounds and seemed oblivious to 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in past tense, because Gore couldn't get past being tense. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime, over the past couple of years, everything changed, and the results 
are unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much fun when you're throwing up blood," Gore said. "Golf was like a 
job, a chore." 
</P>
<P>
 In what qualified as an absolute shocker in the University of Arizona's 
athletic department, Gore announced this month that he would not return for his 
junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big loss for me," Arizona Coach Rick LaRose said. "It definitely 
affects me personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, who was named an honorable mention NCAA Division I All-American after 
winning his second consecutive individual Pacific 10 Conference championship 
last spring, said the decision was borne of self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't like what the game and the Wildcat program had done to him, he said. 
He was wrapped tighter than a 100-compression ball and was starting to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, he experienced violent episodes of nausea before and 
during major tournaments. This summer, Gore underwent a battery of tests, none 
of which pinpointed the cause of his stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Gore thought he had ulcers. Doctors said he might have contracted a 
stomach virus. He's been poked, prodded and probed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere, everything," said Gore, a former Hart High standout. "Every 
square inch." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it could be psychosomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I got real worked up, I threw up blood," Gore said. "It just knocked 
me out. I had trouble functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been easygoing. I found I was (angry) all the time. Finally, the 
smile's returning to my face." 
</P>
<P>
 The same cannot be said of LaRose, who is wondering what went amiss with his 
star pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRose said that Gore, with two Pac-10 titles in as many tries, had a chance 
of being inducted into the school's hall of fame. Gore could have been "a great 
pro someday, and still might," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRose, in fact, is reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I treated him like my son and I did a lot of things for him," LaRose said. 
"Getting him on that All-American team was not easy. It took a lot of work. I 
talked to him in June, July, August, and he said he was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that you never know what kids are thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore has enrolled for the fall semester at College of the Canyons. Eventually, 
he might transfer to another four-year school, but is still considering his 
options. However it turns out, Gore said, he hasn't been sick since he informed 
LaRose of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, sometimes, the guys who are happiest on the outside are 
dog-paddling like crazy under the surface," LaRose said. "Like a duck, 
underneath, they're paddling like mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said nothing in particular about the Arizona program prompted him to 
withdraw. Perhaps expectations were too great -- Gore was on full scholarship, 
a rarity in men's golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Arizona expected the big-hitting, 6-foot, 210-pounder to be a Terminator 
in cleats and wraparound sunglasses. Coaches perceived him as "soft." 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to be intimidating," Gore said. "Maybe at my size, I should 
be. But that's not really the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be emphasized that Gore didn't exactly wilt under pressure at 
Arizona. He won both Pac-10 championships in sudden death, including a playoff 
victory over All-American Todd Demsey of Arizona State as an 18-year-old 
freshman. Gore triple-bogeyed the 72nd hole to blow a three-shot lead in the 
1994 Pac-10 final, then somehow came back to win the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sick all week in the Pac-10s and still played real well," LaRose said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's mystifying, LaRose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf can be a stressful situation," he said. "It's easy to be happy-go-lucky 
when you're beating everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when people are nipping at your heels, it's a little different and people 
react in their own way, I guess." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Heavy medal: Todd Golditch of Northridge swiped some of his brother's thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Golditch, who will be a sophomore at Chatsworth High, won the individual gold 
medal in the 13-14 division last week at the Maccabiah Games in Cleveland. 
Golditch, 14, finished with a 36-hole total of 164. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1992 games in Baltimore, brother Scott, a standout at Taft over the 
past two seasons, won the gold in the 15-16 division. Scott will play at Cal in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is originally from Philadelphia, but brotherly love only goes so 
far. Asked when he expects to begin drubbing his brother, Todd said: "Pretty 
soon."

 On deck: On the heels of the Women's U.S. Mid-Amateur qualifier last week at 
El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana comes the male version in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-year-old Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo, the area's newest 
layout, will be the site of a men's Mid-Amateur qualifier on Tuesday. The 
Women's Mid-Amateur begins Sept. 10 in Tacoma, Wash., while the men's event 
starts Sept. 17 in Minneapolis.

DIGEST: WI FIRES 74, REMAINS IN U.S. AMATEUR HUNT

 Charlie Wi of North Hills shot 74 in the second round of stroke play 
qualifying Tuesday and remained in the hunt for a berth in the match play 
portion of the 94th U.S. Amateur Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a Westlake High graduate, is tied with 15 players for 54th place at 
two-over-par 146 and is facing a playoff today. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine golfers, including Mitch Voges of Simi Valley, were still on the 
course when play was suspended because of darkness. They will complete their 
second round today and the field of 312 will be trimmed to the low 64, who will 
begin match play later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Voges shot 75 in the first round. James Camaione, a member of the Crystalaire 
Country Club in the Antelope Valley, shot 76 to finish at 149. David Saylor of 
West Hills shot 89-81 -- 170. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chad Wright of Ventura, a sophomore at USC, shot rounds of 71 and 75 to win 
the Oxnard Junior City Championship by seven shots at the River Ridge Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Hendon of Oxnard was second at 153. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty Morton of Ventura won the 14-15 age division with a 73 and Mike Hewitt 
of Ojai won the 13-and-under division with a 75. Jill Kaopua of Oxnard won the 
girls' division with an 80. Baseball 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Tucker, one of the top high school players in the area, has enrolled at 
Chatsworth High after he failed to meet academic standards at Alemany.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, a 6-foot-5, 200-pound, left-handed hitting first baseman, hit .370 
with two home runs and 15 runs batted in last season at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker and Montclair Prep outfielder Darrell Dent have been selected to play 
for the United States in a series of games with teams from Japan and South 
Korea on Sept. 3-5 at Blair Field in Long Beach. Track and Field 
</P>
<P>
 Darvena Merritt, the City Section champion in the shotput for North Hollywood 
High, has signed a letter of intent with Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt, who has a personal best of 43 feet 2 inches, narrowed her final 
choices to Northridge and Southern University in New Orleans before choosing 
the former. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Merritt excelled as a shotputter in high school, she will focus on 
the javelin and discus in college because her relatively lanky 5-foot-8 frame 
is better suited for those events. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt, a two-time City Section 4-A Division selection in basketball, hopes 
to walk on to the Northridge team in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give it a shot," she said. "I can't guarantee I'm going to make 
the team, but I am going to try out." JOHN ORTEGA

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; INJURIES, LOSS BRING CHANGES ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams made changes in their starting defense Tuesday after injuries 
depleted their pass rush in a 29-20 exhibition loss to the Raiders Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox named rookie Brad Ottis, a second-round draft pick, as the 
starter at right defensive end for Thursday night's exhibition finale at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis replaces Gerald Robinson (sprained left ankle), who had started three 
games in place of Fred Stokes (sprained left knee). 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes returned to practice Monday, but Knox plans to hold him out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't had any live pass rush in awhile," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie free-agent D'Marco Farr of Washington appears to be in line for the 
starting right tackle spot in place of the injured Sean Gilbert (sprained left 
ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 "D'Marco has played well," Knox said. "He has some talent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Henry Rolling, the starting left outside linebacker last season, 
also practiced with the first unit, replacing Joe Kelly, who had started there 
the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker coach Dick Selcer said he wanted to start Rolling for Thursday 
night's game against the Chargers, where Rolling played three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rolling started the first game against Green Bay, Kelly started the second 
game (against New England) and the third game against the Raiders where he came 
from," Selcer said. "They're both in open competition for it. We haven't 
cut-and-dried the starters yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give both of them an opportunity. And the natural thing to do, 
from a motivational standpoint, was to give them a chance to play against the 
teams they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie safeties Keith Lyle and Toby Wright have yet to crack the starting 
lineup, but Lyle leads the team in special teams' tackles with five, followed 
by Wright with four. . . . The Rams have lost eight consecutive exhibition 
games, but have a 15-11 exhibition record against the Chargers. MIKE REILLEY

 At&T, Delta Sign $2.8-Billion Deal: The companies said they will set up a 
joint firm to provide computer services to tourism and transport companies as 
part of the 10-year agreement. The deal will push Delta Air Lines Inc. into the 
profitable transportation information business and give AT&T Corp. a solid edge 
in overhauling Delta's computer systems.The partnership between the 
telecommunications giant and the nation's third-largest airline will develop 
new information technology services to be used by Delta and sold to other 
travel and transportation companies. The deal excludes airline and travel 
agency computer reservations systems. The venture, which has not yet been 
named, will supply computer services to Atlanta-based Delta, which is 
overhauling its communications as part of a restructuring.

 Delta, Pilots Reach Pay Agreement: The carrier's accord with the Air Line 
Pilots Assn. suspends a scheduled 2% pay raise pending new contract talks this 
fall, the Atlanta Constitution reported.The newspaper said the deal came after 
ALPA decided over the weekend to renew the offer, following a company move to 
furlough another 101 pilots. Delta Air Lines Inc. said the move was unrelated 
to the pay question. ALPA had already made a conditional offer to forgo the pay 
raise. Its officials were quoted as saying they now want talks on ways to avoid 
mounting pilot layoffs. The new furloughs boost to 549 the number of Delta 
pilots idled since the middle of last year.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A ZANY, BEGUILING AND ODD TALE THAT ALMOST MAKES SENSE; 
FOUR HANDS BY PACO IGNACIO TAIBO II ; TRANSLATED BY LAURA C. DAIL; ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS $22.95, 378 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Four Hands" by the Mexican novelist Paco Ignacio Taibo II is a political 
thriller that sometimes resembles a crazy mosaic fashioned out of the shards of 
shattered novels -- E. L. Doctorow's "Ragtime," Robert Stone's "Dog Soldiers," 
and, above all, the half-plausible, half-paranoid works of Richard Condon. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say "Four Hands" is a mere pastiche. Taibo writes with genuine 
savvy, a crackling wit and a certain zaniness that is his very own. Once we 
pick up the strange but beguiling rhythms of his narrative style, we begin to 
understand that Taibo is a storyteller of real genius. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century after century," muses one of the slightly cracked conspirators who 
populate "Four Hands," nicely summing up what's happening in the rest of the 
book, "professionals of power hired professionals of information, who hired 
professionals of curiosity, who hired legalized criminals to keep the game in 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes of his tale, if we can single out only a couple of the memorable 
characters in "Four Hands," are Greg Simon and Julio (Fats) Fernandez, an odd 
couple of international investigative journalism, whose first-person 
reminiscences are presented in alternating, almost Rashomon-style testimony 
that begins to reveal a labyrinthine plot of dazzling complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg is an American, "a Los Angeles Jew raised in an orphanage for Catholic 
boys, later living in a black neighborhood, and finally going to a high school 
that for some strange reason was full of Koreans." Julio is a Mexican, a man 
who "expects a mixture of astonishment, frustrated paternal relationships, 
commiseration and dazzle from the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And the title of "Four Hands" refers to their intimate collaboration at the 
typewriter keyboard where they compose the stories that ultimately draw them 
into an intimate dance with spies, hit men, terrorists, drug dealers and 
assorted other malefactors in a complex fugue of crime, obsession and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landscapes of the religion of the scoop , the exclusive," is how Greg 
describes the turf where they live and work. "The faces of the truth and the 
truth that made faces as one drummed one's fingers on the typewriter, creating 
immortals, freezing in time the stories arduously chased down alleys, into 
living rooms and plazas." 
</P>
<P>
 But Greg and Julio are only two of the men and women who flash in and out of 
view like figures in a hall of mirrors. There's Alex, the merry prankster who 
doubles as a spymaster in deep cover. Rolando is a drug trafficker "on (his) 
way to becoming one of Mexico's blackest legends." Stoyan Vasilev is a 
profoundly enigmatic 82-year-old Bulgarian counter-spy who haunts (and is 
haunted by) a half-century of history and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 And, intriguingly, Taibo drafts various historical figures into service as 
characters in "Four Hands" -- Stan Laurel, Leon Trotsky, Pancho Villa, Harry 
Houdini -- and they take on new and beguiling dimensions as Taibo inserts them 
in the phantasmagoria of his narrative. Indeed, Houdini's imagined confessions 
to his psychoanalyst are as poignant, and as plausible, as any of the 
historical asides that decorate Taibo's book.

 Now and then, Taibo throws in stuff that is simply intended to send up his 
characters. We are allowed to peek into intelligence dossiers and confidential 
notes; we are given Trotsky's early drafts of an unpublished mystery novel. 
And, again and again, we are invited to read various versions of "Elena 
Jordan's Rejected Thesis Proposal," a running joke about Julio's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who the hell invented and propagated, and with what insane intentions," she 
writes in a frenzy of anger and frustration, "the concept of 'theoretical 
work'?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fever dream that is Taibo's novel reaches a crescendo when the various 
conspirators, who have been just missing each other for 300 pages or so, 
finally collide in a hotel corridor in Mexico City, a conflagration that 
features an antique Colt six-shooter and "the first recorded Tequila Molotov." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite unreal, quite absurd," says one of Alex's operatives when the 
smoke finally clears, "it's like a Spielberg movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Four Hands" ends up almost making sense, and what's what shows us how 
deftly and how deeply we have been drawn into Taibo's grand passions and 
twisted logic. "Reality is becoming more and more Bulgarian," says one 
character, a crack that amounts to the punch line to an in-joke, but only if 
you've followed Taibo to the end of his marvelous story.

$221,000 with its 12-day summer fund drive, topping the total from last 
summer's 10-day drive by about $42,000 and seeing an increase in the number of 
members and donors from 2,664 to 2,706. To what do station officials attribute 
this success? Four -- count 'em, four -- broadcasts of the "Encore! The Three 
Tenors," the televised concert with Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano 
Pavarotti.The drive ended Monday.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 'MY SO-CALLED LIFE': WEARY TRIP THROUGH TEEN 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a tiny brush stroke of irony, the new fall television season begins early 
on ABC Thursday night with a stripped-down-and-reglazed antique from the 
producers of "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 Although considerably smarter than average, "My So-Called Life" is the latest 
in a very long line of prime-time series about youths coping with their 
changing lives and their parents coping with them. In other words, a sort of 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," minus the lobotomy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an apt curtain raiser for a 1994-95 season in which newness and sameness 
glom together indistinguishably. 
</P>
<P>
 As fathers of the late, great "thirtysomething," Marshall Herskovitz and 
Edward Zwick now bear the crushing tonnage of our expectations, having artfully 
transfused television drama in the late 1980s with an extended family of 
relentlessly introspective baby boomers whose stories on ABC thumpity-thumped 
the heartbeat of substance. They are the executive producers of "My So-Called 
Life"; its creator is Winnie Holtzman, who spent two seasons writing scripts 
for "thirtysomething."  
</P>
<P>
 But "thirtysomething" glistened from its inception with a seductive uniqueness 
that this latest series does not initially share. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite good intentions, some smiles and some moments that may ring 
excruciatingly true for both teens and former teens (to say nothing of their 
parents), "My So-Called Life" often makes you feel less like a witness than an 
exhausted chaperon for its subculture of hyperventilating sophomores. It can be 
a wearing experience, for after a promising start, the series travels a 
slippery downward curve greased by a series of feel-good endings that strain 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen Angst and parental hand-wringing hover smoggily over the stylish, 
Holtzman-written, Scott Winant-directed premiere (the best of four episodes 
made available for preview), as almost immediately the zits hit the fan. For 
reasons even she can't define, mopey 15-year-old Angela Chase (Claire Danes) 
impulsively colors her straight hair crimson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll always be able to spot you . . . in a crowd," her mother, Patty (Bess 
Armstrong), chides with faint ridicule during dinner. Angela over-responds 
defiantly, stabbing her plate with her fork. 
</P>
<P>
 This on-going mother-daughter petulance is mediated by Angela's appeasing, 
stridently anxious-to-please father, Graham (Tom Irwin). "Why do I always have 
to be the mean one?" the self-pitying Patty bitterly lashes out when he shrinks 
from getting tough with their daughter. Flawed characters you can handle, but 
"My So-Called Life" elevates them to high-decibel stridence; just who is least 
grating in this series varies from scene to scene and episode to episode. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In ways that recall ABC's grand "Wonder Years," "Degrassi Junior High" on PBS 
and "Square Pegs," a quirky CBS sitcom in the early 1980s, "My So-Called Life" 
contains its share of charming small truths. When Angela tells a teacher that 
Anne Frank was fortunate to be "trapped in an attic for three years with this 
guy she really liked," for example, you not only pity the poor teacher, you 
also recognize that Holtzman has a witty grasp on adolescence and knows a 
bull's-eye when she sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus is the brooding self-consciousness that seems so genuine in 
Angela, a credit to Danes' effortless performance. Her nervous body language 
speaks volumes, as do her character's private thoughts, delivered as part of a 
voice-over narration in the manner of "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty enough to be noticed, plain enough to be insecure, Angela is dreamily 
transfixed by physical appearance and acutely self-absorbed. These are 
recognizable traits, the territory that comes with teenhood. Will her breasts 
ever grow? Is that a pimple on her face or the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Does 
Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto), the handsome slug she has a crush on, even know 
she's alive? 
</P>
<P>
 Angela's so-called life away from home is marked by boyfriend/girlfriend 
melodramas. Sharon (Devon Odessa), her longtime best friend, is devastated when 
Angela replaces her with flirtysomething playgirl Rayanne (A.J. Langer), who is 
inseparable from the show's human hybrid, the "bi," eyelinered, hormonally 
challenged, sexually ambivalent Rickie (Wilson Cruz). A half-black, 
half-Latino, half-boy classmate, he routinely hangs out in the girls' bathroom, 
which somehow no one questions for several episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Manic passions fill this attic. Although Angela and her friends tend to 
magnify even the minuscule, some genuinely serious matters do surface on "My 
So-Called Life." There's a near rape in the premiere, and it turns out that the 
fun-loving Rayanne is a party boozer who blacks out when she drinks. (As if 
everyone in the series was an amnesiac, however, Rayanne's drinking problem is 
fleeting, vanishing into an abyss of future episodes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Further down the line, "My So-Called Life" slips in an episode about teen 
bullying and guns at Angela's relatively upscale school. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it resolves these affairs with unnatural tidiness, just as Angela's soggy 
rapprochement with her mother at the end of Episode One -- prompted by 
something that her clunk of a father does -- is an illogical U-turn against 
heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dippy teens, dippy parents. The question: If you've experienced it once in 
real life, do you want to endure it again? 
</P>
<P>
 * "My So-Called Life" premieres at 8 p.m. Thursday on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 
and 42).

ANSON THACHER; EX-HEADMASTER OF VENERABLE OJAI PREP SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anson S. Thacher, former headmaster of the venerable Ojai prep school founded 
by his father, the oldest private boarding school west of the Mississippi, has 
died at his home in Ojai. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Thacher died last Wednesday after a brief illness, the family announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on the campus of the Thacher School five miles outside of Ojai, Thacher 
was a student there and taught there from 1931 until his retirement in 1970. He 
served as headmaster from 1936 to 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Yale-educated attorney Sherman Thacher, founded the boarding 
school for boys in 1889 with the unusual requirement that each student must 
care for a horse. "There's something about the outside of a horse," the founder 
espoused, "that's good for the inside of a boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although horses are no longer needed as transportation, first year students 
(which now include girls) still must tend horses and clean stables before going 
to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles that my father believed in . . . a kind of puritanism, hard 
work, self-denial have not changed," Anson Thacher told The Times at the 
school's centennial observance in 1989. "They may be old-fashioned, but they're 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamentally what it comes down to," he said, "is that you can't control a 
horse unless you first control yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Anson Thacher earned his college degree at Yale and taught at the 
Massachusetts prep school, Groton, and the Catalina Island School before 
returning home to Thacher School. 
</P>
<P>
 An active civic leader, Thacher served as president of the Ojai Civic Assn., 
the Ojai Chamber of Commerce and for more than 30 years of both the Senior 
Canyon Mutual Water Co. and the Ojai Valley School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Thacher and his wife, Margaret, were honored as grand marshals of 
Ojai's Independence Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Thacher is survived by three children, Anne T. Adami 
of Walnut Creek, Calif., Anson B. Thacher of Ojai and Nicholas S. Thacher of 
New Canaan, Conn.; one brother, two sisters and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service at Thacher School has been planned for 10 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 
9. The family has asked that memorial donations be made to the Ojai Valley 
Museum or to the Thacher School.

JOAN HARRISON, 83; PRODUCER, WRITER FOR ALFRED HITCHCOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Harrison, a major writer and producer for Alfred Hitchcock and once the 
only woman feature film producer in Hollywood, has died at the age of 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Harrison died Aug. 14 in London, her colleague and friend Norman Lloyd 
said Tuesday in Los Angeles. A native of England, Miss Harrison had lived in 
London for the past 20 years with her husband, novelist Eric Ambler. 
</P>
<P>
 After her editorial writer father discouraged her interest in journalism 
because there was too much drinking, smoking and swearing, she turned to film. 
Answering a want ad, she was hired by Alfred Hitchcock as his secretary in 
London in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning the business at his elbow, she worked on several of his British 
productions, including "Jamaica Inn," starring Charles Laughton and Maureen 
O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock brought her to Hollywood in 1939, where she concentrated on writing 
intriguing screenplays for the famous director's suspense classics. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first writing credit was on Hitchcock's first American production, 
"Rebecca," starring Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, which won the 
Academy Award for best picture in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Next out of her typewriter came "Foreign Correspondent," starring Joel McCrea, 
in 1940; "Suspicion" in 1941, starring Cary Grant and Miss Fontaine, and 
"Saboteur" in 1942, starring Robert Cummings and her friend Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miss Harrison left the Hitchcock camp, her scripts were bought but never 
produced. In frustration, she moved into production at Universal, becoming one 
of the first women producing feature films and the only one in the Hollywood of 
the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Times entertainment writer Lee Shippey mused on her unique position: "Maybe 
she is to be a maker of history -- the one to demonstrate that women can do 
extremely well as producers." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Harrison had learned all facets of the film business working in small 
English studios, tutored by the master. She had no doubt that she could 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Hitchcock is a wonderful teacher and treated me like an associate 
producer," she told The Times when she switched from writer to producer. "I 
think very few women make good directors but producing is different. Directors 
must at times be able to shout in a way women can't or shouldn't. But no 
production which does not satisfy the feminine point of view is a success." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Harrison's first film as producer was "Phantom Lady" for Universal 
Studios, starring Franchot Tone, in 1944. She followed that with "Uncle Harry" 
in 1945, "Nocturne" in 1946, "Ride the Pink Horse" in 1947, "Once More My 
Darling" in 1949 and "Circle of Danger" in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hitchcock decided to go into the new medium of television, he called Miss 
Harrison. She produced his legendary "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" (later 
retitled "The Alfred Hitchcock Hour") from its inception in 1955 until the last 
show in 1966. The popular series has been repeatedly syndicated over the years, 
and enjoyed a one-season revival in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Harrison married Ambler in San Francisco in 1958. Hitchcock signed the 
marriage certificate as a witness.

SCORES ON COLLEGE ENTRANCE ACT EXAM RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nationwide scores on the ACT college entrance exam improved slightly for the 
second year in a row, but most freshmen still aren't ready for calculus or 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores rose in 1994 because high school students, especially growing numbers 
of women, are taking more of the courses needed to prepare for college, test 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's average score on the American College Testing assessment was 20.8, 
up from 20.7 in 1993. During the three years before that, scores held steady at 
20.6. 
</P>
<P>
 ACT is scored on a scale of 1 to 36. Women get the credit for boosting this 
year's average: While male scores fell 0.1 of a point, to 20.9, female scores 
rose 0.3 of a point, to 20.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although men have always scored higher, the gender gap this year was the 
smallest ever, reflecting the growing number of women high school students 
taking advanced math and science classes, ACT President Richard L. Ferguson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many students still aren't taking all the courses they need to get 
ready for college. He called on teachers to steer more students into those 
classes, especially advanced math and science. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of entering college freshmen took the test.

RELATIONSHIPS: HEALTHY WAYS TO COPE WITH SERIOUS ILLNESS AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mona, an accounting manager for an Anaheim insurance company, first heard 
that Carol, a co-worker of eight years, had been diagnosed with ovarian/uterine 
cancer, she cried. Then she let Carol know she was available to help in any way 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 While Carol was home for four months, Mona -- who, like Carol, asked that her 
last name not be used -- visited and called and kept her co-worker updated on 
what was happening at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mona was worried about Carol when she returned to work while still 
undergoing chemotherapy, her fears were allayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in awe of Carol," Mona says. "Despite the chemotherapy, she returned in 
very high spirits and has been working really well through all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol's situation is common today. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that when people became ill with a potentially life-threatening 
illness, such as cancer, they quit work and sometimes didn't return, but that 
isn't so now, says licensed clinical social worker Linda McFadden, who has a 
private practice in Tustin and often counsels seriously ill individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Cancer Society, 80% of cancer patients return to 
their jobs after surgery or treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because insurance polices have cut back on stay-at-home time and families 
often need two incomes, many people must return to work despite serious 
illness," McFadden says. "They will return to work during radiation and 
chemotherapy, which is a very difficult thing to do. Many people would like to 
stay home and rest if they could, and they probably should." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are people who improve because of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people deal with the illness better if they are able to work, especially 
if they have a long history of work and get their self-esteem from their job," 
McFadden says. "Being able to work helps them realize they are strong." 
</P>
<P>
 When a co-worker is diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening illness, the 
entire staff is affected, McFadden says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are frightened by severe illness," she says. "The thought of cancer 
and other potentially life-threatening illnesses makes them feel vulnerable, 
because they realize it could happen to them. If the person is someone they 
really care about, their productivity will be affected to some degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some co-workers react negatively to the news of illness by 
avoiding the person or offering pity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting like you aren't sick is the best way to go" to prevent problems at 
work, Carol says. "I think if you whine, co-workers lose patience, which has a 
negative effect on everyone's performance. I keep my personal problems at home 
and just talk about the cancer with my friends. As a result, people have 
forgotten about the cancer, and I'm treated as I always was." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail, 48, is a secretary who worked closely with Carol for six years. When she 
heard her co-worker had cancer, she was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cancer is a very scary word," she says. "When I first heard about Carol, I 
cried. Then I wondered if she would be able to come back to work and if her 
life would ever be the same." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning Gail showed her support for Carol by calling and sending 
little notes and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A co-worker who has cancer has to know that you care and you're interested in 
him or her getting well," she says. "Never dwell on the negatives, only on 
positives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail has found that humor is especially helpful when a co-worker is ill. 
"Doing things to cheer them up really helps," she says. "When Carol's hair fell 
out from the chemotherapy, I gave her a box of lollipops and said, 'Who loves 
ya, baby?' I always look on the bright side, even if it isn't that bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail worried about Carol's return to work but was pleasantly surprised to see 
that Carol handled it remarkably well. 
</P>

 "There she was undergoing hours of chemotherapy and then returning to work," 
she says. "I just marveled at how well she did it. It made me hope that if I 
become ill someday I'll be able to handle things so well."

 Barbara McKone is a psychologist and clinical director of the Orange County 
Wellness Community in Santa Ana, which provides services for seriously ill 
individuals. She worked with Vicki Goldicsh, the first executive director of 
the center, before Goldicsh died of cancer 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a wonderful, rich working relationship," McKone says. "When we first 
met, Vicki's dream was to make the Wellness Community a reality, which we did. 
Initially, her cancer was in remission, but as we worked together, biology 
eventually overcame her determination." 
</P>
<P>
 McKone worked with Goldicsh for 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vicki taught me that communication between two people is vital when one 
person has a potentially life-threatening illness," McKone says. "The key is to 
ask clear questions and respect the response. Being sensitive to the ill 
co-worker's situations is also a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 If you see that things are becoming difficult for the person, sit down and 
offer to help, but don't treat the person like an invalid, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 McKone also advises against making the illness the center of what is going on 
in the office. "Concentrate on other things," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 McKone says having a co-worker who had cancer was an enriching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about the fragility of life," she says. 
"If you don't fear it, you can only be enriched by the experience. Most of the 
time our fears aren't about the other person; they're about our mortality. 
Recognizing that frees you and enables you to be there for your co-worker, who 
probably needs you more than any other time."

YOUNG PARENTS NARROW THE GENERATION GAP; FAMILIES: EARLY PARENTHOOD HAS ITS 
PLUSES -- CONSIDER THE ENERGY IT TAKES TO KEEP UP WITH KIDS. BUT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY CAN SEEM OVERWHELMING.

 When Margaret and Tony Nava are out in public, strangers often ask if the 
6-year-old boy is her little brother. He always has a quick reply: 
</P>
<P>
 "No, she's my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Nava is used to that line of questioning. She's also used to 
playing soccer with Tony and his friends and dodging her son's water balloons 
outside their Orange apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself having a good time with Tony," Nava says. "My parents were 
older, and they didn't play with me like I play with Tony. Because I 
participate in a lot of activities with him, he and his friends think I'm cool. 
I think if I were older, I wouldn't understand half the things he does or why 
he does them." 
</P>
<P>
 Score one for younger parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) tend to have a sense of playfulness that sometimes disappears when you 
get older," says psychologist Amy Stark. What's more, starting a family early 
also means that you've completed your most intensive parenting responsibilities 
by the time you reach 40. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the challenges of early parenthood can be very stressful. 
Says Stark: "Girls who have babies young find it difficult to raise a child and 
form this other identity when they don't yet know who they are. In terms of 
life stages, the years from 18 to 22 represent a time when you learn about who 
you are and what you want out of life." 
</P>
<P>
 For young couples who have a baby and then get married, statistics show that 
the marriage often doesn't survive, Stark says. "The challenge of supporting a 
family is hard enough for adults. It puts unusual strains on young people who 
have never had that kind of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, there is no question we are more ready in our teens for 
parenthood, but we are more psychologically ready at a later age," says Arthur 
Kovacs, a Santa Monica psychologist who specializes in family life transitions. 
"Marriages seem to work best if there is an orderly progression that begins 
with dating and discovering the contours of (the partner's) personality, 
decision-making rituals, and assignment of responsibilities, such as who takes 
out the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Stark: "Depending on how much work experience or schooling a young parent 
has had, it can be very difficult to raise a child. Many young people don't yet 
have careers and find it impossible to survive on low-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some young people view early parenthood in a negative light, according to two 
studies conducted in the late 1980s. In the 1987 National Survey of Children, 
four out of five youths aged 18 to 22 agreed that becoming a teen-age parent is 
"one of the worst things that could happen to a 16-year-old girl or to a 
16-year-old boy," according to the Los Angeles-based Children's Action Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 15% of the births to school-age mothers (aged 17 and younger) were 
described by the teens as having been wanted at the time -- although that 
percentage more than doubled for mothers ages 18 to 19, according to the 1988 
National Survey of Families and Households. 
</P>
<P>
 Those young parents who have the financial and emotional support of their 
family often have an easier time adjusting to parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nava has her family to thank for helping her survive single parenthood. For a 
time, she was living with her son's father, who was 20 when the baby was born, 
but he became overwhelmed by the responsibility of raising a child and left 
when Tony was 10 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family lives close by and has been very supportive," says Nava. "If it 
wasn't for (them), raising Tony would have been much more difficult. I would 
have missed out on a lot more things, like my senior prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Nava was 17 was Tony was born, a senior in high school. She and her son 
eventually moved in with her mother and then with her father. Mother and son 
went out on their own when Nava was 20. 
</P>
<P>
 While Nava is at work, her mother cares for Tony (Nava pays her.) Her older 
brothers, Danny and Richard Serrano, also help by serving as male role models. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brothers are there for Tony every step of the way," Nava says. "If he gets 
in trouble and I'm having a hard time dealing with him, they'll talk to him. He 
really looks up to them. They also attend his soccer games when I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Nava admits that it's been a long, tough road all by herself. She finished 
high school the first year of Tony's life doing homework in between feedings. 
After school she worked part time to earn enough money for such necessities as 
baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she graduated from high school, Nava realized that she needed to learn a 
trade to support herself and her son, so she attended school to become a 
medical assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Her schedule was grueling. 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 a.m. to noon she worked as an phone operator. Afterward, she would 
return home, eat lunch and go to school from 2:30 to 7 p.m. After school she 
would have dinner and play with her son for a few minutes before putting him to 
bed. Then she would tackle her homework until about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the hardest part of the early years for Nava was not having any time 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself getting upset, stressed and impatient, because I'd see my 
friends going out on the weekends and buying new clothes, and there I was doing 
laundry and using my money for baby stuff. I do feel there are certain things I 
missed during that period of my life, such as going on my senior trip and 
traveling," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Tony is older and Nava has a full-time job as a medical assistant in 
Orange, her schedule is easier, and she does find a little time for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the struggles Nava lauds motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Tony, I think I'd be off partying, and I wouldn't be as serious as I 
am now about life," she says. "I probably wouldn't have a career and I'd still 
be living at home. Tony and I live really comfortably, and we're happy." 
</P>

 Linda Dougherty had always planned on having kids young, so she was delighted 
to get pregnant when she was 20 and equally as thrilled to be expecting again 
when her first daughter was just 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to have my kids before I was 25, so that I could be a young parent," 
says Dougherty, now 40 and living in Tustin. "I wanted to have fun with them, 
versus there being a big generation gap." 
</P>
<P>
 When she got pregnant the first time, Dougherty had just gotten out of nursing 
school and was prepared to raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like my youth was interrupted," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Dougherty forgot to check on was how her 21-year-old husband felt 
about being a father. As it turned out, Walter Dougherty was not as pleased 
with having children that early. He had a much harder time adjusting to the 
rigors of parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter was your typical 21-year-old guy," says Linda Dougherty. "He had no 
idea what to do with babies; they frightened him." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Dougherty, now 41, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I didn't take as much responsibility for the kids as I should 
have, but Linda was very responsible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Walter, the task of making enough money to support his family was 
challenging and somewhat overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Linda had been to nursing school, I hadn't gotten any training and 
had no career to speak of," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had an opportunity to attend school, because I felt that I 
needed a job to provide for the family. Financially, being a younger parent is 
probably harder than being an older parent," says Walter, who, like his wife, 
is now in sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Linda's view, children of young parents tend to grow up more quickly 
because they are less sheltered and protected than kids born to older parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older parents tend to focus on the child's welfare and look at the long-term 
picture and the potentials for disaster. When (parents are) young, a certain 
percentage of ignorance and lack of maturity makes (them) do things -- like 
bring a 6-week-old to the beach -- that you wouldn't do if you were more 
mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Dougherty, 18, who is a senior at Tustin High School, agrees that kids 
with younger parents tend to grow up more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, younger parents make their kids more street-smart than older 
parents," she says. "If I fell down when I was younger and hurt my knee, my mom 
would say, 'It's going to happen.' But if one of my friends who had an older 
parent scraped her knee, her mom would rush for a Band-Aid. Older parents tend 
to baby their children more." 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail also feels that older parents seem to protect their children from 
unpleasant truths such as financial problems. "In my family we know everything 
-- good or bad," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But knowing everything can take its toll at times, says Abigail. "My parents 
have gone through tough times, like all parents do, and it's kind of hard 
sometimes when one of them asks me for advice about the other one," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to me, they'll expect me to go on as if nothing has happened, 
but it's very confusing for me. I wonder, is my mom or dad a mom or dad, or a 
friend? Sometimes I don't want a buddy; I need a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 For Abigail's older sister, Breeanne, 19, having young parents has meant that 
she's been able to get on-target advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents know what I'm going through because it wasn't so long ago that 
they were going through the same things," she says. Breeanne says the advice 
her parents give her is accurate for this day and age because they are more in 
tune with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be totally honest with my parents and tell them what I'll be doing when 
I go out," she says. "Even my friends confide in my mom and dad. For my 18th 
birthday my family threw a big party for me. It was probably the best time of 
my life, and I got to spend it with my family."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: CARLOS TAKES TINSELTOWN? HE COULD'VE BEEN A TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not easy being a pudgy former terrorist in the throes of a midlife 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although initial reports indicated that Carlos, the infamous international 
operative, was arrested 10 days ago at a Sudanese hotel, a London newspaper 
reported Sunday that French agents actually nabbed him in a hospital. According 
to The Observer, he was picked up just after receiving general anesthesia in 
preparation for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The French were able to make their move thanks to Egyptian authorities, who 
had provided the French with a detailed dossier on Carlos, complete with 
pictures and videotapes. In one of the tapes, he is shown socializing at 
Khartoum parties, and in at least one instance, his girlfriend "chides him for 
not taking better care of his appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 News reports chronicling the terrorist's hard-living ways suggest to me that 
the surgery from which he might have benefited most is a liver transplant. But 
Carlos -- who has used his wits and cunning to elude authorities for more than 
two decades -- could not, apparently, elude the perils of his own appetite . . 
. or his girlfriend's nagging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what kind of surgery was the scourge of counterterrorism about to have? 
</P>
<P>
 Liposuction. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective: removal of excess fat from his midriff. 
</P>
<P>
 But his unsightly bulges are dwarfed by the rest of his problems. Having 
failed in his misguided efforts to cripple the running dogs of capitalism, 
Carlos, after 20 years on the lam, has become not only fat but beside the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whiskey-swilling Communist who doesn't believe in God isn't much use to any 
Islamic government," said one former CIA official. "For most of the last 
decade, he's been dead drunk in Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a terrorist emeritus," said a counterterrorism expert. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's a terrorist emeritus to do? 
</P>
<P>
 According to my highly placed sources, Carlos had decided to take the next 
train to Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how the French agents came to find him on a Sudanese gurney, moments 
away from terminating those unsightly love handles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liposuction, you see, was merely a first step in the repackaging of Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
 The next steps would include lipo-reinjection, getting a good agent, learning 
to work the crowd at Morton's, joining a 12-step program, and hitting the 
talk-show trail with segments on "Your Wounded Inner Terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
 Through my sources, I was able to beat out Vanity Fair and Diane Sawyer for an 
exclusive interview with Carlos about his career aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 He told me he hopes to position himself as a cross between a Marxist Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Rodney Dangerfield -- a revolutionary who can't get no 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous, really, but no more outlandish than the life he has already lived. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees himself as a leading man, naturally, with a love life as explosive as 
any of his missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think terrorism is tough?" he said. "I'll tell you what's tough. Juggling 
a girlfriend and a wife, that's what. My wife is a former terrorist herself, 
you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I spent half my time making up excuses for why I wasn't anywhere 
near a kidnaping I was supposed to be masterminding, and the other half 
checking under my car for explosives my wife might have planted." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I call stress, I told him. Maybe that's why you let yourself go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure it is. I can't get a home-cooked meal, because I don't have a home," 
said Carlos. "I busted my buns trying to tilt the balance of world power, and 
all I get is two women telling me how fat I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like they just don't understand you, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I went in for the liposuction," he said. "It was easier than 
listening to them complain. And you know, I didn't have Sudanese health 
insurance, so I was footing the entire bill with money I had managed to save 
from a few Paris bombings I had organized back in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a joke. I thought I was going to wake up 10 pounds lighter; instead I 
woke up in handcuffs. And the damn hospital in Khartoum won't give me a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's gratitude for you. Do you know how much business I've thrown to 
hospitals? A lot, that's how much." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like you're underappreciated, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I did other people's bidding -- with no pension, no sick time, no 
vacation pay -- then they toss me aside like a piece of rotten meat. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do they thank me? By ratting me out for a few lousy public relations 
points, the sharks. There's no loyalty in this business anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like he's got potential. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't know. Hollywood might just eat him alive.

FIRST PERSON: '90S FAMILY; A STORY OF DESPERATION AND THE CHILD IT WROUGHT

 His birth mother never really got a chance to see her son. They took him from 
her quickly, fearful that if she saw him she would never give him up. I doubt 
that this would have happened. He was too misshapen to be instantly lovable; 
born prematurely, he needed that final month in the womb to grow stronger and 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 I still believe that had he lived inside of me for those nine months he would 
have been safer. It took me a while to like his face, but then he really wasn't 
yet mine. It took me a year to adopt him. He didn't look like anyone I knew, 
but he had the best head of dark black, wavy hair, so very thick for such a 
tiny baby. I have always loved his hair. It is thinning now with strands of 
premature gray. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a peculiarly winning smile, just a little off center. Nothing else 
about him made much sense. His face was kind of lopsided and his body was 
floppy. But they said to take him home and love him. I did just that; probably 
I did that job better than most might have. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't grow right, not exactly crippled or deformed, but nothing really 
worked the way it should have. There wasn't one part of his body that wasn't 
just a little off. Even his elbows jutted out at odd angles. He was slower than 
other children his age, slower to crawl, slower to walk, slower to do all those 
things parents dote upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone could see that something was amiss. We just had no name for it. He 
even began to get better looking, tiny eyes squinting through thick glasses, 
but he certainly had an odd assortment of features. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived with me in my home and finally in my heart. So deeply in my heart 
that I could not think of giving him back. There was no ticket attached that 
said, "If damaged in transit, goods may be returned for a full refund." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still not a part of him that works the way it should. His body is a 
testament to eight bad months inside his mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
 I always wondered what had gone wrong. So did the doctors. What happened to 
retard his brain and mess up his body? When asked, I pleaded ignorance. I 
wasn't there at the conception, his birth or anything in between. I just 
brought him home and lived with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I had thought to search for his biological mother. Older 
adoptions were secret affairs with social workers sworn to eternal secrecy. 
Files were locked in basement rooms, of no particular interest to anyone, but 
locked away nevertheless, making it so hard for children to find their birth 
mothers that books were written describing the agonizing search and frequently 
painful reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not about the search. That was the easy part, so easy that within 
weeks I had the name of his birth mother written on a piece of paper, along 
with her phone number and the name of the Eastern city where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
 I saved that number for some time and finally on a Tuesday in the early 
evening I decided to make the call. Perhaps she was watching "Roseanne" on 
television or doing the dishes. Whatever it was, she could not have been 
prepared for my call. 
</P>
<P>
 I told her that I had adopted her baby some 30 years ago. She said she always 
knew that someday I would call, and she asked about her son. I tried to 
describe him as best I could -- including his mental retardation. She said she 
thought he probably looked a lot like his father with that mass of black hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Still she seemed not to want to hear about his disabilities. With some urgency 
she told me about her family and while there were problems with weight and 
heart, she said, no one had ever suffered from any "mental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked her what had happened to that fetus she had carried so long ago, 
she became very silent. She knew the answer. And then there were deep sobs as 
she recalled the past. She remembered the fear and shame she felt when she 
discovered her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 My son was supposed to have been aborted, but 30 years ago his mother badly 
botched the job. She was too scared, too unknowing and too young to take care 
of herself and her unborn child. She was not promiscuous, only careless. A 
one-time-only romance for this nice, well-brought-up Jewish girl charmed by a 
handsome, upper-class Mexican man who left her pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no legal way out of pregnancy in 1963 so she tried to find her own 
way. She knew that drinking quinine in the first trimester had often caused 
abortions. She drank the quinine. And the next day she drank it again. 
</P>
<P>
 She recovered. The fetus didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the most vivid picture of those drops of quinine crossing the placenta 
and finding their way into the tiny holes where eyes would soon develop, 
delicately damaging the intricate workings of the retina, the iris. A few drops 
fell on the shell-like beginning curve of the ear, touching one eardrum just 
enough to mute hearing forever. The liquid traveled through this tiny creature 
twisting the soon-to-develop arms, legs and feet. The heart was touched just 
enough to make it murmur. The most potent fluid fell on the emerging brain, 
microscopic lobes altered immutably for the life of this human being. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not meant to be a political statement about abortion. It's simply a 
story of desperation, fear, error and serious consequences, what people will do 
when they feel trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 After so many years, perhaps I should not have disturbed his birth mother. I 
did it out of the hope that finding the answers would soothe me. I found no 
comfort there but the new knowledge has allowed me to relinquish the past and 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is nothing more to know.

'90S FAMILY; THE TALK; THE FACTS-OF-LIFE DISCUSSION EVERY PARENT DREADS HAS 
NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT IS TODAY. THE KEYS ARE COMMUNICATION AND 
MUTUAL TRUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Believing that her hair is holding her back, Angela, the teen-age protagonist 
of the new television drama "My So-Called Life," goes a punk shade of red. "It 
could be a lot worse," Angela's father tells his distraught wife. "She could be 
cutting class, doing drugs, having sex. . . . like we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Just wait a few episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, unusual hair color and buzz cuts are the least of parents' worries 
as rates of teen-age substance abuse and pregnancy climb. Yet repeated, 
consistent messages from media and community groups targeting these problems 
are on the wane and many parents feel ill-equipped to fill the gap, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many parents are terrified to have these kinds of conversations with their 
teen-agers because no one talked to them (as teens)," said Winnie Holzman, 
creator and co-executive producer of ABC's "My So-Called Life." "It's our hope 
that by showing Angela's parents struggling through these moments, the show 
will engender discussions between parents and young adults." 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to discuss sensitive topics with teens requires years of 
preparation, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk about sex if you haven't 
established an open channel of communication," said Berkeley High School 
teacher Nancy Rubin, whose book "Ask Me If I Care: Voices from an American High 
School" (Tricycle Press) will be published in September. "Many times, 
communication starts when there's a problem. But it's an ongoing process that 
should start by responding to children's questions from an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a time when AIDS is a real fear and when young people's reality about 
sexual relationships and drugs are increasingly influenced by television, their 
questions can fall outside the range of many parents' comfort level and 
experience. Simply telling teens to "be careful" is not enough anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many parents know what (the "designer drug") ecstasy is?" Rubin asked. 
"How can you explain the danger of a drug when you don't know what it is? It's 
hard for parents to be good educators when their only message is 'Don't do it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Credible messages can often come from trusted friends and relatives, as it did 
for 14-year-old Henry Oswald, who lives with his grandparents and older 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandparents just know that drugs are bad," said Oswald, who starts at 
North Hollywood High School next month. "As I am walking out the door to go to 
a party, my grandma will say, 'Henry, if anyone asks you to use drugs, call 
home.' But when my older brother tells me how this stuff really does mess you 
up, it means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who are uncomfortable talking directly with their teens can show their 
support by participating in school-based drug prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any school-based program will be strengthened by parent participation, 
whether it's putting on a drug-free party or getting involved in discussions 
and activities," said Dr. Phyllis Ellickson, senior behavioral scientist at 
Rand, the Santa Monica-based research institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting teens to listen requires that adults be very straight and factual, and 
parents have had less help in recent years from media and community groups in 
reinforcing the message, Ellickson added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common wisdom is not to use scare tactics, which can have a boomerang 
effect -- like images of reefer madness or malformed fetuses linked to 
marijuana use. People really do die from cigarette smoking, drug overdoses and 
drunk driving. Parents do not need to shade the information to make things look 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Latimer-Roberts, a labor relations specialist and mother of two, 
recently took her son Russell, 14, to Skid Row to see firsthand the effect that 
drugs and alcohol can have on "real people." Determined that her son would not 
have to learn about sex and drugs on the street as she did, Latimer-Roberts 
encourages questions on any subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I am nervous inside," Latimer-Roberts said, "but on the outside I 
remain calm and answer Russell's questions. I'll also ask him if he has any 
questions about sex. Or I'll say, 'Children are going to approach you at school 
about drugs. How are you going to decline it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than encourage experimentation as many parents fear, directness has had 
the opposite effect on Russell Rashed-Latimer, who enters Palisades High School 
next month. At his alma mater, Paul Revere Middle School, he had no interest in 
the "jungle," a popular fourth-period smoking spot behind the school. "My mom 
wants me to be able to talk to her whenever anything comes up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching parents to communicate factually and openly with children is a big 
part of many adolescent rehabilitation programs, such as the Suzanne Somers 
Family Treatment Center in Yorba Linda. According to center Vice President Tim 
Allen, teens who find themselves in trouble share the common perception that 
they cannot do things right and are not important in the family. Most of their 
parents fall into what Allen describes as either permissive or controlling. 
</P>
<P>
 "In either case, children will feel rejected and respond in a negative way," 
Allen said. "If permissiveness is not based on love and affection, kids will be 
more likely to take risks and experiment with drugs like marijuana, LSD and 
other hallucinogens. If a child perceives controlling parents as hostile, he or 
she is likely to have attendance problems and try alcohol or cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 The approach to strive for, Allen said, is to act with authority while 
encouraging dialogue. "Parents have to be like chairmen of the board with 
consistent policies," Allen added. "There must be clear and reasonable 
consequences as well as recognition when a child does things well and makes 
good decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers always have experimented and always will, Allen said. The family is 
the reference point for how they will ultimately behave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be role models. If we want our kids to be open in communication 
with us, we need to be honest with them about our feelings and emotions."

'90S FAMILY; BACK TO THE BOOKS; ESTABLISHING RULES ON TV AND HOMEWORK AND 
HELPING THEM GET ORGANIZED WILL GET KIDS OFF TO A GOOD START FOR THE SCHOOL 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The start of the school year is a good time to establish back-to-school 
routines. Maurine Harrison, professor of education at Sweet Briar College in 
Virginia, has these tips for parents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Set definite limits on television, video and computer games. Help children 
choose selectively and carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set a regular time and place for homework. Be firm. If 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. is 
designated as a quiet time for study, stick to it. If this schedule is 
disrupted, get back on track as soon as possible. (This works best if parents 
also use this time for quiet activity.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Help your child get organized with a simple assignment book, calendar and 
notebook with dividers. Don't buy expensive, complicated organizing systems; 
these can be frustrating to use. Be sure to show children how to use these 
aids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep communication lines open with teachers. Work together so little 
problems don't mushroom into big ones. When parents and teachers work together, 
children know limits and expectations will be carried out both at school and at 
home. Close communication with teachers also allows parents to hear and share 
their children's successes. Report cards provide a very small piece of the 
total picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Communicate expectations clearly and consistently. Children need to know 
their parents value learning and expect them to make the best of their talents 
and abilities. Meeting challenges in order to make the best of one's unique 
potential is the foundation of healthy self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Focus on strengths. Find activities children can excel in and enjoy, and 
then support their continued success in these areas -- Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 
sports, music, whatever. If a child has a learning difficulty, parents should 
work with the child, teacher and school. "The key is to help your child develop 
his or her own identity in terms of the things he or she does well." 
</P>
<P>
 * Balance work and play. Personal satisfaction and happiness operate like a 
bank account; whatever is energizing fills the account, whatever is draining 
depletes it. "Never underestimate the value of play for creating energy and 
renewal for less enjoyable, but necessary, tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage and support children through positive communication and action. 
Negative comments help parents vent their frustrations, but they don't help 
children grow and learn. Instead, they engender hurt, anger, "parent deafness" 
and resentment. "Parents, choose your words and actions carefully. They are 
more powerful than we ever fully realize." 
</P>
<P>
 * Anticipate common problems and look for workable solutions. "Family 
meetings" can be used to brainstorm solutions that will benefit everyone. When 
children feel they are valued, contributing members of the family, they become 
active parts of the solution.

A FLAP OVER L.A. COUNTY ARTS FUNDS SURFACES; POLICY: A COMMISSION IS WRESTLING 
WITH PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REAPPORTION A $366,000 GRANT FUND, WITH THE L.A. 
PHILHARMONIC BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE REDISTRIBUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when arts groups increasingly find themselves pitted against one 
another in battles for scarce public dollars, the little-known Los Angeles 
County Music and Performing Arts Commission is suddenly caught in a tug-of-war 
between establishment organizations and smaller community-oriented groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In a commission meeting Monday, President Carlos C. Barron noted that they had 
never even had an audience at a meeting before. But to the dozen or so 
representatives from various arts organizations seated in a boardroom at the 
Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, there was plenty of cause for 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 New guidelines that would have radically changed the way the commission 
allocates its organizational grants were on the table, proposing a 
redistribution of funds that in the past largely have gone to the Music 
Center's triumvirate: the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Music Center Opera and 
the Center Theatre Group. The proposal was voted down and replaced by a new 
"compromise" proposal, which also calls for a redistribution of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a total of just $366,000. Last year more than 53% of that amount 
went to the three icons of the L.A. performing arts, with the remainder divided 
among 25 organizations, among them Long Beach Opera, L.A. Theatre Works, 
Odyssey Theatre Foundation and Southeast Symphony Assn. (The Music Center also 
receives a separate appropriation of $7,658,000 from the county for operation 
and maintenance.) 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1947, the commission is composed of three appointed 
commissioners from each of the five supervisorial districts; money for its 
organizational grants comes from the county's general fund. The guidelines for 
commission grants have remained virtually the same for at least a decade, 
according to commission executive director Laura Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, Barron and four other commissioners supported a motion -- 
authored by an executive committee of Aurelia Brooks, Judith Luther-Wilder and 
Regina Cordova -- that would have drastically reduced funding to the three 
majors, turning that money over to smaller arts groups. Key to the plan was a 
series of caps on the amounts individual organizations could receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Had this proposal passed, the L.A. Philharmonic's allocation -- the largest by 
far -- would have dropped from $124,805 in 1993-94 to $26,700 for 1994-95; the 
Opera's from $41,300 to $24,300 and the Center Theatre Group's from $31,258 to 
$27,600. Meanwhile, organizations such as American Youth Symphony, which got 
$4,000 last year, would have gotten nearly double that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Philharmonic's allocation is just a small portion of its 
$36.4-million annual operating budget, a Philharmonic official argued Monday 
that the loss would hurt: "It's a significant portion of our education and 
community programs budget, our low- and no-cost outreach work in underserved 
communities," said Philharmonic public affairs director Leni Boorstein. "The 
perception that it doesn't hurt is mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 But some commissioners argued that the old guidelines are outdated. "I know 
the city has changed," said Commissioner Adrienne A. Hall, an appointee of 
Supervisor Gloria Molina who spoke in favor of the executive committee 
proposal. "No one is here to do the Music Center any harm. We're only here to 
create a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless the proposal -- which some commissioners said they felt was being 
railroaded -- was voted down. In its place Commissioner Marjorie S. Lyte put 
forth a new plan that would redistribute funds without caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyte is an appointee of Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich and a past president 
of the commission. Her proposal would still take more than $40,000 out of the 
Philharmonic grant, from $124,805 in 1993-94 to a recommended $80,000. The 
Opera and Center Theatre Group would receive essentially the same amounts as 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyte's motion, and the grants for the 1994-95 fiscal year that depend on it, 
will likely come up for a vote at the commission's next meeting, on a date 
to-be-determined, probably in mid-September. The arts organizations are left 
without funds until a decision is made.

O.C. MUSIC; SOPRANO STARTS OFF ON HIGH NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why not start at the top? That's what soprano Noelle Brooks, 21, felt when she 
skipped the easy stuff and went right to Mozart's formidable Queen of the Night 
when she began studying voice privately just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," Brooks said in a recent phone interview from Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fun" is not the first word most singers would use to describe one of the most 
difficult coloratura roles in all of opera. But the high notes posed little 
problem for her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top extension was always there. When I was young, it was even higher. But 
I don't think those notes are really necessary. A or A-flat is as high as you 
need in really modern stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks will make use of that high extension on Saturday when she sings in 
Orff's "Carmina Burana" with conductor William Hall and the Master Chorale of 
Orange County at Pearson Park Amphitheatre in Anaheim. One of the solos goes up 
to a high D. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Walnut Creek, Calif., Brooks grew up in Redondo Beach after her 
father, a phone company employee, was transferred there. "I'm a beach girl," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singing wasn't in the picture when she was a kid. "In the beginning I 
envisioned myself being a prima ballerina," she said. "But I had a weight 
problem. Lots of girls in ballet have problems with their weight. I was never 
fat. I (just) thought I had a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She had started ballet lessons when she was 5. "But those were just for fun. I 
started serious lessons at 9, at the Lichine Ballet Academy in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 But she "just lost interest in ballet" after her parents got divorced. She was 
12. At first, she tried switching to jazz dance, but found it was frustrating. 
"It was so different from ballet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One day she and a friend were noodling around on the piano, and her friend, 
Clyde Allen, then-music director of the Ballet of Los Angeles, began teaching 
her an aria from Puccini's "Gianni Schicci." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother heard me and thought it was a recording," she said. "I was about 
14." 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't prove to be a decisive moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was still kind of floating," Brooks said. "I wasn't interested in anything 
specific. I was flirting with theater, jazz dancing, typical Hollywood 
professions." 
</P>
<P>
 All that is over, however. "I most certainly have decided now," she said about 
her pursuing a professional singing career. "I'm not floating any more. I 
decided when I was 18." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has been taking private voice lessons for the last three years with 
Judith Natalluci, who also teaches at USC. Her plans to study at that school 
didn't work out. "They gave me a scholarship," she said, "but it wasn't enough, 
not really. My family is not rich, not even moderately wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Natalluci suggested she audition for Hall, who was looking for a soprano to 
take along on the Master Chorale's three-week tour of China in July. "Carmina 
Burana," Orff's setting of bawdy medieval poems, was on their program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall picked her on the spot. "I auditioned four sopranos," he said in a 
separate interview. "We didn't have anyone in the group who could sing a high D 
well. She floats a high D. She's going to be one of the major lyric sopranos," 
he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe that Brooks will turn out to be a dramatic soprano. "But I 
really don't think so," she said. "You hear a dramatic soprano and she 
practically blows you out of the room. I don't think I do that. I would 
definitely call myself a lyrical coloratura with a very round sound, very light 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 To build her career, Brooks plans to enter the Metropolitan Opera regional 
auditions next year. "That's really the way to go -- to enter the auditions and 
see how you do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to say that they determine how your career goes. Many great 
singers never won a competition. They're not the determining factor. But they 
help pay for lessons and get you experience in performing, and also get you 
exposed to people who criticize what you're doing, which you'll get all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some young singers, Brooks also studies recordings to bolster her 
education. "It can be very useful in terms of styles of singing, very 
educational," she said. "But to try to sound like somebody else -- I don't. If 
you do, the chances are you're not singing right for your voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks also is interested in singing challenging modern repertory, such as 
Berg's "Lulu," a part she "would love to do. I just love that role, not that it 
has anything to do with my personality. I don't want to scare anyone. But it's 
a great role." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks sings every day. "I have ever since I was a little girl. But as far as 
vocalizing, I try to do exercises every day. I try not to sing much longer than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not a grind," she added. "I enjoy it. I don't really take 
vacations. I'm working on (my singing) most of the time. But I still have a 
personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall will be conducting Orff's original orchestration of the work -- 
percussion and two pianos -- instead of the customary full orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect for the outdoors," Hall said. "We'll have 21 mikes on 
everything. Strings are so hard to get a good sound from outdoors. So we'll 
leave out the two (orchestra dances), but do everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 "In this piece, Orff really has something for everyone," Hall added. "It has 
two of the most beautiful melodies ever written for soprano. One is the 'In 
Trutina' and the second is 'Dulcissime,' which is simply a vocalise." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks agreed "In Trutina" is "a very beautiful piece. If sung very well, it 
can be very effective," she said. " 'Dulcissime' is very exciting and the most 
impressive of all the pieces for my kind of voice. It's the shortest thing in 
there, but the most exposed. No pun intended, it's kind of like the climax of 
the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 * Noelle Brooks will sing in Orff's "Carmina Burana" with conductor William 
Hall and the Master Chorale of Orange County on Saturday at 8 p.m. at Pearson 
Park Amphitheatre, Harbor Boulevard and Cypress Avenue, Anaheim. Also on the 
program are opera arias and choruses. $5 to $15. (714) 556-6262 (Master 
Chorale); (714) 755-5799 (Pearson Park).

OPENING EARS TO URBAN AFRICAN POP; WORLD MUSIC: TABU LEY ROCHEREAU, WHO 
PERFORMS TONIGHT IN LONG BEACH, IS A MISSIONARY OF SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The first taste of stardom came early to Tabu Ley Rochereau, when he played 
before a huge crowd -- including an assortment of dignitaries, the king of 
Belgium among them -- celebrating the 1955 opening of a new soccer stadium in 
Leopoldville, Belgian Congo. 
</P>
<P>
 City and nation long since have been known as Kinshasa and Zaire, 
respectively, and the stadium went on to gain a measure of fame in 1974 as site 
of one of the most celebrated boxing matches ever, the "rumble in the jungle" 
between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rochereau, who performs tonight in Long Beach, remembers best that 
long-ago day when the stadium was new. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 14, his public singing had been confined before then to family gatherings 
and baptisms at his church. But he was invited to take part in a vocal 
competition to mark the stadium opening -- and he won. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was maybe 80,000 people in the stadium; it was live on radio," Rochereau 
recalls. Before then he was just another youngster, but "that same day, I was 
very known." 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers and radio stations called on him for interviews. More important for 
the young singer, "there was one big, big star -- we call him the father of 
modern Zairian music -- (who) called me to write a song for him." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Joseph Kabasele, known as Le Grand Kalle, who more than anyone was 
responsible for creating a distinctive Central African sound that fused Latin 
rumba with Congolese rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau began writing songs for him, at first without credit. "When I 
finished my school on 1959, I started to put my name on the records. The first 
song was 'Kalia.' That song was very, very popular, even to now. Even the 
musicians from Puerto Rico, Cuba and all over Africa, they put that song in 
their language and make a record with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau and Orchestre Afrisa International play tonight on the lawn at the 
Long Beach Museum of Art for the final concert of the museum's summer series. 
He was interviewed in late June on an earlier swing through Long Beach, the 
morning after he performed during the FESTAC African-Caribbean music festival 
at Rainbow Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 His singing has often been described as honey-voiced, but his speaking tone is 
deeper and more resonant. He chatted amiably in heavily accented English about 
his long career, pausing only occasionally to reach for words (French is the 
official language of Zaire, although Rochereau sings most often in Lingala, the 
main local language). 
</P>
<P>
 In a career than spans almost 40 years, Rochereau has released more than 100 
albums in Zaire and has written, "I suppose, 2,200, maybe 2,300 songs. Because 
every year, I make new songs for me and for other musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Rochereau has been a steady presence on the touring 
scene and has even resided here periodically (he lived in Los Angeles for a 
spell in 1989 and is staying now in New Jersey). He is not as well known here, 
however, as Nigeria's King Sunny Ade, Senegal's Youssou N'Dour or Mali's Ali 
Farka Toure. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Rochereau who opened Europe's eyes to urban African pop, with an 
astonishingly successful 1970 run (extended several times) of 26 performances 
in 18 days at the Paris Olympia, followed by a shorter engagement at the London 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big event for Africa," Rochereau said. "It was the first time that a 
black star came straight from Africa with a band to play the Olympia. . . . 
Before me, it was Miriam Makeba, but Miriam Makeba was based here (in the 
United States), and she played with American and Brazilian musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade before his European breakthrough, he was building his stature as 
a Pan-African star with few rivals. After several years of writing, singing and 
touring with Kabasele's seminal African Jazz, he joined the band full time in 
1959 (other members at the time included Dr. Nico, who was Zaire's top 
guitarist until his death in 1985, and Cameroonian saxophone player Manu 
Dibango, still an international star). 
</P>
<P>
 When that band dissolved a few years later, Rochereau and Dr. Nico joined 
forces, but "only for two years," Rochereau said. "Him and me, we were very 
young, and (had) no experience. After two years, we started over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Both started their own bands -- Nico had African Fiesta Sukisa, while 
Rochereau led African Fiesta National, which eventually became Afrisa 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, Rochereau created controversy when he introduced the use of a 
Western-style drum kit (now widely accepted in Afro-pop) and popularized 
elaborate, highly choreographed stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the decade, Rochereau helped pioneer a new sound that continues to 
dominate Zaire and other parts of Central Africa: soukous . Essentially 
speeded-up versions of the older rumba tunes, soukous are long, two-part songs 
with a lilting first section, in which the lead singer, later joined by a 
chorus, sings the main lyrics; then in the second section, or sebene , the beat 
kicks into hyper-drive and the music is propelled by elaborately interlocking 
guitar parts that echo the traditional melodies of the likembe , a Zairian 
thumb piano. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nightclubs of Kinshasa, audiences sit quietly for the first part of the 
song, then get up and dance en masse for the second section. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first part is for lyrics and poetics, words," where the audiences "listen 
to what the musicians are talking about," Rochereau explained. "After that, 
sebene comes, and people move." 
</P>
<P>
 Many soukous musicians left Zaire in the 1970s and '80s to live and record in 
Paris, but Rochereau stayed until 1988. He left on a temporary visa but stayed 
away as political and economic conditions in Zaire worsened. His family is in 
Belgium. Rochereau also owns homes in Paris, Kenya and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Zaire, Rochereau and another enormously popular singer, Franco, had very 
complex relationships with the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, who 
has held power since 1965 and is widely accused of destroying the country while 
enriching himself to the tune of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau and Franco were courted -- and held in deep suspicion -- by Mobutu 
because of their popularity. Any song perceived as critical of the government 
was likely to land them in trouble. Rochereau found himself in and out of favor 
while in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision to leave in 1988 and some of the songs he has recorded in Paris 
since have created further tensions with Mobutu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left to record in Europe . . . but I stayed a long time, and (the) 
government was thinking I had run away. They called me to go back, but I 
refused." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau said he now is barred from returning. Since leaving Zaire in 1988, 
he has been allowed to return only once, a 24-hour visit for the funeral of 
Franco in 1989. Still, he shrugged when asked if it worried him. "As a 
politician, he will change," he said. "He needs me." 
</P>
<P>
 Franco's death (reportedly of AIDS) ended an era in which the two singers 
sparred publicly through their songs. "Sometimes he writes song, he talks bad 
of me. I worry, and I write a song for him," Rochereau said. "Many times he was 
a rival, because he was working to be better than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, the two became friends, but the public enjoyed the rivalry, so it 
was maintained. "One day he told me, 'You know, Tabu Ley, people don't like us 
to be friendly, because you and me we are like plane engines, you on right and 
me on left, and we work to make the aircraft go to the destination.' It was one 
year before he died, he told me that." 
</P>
<P>
 While touring this summer, Rochereau has also been putting the finishing 
touches on an album for Rounder Records, his first recorded in the U.S. Scott 
Billington, who has worked with such New Orleans R & B artists as Irma Thomas, 
Johnny Adams and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, produced the record, which will be 
released in September. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his goals, Billington said in a telephone interview, was to get away 
from the heavily synthesized drum sound of recent recordings Rochereau has made 
for the French label Sonodisc (some of which have been released in the United 
States by Shanachie Records). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get away from tracks that were so computer-oriented. . . . There 
was so much reliance on MIDI sounds, he was losing a bit of the spirit and 
excitement," Billington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochereau, who has a full-time MIDI player in his band, took some persuading. 
"We actually had some pretty heated exchanges," Billington said. "In the end, 
when we finally got down to mixing the record, we had a very good time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew, as I got to know him, to respect him very much," said Billington. 
Working with an African artist was new for him, but "I'm always looking for 
people who have taken a roots-music style and created something new." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Billington and Rochereau agreed that while the new album is designed to reach 
a wider U.S. audience, it remains primarily a work for the singer's compatriots 
in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 One song in particular, Rochereau said, "is for reconciliation for all the 
people in my country. (I want) the people from government, the people in the 
opposition, everyone to sit together to talk good, to push our country to go 
ahead. I think they will be happy." 
</P>
<P>

Long Beach Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. 7 p.m. Grounds open 
at 6 p.m. for dining. $8 to $10, free for kids 12 and under. (310) 439-2119.

ABC GOES ON THE SITCOM DEFENSIVE; TELEVISION: THE NETWORK PUTS TOP-RATED 'HOME 
IMPROVEMENT' IN 'ROSEANNE'S' TIME SLOT TO COUNTER NBC'S PLAN TO MOVE 'FRASIER' 
TO TUESDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of America's most popular TV program, "Home Improvement," and a trio of 
other successful ABC sitcoms, including "Roseanne," may be scratching their 
heads when they look for their favorite shows next month. They won't be where 
they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC announced Tuesday that "Home Improvement" will swap time slots with 
"Roseanne." Beginning with the season premiere on Sept. 20, "Home Improvement" 
will air Tuesdays at 9 p.m., where "Roseanne" has been a bastion for five 
seasons. The season premiere of "Roseanne," meanwhile, will be bumped to the 
next night at 9, in "Home Improvement's" old Wednesday time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grace Under Fire" will continue to follow "Home Improvement" at 9:30 p.m., 
but now on Tuesdays. "Roseanne" will be followed on Wednesdays by "Ellen," last 
spring's sleeper comedy series starring Ellen DeGeneres, which has been running 
on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's plan was hatched as a defensive move to prevent NBC from building a 
powerful night of comedy programming around last season's highest-rated new 
series, "Frasier." NBC made the decision last spring to break out "Frasier," 
which had a choice time slot last season after "Seinfeld" on Thursdays, to 
Tuesday at 9 p.m. this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "(NBC Entertainment President) Warren Littlefield has said that he knew 
'Roseanne' would beat 'Frasier,' and we thought so too. But we think 'Home 
Improvement' will make life unbearable for 'Frasier' on Tuesday at 9 p.m.," 
said Alan Sternfeld, senior vice president of programming for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Improvement" is considered to be a more formidable competitor than 
"Roseanne," which has shown signs of decline in the ratings, because it has not 
yet reached its full growth potential after only three seasons on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want NBC to achieve a comedy block that will ultimately achieve 
parity with us," Sternfeld said. "We're sort of borrowing from the doctrine of 
(Gen. Norman) Schwarzkopf: If you're interested in accomplishing something, use 
overwhelming force." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, in a terse statement Tuesday, said: "We think that it's a very 
interesting move. It certainly shows that ABC has tremendous respect for 
'Frasier,' as do audiences. We believe that 'Frasier' will perform well, 
wherever it is on our schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's decision met with mixed response at "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is this: Obviously we take great pride in having the No. 1 show on 
television," said a perturbed Matt Williams, one of the show's creators and 
executive producers. "With this move to Tuesday night against 'Frasier,' a 
different night with different competition, it's highly unlikely that we're 
going to be No. 1 again. How much the audience is divided will determine where 
we fall in the Top 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Series star Tim Allen expressed sympathy for viewers. "Personally, on one 
level, I used to hate it when shows moved around. And as a TV viewer from way 
back, I don't like it when two good shows are on at the same time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a professional level, Allen noted, "I love the fact that ABC has 
created a night for us. That's the best compliment ABC has ever given us." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Schulman, president of the New York advertising firm, Paul Schulman Co., 
predicted that if NBC leaves "Frasier" to fight it out with "Home Improvement," 
"Frasier" will drop out of the Top 20.

'GODFATHER OF AFRICAN SOUL' ON U.S. SAFARI; POP MUSIC: CAMEROON'S MANU DIBANGO 
IS ON HIS FIRST MAJOR TOUR HERE IN YEARS TO PROMOTE 'WAKAFRIKA,' WHICH 
REINTERPRETS AFRO-POP SONGS, INCLUDING HIS 'SOUL MAKOSSA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One by one and in small groups, nearly a dozen admirers approached the small 
table at Ngone, a colorful Senegalese oasis in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 They all came to pay their respects to the Godfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men waved at him and smiled from a table across the room. Another man 
introduced himself and brought with him two young women who wore flowing yellow 
and green African print dresses and briefly sang for him. Even the restaurant's 
maitre d' playfully chided the Godfather for not staying long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 With his eyes hidden by tinted, golden-brown, horn-rimmed glasses, Manu 
Dibango -- the 60-year-old Cameroonian saxophonist, bandleader and composer who 
is known to millions of Africans and Europeans as "the Godfather of African 
Soul" -- cheerfully conversed with his fans. He spoke in a rich, raspy French, 
often throwing back his head and heartily laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, bald-headed singer -- whose imposing appearance alone is enough to 
justify his nickname -- is currently on his first major American tour in 
several years, promoting his latest album, "Wakafrika." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a musical safari," Dibango said of "Wakafrika," between drags on a 
cigarette and sips of black coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a trip from Dakar to Cape Town," he continued, pointing to a 
photograph on the back of his CD of a West African vehicle called a bush taxi. 
"I'm the driver. I picked up Salif Keita in Mali, Toure Kunda in Senegal, 
Angelique Kidjo in Benin and Ladysmith Black Mambazo in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other African stars, including Youssou N'Dour and King Sunny Ade, 
are joined by European luminaries Peter Gabriel and Sinead O'Connor as guests 
on the album's reinterpretations of a baker's dozen of Afro-pop or 
African-influenced songs, including Dibango's own 1973 breakthrough, "Soul 
Makossa." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dibango and Senegalese producer George Acogny, "Wakafrika" was a dream 
project that took two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Can we put together the most popular African artists and combine 
on one project?' " Dibango said. "I asked them if they liked the spirit of the 
record. I told them they must trust me and I would respect them. I heard the 
songs and I wanted to take them to new levels. You have to let your imagination 
travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the nearly two dozen albums Dibango has recorded, the new "Wakafrika" 
combines diverse musical elements and Afrocentric themes. It follows an ideal 
that Dibango has pursued since he was a philosophy student in Paris in 1960, 
where he was swept up simultaneously by the spirit of African independence and 
by American jazz. Dibango said the album's title speaks to the dream of 
pan-African unity in both music and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 " Waka is a pidgin word in Cameroon which means wake up or walk ," Dibango 
said. "It's the notion of motion."  
</P>
<P>
 The album's rich and varying tapestries of African musical styles stem 
directly from "Soul Makossa." But unless that tune's chant 
mama-ko-mama-sa-mama-makossa jogs your memory, you may not remember it as the 
groundbreaking 1973 American pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The tune "was a bridge connecting America with the motherland in the early 
'70s, during the 'black is beautiful' period," Dibango said.  
</P>
<P>
 That hit, from his debut album, "O bosso," opened the door to Dibango's 1973 
shows at New York's Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden, attended by 
nearly 100,000 fans in total. 
</P>
<P>
 After those shows, Dibango's radio airplay waned in this country. But his 
polyrhythmic fusion of traditional West African melodies, jazz, classical, 
funk, reggae and hip-hop established him as a pop music icon in Africa and 
Europe for the past 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His weekly, hourlong French TV show, "Salut Manu," showcased Dibango's music 
and gave him the opportunity to introduce viewers to young African guest 
players, which further solidified his "Godfather" image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always interested in what young musicians are doing," Dibango said, 
adding with a laugh, "You need to get young blood, so in that way I was like a 
vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dibango plays a benefit for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in 
Orange tonight, with Hugh Masekela and Angelique Kidjo, at the House of Blues, 
8430 Sunset Blvd. 7:30 p.m. $30. (213) 650-1451. Dibango also plays Thursday at 
the Santa Monica Pier, 7:30 p.m. Free. (310) 458-8900.

RUNNING HIS OWN SHOW; 'GONZO COUNTRY' PERFORMER JERRY JEFF WALKER FINDS GREAT 
REWARDS IN TAKING CONTROL OF HIS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll almost never see an interview with a musician over 40 in which, at some 
point, the subject doesn't take a few well-aimed shots at the music industry's 
powers-that-be. There seems to be a pervading sense of victimization, impotence 
and, ultimately, resignation to some dark conspiracy against veteran recording 
artists who, fairly or not, feel exploited and abused by the people behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jeff Walker has been among the most vocal critics of the bigwigs on 
music row. "The only way to make any money these days," he said in 1991, "is to 
earn enough that, after they get done (messing with) you, there's still a 
little bit left over." But instead of just bemoaning his circumstances, Walker, 
at 52, has taken an old axiom to heart: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want something done right, do it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The grizzled singer/songwriter -- who plays tonight at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano -- has taken the reins of his own career in hand, instead of 
yielding them to people he doesn't trust. Along with his wife, Susan, he has 
established Tried and True Music to control virtually every aspect of his 
business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We own our own airplane, we're our own travel agent, our own booking agent, 
our own record company, our own PR firm, our own accounting firm, our own 
publishing firm," Walker said Monday from his home office in Austin, Tex. 
"We're a little million-dollar cottage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a lot of percentages back to us that we can work with, and we're 
busy all the time. You have to figure out ways to do things on your own. I do 
my own thing, and I don't pay much attention to what anyone else is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 He has released five albums on the Tried and True label, most recently "Viva 
Luckenbach" a few months ago. "The album is real Texas-y," he drawled. "It 
turned out real good; I'm real happy with it. There's a song on there called 
'Keep Texas Beautiful' that's about changing times. They say in a few years, 
Texas will be right next to California in terms of its population. I don't know 
how many (doggone) people there are in this world, but it looks like they're 
all gonna be down here soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker started out on the New York folk scene in the '60s and made his first 
real dent when the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band scored a Top 10 hit with his "Mr. 
Bojangles" in 1970. He has released 25 albums that have sold in relatively 
small but steady quantities to his devoted, sometimes near-obsessive fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking over our own business and running it ourselves has tied us even more 
to our fans," he noted. "We've got more than 40,000 names on our mail-out 
newsletter, so the fans pick up on (concert) dates way in advance. The clubs 
will call and say, 'I've already sold 100 tickets and I haven't even advertised 
yet.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Our audience is really upbeat," he added. "Likes to have a good time. They're 
not introverted or shy." 
</P>
<P>
 That's something of an understatement: Walker's fans tend to be a boozy, 
sometimes rowdy lot of fun-seekers, following the lead of their notorious idol. 
There is a rare and special closeness between the man and the fans, a 
relationship he seals by actually throwing parties for his roving band of 
admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fan outings where we go to New Orleans for a weekend. Then we go to 
Belize for a couple weeks every January and take over a resort. We go 
snorkeling, scuba diving, eat lots of fish, get drunk, sleep under the stars

 Walker's music is hard to define. Such songs as "Up Against the Wall, Redneck 
Mother" and "L.A. Freeway" blend strains of honky-tonk, folk and rock in ways 
that blur categorical lines. So, in keeping with his do-it-ourselves credo, 
Walker and his fans have come up with a term of their own to describe it: 
"Gonzo Country." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gonzo means taking an unknown thing to an unknown place for a known purpose," 
he explained, laughing. "But sometimes we're lost in an unknown place for no 
known purpose."

 FEARSOME TWOSOME: A 48-member, all-time National Football League team was 
announced Tuesday, and guess how many Los Angeles Rams players were on the 
team. Nobody on offense, but Deacon Jones and Merlin Olsen, part of the 
Fearsome Foursome defense of the 1960s Rams, made the defensive team (C10). The 
other two on that "Foursome"? Lamar Lundy and Roosevelt Grier. . . . The 
all-time team was compiled by a committee of former players, media types and 
NFL officials. And if you're wondering -- yes, O.J. Simpson is on the list too.

 HOT BOX OFFICE: If you missed Barbra Streisand at the Pond in Anaheim last 
month, if you missed her Home Box Office special Sunday night taped from her 
final stop at The Pond, then here's what you missed: HBO says it was the 
highest-rated special in its history, drawing an estimated 11.2 million people, 
according to figures supplied by the Nielsen ratings. . . . You can still share 
in the aura: A concert album from the Streisand tour is in the works, and maybe 
a video.

 IF THE NAME FITS: The Orange County Bar Foundation has set up a new award to 
recognize people who have contributed greatly to its community-service 
programs. It's named after former foundation president Robert (Sam) Barnes. 
This year's first winner? Robert (Sam) Barnes. . . . The Irvine attorney is 
also past president of the county bar. He was credited when given the award 
with "single-handedly leading the Bar Foundation from struggling grass roots to 
a successful nonprofit organization."

 ARMED & ORGANIZED: Two years ago, Aliso Viejo businesswoman Audrey Prosser was 
frustrated by lobbying in Washington for AIDS research and seeing money snipped 
from its budget. She's heading back soon to fight for a gender-equity bill. But 
this time she's better armed. She's taking along a local contingent from Women 
in Business. . . . "This time I know a little more about how the process 
works," she says. "You need support to win anything in Washington."

 CLEAN NEEDLES: The L. A. City Council wants to prevent police interference 
with activists who give clean needles to drug addicts (B1), but such "needle 
exchanges" have been taking place in the Valley for at least three years. . . . 
Clean Needles Now, an anti-AIDS group, estimates that it has distributed 50,000 
needles to Valley addicts.

 FREEWAY DELAY: Plans to complete repairs on the quake-damaged Simi Valley 
Freeway in Granada Hills have hit a roadblock. Instead of completion originally 
set for next week, the freeway won't be finished until mid-September. . . . 
But, unlike the efforts to rebuild the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways, 
the $9.6-million project carries no bonus or penalty for early or late 
completion (B1).

 TEEN TENNIS: The Little League boys aren't the only Northridge athletes making 
big news. Also serving notice is Meilen Tu (above), 16, who was awarded a 
wild-card spot for next week's U. S. Open. . . . Tu, who may play Steffi Graf, 
has no female tennis idols. In fact, she practices almost exclusively with men, 
and admires the work ethic of Jim Courier and the footwork of Michael Chang 
(C6).

 DORM RADIO: On the air, and up in the air. That's the current status of 
KCSN-FM (88.5), the radio station at Cal State Northridge. Displaced by the 
quake, KCSN operates from a dorm, but could be moved to another spot at any 
time. . . . The good news is programming has almost reached pre-quake levels. 
"Most of us have learned to accept things here," said Jared Kliger, program 
director.

 HOLY ROBBERY! This just in from Burbank: Someone has stolen 81 storyboards for 
an upcoming "Batman" movie. . . . Storyboards -- drawings outlining scenes in 
the film -- were ripped off from a locked room at Warner Bros. studios (B4). 
There was no early word on suspects. . . . But doesn't this sound like the work 
of the Riddler? How else could he beat the Caped Crusaders? Michael Arkush and

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; CELEBRATING DECADES OF WEDDED BLISS; COUNTY FAIR: COUPLES 
RENEW LONG-AGO WEDDING VOWS AS ANNUAL BLESSING OF MARRIAGE KICKS OFF SENIOR 
DAY.

 Mary Cimino of Simi Valley recalls those days in wartime Washington as if they 
were yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working in the Pentagon; he was in the Air Force," said Cimino, 75, 
flamboyantly colorful at the Ventura County Fair on Tuesday in a red top and 
brightly patterned patchwork skirt. "I was from Rhode Island; he was from 
Pennsylvania." 
</P>
<P>
 Cimino smiled at her solemn-faced husband of 52 years, John, 72, seated beside 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Air Force had a dance, and he came up and asked me to dance," she said. 
"How about that? Two and a half months later, we were married." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Mary Cimino joined about 15 other couples Tuesday at a hay-strewn 
lawn where they celebrated their long-ago wedding vows. The 11th Annual 
Blessing of Marriage Ceremony kicked off the fair's Senior Day, featuring 
special events geared to the elderly population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today you are blessed," Minister Charlie MacLaren of Ventura's Calvary 
Assembly told the couples, "to have the mother of your children, the bride of 
your youth, seated beside you, and you can turn to them and say, 'I love you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You are a great blessing and an example that I hope will stand for younger 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the five-minute blessing from MacLaren, the couples received 
white carnation corsages, bone-colored, marriage-blessing certificates, and 
big, ruffly blue ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the Harrises. Since Glenn and Ruby Harris of Ventura have been 
married 72 years -- longer than anyone else participating in the ceremony -- 
MacLaren handed them a big, ruffly ribbon the color of rainbow sherbet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect every day to be perfect," is Ruby Harris' advice on marital 
longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love one day at a time, and don't try and rush it," Ruby, 90, continued. 
"Some days are good, some are bad."  
</P>
<P>
 The Harrises met in grammar school, dated throughout high school and married 
after Glenn dropped out of college because he didn't want to be without his 
sweetheart any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 He put the situation to Ruby plain and simple one week when he and his 
roommate, Johnny, were home on break from school. "He said, 'I want to get 
married before the weekend because Johnny has to go back to Stanford,' " Ruby 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So they did. And Johnny drove back north alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn later went into ranching in what is now the California community of 
Fallbrook and Ruby kept house and watched the children. The Harrises have one 
son and one daughter, 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get married young so we could enjoy the children," Ruby said. "I 
never dreamed we would enjoy the great-grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's Senior Day also included a senior dance contest and a senior queen 
beauty pageant. Aunnie Walker, 80, of Ventura won the crown of senior fair 
queen after a 20-minute quiz in which participants had to reveal their favorite 
color and admit where they would go if they could go anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to pieces," Walker said, clutching a bouquet of roses and 
sporting a red-felt-and-gold-cardboard crown atop her head. "My husband just 
dared me to do this a little while ago. I'm really excited." 
</P>
<P>
 The fairgrounds filled with white-haired visitors Tuesday as seniors enjoyed 
free admission and a whole day with activities planned especially for them.  
</P>
<P>
 For the Ciminos, it was a time to reflect on five decades together as they 
enjoyed gooey foods and live music. 
</P>
<P>
 They met at that Air Force Easter dance, Mary recalled, because "I had a 
beautiful floral dress on and it caught his eye." 
</P>
<P>
 John recalls the night a bit differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was sitting there all alone, and I was all alone," he said. "So I asked 
her to dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, they ended up together. And they still go dancing every Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was going to see him again (after the dance)," Mary said. 
"You know, during the wartime, soldiers and all." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed, remembering. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the next morning, he was knocking at my door."

COLLEGE HAS A GYM AFTER 19-YEAR WAIT; OXNARD: IT'S HOPED THE COMPLEX WILL 
PROPEL THE INSTITUTION TO LEVEL OF SERVICES OF ITS SISTER CAMPUSES.

<P>
 There are no screaming fans among the 1,500 bleacher seats, no landscaping 
covering the patches of bare ground surrounding the building. The hands of the 
wall clocks are frozen at 7 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of those details matter to Oxnard College students and officials, who 
this week christened their new gymnasium with basketball scrimmages, dance 
practices and racquetball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the second person hired in the (physical education) department here," 
sports coordinator Juan Hernandez said, showing off the new facility. "I've 
been waiting 20 years for this." 
</P>
<P>
 As students return to Oxnard College this week after summer hiatus, they are 
being welcomed to explore the $5.2-million complex, which features the latest 
in sports education facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a project years in the making and one that college officials hope will 
help propel Ventura County's smallest community college to a level of services 
equal to those of its sister campuses in Ventura and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the most exciting things that's happened on campus probably since 
it opened," said Trustee Pete E. Tafoya, who represents south Oxnard on the 
college district governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the kind of community we have and the shortage of recreational 
facilities in Oxnard, it will really have an impact," Tafoya said. "It's going 
to be a major draw for the local students who go to Moorpark or Ventura to play 
basketball or something else because they think (those campuses) have better 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The 56,000-square-foot building on the northeast side of the South Rose Avenue 
campus offers a championship-caliber basketball court, indoor volleyball, a 
2,500-square-foot dance studio, four racquetball courts, weight room, training 
room and a handful of health-science classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in 19 years, we'll be able to host our own basketball 
games," Oxnard College President Elise Schneider said. "We had been holding our 
games at Santa Clara," a private high school several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an arrangement with the city of Oxnard, the gym will be available for 
public use on weekends, Schneider said. The college already has marketed 
classrooms and meeting space for rent by various community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities," Schneider said. "It will 
generate a significant amount of income." 
</P>
<P>
 Students still signing up for classes Tuesday welcomed the new gymnasium as a 
much-needed venue for the college's physical education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty nice," said Sandra Martinez, a 27-year-old international business 
major. "You can tell they put a lot of time, money and effort into building 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old freshman David Camarena said he plans to make good use of 
the 28,000-square-foot hardwood court. "It looks sweet," he said. "I like the 
flooring especially, and the weights." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College, which occupies 118 mostly vacant acres in south Oxnard, opened 
in 1975. Yet it remains the least completed of the three campuses that make up 
the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya has complained for years that Oxnard College, with roughly half as many 
students as the Moorpark and Ventura campuses, typically has been overlooked in 
yearly spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are with the largest community in the county and we have the smallest 
facility of them all," he said. "We need to really work on completing our 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said passage in 1978 of the tax-cutting Proposition 13 has prevented 
the state from coming up with money to complete master building plans for 
Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here in July, 1989, I couldn't believe there was a community 
college that didn't have a P.E. facility," she said. "But this is going to make 
a huge difference." 
</P>
<P>
 As basketball and other classes began inside the gym this week, workers 
Tuesday were applying the finishing touches to the beige, sky-lit building. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews Tuesday were applying the last coat of paint to the 
interior of the lobby and some final wiring was needed to hook up the hanging 
clocks. Landscaping is scheduled to be completed later this term. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of satisfaction to see it built from the ground 
up," said Dave Abraham, campus director of maintenance and operations. "We've 
been working from the first day, to the day we opened the doors."

SCIENTISTS BLAME QUAKE DUST FOR VALLEY FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cloud of dust rising from the Santa Susana Mountains after the Jan. 17 
earthquake very likely brought on the unprecedented outbreak of valley fever 
that plagued Simi Valley and much of eastern Ventura County this spring, 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months of interviews and analysis, scientists at the Centers for 
Disease Control have concluded that residents caught in the dust cloud were 
most likely to contract the flu-like ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 203 cases of valley fever diagnosed among Ventura County residents 
in the weeks after the quake. That contrasts with 52 cases for all of 1993. One 
71-year-old Simi Valley man died in this year's outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe that disease-bearing spores were stirred up in landslides 
caused by the quake and its aftershocks, then swept with the wind across the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spores are often in the ground, but they're pretty much just sitting 
there," explained Richard Spiegel, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. 
"Basically from all the ground shaking, that unleashed significantly more dust 
than you might normally have." 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC team will declare the Simi Valley outbreak the first known to be 
related to an earthquake when it presents conclusions at a Stanford University 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But one local health official is disputing the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 'Piddle paddle," said Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for 
Los Angeles County. "I have to tell you I disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley, hardest hit by the magnitude 6.8 quake, had little 
change in its rate of disease, she said. Only 46 cases have been reported this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease, a fungal infection known to scientists as coccidioidomycosis, 
manifests no real symptoms in about 60% of cases. Other victims experience 
flu-like exhaustion, coughing, even high fevers and pneumonia. Older people are 
usually more severely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin believes that Ventura and the CDC overreacted to the valley fever 
scare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called everything with a positive lab test for antibodies a case of 
valley fever," she said. She said tests would have been positive if a patient 
had contracted the illness any time in the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials did not count a case as valley fever until 
further tests or active symptoms confirmed the disease, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC researchers defended their findings, saying all of the Ventura County 
cases were confirmed with blood tests. The direction of the wind or the amount 
of fungus found in paved-over San Fernando Valley could account for the low 
incidence there, said Eileen Schneider, a CDC epidemiologist from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of the Valley did not have 
the same landslide activity that occurred in the Santa Susana range near Simi 
Valley. While the northern edge of the Valley also borders the Santa Susanas, 
winds were blowing toward Simi Valley after the quake, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake and each of its aftershocks brought up a cloud of ocher dust from 
the canyons around Simi Valley. The highest concentrations of valley fever 
cases lay in the neighborhoods near the base of the mountains north of the 
city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A map hanging in Ventura County's Public Health Services Department shows 
graphically how valley fever spores may have spread. Dozens of push pins are 
clustered in the Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The pins fan out on a southwest course, with several cases in Thousand Oaks, 
and thin out farther from the mountains on the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura and CDC officials believed from the start that the earthquake had 
kicked off the valley fever outbreak, but conducted tests this spring aimed at 
proving their theory. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked valley fever victims if they had been in a dust cloud, and more 
than a third responded that they had. 
</P>
<P>
 They tested a random sample of the Simi Valley population for overall exposure 
to the fungus causing valley fever and found fewer than 6% had been exposed. 
They tracked the cases and found that the incidence of the disease returned to 
normal levels about two months after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they studied the age, race and other demographic factors for victims 
and found nothing to suggest another reason for the outbreak, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes it name from the San Joaquin Valley, where it is most 
commonly found. In recent years, Kern County has been plagued with thousands of 
cases of the ailment, particularly among farm workers.

BOARD PITCHES LOCAL CLEAN-AIR PLAN TO EPA; POLLUTION: SUPERVISORS WILL REQUEST 
MANY PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL PROPOSAL BE REPLACED WITH THOSE DRAFTED BY COUNTY 
BUSINESS LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Backing an anti-smog plan drafted by business leaders, Ventura County 
supervisors Tuesday urged federal regulators to adopt an alternative proposal 
that supporters say will meet health standards without undue harm to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted unanimously to request that the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency replace many provisions of its own clean-air plan with those 
written by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn and the Council on 
Economic Vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The local plan would relieve businesses of a proposed EPA regulation requiring 
annual reductions in emissions and would allow companies to get credit for 
previous reductions in smog. 
</P>
<P>
 As written, the local plan also shifts some of the burden of reducing 
emissions from stationary sources of pollution to cars and other mobile 
sources. It includes a controversial proposal that would charge motorists an 
annual fee based on how much they drive and how much their vehicles pollute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original (EPA) plan would be prohibitive for business," said Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee, who urged the board to adopt the alternative plan. "The (local) 
plan includes other sources like motor vehicles and doesn't place the entire 
burden on the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 In separate action, the county's Air Pollution Control Board, which includes 
the five county supervisors as well as city representatives, endorsed its 
staff's recommendations that the EPA adopt many of the measures in the local 
anti-smog plan. County pollution control staff members helped develop the local 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Air Pollution Control Board member dissented, arguing that the board 
should oppose the EPA air cleanup plan and propose no alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask the board to go on record with Fillmore and Camarillo and oppose the 
entire federal implementation plan to try to get something we can live with," 
said Michael McMahan, a Fillmore city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA, which is under court order to clean up the county's air, is scheduled 
to adopt a final air cleanup plan Feb. 14. The federal Clean Air Act forced the 
federal government to step in when the county failed to meet federal clean air 
health standards on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan, once adopted, will also apply to the Sacramento and Los 
Angeles regions, which have also been designated to have "severe" air quality 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those problems could be curtailed with more stringent controls on 
private vehicles, said county Air Pollution Control Officer Richard Baldwin. In 
his comments to the EPA, Baldwin asked the federal government to require a 
strict new smog-check program that would centralize all check stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin also said the EPA correctly included controls on emissions from 
pesticides. But he urged the federal government to allow the state time to 
develop its own regulation based on complete information from the pesticide 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Frost, manager of the Oxnard Pest Control Assn., questioned the economic 
effects of pesticide controls on the agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA doesn't have a clue of what this will cost" the industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Caldwell, executive director of the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and 
Business, urged the Air Pollution Control Board to reject both the EPA and the 
local plan, contending that lobbying in Washington and congressional action 
could change the U.S. Clean Air Act, making the cleanup plan moot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not need the federal government to interfere in California," Caldwell 
said. "We either need one nationwide federal implementation plan or none." 
</P>
<P>
 But Russ Baggerly, a former aide to Supervisor Maria VanderKolk and longtime 
area activist, urged the board to adopt the alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principle here is to protect the health, safety and welfare of every man, 
woman and child of Ventura County from the devastating effects of air 
pollution," he said. The local alternative "provides a chance for good air 
quality and economic vitality.

COUNTY IN A STATE OF FLUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Ventura County continues to lose residents to other states, it remains a 
favored place to live for many Californians, according to a state report. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest figures from the Department of Motor Vehicles show a net migration 
of 3,091 licensed drivers into Ventura County from the state's other 57 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the drivers relocating here are from neighboring counties, such as Los 
Angeles, Santa Barbara and Orange. By far the largest number of arrivals were 
from Los Angeles, which sent a net 5,949 licensed drivers to Ventura County for 
the year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those are people displaced or frightened away by January's strong 
earthquake, centered in the San Fernando Valley, said Carolyn Leavens, 
president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, Ventura County is an attractive option because they can remain close 
to jobs and family in Southern California, Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awfully nice place to live," Leavens said. "The beaches, the 
mountains and climate. In fact, we're afraid to say it too loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for a fifth straight year, more licensed drivers left Ventura County 
for other states than moved here, according to the DMV report. State figures 
show that 7,107 out-of-state residents moved here, but that 11,265 left--a net 
loss of 4,248 drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens attributes such emigration to a sluggish state and local economy and 
strict regulations that frighten away business. Often, those leaving are 
"tremendously high-quality people" with experience in aerospace and 
military-related industries, but who have lost their jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are leaving were employed by large companies that moved out of 
state," Leavens said. "The reason is pretty simple. We have some of the 
toughest permitting and regulatory processes in the state and in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's unemployment rate was 9.3% in July, the highest it has been 
since January. But economists believe the rise reflects a seasonal adjustment 
due to a drop in agricultural jobs and schools' summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the county's economy is slowly improving, according to a forecast 
prepared by the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Building permits and construction jobs are climbing, key indicators of a 
growing economy. Retail sales dollars are growing in many Ventura County 
cities, and home sales have increased countywide, according to the most recent 
UC Santa Barbara report. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wood, a demographer for the county of Ventura, said people are moving 
here from other California counties because Ventura County's economy is in 
better shape than the ones they left. But they also are drawn by the county's 
aesthetic appeal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to Los Angeles County, we definitely have a lot more open spaces," 
Wood said. The relatively small population in Ventura County compared with 
other Southern California counties also draws people, Wood said. Ventura County 
has about 700,000 residents, while Los Angeles County alone has more than 9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people settle into the various cities in this county, they feel they are 
a part of that community," Wood said. "I don't think they have that feeling in 
Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, however, disputed Leavens' contention that Los Angeles residents are 
fleeing in the aftermath of January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're trying to get away from earthquakes, they haven't moved far 
enough," Wood said. "We did have considerable damage in this county," he said, 
referring to homes and businesses lost in hard-hit Fillmore and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Orange counties sent more new drivers 
to this county than left. But those totals, 53 and 77 respectively, were far 
lower than the exodus from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV report does not indicate to which states Ventura County residents are 
moving. But in past years, the most popular destinations have been neighboring 
western states, particularly Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Arizona.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; INJURED STUDENT FILES CLAIM AGAINST 
DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westlake High School student who was involved in an off-campus brawl in 
February has filed a claim against the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
for medical and other expenses stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Simmons, who will be a senior at Westlake High this year, was beaten 
with a wooden board and other objects during a Feb. 3 fight at North Ranch Park 
that left two students hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons and his family are seeking compensation from the school district for 
his medical treatment, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school officials would not comment on the details or amount of the 
claim, they have recommended that the school board reject it. Board members 
will vote on the matter at their meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court testimony, the brawl occurred after Simmons and 16-year-old 
James Lee agreed to meet at the park for a fistfight to settle an ongoing 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the violence began when Lee arrived with several carloads of older 
youths, one of whom opened fire on friends of Simmons who had gathered to watch 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and three other youths have been charged with a variety of crimes, 
including assault with a deadly weapon. In April, the four boys were ordered to 
stand trial as adult co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, of Thousand Oaks, has been a fugitive since April 27, when he failed to 
appear for arraignment. Authorities believe that he may have fled to his native 
Taiwan. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAN MAY CUSHION BLOW OF BUDGET CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Terry believes he's discovered a way to cushion the blows of school 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from his experience as an advertising specialist, the 45-year-old 
Woodland Hills minister and father of three has founded a program called Save 
Our Schools as a vehicle to donate thousands of bleacher cushions to area high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry launched the not-for-profit program last year, donating 1,000 cushions 
to each of three Ventura County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Save Our Schools will donate 1,000 cushions each to 13 schools, 
including Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, Westlake, Royal, Simi Valley and Oak 
Park high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The cushions, emblazoned with each school's name and logo on one side and 
local advertisements on the other, are sold by booster clubs to generate 
much-needed funds for school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you turn around, the budget is being cut," Terry said. "The 
programs I enjoyed when I was in high school are just not there for students 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Safe works in the athletic department at Thousand Oaks High School, 
which received 1,000 cushions from Save Our Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the school raised about $2,000 selling the cushions to students and 
parents last year. But this year, she expects sales to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have experience, it will be more successful," Safe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe said the cushions arrived too late in the year for football season, and 
about 675 were left at the end of the year. At graduation, cheerleaders sold 
all of them for $1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High School boosters gave the cushions to new members of the 
football booster club as an incentive to join last year, club President Dennis 
Turville said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used them as a kind of promotional item and we're going to push them again 
this year," he said. The club also sold the cushions for $2 apiece during 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry said the project needs the cooperation of parents, community members and 
local businesses in order to work. Terry is encouraging the businesses that 
advertise on the cushions to display stickers in their windows to show their 
support for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising fees pay for the cost of the cushions as well as the printing, 
Terry said. About 50 cents per cushion is reinvested in the program to cover 
handling and processing fees. SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 Police were searching Tuesday for two men who robbed employees of an Oxnard 
clothing store at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, a man approached two Fashion Bug employees in the 
store's parking lot on Rose Avenue about 9 a.m. Monday and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
 The two employees, who were on their way to a bank to deposit store receipts, 
told police that the man pointed a gun at one of them and demanded the bag, 
which contained $1,154, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After grabbing the bag, the man fled to a waiting vehicle and was driven away 
by a second man with a rifle, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police later found the vehicle abandoned at Indiana Avenue in Oxnard. The 
vehicle had been reported stolen. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CALABASAS; APPEAL CONSIDERED ON ROAD-WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council is expected to vote tonight whether to appeal a 
judge's decision to allow widening of Thousand Oaks Boulevard to accommodate 
the Ahmanson Ranch housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Charles Cate said the city attorney would be consulted on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will announce its decision after the closed session, which will be 
attended by City Atty. Casey Vose, Cate said. The council meets at 7:30 p.m. at 
City Hall, 26135 Mureau Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 residences, two golf courses and 
400,000 square feet of commercial space in the hills southeast of Simi Valley 
on the border of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson sued Calabasas after the city refused to act on the developer's 
request to widen from two to four lanes a quarter-mile section of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. The city has argued that a wider road would add thousands of cars 
and disrupt traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was issued Aug. 8 by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like the city to process the application. We think it's a valid 
request, and the court has ruled that it's a valid request, and we hope they 
would process it," Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson Land Co., said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas has already appealed another Superior Court ruling, which concluded 
the project's developers have done everything possible to minimize the impact 
of the project on the environment and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 That court decision came after Calabasas and eight other parties, including 
the city and county of Los Angeles, challenged the validity of an environmental 
impact review of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't agree with the decision, and we still think our original points are 
correct," Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits have stalled the controversial development, which was approved by 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors more than two years ago. FRANK MANNING

 A Port Hueneme task force today is scheduled to discuss the future of Port 
Hueneme's Naval Civil Engineer Laboratory, which will be closed in April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-member task force, which includes city officials, residents and 
government representatives, plans to explore how the city and the U.S. Navy 
should use the 33-acre site once the lab is closed, said Tom Figg, Port Hueneme 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities for the site include a city park and a homeless shelter, 
Figg said. This is the second of a series of meetings the task force plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which is open to the public, will take place at 7 p.m. at the 
Orvene S. Carpenter Community Center. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNTY TELLS FARM TO CONTROL ODOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials may require a Camarillo-area farming operation to move 
several compost heaps from a 60-acre farm unless the company can control the 
strong odor from the compost before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfield housing tract residents, whose homes are near the 300-foot-long 
compost piles at Conejo Ranch, have complained that the piles have created an 
overwhelming stench and have attracted thousands of flies. The farm is situated 
north of the Ventura Freeway at the base of the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awful," said Helen Kosmala, a Fairfield resident and a member of the 
housing community's board of directors. "Last night, I couldn't get to sleep at 
all, it smelled so bad. We tried to have a birthday party outdoors on Saturday 
and we were covered with flies. It was pretty gross." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Underwood, part owner of Conejo Ranch, said his company has brought in 
about 15 tons of shredded paper, which will be used to stabilize the 
biochemical mix in the compost. The material, which is used by the farm as a 
natural fertilizer, is made up of decomposed avocados, lemons, various kinds of 
vegetables and lawn clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping the paper will work," Underwood said. "We've tried covering the 
piles with plastic, but that didn't seem to work. We want to fix this problem. 
We don't want to be bad neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence Gilday, manager of the solid waste department of the county's 
Environmental Health Division, said his department issued Conejo Ranch's 
owners, Underwood Ranches, an order early last week to fix the odor problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying very hard to alleviate the problem," Gilday said. "But if 
they can't fix it, we may have to order them to relocate the (compost) piles." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilday said his department will give Underwood until the end of this week 
before issuing orders to the farmer to remove the offending compost piles. J.E.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MANAGER QUITS SYMPHONY POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karine Beesley, executive director of the financially troubled Ventura County 
Symphony, announced her resignation Tuesday, saying she has neared the point of 
job burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running an organization this size is just a stressful job and I've been here 
for a long time," she said. "I just have lost a little bit of energy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Beesley, 37, took over as the orchestra's manager in 1987 when the group's 
annual budget was $450,000. The budget has since expanded to $700,000 a year, 
outpacing ticket sales and fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony officials estimate the orchestra will close out the 1993-94 fiscal 
year with an $85,000 deficit, the largest in the group's 31-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she described her position with the orchestra as "a happy marriage 
for the most part," Beesley said the deficit and the strain of ongoing 
negotiations with the musicians union were factors in her decision to resign, 
effective Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors included the recent flap over the symphony's Duck Race 
fund-raiser, a wage freeze on her $38,900 annual salary, and the perennial 
scarcity of arts dollars in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been disheartening living here and seeing the lack of that kind 
of support for arts organizations, unlike in Santa Barbara, which has 
tremendous municipal and county support," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Ventura County district attorney's office advised symphony 
leaders that the group was illegally publicizing its Duck Race fund-raiser as a 
lottery. After being postponed for two months, the event earlier this month 
netted about $6,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to joining the symphony, Beesley served as executive director of the 
Ventura Arts Council, worked for the Ojai Festival and earned a master's degree 
in arts administration from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 After resigning, Beesley said she plans to work as a consultant for smaller 
orchestras throughout Southern California, and regional arts groups. JULIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW FIRE CHIEF GETS WELCOME

<TEXT>
<P>
 With one day on the job under his belt, Ventura County Fire Chief James E. 
Sewell was welcomed and introduced Tuesday by county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell, 45, came to Ventura County after 24 years with the San Diego Fire 
Department.He takes over the county's 443-member fire district from Chief 
George Lund, who retired in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund left the department after supervisors declined his request for funding 
from Proposition 172. An audit the previous October had criticized the 
department as being too top heavy and too free with overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell was chosen Monday from a pool of 17 candidates. Sewell said Tuesday 
that he is delighted to be taking over the post.

</P>
<P>
 Sewell said he and his wife, Katherine, have moved to Ventura. 
</P>

Department. He also has worked as a fire marshal for the Fire Prevention 
Bureau, battalion chief, investigator, engineer, inspector and firefighter.

degree in business administration. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SERVICE UNION BACKS TALLMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The union that represents non-teaching employees of the Ventura County 
Community College District has voted to endorse a former administrator in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Service Employees International Union, Local No. 535, which 
represents about 350 college district secretaries, technicians and other 
workers, have endorsed John Tallman in his campaign for the Area 1 seat on the 
governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Herrmann, the Ventura College lab technician who serves as union vice 
president on the campus, said Tallman has a reputation for supporting 
classified employees within the three-campus college district. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in favor of an employee's right to decide for an agency shop, he's 
against the privatization of public education and he supports fiscal 
accountability," Herrmann said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman is a former college district administrator who retired last year after 
more than 20 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 He is challenging appointed incumbent Karen Boone and Ventura businessman Jim 
Hibbs on the Nov. 8 ballot for the Area 1 seat on the board. JEFF McDONALD

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA ENDOWMENT FUND SURPASSES $6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza endowment fund increased by $1 million last month, 
boosting the performing arts center's campaign total to $6,012,114, officials 
with the Alliance for the Arts announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Dick Johnson, alliance executive director."We've never 
made so much in such a short amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson attributed the unprecedented increase to programming brochures 
published this month and a recent decision by the City Council to give donors a 
voice in governing the 1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been able to see the quality of entertainment," Johnson said. 
"They've really started to see how important and significant this facility is 
going to be and are going to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to raise $7 million in cash and pledges by the center's grand 
opening in October, and a total of $10 million by April. The endowment fund 
will support operations and programming for the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 New members of the Founders Circle who donated $50,000 or more include John 
Notter, who donated $150,000; the Richard Gilleland family, which gave 
$100,000, and Gary L. Wetter, who gave $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Southern California Edison, PTS Furniture, Geri and Bob Crystal, Marilyn 
and Al Adam, Robyn and Scott Bleakley, Rosemary and Charles Licata, Sandra and 
John Moyen and Karla and Gary Nesen all donated $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the new founders are responsible for $750,000 of the $1-million 
boost in revenue. The remaining $250,000 was generated through smaller 
fund-raising programs sponsored by the alliance. TRACY WILSON

SIMI MAN, 46, FILES CLAIM ALLEGING ABUSE BY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man has filed a legal claim against the city, alleging that a 
police officer roughed him up while he was handcuffed during an arrest and 
again after he was hospitalized for minor injuries from the first assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Landman, a 46-year-old pool maintenance man, filed the claim Aug. 18.He 
charges that Officer Todd Berg hurt him twice while arresting him for battery 
in a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Capt. Jerry Boyce declined to comment on the claim or to 
say whether the department is investigating the incident internally because the 
matter is in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. John Torrance said, "We just got the claim yesterday, and we're 
investigating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Landman's lawyer, Diane Marchant, said he got involved in an argument with his 
daughter's ex-husband when he dropped off a grandchild at the man's house. 
During the altercation, the man shoved Landman, then called police to complain 
that Landman had spit at him in response, Marchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived to cite Landman for battery, he refused to sign a citation 
and Officer Berg said he would get a warrant for Landman's arrest, the claim 
contends. Landman told the officer, "If you're going to arrest me, arrest me 
now," and held out his wrists to be handcuffed, the claim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg cuffed Landman's hands behind his back, picked him up and "body-slammed 
him face down onto the concrete, rendering . . . Landman unconscious or 
semi-conscious and injuring him," the claim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while handcuffed to a bed at Simi Valley Hospital, Berg lifted Landman 
off the bed, injuring his left hand, the claim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landman said in an interview that he suffered a black eye, scratches to his 
face from the pavement and injuries to his wrists and ankles from the 
restraints. MACK REED

RAMS PUT RUBLEY ON INJURED LIST; LEWIS RELEASED; FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK IS 
INELIGIBLE TO PLAY THE ENTIRE SEASON. RECEIVER, ONE OF SEVEN CUT LOOSE, SIGNS 
WITH BEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the pain continuing to swell in his right elbow, Ram quarterback T.J. 
Rubley's 1994 season ended before it began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams placed Rubley on the injured list Tuesday and cut seven others, 
including wide receiver Nate Lewis, who signed a one-year, $375,000 deal with 
the Chicago Bears hours later. The Rams, who trimmed the roster to 60 players, 
must cut seven more by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley has missed most of training camp because of tendinitis in the elbow of 
his throwing arm. He said arthroscopic surgery is "inevitable" but hopes to 
wait at least another week before undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no nerve damage, then it could be six to eight weeks (out)," said 
Rubley, who started seven games last season but was fighting for the 
third-string position this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting him on injured reserve, the Rams lose Rubley, a third-year player, 
for the entire season. But his salary, approximately $200,000, will still count 
under the league's new salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured this was the way they were going to go," Rubley said. "It was 
either this or get released. I'm not the football player I was six or eight 
months ago, when I was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, 6 feet 3 and 205 pounds, was expected to challenge Chris Chandler for 
the backup job behind Chris Miller but struggled to throw the ball since his 
elbow began hurting in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't throwing the ball well and that was unusual for him," Ram Coach 
Chuck Knox said. "Usually he has good zip on the ball. I thought at the time, 
because T.J. is so into football, that maybe he was working too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept coming out here and throwing at targets, all the while he had 
problems in there (the elbow) and it was not unlike a baseball pitcher 
developing that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting Lewis, the Rams save most of his $600,000 salary, but it cost them 
the fourth-round pick they had traded to the San Diego Chargers to get him in 
the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams thought Lewis, a fifth-year pro who started nine games for the 
Chargers last season, could help them as a return man and add depth at wide 
receiver. But Lewis didn't impress Ram coaches in training camp and three 
exhibition games, catching only one pass for six yards and failing to show the 
speed necessary to return punts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some younger players and we wanted to go with them," Knox said. "I 
talked to him, and I think he was a little shocked about it. But in this day 
and age, anything can happen. There are economics involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears, in dire need of wide receivers for new quarterback Erik Kramer, 
came to terms with Lewis only three hours after he left Rams Park. The Bears 
also claimed receiver Greg McMurtry, cut by the Rams on Monday, off waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Rams) brought me here and I guess they didn't like what I did," Lewis 
said. "I knew my playing time had (decreased). I had an idea what was going on 
the past two weeks. I don't know if it's a money thing, or a position thing or 
what." 
</P>
<P>
 By releasing Lewis, the Rams are banking on rookie wide receiver Chris 
Brantley, tailback Johnny Bailey and wide receiver Todd Kinchen to carry the 
bulk of the kick and punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
 With Lewis gone, Jessie Hester is set as the starting wide receiver opposite 
Flipper Anderson. Hester, who caught 64 passes for 835 yards with Indianapolis 
last season, has seven receptions for 112 yards in three exhibition games, 
including three for 59 yards last Saturday night against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lewis, the Rams also cut cornerback Terry Taylor, safety Cliff Hicks, 
linebacker Andy Mason, defensive end Kevin Patrick, center Brad Fichtel and 
defensive tackle Maa Tanuvasa. The Rams cut nine players on Monday, including 
wide receiver Sean LaChapelle.

MIKE PENNER: DUCKS-KARIYA TALKS JUST LIKE BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came to the big city to try it again, to see if some kind of accord could 
be reached in the indefatigable labor dispute that has left tens of thousands 
of sports fans bitter, disenfranchised and bored beyond tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But, no, management refused to budge on the salary cap, labor responded by 
threatening to sit out the year as a prelude to open free agency in 1995 and 
the impasse remained intact for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Paul Kariya holdout enters Day 424. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greed, Grief and the Glorious Season That Might Have Been" read the headline 
on the cover of the national weekly news magazine, pretty much speaking on 
behalf of all Mighty Ducks fans. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, did the screaming red headline on the pages inside: "We Was Robbed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that seems to be the consensus of the fantasy hockey-league reports you 
see popping up in various sports sections across the country. These reports 
have been the most bizarre offshoot of the Kariya work stoppage -- a couple of 
frazzled editors, desperate to fill space in lieu of real Kariya news, buy a PC 
software program (or break out the old Strat-o-Matic board) and play phony 
games and print the phony results where the actual NHL roundups used to run. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the dice rollers and the keyboard hackers, Kariya not only signed 
with the fantasy Ducks last March, but led them into the fantasy Stanley Cup 
playoffs, ahead of the fantasy San Jose Sharks. There, Kariya led the fantasy 
Ducks over the fantasy Red Wings in the first round, the fantasy Maple Leafs in 
the quarterfinals and extended the fantasy Canucks to seven games and three 
overtime periods -- before Stu Grimson took a feed from Kariya and mistakenly 
slapped it into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
 These reports were intended to appease deprived and despondent Ducks fans, but 
instead only serve to incite them over what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 One irate season-ticket holder has threatened legal action. "According to the 
brochure I received in the mail," the fan writes in his complaint, "I was 
promised 'exciting, action-packed hockey at The Pond.' You call 60 minutes of 
dump-and-chase and Todd Ewen rear-ending one off the post for the only goal of 
the game 'exciting?' I want my money back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either that or the box next to Eisner's." 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of angry boosters organized a protest rally in The Pond parking 
lot, determined to boycott something. But what? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Ducks home games, it was decided. Everyone present seemed to have already 
purchased season tickets -- and have you seen what those are going for these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks merchandise? Sorry. Christmas is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 After much debate, and a very close vote by show of hands, it was determined 
that these fans would boycott valet parking at all Duck home games next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalemate has dominated sports talk shows for weeks. Among hockey 
analysts, division over the issue runs deep. 
</P>
<P>
 John Davidson: "Management is out of line when it says it wants to cap 
Kariya's salary at $1.5 million or whatever. Just because Tverdovsky crossed 
the picket line and signed for. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cherry: "The kid's too small and he can't hit anybody. He couldn't play 
for me. Let him walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson: "But Kariya led Canada to the silver medal against Sweden and the 
world championship over Finland." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry: "Scandinavians are wimps." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson: "Of course, the fans only want to see Kariya on the ice again. They 
don't care how it gets done. They say both sides are to blame. They say both 
sides are too greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry: "I say let's watch that tape of McSorley cleaning Probert's clock 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Local businesses have suffered as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Crates of Paul Kariya bobble-head dolls, Paul Kariya purple-and-green jerseys 
and Paul Kariya ceramic cappuccino mugs remain on dusty warehouse shelves, 
unopened and unsold. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera crew for "The Paul Kariya Mighty Ducks Pre-Game Hour" had to find 
second jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond, struggling to fill the Kariya gap in recent weeks, has been forced 
to schedule indoor soccer matches, roller hockey games and Whitney Houston 
concerts to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans eager for a fix are resorting to dire measures. Bootleg tapes of Kariya 
in action with the University of Maine and the Canadian national team have 
become an underground rage. Viewing can be hazardous, however. There are 
isolated reports of Mighty Ducks fans passing out in front of the living-room 
big screen at the sight of Kariya picking up the puck in his own end and 
carrying it across all three lines without falling down once. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the logjam continues, with each side dead set on breaking the 
will of the other and the fans apparently set on going Kariya-less on into 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ken Burns has indefinitely shelved plans for his third PBS maxi-series, 
"Mighty Duck Hockey: The Kariya Years."

 The fans never knew how close the Kings were to tumbling into the abyss last 
season,nearly being taken over by the Bank of America or the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
 All they knew was that the team was struggling on the ice, not looking one bit 
like a Stanley Cup finalist from the previous season, even with Wayne Gretzky, 
Luc Robitaille, Jari Kurri and Rob Blake.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Kings' slide was almost parallel to the declining fortunes of then 
majority owner Bruce McNall. They couldn't pull themselves out of trouble and, 
as it turned out, neither could McNall. He was forced to sell 72% of the team, 
then enter into bankruptcy proceedings and now has agreed to plead guilty to 
four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the paths of McNall and the Kings will separate, an already 
evolving process. McNall, who is now the team's president, started to distance 
himself from them last season by necessity because of his continuing legal and 
financial problems. He simply could not be overly involved in the club's 
day-to-day activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the Kings will still be the Kings. They will start training camp in 
early September and, barring a player strike, the season will begin in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there will be change on another scale. No matter what happens to McNall 
in the aftermath of his plea agreement with the government, one fact stands out 
-- it is the end of the freewheeling McNall era. As one of the most 
high-profile and accessible owners in the country,McNall once seemed capable of 
trying and doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
 With him, the question wasn't: What would he do? Rather it was: What wouldn't 
he do? 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers for $15 million in 1988, 
helped by funding from European American Bank. He didn't stop acquiring players 
and objects. Larry Robinson showed up in 1989. Jari Kurri in 1991. A private 
jet for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall threw a preseason party in 1988 at Chasen's to celebrate the arrival of 
Gretzky. Later, he held another bash in honor of Gretzky's first 100 games with 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at his art gallery in Century City and who else but McNall could giggle 
and crack jokes when a reporter accidentally knocked over and broke a rare 
piece of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The man never seemed to get angry. Gretzky, in fact, once noted that McNall 
was the same all the time, saying: "It's almost frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 He was so successful at convincing everyone from lenders to reporters that 
everything was fine, that it became easy to overlook early signs of trouble. 
The image of success fit McNall so well that anything to the contrary didn't 
add up. At first. As his problems began to emerge, McNall still insisted 
everything was fine, even making plans to write a book about his business 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several familiar with his business operations were surprised it took so long 
for the house of cards to tumble, saying that McNall's personal charm carried a 
great deal of influence with lenders and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of continued good salesmanship," one source said. "Bruce 
could sell the Brooklyn Bridge . . . swampland in Florida. He's good at playing 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no surprise -- a guy like Bruce McNall. The bankers don't have very 
exciting lives. They get to sit at the owners' table for dinner. They meet 
Goldie (Hawn). Most of the time, bankers have never gotten close to something 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers filed in bankruptcy proceedings, McNall's code name during the 
sale of the Kings was Prince Charles. It's surprising that his code name wasn't 
that of a Roman emperor, because he prided himself on his vast knowledge of 
rulers of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 You might say that McNall's rapid rise and equally rapid fall are much like 
those of some of the Roman emperors he grew up reading about as a youngster in 
Arcadia, long before the Kings were even in existence. 
</P>

HENLEY CAN TRAVEL, BUT BAIL INCREASES; PRO FOOTBALL: RAM CORNERBACK ALLOWED TO 
PLAY AWAY GAMES IF HE MEETS $1-MILLION BOND, IS SUPERVISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Henley, under indictment on drug charges, was granted permission 
Tuesday to travel to games, but a federal judge stunned the Ram cornerback and 
his attorneys by raising bail to $1 million and requiring that he be 
accompanied at all times -- even while on the bench -- by a court officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, alleged to be the mastermind of a cocaine ring that transported drugs 
using a former Rams cheerleader as a courier, sought a change in his bail 
restrictions that would allow him to travel outside the seven-county Central 
District of California, which includes Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henley and his attorneys gasped when U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. 
Taylor suggested that his previously set bail of $200,000 was too low and 
should probably be increased to $2 million or $3 million to ensure he doesn't 
flee while traveling with the team throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about playing football," Taylor said when Henley's attorneys 
objected. "This is a case that has a maximum sentence of life in prison and a 
very large minimum sentence. . . . This is a dangerous and important case." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor increased bail, set last year by a federal magistrate, to $1 million. 
Taylor had expressed similar reservations when he recently set bail at $500,000 
for Henley's uncle, Rex Henley, who also is charged in the conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine. Rex Henley is considered to be a lesser player in the 
alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor ruled that Henley's $1 million bond could come from a "responsible" 
third party, such as the Rams, which would have to pledge in an affidavit to 
pay should Henley flee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Henley will have to pay $100,000 in cash to the U.S. District 
Court clerk. The money will be refunded if Henley meets terms of his bail. 
Henley said that amount will likely come from his $350,000 contract with the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The court did not set a deadline on when the bond must be paid, but Henley's 
attorneys were scrambling to make bail as soon as possible so the cornerback 
would be free to travel to San Diego for Thursday's exhibition game against the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said his agent, Marvin Demoff, will meet with Rams President John Shaw 
regarding the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the judge ruled Henley must be accompanied on the road by a court 
officer -- either someone from pretrial services or the U.S. marshal's office 
-- even when Henley sits on the bench during the games. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that Jessie Flores, his pretrial services officer, will be 
assigned to accompany Henley. The court ruled Henley will have to pay the 
escort's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he has no problem with a court officer accompanying him on 
out-of-town games and is in no way a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why in the heck would I flee?" he said. "Why would I run? I've been (out on 
bail) for nine or 10 months. This isn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger L. Cossack, one of Henley's attorneys, called Taylor's initial 
recommendation of $2 million to $3 million bail "a major stumbling block" and 
said it would be impossible for Henley or his family to raise anywhere near the 
$200,000 to $300,000 that is typically required to secure the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the $1 million will be tough to make, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be up to the Rams or some other party," said Gerald L. Chaleff, a 
Henley attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Henley said he was happy to be able to travel and hoped to 
play Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other restrictions ordered Tuesday, Henley's salary will go directly to 
the pretrial services division and will be held in escrow, to be paid to Henley 
for necessities, such as legal fees and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henley is on the road and not on the playing field, in team meetings, or 
otherwise connected with official team gatherings, he must stay in the team's 
hotel and cannot join in "social or extracurricular activities," Taylor said. 
He also is prohibited from talking with any of the other defendants or 
witnesses in the case.

BELL TAKES INEVITABLE RELEASE HARD; PRO FOOTBALL: EX-RAIDER TAILBACK FIZZLES AT 
TIGHT END AND BLAMES SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Bell didn't want to get up Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get out of bed," he told his wife, Pamela. "I don't want to 
get cut." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get up. And he did get cut. 
</P>
<P>
 It was swift and expected, but being released by the Raiders was still painful 
for Bell, who was a highly regarded second-round draft choice only three years 
ago, an All-American running back from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, Bell was sharing running back duties with Eric Dickerson and Marcus 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1993, he was designated the starting tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 But it never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit while he was going out of bounds after a five-yard gain in the second 
quarter of last year's exhibition finale against the Rams, Bell suffered a 
hamstring injury. By season's end, Bell suffered the indignity of being 
relegated to the bench as his team advanced to the second round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1994, he was down to his last chance, signed to a $300,000 
contract and given an opportunity at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't really much of an opportunity. With the off-season departure of 
Ethan Horton, Andrew Glover had gotten the starting job. Veteran free agent 
Jamie Williams was signed as backup and Kevin Smith remained as a holdover from 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Bell fourth in a three-man rotation. Sixteen men have caught passes 
in the Raiders' four exhibition games. Bell was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunity is the key to everything," he said Tuesday morning as he loaded 
his bag into his vehicle after getting the official word from Steve Ortmayer, 
the Raiders' director of football operations. "The opportunity was not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell had gotten his final opportunity as a running back the day after 
Christmas last season. It was a miserable day for the Raiders, who suffered a 
28-0 defeat at the hands of the Packers in a game played in Green Bay 
zero-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But none was more miserable than Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting only his third start in his injury-marred season, Bell fumbled twice, 
dropped a pass and had another one nearly hit him in the back of the helmet 
when he failed to turn around. That was all before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bell, though, it was the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get called on in the second half. Nor much after that. After a 
season-ending injury to Greg Robinson, the team's leading rusher, early in 
December, Bell finally had his long-awaited chance to regain the starting spot 
he had lost in the exhibition season. But he let it slip through his cold 
fingers that day in Green Bay. Bell got only two carries in the Raiders' two 
playoff games, gaining three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This offense was not designed for somebody who runs like I do," Bell said 
Tuesday. "That's why Leonard Russell isn't here. Or Rod Bernstine. That's why 
all the big backs aren't here. . . . This offense was designed for a scatback. 
I am not a scatback and never will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have good explosion. I run straight ahead. I run downhill, but I'm not the 
type of guy who is going to run around somebody. Every time I try to do that, I 
hurt myself. I'm not a Bo Jackson. This offense is all about Bo and Marcus 
(Allen) and those kinds of guys. It's unfair to me. I don't have 4.2 or 4.3 
speed. I don't have the type of explosion (Jackson) had. I wasn't 230 pounds. I 
was 20 pounds heavier than him. What do you expect? Be realistic in your goals. 
Don't try to make somebody into something they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you don't paint a picture of me as being bitter because I'm not. I'm 
just looking at it realistically." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's best season was 1992, when he gained 366 yards, averaged 4.5 a carry 
and scored three touchdowns. He also rushed for 107 yards in a 1991 playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? Bell wants to return to school and eventually go into business for 
himself, but he's still interested in football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been one to give up and I still haven't given up," he said. "The 
fact is, I always tried the best I could, even when I had a torn hamstring. I 
was still out there six weeks later, hobbling on it, practicing, playing in 
games. For who? Myself? I don't think so, because it hurt me. Look at where I 
am now."

IRVAN'S CONDITION IMPROVES SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock car driver Ernie Irvan showed strong improvement Tuesday, responding to 
commands from doctors and the swelling of his brain diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I would take these as very encouraging signs, he still remains in 
terms of brain and neurological injury in critical condition," said Dr. Errol 
Erlandson, a vascular surgeon at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital near Ann Arbor, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Setbacks and complications are certainly a possibility. A slow, progressive 
recovery would be the best we could look at at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Erlandson said he was encouraged that the hospital's trauma team has not found 
any additional injuries since Irvan was brought in after his car slammed into a 
wall during practice Saturday for the Goodwrench Dealers 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan suffered head and lung injuries and remained on a ventilator Tuesday. 
His lung injury has stabilized, Erlandson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan began opening his eyes Monday afternoon after drugs given him were 
decreased and he responded with some body movements later that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are certainly not responses that we would call perfectly normal or 
fully responsive or conscious, but they are appropriate," Erlandson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan's eyes were open at times and he can move his arms, legs and head and 
also grimace. The ventilator prevents him from trying to talk, however, 
Erlandson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian VanDercook, spokesman for Irvan's racing team, said he was encouraged 
after visiting with Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was confident when I left the room that he knew it was me who was talking 
to him, that he understood what I was saying to him about the support of his 
teammates and his friends and thousands of concerned fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "His left leg was moving like he was pedaling a bicycle" in response to 
voices, VanDercook said. "I've never felt better than I did talking today to 
Ernie." 
</P>
<P>
 Erlandson said at a news conference he doesn't think further surgery will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must remain very guarded because this is a very severe injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only surgery performed so far has been a minor procedure to make it easier 
for Irvan to breathe.

STUDIES ARE A SNAP; USC CENTER JEREMY HOGUE WORKS TOWARD RHODES SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you can remember drinking coffee, popping No-Doz and studying all night for 
a college economics exam, and then being grateful for getting a C, you'll find 
USC center Jeremy Hogue a very annoying guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue's 3.85 grade-point average ranks him No. 2 academically on the Trojan 
football team. He aspires to be a Rhodes scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 So here, you figure, is a guy who has absolutely no fun, watches no TV, has no 
social life and either studies all night or arises at 3 a.m. to study and write 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 "I study about two hours a night, if I have a test the next day," he said. "If 
I have a paper due, I'll start it two nights before. I really don't study that 
much. I socialize, and I have a girlfriend, just like other guys on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "People assume because of my grades I'm a student who happens to play 
football. I'm not. I love football. I'm not a speed reader, but the Lord has 
blessed me with very good reading retention. I can read 200 pages of something 
and pretty much remember all of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in bed by midnight every night and I sleep in to around 9." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he tries never to miss his favorite TV shows, "Coach," and "Home 
Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue, a senior with two years of football eligibility remaining, is two 
classes shy of a degree in political science. Only sophomore defensive lineman 
Matt Keneley has a higher GPA, a 3.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue made the Pacific 10 Conference's all-academic first team after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been on the dean's list every semester, is a Phi Beta Kappa member and 
has had two B's in four years -- A's in everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have earned his degree after this semester. Next year, in his senior 
football season, he will be a graduate student in USC's business administration 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 If this keeps up, he has a chance to become the Trojans' only athlete, other 
than Pat Haden in 1975, to earn a Rhodes scholarship. Rhodes scholars study at 
Oxford with tuition and fees paid and are given a living allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to high academic achievements, candidates must display "qualities 
of character, leadership and personal vigor."  
</P>
<P>
 Fred Stroock, USC's assistant athletic director in charge of academic 
services, says Hogue's writing ability, not his near-photographic memory, will 
help him most on his Rhodes scholarship application next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A photographic memory, if applied effectively, can be a sign of great 
intelligence," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Jeremy can really write well, and good writing is a prime determinant in 
Rhodes consideration. He's an excellent writer, and it comes easy to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden said the Rhodes application process is nearly as fulfilling as the 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are against you from day one," he said. "There are 100 to 200 
applications every year from California alone. You wind up with 32 from the 
United States finally getting a Rhodes, about 75 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "A key factor is getting to the final 14 in your state, and getting to the 
interview stage by a committee of ex-Rhodes scholars. From there on, interviews 
are critically important.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before the committee, you might be asked a question about a story in that 
day's newspaper, about political science, about the importance of sports in an 
academic environment -- nothing you can prepare for, in other words." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue, the son of an Oklahoma City nondenominational minister, says he will 
apply from his home state, Oklahoma, where he figures he will have a better 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden, 41, a mid-1970s USC quarterback who played six seasons for the Rams, 
lives in San Marino. He's a partner in the venture capital firm of Riordan, 
Lewis and Haden, and is also an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rhodes scholarship was absolutely the most phenomenal experience of my 
life," he said. "I'll never forget the dinners, sitting around a table with 
extremely well-read people and discussing either a great issue of the day or a 
great issue of 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chairman of the USC English Department was the first one who suggested I 
try for one. I didn't even know what a Rhodes was. All I knew was that Bill 
Bradley got one." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, Haden says, he is struck by how many remember him as much 
for his Rhodes scholarship as for his USC and Ram football days. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Times reporter Bryce Nelson, now on the USC journalism faculty, 
coordinates Rhodes applications for USC students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a demanding application process," he said. "First, you have to write a 
1,500-word essay on why you want a Rhodes. Then, your university has to 
nominate you for one, well before you get to the interview process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interviews are extremely important, and there are a lot of smart people 
who don't interview well." 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven USC students have been awarded Rhodes scholarships since 1913, 
Nelson said, the last in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Stroock said Rhodes selectors view candidates who are athletes as they would a 
candidate who is a student-body president or a student-newspaper editor. But 
Haden says some Rhodes selectors are biased against athletes.  
</P>
<P>
 Stroock said, however, "If a candidate has blended football with academics 
successfully, selectors are intrigued with that, since it shows very good time 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue makes it sound like football success is much harder to come by than 
classroom success. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-feet-4 and 270 pounds, he's a runt in the Trojans' massive offensive 
line, where Tony Boselli, Norberto Garrido and Phalen Pounds all stand at least 
6-7 and weigh more than 300 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Hogue was an untested sophomore when he was thrust into a 
starting assignment. Starting guard Joel Crisman suffered a foot injury and 
Hogue filled in for four games. Coach John Robinson switched Hogue to center 
last spring, and he's now battling another junior, Robert Loya, 6-2 and 285, 
for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue's development was sidetracked last spring when he underwent surgery to 
repair a herniated disk. He says he's fit now and unofficially the No. 1 
center, with Loya sidelined because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue's family moved from Oklahoma to California, then back again, and Hogue 
went to El Toro High, where he was a teammate of USC quarterback Rob Johnson 
and linebacker Brian Haas. All three played for Johnson's father, Bob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy's a quick learner, an extremely bright kid who asks a lot of good 
questions," Bob Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone forgets his assignment, they can ask Jeremy. He knows what 
everyone's supposed to do. He may find himself up against someone who's bigger 
and stronger, but he'll find a way to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife thinks Jeremy's great. She thinks he's going to be President of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 USC offensive line coach Mike Barry, while acknowledging that Hogue plays with 
great intelligence, says he does have shortcomings.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a long way from being where Craig Gibson (the graduated previous 
starter) was as a center, but he's such a bright kid, he understands how to get 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue accepts the criticism, but believes his grit will sustain him as the 
starter.  
</P>
<P>
 "I play low and I never quit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, about those two B's . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "One was in English composition, in a class where no one got an A," Hogue 
said. "The other was in cinema. I thought all I'd have to do is watch movies. 
But everything I turned in came back with a B on it." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he enjoys debating points of political and social philosophy with 
"liberal" USC professors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very conservative politically, and I've become even more so at USC, after 
debating with professors," he said.

QUESTIONS SURROUND KARIYA TALKS; HOCKEY: DUCKS' DRAFTEE WAITS FOR ANOTHER 
CONTRACT OFFER WHILE EXPLORING POSSIBILITY OF NOT SIGNING IN ORDER TO BE A FREE 
AGENT NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Paul Kariya is awaiting a new contract offer from the Mighty Ducks this week, 
and agent Don Baizley said Kariya then will have to wrestle with a decision -- 
whether to sign or pursue an NHL ruling Baizley believes would make his client 
a free agent for the 1995-96 season if he sits out this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch could end up being this: The league is declining to give a rules 
interpretation on a hypothetical situation, meaning Kariya might have to make a 
decision without knowing its repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 That, as negotiations go, would be a point for the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks have remained amicable despite a pace so creeping that Duck General 
Manager Jack Ferreira says the headline when Kariya signs -- if he signs -- 
should be, "Finally." 
</P>
<P>
 The key sticking point this summer has been Baizley's request for a 
clarification on Kariya's status should he not sign this year. Unsigned draft 
picks typically return to the draft after two years, or one year after leaving 
college. But Baizley says that because Kariya would be classified as a 
21-year-old under NHL rules and therefore too old to qualify for next June's 
entry draft, he should become an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 His appeals to Commissioner Gary Bettman have been fruitless, however, and 
league spokesman Arthur Pincus said Tuesday Bettman will not rule until there 
is an actual dispute. The implication is that Bettman won't make an 
interpretation that could be used in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Baizley said he is confident Kariya would become a free agent. 
(Ferreira says the Ducks don't care if he could become a free agent, they only 
want to sign him.) 
</P>
<P>
 With training camp scheduled to open Sept. 4 in Anaheim and the season 
scheduled to begin Oct. 1, "we all realize time is closing in," Baizley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who say there is nothing new to report in the negotiations, will 
offer Kariya a contract richer than the three-year $4.2 million deal they gave 
this year's second overall pick, Oleg Tverdovsky. Tverdovsky's deal pays an 
average $1.8 million a year before the third year, which calls for an option 
year salary of $600,000 that probably will be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya is believed to be seeking more than $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya is declining interviews, but Baizley said "he is being typically 
thoughtful Paul, trying to examine his options."

CROWDED TABLE AS NEGOTIATIONS RESUME TODAY; BASEBALL: SEVERAL DOZEN PLAYERS, 
REPRESENTATIVES OF OWNERS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND, BUT THERE IS LITTLE HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by federal mediators, baseball's collective bargaining will resume 
today. Will it go beyond today? Is there anything new to discuss? 
</P>
<P>
 Only if owners withdraw the salary cap that has polarized the sides and shut 
down negotiations since the strike by major league players began on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 12 of the strike Tuesday, there was some seeming flexibility offered by 
Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington regarding the owners' willingness to look at 
alternatives, but no firm indication that the cap is coming off -- either today 
or in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, the moderate CEO of the big-market Red Sox and spokesman for the 
owners' pool, was asked if the owners are prepared to let go of the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at this time," he said. "We still feel it's in the best interest of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the owners remain united behind the need for change in the 
compensation system and keep hoping and waiting for the union to respond to 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that if the union has better ideas there are "no limits" to 
the owners' willingness to discuss alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no way we'll go for a salary cap, but get rid of it and 
we'll talk about anything," said Dodger player representative Brett Butler, one 
of 18 players who met with four mediators after the mediators had met with the 
pool of 12 owners and club executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a request by owners negotiator Richard Ravitch, mediators 
agreed to let all 12 attend today's negotiations, a decision that drew no 
objection from the players union, which might have twice as many players and 
has been eager to confront the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a rich mix," said John Calhoun Wells, national director of the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in reference to the crowded table. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ravitch and Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, expressed hope 
that a dialogue can accelerate a settlement, but there were no promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard rumors that the owners might have a second proposal," Kansas City 
Royal pitcher David Cone said. "That's the kind of thing we're looking forward 
to finding out." 
</P>
<P>
 A second proposal? 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly not," acting commissioner Bud Selig said from Milwaukee. "The only 
thing you may have been hearing is that we have cost problems that have to be 
dealt with, and revenue sharing (without the cap) isn't enough. If the union 
has any devices for dealing with the problems, we'll be happy to discuss them. 
That's all anyone is saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch, when asked if the cap was still on the table: "I'm not going to 
comment on that, but I don't want to suggest by my silence that the proposal 
has changed. It's fair to say the owners have not changed their view on the 
need for cost certainty." 
</P>
<P>
 The union recently presented the owners a series of revenue-sharing 
alternatives without a cap and saw them rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the alternative is a functional equivalent of a cap, we don't draw the 
distinction," said Fehr, who added that the owners are still tied to the 
historical baggage of previous negotiations -- this is the eighth stoppage 
since 1972 -- and still attempting to put artificial limitations on a free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a compromise in the stalemate, most believe it rests in the 
players' willingness to eliminate or modify salary arbitration in exchange for 
earlier free agency and removal of the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, said that's not what the owners mean when they bring up 
alternatives. He says they are merely expressing a willingness to change the 
percentages of their proposal -- they have offered the union 50% of all revenue 
-- if the union will tell them what it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr has refused to provide an answer because it would be accepting the cap. 
He says a free market should determine what the players earn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the union has sent a recently completed economic study of the 
industry to each of the clubs. The report, commissioned by the union, was done 
by Stanford economist Roger Noll and reaches the same conclusions as a 1985 
study by Noll: The industry is not in the trouble the owners say it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the battle lines remain drawn as the season evaporates and Fehr and 
Ravitch continue to throw verbal darts at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I note Don said yesterday that he's never seen me in a team picture," Ravitch 
said. "Well, I've never seen him in uniform on a (bubble gum) card either. 
That's not our job. We're not players and we're not owners. Don is a very 
capable negotiator and we're here to facilitate a settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 They will be accompanied by the players and owners today, but that doesn't 
mean that a settlement is any closer.

RIDE THE WILD TURF; JOHN TOMAC, TINKER JUAREZ WILL BATTLE FOR NATIONAL MOUNTAIN 
BIKE TITLE IN BIG BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At first they will suffer from oxygen debt, with interest, especially at such 
a high elevation as Big Bear Lake's 6,700 feet, where the NORBA National 
Mountain Bike Championships are scheduled this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of a tingly, lightheaded feeling," John Tomac explains. "You have 
to recover from that. And then later in the race when you start running out of 
glycogen, you lose all your energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Glycogen is the starchy stuff stored in the liver and muscles that the body 
turns into sugar when the energy alarm goes off. 
</P>
<P>
 When the glycogen gauge reads empty, David (Tinker) Juarez says, "You feel it 
mainly in your legs."  
</P>
<P>
 Then, perhaps, come heat exhaustion -- and that's only the physical part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could just choke from the pressure," Juarez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac sometimes does that to his rivals. At 26, he could become the first to 
accomplish what few mountain bike competitors have even attempted: winning both 
the national cross-country and downhill championships in the same year. The 
downhill is virtually assured, unless he falls on his head or the bike breaks, 
none of which he discounts, based on experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But he must beat Juarez to win the cross-country title, and endurance plays an 
important role in that 32-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac leads Juarez by two points, 227-225. The winner gets 60, the runner-up 
55. Nobody else is a factor as they come into the national finals, the last of 
six events on the National Off-Road Bicycle Assn. (NORBA) tour that has wound 
around the country from Georgia to Michigan to Vermont to Mammoth Lakes to 
Spokane to Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's competition is being staged by Team Big Bear at the Snow Summit 
skiing complex, where more than 2,500 men and women will ride cross-country, 
downhill and double slalom in various divisions based on age, gender and skill. 
The top six finishers in each division advance to next month's world 
championships at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain biking has become popular in the last decade and its natural 
evolution into racing has been even more recent, drawing competitors who grew 
up in BMX -- the little bikes -- racing over artificial bumps and jumps. In 
1996 it will enter the lofty realm of the Olympics when cross-country becomes a 
formal event of the Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some top riders, such as Tomac and Juarez, already have found they can make a 
decent living at it. The prize money isn't quite enough -- the winners earn 
only $2,200 in cross-country and $1,500 in downhill, and the total purse is 
$200,000. But most riders receive team salaries and supplement those with 
endorsements. Tomac rides for Tioga/Raleigh, Juarez for Volvo/Cannondale. The 
top five might earn $100,000-$150,000 a year, Tomac maybe $250,000 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac hopes to add to his earnings in the cross-country race, scheduled for 1 
p.m. Saturday. If successful, he will try to complete his double by clinching 
the downhill title Sunday morning. It's an iron-man order. Only one other 
rider, Jed Fox, is even listed in the top 30 in both disciplines, and he's 22nd 
and 30th. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a busy schedule, but I enjoy doing both events, and I'm good at both, 
so there's no reason not to," Tomac says. "Usually, the cross-country race 
takes quite a bit out of my legs, so I'm at a bit of a disadvantage for the 
downhill. But if I do it right I can get away with being a little bit tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals are in awe of Tomac. He is the face of his sport in this country, 
fulfilling PR obligations but preferring time with his wife, Kathy, two sons, 
two Bernese mountain dogs and five turkeys at their home outside Durango, 
Colo., an out-of-the-way town that has become a haven for mountain bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tomac really wants to hide, he retreats to his 800-acre ranch near 
Cortez, Colo., where Kathy says they plan to retire, as if 26-year-olds think 
about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the riders carry less body fat than a ghost, but even at a lean 
5-feet-10 and 160 pounds, Tomac is slightly oversize for a cross-country racer. 
Going uphill he spots rivals as much as 20 pounds. Downhill he makes it up, and 
Juarez's strategy revolves around those factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just need to beat John," Juarez says. "I'm thinking that he's going to want 
to be the guy that leads the race. It's going to be a long race, close to three 
hours, so my main goal is to stay on him and find out where his strong and weak 
points are. He could feel good or he might be a little slow in certain spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez learned about pacing by running in four L.A. Marathons, 1988-91. His 
best time was 2 hours 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to go out and try to lead the race," he says. "A lot of riders 
do that and fade far back. (Tomac has) done that quite often, and usually the 
riders behind end up catching him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tomac says he has learned, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot more experienced now," he says. "I know what it takes to win and 
how to get to the finish line the fastest." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez figures he's the cat and Tomac's the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to get out of sight, and if he does jump out in front I'm 
going to stay on his wheel until I know where I'm going to set him up at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez thinks he may be able to reduce Tomac's edge by getting in front uphill 
and blocking him on the downhill sections where the course is tight. Juarez is 
cautious going downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might be good, but I'm far from a gonzo rider," he has said. "I fear for 
getting hurt. I don't like to go too extreme down the hills because I don't 
want to crash or get a mechanical problem. (Tomac) kind of lets it all out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez, 33, is from Norwalk but lives at Sugar Loaf, near Big Bear Lake, with 
his fiancee, Sara Ellis, who is also a bike racer. Everybody calls him Tinker, 
not David. His mother, Rose, is his agent and publicist but may lose her job 
after he reads how he got his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows this story," she says. "When he was a couple of months old, 
every time I changed his diaper he would 'tinker' all over. So I used to say, 
'You little tinker you,' and everybody around me would say, 'You little 
tinker.' He's told different stories, but that's the real one." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker may hear about that from his rivals -- especially Tomac. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac has finished ahead of Juarez in three of the five NORBA events this 
year. He won all three, with Juarez second -- once by a bike length. When 
Juarez won at Vermont, Tomac was fourth, and when Juarez finished fifth at 
Mammoth Lakes, Tomac dropped out, still suffering after-effects of the flu. 
That became each rider's "throw-out" race for the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is only to beat Tinker and win the title," Tomac says. "I don't care 
if we're racing for 15th place or first. He's been consistent this year. It'll 
be interesting to see how prepared he is for this last race. I mean, I know how 
to beat the guy. It's just a matter of doing it one more time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac has had enough bad luck, such as flat tires and breakdowns, to keep him 
from winning more than one national title. Juarez hasn't won any but has been 
close enough twice to figure he deserves one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this position twice in my career and been choking at the end," 
he says. "I know about blowing it at the last race." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez won a World Cup event at Mt. Ste. Anne, Canada, in '93 but missed the 
national title by placing third to Tomac at Michigan. However, it could hardly 
be called a "choke" in '91 when he was leading in points going into the Big 
Bear Lake race and needed only to finish in the top 10 to claim the title. 
Instead, he suffered two flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty psyched that I'm going to do well," Juarez says. "My strategy 
is just to have a strong race and not ride over my head. I'm going to try to 
pretend that it's just another race and go in more relaxed. He's really going 
to make the pressure hard on me. If I want it bad enough, I'll have to prove 
him wrong."

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; ERIC WOODS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming off his worst performance of the year, Eric Woods nearly made the 
biggest mistake of his professional golf career. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who played at Corona del Mar High and UC Irvine, missed his tee time 
for the first round of the Ontario (Canada) Open this month. That cost him two 
strokes. But had he arrived at the tee box a few minutes later, after his group 
had hit their second shots, he would have been disqualified from the tournament 
he had won in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got there my group was halfway down the fairway. I just dropped 
my ball and ripped it, 'Fore,' " Woods said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be an insignificant mistake. Woods birdied that first hole 
for a bogey and after an eagle and a birdie he was two-under par. He finished 
three-under 69, two shots behind the leader after one round, and wound up 
winning the tournament by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory of 1994 the Canadian PGA season for Woods, who won 
two tournaments and was the leading money winner in Canada last year. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, after losing a playoff in the second event and finishing in the 
top 10 in the first five, Woods struggled. He finished 54th at the Canadian 
Masters and slipped to seventh in the tour's Order of Merit, which with two 
events left put him in danger of finishing out of the top three and therefore 
missing the PGA Tour's Canadian Open in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The $18,000 first prize at Ontario put him back into the lead in the Order of 
Merit, which he won despite missing the cut last week at the season-ending 
Trafalgar CPGA Championship. He finished the season with $44,083 in prize money 
and also earned a $15,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who turned pro in 1988, said he enjoys his globe-trotting lifestyle. 
For the last two years, he has played on the tours in South Africa and Asia as 
well as Canada. He also was the South American Order of Merit winner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His success helps him build a resume, which helps him earn exemptions on other 
tours and other tournaments. The key to exponential advancement, of course, is 
earning his PGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even if he is able to secure the card at the tour school this fall, 
he says, he'll come back to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot more fun on the Canadian Tour," Woods said. "We have a good 
time up here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal Olson/Payne Stewart-designed golf course under construction in East 
Coyote Hills could be ready to play as soon as October -- with a significant 
catch: there won't be any grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Unocal Land and Development Co., is hoping to hold a charity 
"dirt tournament" on the course, which actually is scheduled to open in 
September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's missing basically is grass," said Dennis Chapman, a 
Unocal official. "People are going to get a real feel for what takes place 
before you have a finished golf course." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are still sketchy, Chapman said, because he's not sure how much of the 
course will be usable. Massive grading started in January and plans call for 
shaping of the holes to start in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the public course will be 6,600 yards long from the back tees. 
Chapman said the company is hoping to hold greens fees below those charged by 
Tustin Ranch and Tijeras Creek (about $50 during the week) and above Imperial 
(about $20). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be in the middle somewhere," Chapman said.

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; LITTLE LEAGUE SYSTEM IS SIMPLE, BUT CHALLENGING; 
BASEBALL: PREPARING A TEAM WITH SOUND FUNDAMENTALS IS COACH'S PRIMARY ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little League, quite simply, was designed to be baseball made easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners cannot lead off bases until a pitch crosses home plate. And a batter 
cannot run to first base if the catcher misses strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 These rules eliminate a great deal of baseball as it is played from high 
school to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need for pitchers to use the set position and hold runners close 
to bases. Stolen bases are infrequent. The hit-and-run play is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielders, unconcerned with holding runners close to bases, can remain still 
and focused on the batter when the pitch is thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a strong proponent of the Little League system because kids concentrate 
solely on the fundamentals of catching, throwing and hitting the ball," said 
Jeff Burroughs, a former major leaguer who coached the Long Beach Little League 
team to World Series championships in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple, maybe. But easy? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask that question of any batter who has faced Nathaniel Dunlap, Northridge's 
hard-throwing right-hander, and you'll get a look like you are, well, batty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap was clocked throwing 70-74 m.p.h. consistently in Monday's World Series 
opener. The pitcher's rubber in Little League is 46 feet from home plate, 
compared to 60 feet 6 inches on a regulation diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic algebra reveals that the 5-foot-11 Dunlap throwing 74 m.p.h. from 46 
feet is the equivalent of a 7-foot-9 pitcher throwing 97 m.p.h. from 60 feet 6 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Little League at its top level is considered a pitcher's game. A 
pitcher such as Dunlap, or even Northridge's Peter Tuber, a 5-foot-9 
right-hander who mixes a 66 m.p.h. fastball with a sharp curveball, is 
downright intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Nathaniel's long arms, he's not pitching, he's handing the catcher the 
ball," said Larry Baca, the Northridge manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, too, that home plate is the same size in Little League as it is in 
the major leagues. A kid less than 5-feet tall must cover the same strike zone 
as a long-limbed major leaguer such as Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a Little League batter to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd the plate a bit, develop a short, compact swing, and dig into the 
batter's box with what it says on the back of those T-shirts everybody seems to 
wear: No fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "A long, looping swing is death (for a Little Leaguer)," said Jack Fisher, 
whose son, Matt, Northridge's shortstop, was 11 for 17 with two home runs in 
Western Regional play despite weighing about 90 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the same words a major league scout will tell a high school 
prospect. Thus, Little League forces hitters to develop habits that will carry 
them into higher levels of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good Little League has the competitiveness of good varsity baseball," said 
Baca, who in addition to being a longtime Little League manager was coach of 
the Granada Hills American Legion team in 1991 and '92. "It's a bang-bang game, 
very fast, with close plays and solid fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a state-of-the-art, ultra-light aluminum bat to the plate doesn't 
hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitters have been able to take the game back from oversized pitchers in recent 
years because of bats that can be as long as 31 inches yet as light as 23 
ounces. Only a few years ago, the weight of bats corresponded much more closely 
with the length. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighter bats enable hitters to generate more bat speed and extend their 
arms against faster pitching without sacrificing much power. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing a team with sound fundamentals is a Little League coach's primary 
role. Once the game begins, less coaching is necessary than on a regulation 
field. Without stolen bases and hit-and-run plays, teams must wait for the ball 
to be hit to create action. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can still be aggressive, but in a different way," said George Saul, the 
Northridge coach who also helped Baca with the Granada Hills legion team. "The 
bunt is a big tool, and you teach aggressive baserunning after the ball is hit. 
Round bases aggressively and slide hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise it's like over-the-line. You wait for the ball to be hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Little League rules speed up play. Without pickoff moves and base stealing, 
games often are completed in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Short, simple games with loads of action, lightning-quick pitches with swings 
to match. Strip away the hype from the Little League World Series, and that is 
what remains. 
</P>
<P>
 For Little Leaguers worldwide, that is plenty.

MARCACCINI BROTHERS FACE POTENTIAL NCAA SCRUTINY; BASKETBALL: PLAYERS' TIES TO 
PROFESSIONAL TEAM IN ITALY COULD POSE ELIGIBILITY PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS and MIKE HISERMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 G.C. and Monte Marcaccini, brothers who starred in basketball for Notre Dame 
High, might still have a few hoops to jump through before they play hoops for 
the colleges of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 G.C., 21, said Tuesday he has accepted a scholarship offer from George Mason 
(Va.) University. Monte, 19, signed with Pepperdine last week. But both players 
had ties to a professional basketball team in Treviso, Italy -- posing 
potential eligibility problems, according to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte, a 6-foot-6 swingman, averaged 25 points a game last season for the 
Benetton United Colors' junior team, an amateur contingent that competes one 
rung below the professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 G.C., whose size and skills are similar to that of his brother, said he 
practiced both with Benetton's junior team and the professional squad, but 
played for neither. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA regulations prohibit athletes who have competed for professional teams -- 
even for no pay -- from gaining intercollegiate eligibility in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the general scenario of the Marcaccinis' cases, Steve Mallonee, a 
director in the NCAA's department of legislative services, said Tuesday that 
"some issues need to be resolved before eligibility can be determined." 
</P>
<P>
 The obligation for confirming eligibility rests with the universities that 
signed the players, Mallonee said, adding, "There appears to be enough reason 
to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Marcaccini, the mother of both players, said the family went to great 
lengths -- including several preemptive calls in the spring of 1993 to NCAA 
administrative offices in Overland Park, Kan. -- before arrangements were made 
for the brothers to spend a season in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his letter of intent, G.C. said, he is mailing George Mason Coach 
Paul Westhead a letter from Benetton officials explaining that he was not paid 
for his services and is under no contractual agreement with the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my assumption and understanding that (Marcaccini) did not play 
professional basketball," said Westhead, the former Lakers coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Said G.C.: "We don't pose a problem for the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 However, G.C. also said he held an option on a $900,000 contract with Benetton 
for next season. He said his agreement with the club was that at the end of one 
season he would decide whether to stay with the club or return to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 Times story, Alicia Marcaccini described G.C.'s agreement with 
Benetton as "very lucrative." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallonee, interpreting legislation from the NCAA manual, said G.C.'s status as 
a non-paid member of the Benetton organization still might place him in 
jeopardy. "If you sign a contract with a pro team, then you've signed with a 
pro team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte Marcaccini's situation also might be scrutinized, Mallonee said, if the 
NCAA learns that the Benetton amateur team is funded by the professional unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the pro team is sponsoring or supporting the other team then by our 
definition it, too, is a professional team," Mallonee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte Marcaccini averaged 19.7 points and 11.4 rebounds while leading Notre 
Dame High to the Southern Section Division III-A championship in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 He spurned a scholarship offer from Indiana Coach Bob Knight to play in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 G.C. Marcaccini spent his freshman year as a redshirt at UC Santa Barbara 
before transferring to College of the Canyons, where he averaged 20.7 points 
and 8.2 rebounds in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players spent last season in Italy to establish residence -- so they 
would be considered Italian players by the native professional league. Pro 
teams in Italy are allowed only two U.S. players on their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 G.C. said he chose to come home to be closer to his family, refine his skills 
and also improve his bargaining power should he choose to return to Italy.

PLAYING GRAF IN THE U.S. OPEN AT 16 PROBABLY WOULD BE A BIT TU MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Meilen Tu of Northridge, who recently won her first national championship in 
junior tennis, has been granted a wild-card spot in the women's division in 
next week's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States Tennis Assn. on Monday selected Tu, 16, to its 128-player 
draw in the Grand Slam event that opens Monday at Flushing Meadows, N.Y. Tu's 
only concern is that she might face Steffi Graf, the No. 1 player in the world. 
Seedings will be made later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not have to play somebody like that, because I lack experience," 
Tu said. "But whoever I do play, I'm going to give them all I got. I've never 
played in that big of an event. I might get nervous. But I've also been 
preparing for this event, mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Granada Hills High student, who is now in a home-study program, 
earned the U.S. Open berth after winning the USTA Girls' 18-and-under national 
championship in San Jose on Aug. 13. She defeated Lilia Osterloh of Winchester, 
Ohio, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, in the final. Tu lost in the quarterfinals of that event 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But her game has reached a new level. Touring with the USTA Junior National 
team, Tu has won two international tournaments this year: the Banana Bowl on 
clay in Sao Paulo, Brazil in March and the Surbiton (England) International 
Junior Championship on grass in July. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Tu's first appearance in a professional tournament. She scored a 
first-round victory in February in the $25,000 Coral Gables (Fla.) Challenge 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu's second-round loss came against then 138th-ranked Audra Keller of Memphis, 
Tenn. Keller also was granted a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Tu played the Junior U.S. Open, an international juniors event 
that coincides with the pro tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 She lost in the first round in both singles and doubles.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, she is undaunted about returning to Flushing Meadows as an amateur 
playing in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've really earned it, I think," she said. "I've worked really hard."

CSUN WOULD WELCOME RETURN OF HEITMANN; VOLLEYBALL: GERMAN NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER 
COULD RETURN FOR SENIOR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Oliver has taken a twist -- a good one for backers of the Cal 
State Northridge men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann, a German National Team member who was the Matadors' top 
player last season, wants to return to Northridge for another campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 By telephone from Hamburg, Germany, Luise Heitmann, Oliver's grandmother, said 
the 6-foot-7 middle blocker "would very much like to" play his senior season at 
Northridge. Heitmann was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't anticipate him coming back," Matador Coach John Price said. "With 
him, I have a chance to be a pretty good coach again." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, a second-team All-American, paced Northridge with 569 kills, a .445 
attacking percentage and 136 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Heitmann would be an even stronger force in his second season with 
the Matadors, after adjusting to the differences between international play and 
top-level U.S. collegiate competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has advanced to postseason competition the past five seasons 
largely because of a flow of dominant players -- including Coley Kyman, a 
three-time All-American -- in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in years, the Matadors face the prospect of replacing both 
middle blockers. Craig Hewitt, who played opposite Heitmann last season, has 
exhausted his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Bond, Eric Klootwyk and Larry Corbi are considered the front runners to 
replace Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Ferguson, a UC San Diego transfer, is expected to take over at setter. 
Peter Piexoto and Collin Smith are back at the swing hitter spots, and Jason 
Hughes and Jon Baer will be vying for time at opposite hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's last contact with Northridge coaches came more than a month ago. Of 
late, Price said, he and the player have been playing "phone tag." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to figure out what type of class schedule he needs to have," Price 
said. "But if he wants to come back, there shouldn't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Luise Heitmann said her grandson is unsure what arrangements to make and is 
waiting for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach has them. "I'll tell you what he should do," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call me. I'll take it from there."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RUBLEY'S SEASON ENDS WITH BAD ELBOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the pain and swelling continuing in his right elbow, Ram quarterback T.J. 
Rubley's season ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams put Rubley on injured reserve and cut seven other players, among them 
wide receiver Nate Lewis, who signed a one-year, $375,000 deal with the Chicago 
Bears hours later. The Rams trimmed their roster to 60 players, and seven more 
must go by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley has missed most of training camp with tendinitis in the elbow of his 
throwing arm. He said arthroscopic surgery has become "a viable option." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no nerve damage, then it could be six to eight weeks (out)," said 
Rubley, who started seven games last season but was fighting for the 
third-string position this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting him on injured reserve, the Rams lose Rubley, a third-year player, 
for the entire season but his salary will still count under the league's new 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting Lewis saves the Rams most of his $600,000 salary, but it cost them the 
fourth-round pick they traded to the San Diego Chargers to get him in the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lewis, the Rams also cut cornerback Terry Taylor, safety Cliff Hicks, 
linebacker Andy Mason, defensive end Kevin Patrick, center Brad Fichtel and 
defensive tackle Maa Tanuvasa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams made changes in their starting defense after injuries depleted their 
pass rush in a 29-20 exhibition loss to the Raiders on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox named rookie Brad Ottis, a second-round draft pick, as the 
starter at right end for Thursday night's exhibition finale at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis replaces Gerald Robinson, who had started three games in place of 
injured Fred Stokes, before spraining his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, who had a sprained left knee, returned to practice Monday but Knox 
plans to hold him out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie free-agent D'Marco Farr of Washington appears to be in line for the the 
starting right tackle spot in place of the injured Sean Gilbert, who also has a 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Rams task force today will unveil its plan to buy part of the 
team for $50 million. It includes revamping Anaheim Stadium and building a new 
corporate headquarters and practice facility. MIKE REILLEY

TRIAL OPENS IN CASE OF MISSING NORTHRIDGE BOY; COURTS: DESPITE THE LACK OF A 
BODY OR CRIME SCENE, MAN IS CHARGED WITH KILLING MICHAEL AZZARO, 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 18 months after her 16-year-old son disappeared, Rosalie Azzaro 
still has trouble thinking of him in the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you have a son named Michael?" a prosecutor asked Tuesday, as Evans York, 
who is accused of killing Michael Azzaro while taking his truck, went on trial 
in San Fernando Superior Court on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do," she replied at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did," she corrected herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though York has been charged with first-degree murder, there has been no 
body for Azzaro's family to bury, no crime scene for the police to analyze. 
Azzaro disappeared without a trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months after he dropped from sight, Michael's driver's license turned 
up mysteriously in the mail, his mother testified. It came in an envelope 
addressed to her son with no return address and no note. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Asari told jurors Tuesday that York, 20, an 
acquaintance of Michael's, was seen driving Michael's new red Isuzu Rodeo the 
day after he disappeared. Phone company records show that someone telephoned 
York's guardian several times that weekend using Michael's car phone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 York told some of Michael's friends before the disappearance that he was 
thinking about "jacking" -- robbing -- him, according to testimony at a 
preliminary hearing. Later, he told other friends the Rodeo was his, witnesses 
at that hearing testified. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman named April Cotton overheard York at the Golden Bird restaurant in 
South-Central Los Angeles, the prosecution contends. She testified at the 
preliminary hearing that York, talking to a friend in street slang, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Blood, I can't go back to the Valley . . . I snatched the blood up out of the 
car and I pulled out the strap on him, and when I busted, I just jumped in the 
s--- and boned out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Neal May offered this translation at the 
preliminary hearing: 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the individual out of the car. I pulled a gun on him and when I shot, 
I just jumped in the car and left." 
</P>
<P>
 Asari, who said Cotton will testify for the prosecution, contends the remarks 
she says she overheard amount to York's admission to the crime. It is arguably 
the most compelling evidence in a difficult case built on circumstantial 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Kenneth Lezin gave the jury no hints of his strategy, 
declining to make an opening statement until later in the trial. But outside 
the courtroom he later told reporters that the prosecution can't prove York 
killed Azzaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he may well be alive," the defense attorney said. "Maybe he just 
wanted to disappear. . . . There's no body. There's no witnesses, and there's 
no case." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the testimony Tuesday centered on Michael's habits, and the 
circumstances of his disappearance. He was a sophomore at Granada Hills High 
School and lived in Northridge. Most of his friends, including York, lived in a 
gated community about a mile from his house. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother often chided him about acting as a "taxi" driver for his friends, 
many of whom were younger than he was because he had repeated kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he was temporarily paralyzed by an inoperable brain tumor at age 3, 
when he was given two to five years to live. The tumor also affected his sight 
and made school work slow and difficult for him, she said. He survived, but had 
physical problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his physical condition, he stayed in constant touch with his family 
through his car phone and pager as a teen-ager, she said. "Michael was what we 
called a phone-a-holic," she said. "He'd call all the time, sometimes every 
half hour." 
</P>
<P>
 While his parents were returning from a vacation in Russia on Feb. 13, 1993, 
Michael pulled away from his family's Northridge home in his red Rodeo, telling 
his grandmother not to defrost dinner for him. The next day, his parents 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 His things were there -- his video games, his videos, even his favorite Notre 
Dame football jacket -- but Michael was not there to greet them, his mother 
testified.  
</P>
<P>
 They tried his car phone several times and received no answer. They repeatedly 
called his pager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He was last seen by the mother of his best friend, Doug Paul. According to 
court records, Paul told police after Michael's disappearance that York had 
said he was looking to "jack" -- meaning rob -- Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends also told police that Michael Azzaro was interested in buying a 
.45-caliber pistol like York's, and York told him he knew where he could get 
one, according to court records.  
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old friend testified Tuesday that Michael and York planned a trip to 
Los Angeles to "get money" to finance a deal to buy three pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 He last saw Michael at breakfast the day he disappeared, he testified, saying: 
"I told him he should not go to L.A. I told him, 'You do not belong there.' 
There was nothing I could do to stop him."

ROADBLOCKS STALL REPAIRS ON SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY 
</P>

<P>
 In a setback for northern San Fernando Valley commuters, reconstruction of the 
earthquake-damaged Simi Valley Freeway -- originally scheduled for completion 
next week -- will not be finished until the middle of next month, Caltrans said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had expected to reopen all lanes of the bridges at San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek next Tuesday after workers finished repairing 
the westbound side of the spans, which were considerably weakened in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But a delay in starting the project and last-minute design changes have pushed 
the target back by up to three weeks, to Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still possible they'll get it open before the 19th," Caltrans engineer 
Frank Latham said of the contractor, San Diego-based F.C.I. Constructors. "But 
right now the 19th is the scheduled date." 
</P>
<P>
 After the January temblor, the overpasses sagged nearly four feet in some 
spots. To handle traffic in the area, which currently averages about 180,000 
vehicles daily, workers erected a detour that funneled traffic from both 
directions into the five lanes that used to carry only westbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration of the eastbound bridge, which cost $9.7 million, wrapped up last 
May. Although plans called for the contractor to immediately begin work on the 
westbound portion, two related problems cropped up: The previous contractor had 
not yet finished cleaning up and traffic could not be shifted onto that newly 
rebuilt eastbound side. 
</P>
<P>
 The project hit another roadblock when Los Angeles flood control officials, 
who have jurisdiction over the Bull Creek flood channel, decided not to allow 
scaffolding to be anchored in the channel, requiring new plans that added two 
weeks to the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the circumstances were beyond contractor F.C.I.'s control, officials 
said the firm will not be held financially liable for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The current repair project -- worth $9.6 million -- carries no bonus or 
penalty for either early or late completion. Such financial incentives were 
used to accelerate repair of the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway and the 
shattered Santa Monica and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Latham said it was difficult to determine whether incentives would have 
speeded up work on the current project. F.C.I. also faced greater limitations 
than contractors on those past projects, because some night work was banned by 
the California Department of Transportation in an effort to mollify disgruntled 
freeway neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be responsive to the residents," Latham said. "They've got to 
live with the dust, but the noise we try to do something about." 
</P>
<P>
 If construction is completed by Sept. 19, the three lanes of westbound traffic 
will be routed onto the new bridge immediately. But a full reopening of all 10 
lanes of the freeway -- five in either direction -- could take another 20 days, 
as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Latham said, traffic flow should improve along the new overpass 
immediately, because two sharp curves created by the detour will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also is scheduled to begin widening the Simi Valley Freeway in 
mid-September, close to the date of the planned reopening of the Granada Hills 
bridges. That project will begin on the western end of the freeway and should 
not impact or be delayed by the repairs over Bull Creek, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That $22.4-million widening project is expected to alleviate a long-standing 
traffic tie-up on the freeway by adding lanes to both sides of the freeway from 
just west of the Ventura County line to the Golden State Freeway. Lane closures 
for the widening should only occur at night or off-peak hours, officials said.

UNWELCOME SUPPORT; PARENTS: THOSE WHO HAVE ORGANIZED CENTERS AT CITY SCHOOLS 
ARE NOT PLEASED WITH DISTRICT PLANS TO TAKE CHARGE AND STANDARDIZE THEIR 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just one more case of school district bureaucrats meddling in a program that's 
doing just fine, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the reaction of many who learned recently that the Los Angeles Unified 
School District is planning a takeover of "parent centers" that have spread to 
about 75 campuses citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers have in the past few years evolved into unique programs, all 
without much help, or notice, from the district. Largely reflecting the 
interests of parent volunteers, the centers have offered classes ranging from 
language to sewing and crafts. Some of the centers have offered free 
immunizations; others have held workshops on discipline, report cards and 
getting the most out of teacher conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, district officials say they want to take charge and standardize the 
parent center offerings. Critics say this is a step backward from district 
promises to relinquish more power to local schools and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way for change is Assistant Supt. Liliam Castillo, the newly 
appointed head of the district's 3-week-old Parent Community Services branch. 
Acting on orders from Supt. Sid Thompson -- and recommendations from a task 
force to spur parent involvement -- Castillo said she intends to revamp the 
centers and train parent volunteers to operate in a more standardized fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local centers, mostly, are not doing enough," Castillo said. "They're not 
bad, they're just a start and they really need expansion. . . . Where does the 
parent go who wants information about school budgets, programs, college 
applications? It shouldn't just be English classes and needlepoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to some of the volunteer parents who have built these small 
programs on a shoe-string budget. They work with little money and, in some 
cases, without even a regular classroom in which to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, this is ridiculous," said Tony Alcala, who has helped several 
schools establish their parent centers. "They're going to take control and 
every time a parent center wants to do something, we'll have to ask for 
permission from Downtown. I do not support this at all and I don't trust that 
they will really help us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district disagrees. In line with their efforts to reform and restructure 
the school system, officials say they want these centers to be located at all 
campuses, and to be responsive to all parents -- not just a small group of 
mothers and fathers who have the time to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some school administrators are siding with parents. Although they admit 
the programs now serve only a small number of parents, they benefit many who 
never before volunteered or spent much time at their children's school. 
</P>
<P>
 They say just getting a parent to come to school for something other than to 
drop off or pick up their children is a giant step. And, like some parents, 
they question whether the district bureaucracy will able to do as well or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a core of very dedicated, intelligent and hard-working 
people," said Kathleen O'Driscoll, the assistant principal at Oxnard Street 
Elementary School in North Hollywood. "The first goal is to get the parents 
involved in the school and to help make them feel comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
 The centers, the majority of which were created over the last couple of years, 
draw parents by offering the free classes and workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the centers reflects the interests of the coordinators and the parents 
themselves, but most offer language courses for non-English speaking parents, 
as well as sewing and crafts classes. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Castillo says the new parent unit wants to support the schools 
and help make the centers more useful and interesting. She said the goal is to 
open parent centers on all campuses, offering parent education classes as well 
as health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 With district officials directing the centers, she said, parents throughout 
the city will receive the same information and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just not equal in terms of what they do now," Castillo said. "I think 
they are working in some communities but not in all. If you're the middle-class 
Valley parent who only belongs to the local PTA, you're not getting the same 
information as the parent who goes to a parent center and finds out more."  
</P>
<P>
 The centers are mostly in predominantly minority schools with low-income 
students because three years ago the district set aside some special Chapter 
One funding. Last year, for example, the district spent about $300,000 for all 
75 centers. 
</P>
<P>
 While every region of the giant school district has at least one parent 
center, most -- 50 -- are in the San Fernando Valley. Assistant Supt. Sally 
Coughlin, who until recently oversaw all Valley elementary schools, distributed 
the special funds allocated to the Valley to schools that wanted to establish 
the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want it to be a cookie-cutter movement," Coughlin said. "We wanted 
them to be different and unique. It just grew through word-of-mouth, but the 
problem has been finding the space on these crowded campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas of the city, regional centers were created so that parents from 
different schools could attend classes together and get to know each other. 
Centers have also been started at schools without special Chapter One funds 
after parents became interested in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabel Martinez, a mother of eight who helped open the first parent center in 
the district at Telfair Avenue Elementary in Pacoima, said she has seen 
dramatic changes in the mothers who have taken classes at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the way they walk, you can tell they've had our classes," Martinez 
said. "They're more sure of themselves, they're proud to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 While Martinez says the centers need to be expanded, she says the parents 
should be the ones deciding how they are run and what classes are offered. 
"We're working well here," Martinez said. "It's very rewarding. I've seen the 
changes in these women." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Martinez said that the district could be helpful "as long as 
we're asking them -- not them asking us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Room 21 at Noble Avenue Elementary in North Hills, more than 250 parents 
meet regularly for classes on motivating their children, discipline and the 
importance of higher education. Louis Carrillo, a school coordinator, said the 
parents need to be in charge of their center. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (district officials) come in with a mandatory set of ideas, I see 
that as a potential problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard Street, where an enthusiastic group met last week to discuss the 
fall's course offerings, the parents say they are proud of their work. The 
group met in a cramped office, their voices often drowned out by a copy 
machine, and settled on English, sewing and arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that I can make a difference," said Susana Martinez, a mother of 
two who coordinates the Oxnard parent center. "I can come here and make 
change."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCIL MAY DECIDE ON FILING OF APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote tonight whether to appeal a judge's 
decision to allow widening of Thousand Oaks Boulevard to accommodate the 
Ahmanson Ranch housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Charles Cate said the city attorney would be consulted on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will announce its decision after the closed session, which will be 
attended by City Atty. Casey Vose, Cate said. The council meets at 7:30 p.m. at 
City Hall, 26135 Mureau Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 residences, two golf courses and 
400,000 square feet of commercial space in the hills southeast of Simi Valley 
on the border of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson sued Calabasas after the city refused to act on the developer's 
request to widen from two to four lanes a quarter-mile section of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. The city has argued that a wider road would add thousands of cars 
and disrupt traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was issued Aug. 8 by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like the city to process the application. We think it's a valid 
request, and the court has ruled that it's a valid request, and we hope they 
would process it," Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson Land Co., said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas has already appealed another Superior Court ruling, which concluded 
the project's developers have done everything possible to minimize the impact 
of the project on the environment and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 That court decision came after Calabasas and eight other parties, including 
the city and county of Los Angeles, challenged the validity of an environmental 
impact review of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't agree with the decision, and we still think our original points are 
correct," Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits have stalled the controversial development, which was approved by 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors more than two years ago. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUCK ELEVATOR HALTS FOES OF BILLBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A protest over controversial radio station billboards came to a halt Tuesday 
when 16 picketers got stuck in an elevator on their way up to the station's 
executive offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The trapped protesters were among nearly 50 Latino activists who gathered in 
Burbank to protest Power 106 Radio Station's recent ad campaign, which promotes 
a morning show hosted by "2 Fat Mexicanz." 
</P>
<P>
 The protest grew quiet, however, when the elevator stopped between the ground 
and first floors of the 10-story building in the 2600 block of West Olive 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a Burbank fire company, several Burbank police officers and the 
building's elevator technicians more than an hour to pry open the elevator, 
which was on its way to the eighth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sure didn't expect anything like this to happen today," said Burbank 
Officer Dan Yadon, who was monitoring the picketers outside before they entered 
the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rescue effort, several leaders of the day's protest said their 
organizations will try again to meet with the station executives.  
</P>
<P>
 "This matter isn't resolved," said Bert Corona, executive director of 
Hermandad Mexicana, a Latino civil rights group with headquarters in North 
Hollywood. "We're going to put a stop to these racist advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad campaign has been the focus of debate since July, when about 40 
billboards went up throughout the city to advertise the station's four-hour 
morning show that features two overweight Latino men from Bakersfield who are 
called the "Baka Boyz" or "2 Fat Mexicanz." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards show the pair in three scenarios -- one with them on toilets, 
pants around their ankles.  
</P>
<P>
 "This not only depicts Mexicans in a demeaning, offensive manner, but refers 
to the oldest and most classic stereotype of a Mexican -- fat and stupid," said 
Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids like the show, which scares me because it's like they're being served 
sugar-coated poison," said Silver Lake resident Maria Diaz, who has five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle Rose, president of Power 106, believes the billboards have been 
misunderstood by a portion of the community that isn't familiar with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a result of numerous complaints to the station, all advertisements 
depicting the brothers on toilets have been removed and replaced with 
billboards showing the pair standing behind surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize now that it wasn't a good campaign technique," said Rose. "Our 
intent was to depict these guys as fun, and not display tones of racism. We 
hope that by taking down these billboards that we will defuse some of the 
controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the reference to "2 Fat Mexicanz" is a nickname the morning show 
hosts gave themselves and have used on the air for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baka Boyz are rare, Latino role models to Los Angeles young people," said 
Rose. "Our audience considers them as such, and has responded favorably to the 
phrase '2 Fat Mexicanz.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Vidal, the younger of the brothers, said he's proud of the nickname and 
can't understand why it's being criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can Mexicans be racist against Mexicans?" said Vidal. "We're proud of who 
and what we are. We're proud that we're Mexican and we're proud that we're fat. 
Most of the people who are making judgments about us haven't even listened to 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Vidal believes the billboards were misinterpreted from the start. "We 
have fun on the show, and that's what we're trying to tell everyone on the 
billboards," he said. "We're also comfortable with who we are. Everybody needs 
to come together and be proud of who they are. That's all we're trying to say."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; RESIDENTS CRITICIZE 'GHOST TOWN' GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguing that the guards should be armed, residents and police in North Hills 
Tuesday sharply criticized a security company hired by the city to protect a 
string of North Hills apartments that became a "ghost town" when abandoned 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area looks worse now than when the security guards came on," said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Henry Acosta, who patrols the nine apartment buildings 
on Orion Avenue. "These guys are sitting there while people break through their 
security system and enter the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen fires inside the buildings where vagrants cook and the guards are 
taking no action," said Eddie Gonzalez. "I have even offered the phone in my 
house for them to call the police." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrations were expressed at a meeting of the North Hills Task Force, 
where about 40 residents, city officials, apartment managers and social service 
agency heads gathered at the Sepulveda Methodist Church on Rayen Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this tempest was Inter-Con Security Systems, an 
Alhambra-based security company that has been providing two unarmed guards at 
the abandoned complexes since July. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the $600,000 security contract is paid for by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, 10% by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, the federal agency granted $2.8 million to the city to 
board up, fence off and protect 12 designated "ghost towns" that have been 
abandoned since the quake, making them magnets for prostitutes, drug dealers 
and vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is managed by the city of Los Angeles Housing Department, which 
hopes to use the opportunity granted by the quake while the buildings are 
abandoned to contact owners, banks and managers to clean up the apartment 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Devonshire police station Capt. Vance Proctor said that vagrants and drug 
dealers must be kept out of the buildings before any cleanup can be 
accomplished, and that means arming the guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as federal money is around, we've got to get them to do the job they 
are paid to do and get them armed to do the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Inter-Con operations manager Bud Larguier Jr. told Proctor and 
residents that he was "distressed" by reports that his guards turned their 
backs on crime occurring in the apartment buildings, he said the city contract 
does not call for them to engage criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys are not law enforcement officers," Larguier said. "They are in an 
observe and report role." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Luna, director of the city Housing Department's neighborhood recovery 
program, added that the city was warned by police in Foothill Station against 
using armed guards, since confrontations with weapons could escalate into a 
situation that leads to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, Larguier promised to meet with city officials, 
residents and police to come to a solution, including the possibility of arming 
the guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the system perfect? Absolutely not," Larguier said. "If the city wants us 
to, we would have armed guards out in the next few days." JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BROKEN PIPE SHUTS DOWN WATER SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ruptured pipe cut off water service to about 400 homes in the Glenoaks 
Canyon area before dawn Tuesday, although city officials were hoping to have 
service restored by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident reported seeing water gushing from the street near the intersection 
of Edwards Place and Gardner Place in Glendale at about 2:30 a.m., officials 
said. A water main located next to a pumping plant that serves a city reservoir 
in the canyon broke apart, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons into the 
street, said Bernard Palk, the city's public service director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exactly clear at this point what caused the break," Palk said. "I 
inspected the break and there was significant damage. It could have been latent 
from the earthquake, or from the age of the pipe." The pipe is 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage also could have been caused by the roots of three large pine trees 
growing over the water main, he added. Efforts to repair the pipe were delayed 
because workers had to remove the trees to reach it, Palk said. 
</P>
<P>
 To isolate the damaged pipe, workers shut off valves serving the entire 
eastern section of the canyon, roughly from Edwards Place to Scholl Canyon 
Park, said Don Froelich, the city's water services administrator. The repair 
work, including filling a hole that was dug around the pipe and cleaning up mud 
from the streets, was not expected to be finished until about 4:30 a.m. today 
or later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Morita of Edwards Place said it was the most serious breakdown in water 
service in the 22 years he has lived in the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the longest we've been without water, but we're making do with what 
we had in the refrigerator, just a couple of quarts of water," said Morita, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jacobs, an 18-year resident, said the biggest inconvenience was the 
inability to flush the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants them to fix it right away, but when it's a problem this big 
and they've got that many people working on it, we just have to be patient," 
said Jacobs, 58. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GARDEN PLOT HELPS PATIENTS TO GROW 
</P>

<P>
 Build it and they will come. Plant them and they will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the two messages Melinda Villarreal of the Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center delivered to both hospital administrators and her patients 
whenever she was asked about the feasibility of using a vegetable garden as 
psychological therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the director of the hospital's new Partial Hospitalization Program, 
Villarreal is pledged to helping her chronically disturbed and temporarily 
depressed patients assimilate into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon accepting her current position three years ago, she immediately pitched 
the idea of a garden as a means to instill self-esteem and daily responsibility 
in her patients. 
</P>
<P>
 While her supervisors supported the idea, there never was any room or money to 
implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the hospital started reconfiguring its parking lot and 
Villarreal asked administrators to set aside a small plot of land for the 
gardening project. 
</P>
<P>
 With the land, two 4-by-6-foot plots of dirt, Villarreal immediately 
introduced her patients to the concept of gardening. But problems introduced 
themselves from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean we have to get in there and dig?" some patients asked when presented 
with the prospect of tilling the soil before planting the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't like it at all at first, but it took about five minutes to 
convince them it would be fun," said Villarreal. "Before then, I'd never 
planted a seed before in my life. So I was just as new to the process as they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking by an abundance of vegetables and spices that were soon growing, 
Administrative Director of Behavioral Medicine Services Patricia Prouty spotted 
12 stalks of corn swaying in the middle of the parking lot and suggested that 
Villarreal call the garden "The Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it truly was one," recalled Villarreal. "We picked a few ears of corn to 
see what they tasted like and they were as sweet as sugar." ANTONIO OLIVO

 City officials and a group of about 20 veterans hope to raise up to $100,000 
in the coming year to construct a memorial to Glendale's war dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has a small memorial to its Vietnam veterans in the Montrose area but 
the proposed monument in front of City Hall would honor all the city's men and 
women killed or missing in action in every military conflict since 1906, when 
Glendale was chartered, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encompass as many of the wars that citizens of Glendale have 
participated in since 1906, as far back as the Spanish-American War and as 
recent as Desert Storm," said Roy Lopez, an engineer in the city's Public Works 
Department and a member of the Glendale-Montrose-Crescenta Valley War Memorial 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial is to be located next to the Peace Globe at Broadway and Isabel 
Street. That is Glendale's only other tribute to its war dead aside from the 
Montrose memorial and the site of the city's annual Memorial Day ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff of Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale) is helping the memorial 
committee compile, from Defense Department statistics, a list of all of 
Glendale's war dead and MIAs, but that task could take months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number could be in the hundreds, maybe even in the thousands, but we 
really can't even speculate at this point," said Ray Cruz, an assistant in the 
city manager's office who is coordinating the efforts to build the monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will really be a factor as far as how big the memorial is going to be 
and how much it's going to cost," Cruz said. "In Pasadena, they have a simple 
square block that cost $30,000, but we're thinking something bigger and much 
more elaborate." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, architectural sketches have been completed on four possible designs. 
Lopez said the memorial will have one to three panels and will likely be 
expandable to include the names of soldiers lost in potential future conflicts. 
Before a design is approved, it will be voted on by the memorial committee and 
presented to the public before consideration by the City Council, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, the design depends on how much money we can raise from the 
citizens," Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the memorial committee deposited a check for $1,000 with the 
Glendale Community Foundation to establish a donor fund. Donations can be sent 
to P.O. Box 313, Glendale 91209. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MEDICAL CENTER OPENS NEW HIV UNIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thompson Memorial Medical Center in Burbank officially opened its new HIV 
unit Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immune Wellness Unit, which will provide both short- and long-term care 
for patients who have tested positive for HIV, is staffed with doctors and 
nurses specializing in infectious diseases, hematology and oncology. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the concept of having an HIV unit in its hospital, the board of 
directors at Thompson Memorial put together a task force of physicians to 
determine which services were needed the most in the Burbank area. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force recommended that the hospital focus on AIDS prevention and, for 
that reason, the hospital decided the unit would accept patients who were only 
infected with the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will treat them in an out-patient setting," says hospital spokeswoman 
Cathy David.  
</P>
<P>
 With four units equipped with beds, sleep couches and refrigerators, the 
Immune Wellness Unit focuses on a sense of family and community.  
</P>
<P>
 Its full-time staff includes licensed clinical social workers, a respiratory 
care practitioner, an epidemiologist, a pharmacist and a dietitian. ANTONIO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; SAV-ON LIKELY TO REOPEN, SAYS BUILDING OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Silent and dark and swathed in graffiti since the Northridge earthquake, the 
Ventura Boulevard Sav-On Drugs store is inching toward a reopening, according 
to owners of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have been negotiating a new, more expensive lease with the 
Anaheim-based drugstore chain, which leases the site, according to co-owner 
Frank Ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the talks have been under way, the store has remained closed, causing 
residents to wonder when, if ever, it would reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sav-On's is a big factor in our community," said community leader Jeff Brain. 
"When you drive down Ventura Boulevard and you see Sav-On boarded up like that, 
it's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 While lease negotiations may be wrapped up by early September, Ponder said, 
repairs will not begin immediately, because owners must first seek building 
permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the negotiations is the rent that Sav-On will pay.  
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the earthquake, thanks to a lease agreement signed in the 1970s, the 
drugstore was paying only about 20 cents per square foot for the 
37,000-square-foot store, or about $7,400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual market value for the property is approximately $1 per square foot, 
which would mean a monthly rent of $37,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ponder would not disclose the new rent, he said that it would be 
higher than before, but still be below-market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a long-term relationship with Sav-On and we want to have that 
continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue in the talks is how much Sav-On will contribute to the cost of 
repairing the building, Ponder said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sav-On could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused major structural damage to the drugstore, including a 
partial roof cave-in. Ponder said he is not sure of the dollar amount of the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 While numerous Valley Sav-On stores suffered damage in the temblor, Woodland 
Hills is the only other store that remains closed. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PARTIAL MOTEL VICTORY ON SECURITY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday reduced security conditions 
against the owners of three Van Nuys motels targeted by the city as magnets for 
crime and recommended that they should not be made to reimburse the city for 
being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victory by the Cinema, El Cortez and Town House motels was only 
partial, as Planning and Land Use Management Committee members Laura Chick and 
Hal Bernson recommended against allowing the motels to rent rooms more than 
once a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the three motels were among five along Sepulveda Boulevard that were 
labeled public nuisances by city zoning officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the motel owners were ordered to hire 24-hour security, reimburse 
the city more than $4,000 for the cost of the city probe and impose nearly two 
dozen other conditions to prevent loitering by prostitutes and drug dealers.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other motels -- the Chateau and Bali Hi -- did not appeal the findings, 
but on Tuesday, city officials said Chick and Bernson agreed that the security 
could be negotiated with Los Angeles police officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of 24-hour on-call security, the motels can implement eight- to 
12-hour security, said Associate Zoning Administrator Dan Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some flexibility there," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council must still vote on whether to accept the committee's 
recommendations on the motel conditions or whether to implement other 
conditions. The issue is expected to come before the council on Sept. 13, Green 
said. JEFF SCHNAUFER SECURITY

DUST CLOUD AFTER QUAKE CAUSED VALLEY FEVER, SCIENTISTS CONCLUDE; HEALTH: 
WINDBLOWN DEBRIS IS BLAMED FOR FLU-LIKE AILMENT. RESEARCHERS WILL DECLARE THE 
SIMI VALLEY OUTBREAK THE FIRST KNOWN TO BE LINKED TO A TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cloud of dust rising from the Santa Susana Mountains after the Jan. 17 
earthquake very likely brought on the unprecedented outbreak of valley fever 
that plagued Simi Valley and much of eastern Ventura County this spring, 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months of interviews and analysis, scientists at the Centers for 
Disease Control have concluded that residents caught in the dust cloud were 
most likely to contract the flu-like ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 203 cases of valley fever diagnosed among Ventura County residents 
in the weeks after the quake. That contrasts with 52 cases for all of 1993. One 
71-year-old Simi Valley man died in this year's outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe that disease-bearing spores were stirred up in landslides 
caused by the quake and its aftershocks, then swept with the wind across the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spores are often in the ground, but they're pretty much just sitting 
there," explained Richard Spiegel, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. 
"Basically from all the ground shaking, that unleashed significantly more dust 
than you might normally have." 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC team will declare the Simi Valley outbreak the first known to be 
related to an earthquake when it presents conclusions at a Stanford University 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But one local health official is disputing the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 'Piddle paddle," said Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for 
Los Angeles County. "I have to tell you I disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley, hardest hit by the magnitude 6.8 quake, had little 
change in its rate of disease, she said. Only 46 cases have been reported this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease, a fungal infection known to scientists as coccidioidomycosis, 
manifests no real symptoms in about 60% of cases. Other victims experience 
flu-like exhaustion, coughing, even high fevers and pneumonia. Older people are 
usually more severely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin believes that Ventura and the CDC overreacted to the valley fever 
scare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called everything with a positive lab test for antibodies a case of 
valley fever," she said. She said tests would have been positive if a patient 
had contracted the illness any time in the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials did not count a case as valley fever until 
further tests or active symptoms confirmed the disease, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC researchers defended their findings, saying all of the Ventura County 
cases were confirmed with blood tests. The direction of the wind or the amount 
of fungus found in paved-over San Fernando Valley could account for the low 
incidence there, said Eileen Schneider, a CDC epidemiologist from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of the Valley did not have 
the same landslide activity that occurred in the Santa Susana range near Simi 
Valley. While the northern edge of the Valley also borders the Santa Susanas, 
winds were blowing toward Simi Valley after the quake, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake and each of its aftershocks brought up a cloud of ocher dust from 
the canyons around Simi Valley. The highest concentrations of valley fever 
cases lay in the neighborhoods near the base of the mountains north of the 
city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A map hanging in Ventura County's Public Health Services Department shows 
graphically how valley fever spores may have spread. Dozens of push pins are 
clustered in the Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The pins fan out on a southwest course, with several cases in Thousand Oaks, 
and thin out farther from the mountains on the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura and CDC officials believed from the start that the earthquake had 
kicked off the valley fever outbreak, but conducted tests this spring aimed at 
proving their theory. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked valley fever victims if they had been in a dust cloud, and more 
than a third responded that they had. 
</P>
<P>
 They tested a random sample of the Simi Valley population for overall exposure 
to the fungus causing valley fever and found fewer than 6% had been exposed. 
They tracked the cases and found that the incidence of the disease returned to 
normal levels about two months after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they studied the age, race and other demographic factors for victims 
and found nothing to suggest another reason for the outbreak, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes it name from the San Joaquin Valley, where it is most 
commonly found. In recent years, Kern County has been plagued with thousands of 
cases of the ailment, particularly among farm workers.

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys motorcyclist was killed Tuesday when he lost control of his cycle 
as he tried to brake to avoid a slow-moving car with its lights off on the San 
Diego Freeway, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Lovins, 24, died shortly after midnight on the freeway just south of Bel 
Air Crest Road, said Officer Maria Ingram of the CHP's West Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovins, who was driving about 50 m.p.h., "panicked and locked up his rear 
tire," Ingram said. "He didn't hit the car, but he hit the pavement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcyclist was declared dead at the scene by the coroner's office, 
Ingram said. The investigation is continuing.

PANEL WANTS STEEL-FRAME BUILDINGS CODES ALTERED; ORDINANCE: TEMPORARY MEASURE 
WOULD CHANGE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEAM-TO-COLUMN CONNECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City building officials recommended Tuesday that the Los Angeles City Council 
enact a temporary ordinance to alter the way steel-frame buildings are 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would change part of the current building code section governing 
requirements for beam-to-column connections in steel-frame buildings -- the 
major source of problems in those types of buildings that were damaged during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been found that the connection doesn't perform adequately and we don't 
want any additional buildings to be built with this connection," said Richard 
Holguin, assistant chief of the city's Building Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for an emergency design standard, expected to go before the full 
council next week, was made Tuesday during a special meeting of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Earthquake Recovery and was prompted by post-quake inspections 
that found serious problems in the welded connections of steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 110 steel-frame commercial buildings -- most of them in the Valley or 
on the Westside -- were damaged during the quake. Another 900 such buildings 
could be in danger if another major quake hits Los Angeles, according to the 
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows at this point that (the current code section) doesn't perform 
to the expectations of the engineering community," Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in steel-frame buildings, horizontal beams and vertical columns are 
welded together. In some buildings, these connections broke or cracked during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsection of the code that would be suspended by the temporary ordinance 
currently allows builders of steel-frame structures to build without conducting 
involved studies and tests to prove that their connections are sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin described the code section as "sort of a cookbook approach to the 
design of that connection. . . . It told you specifically, 'If you do this and 
this, you don't have to go into an elaborate test procedure to show that the 
design will work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would require builders to meet more detailed design 
requirements and perform a more in-depth study of the connections, Holguin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have to . . . prove to the department that the connection will 
work, based on design, based on tests, or both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailer Martin, a private structural engineer, spoke before the committee and 
showed photographs of welded joints that cracked during the quake. Some cracks 
were three-eighths of an inch long. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 steel-frame buildings Martin has inspected in West Los Angeles and 
in the Valley, he said 21 "have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's widespread and it needs to be addressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would only apply to new buildings that have not 
previously been issued permits and not to existing buildings or those being 
repaired, Holguin said. It would remain in effect for a maximum of one year, 
but would be followed by a proposal for permanent changes, Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final answer will depend on some of the testing taking place," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, tests on steel-frame buildings are being conducted at UC Berkeley 
and at the University of Texas, Austin.

VALLEY BRIEFING: SCHOOL QUAKE SAFETY ; DISTRICTS SCRAMBLE TO BE READY FOR THE 
NEXT ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, a state task force told lawmakers that schoolchildren might be in 
serious danger if a major earthquake strikes when classes are in session. A 
report prepared by the task force formed after the Northridge Earthquake 
pointed out that school buildings and staffs should be better equipped to 
handle catastrophic situations. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the last 10 major earthquakes in California have struck while school 
is in session, but members of the task force said the state's luck will not 
likely hold. By not being properly prepared school districts open themselves up 
to a potential "tsunami of litigation" should injuries occur at school during a 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said local districts are lax in their implementation of safety 
procedures and of programs to secure furniture and fixtures that might topple 
onto students during violent shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of how the Los Angeles Unified School District handled the earthquake 
crisis, released last month, recommended that the district secure equipment and 
furniture in classrooms and offices. The district is attempting to secure 
federal funds for those improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $600-million maintenance backlog, school district officials say they 
have not had the money nor the resources to regularly inspect school buildings, 
let alone make the seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how Valley-area school districts compare. The chart shows how many 
schools were built before 1976 -- when new construction standards were adopted 
-- how they have been upgraded to withstand earthquakes, how frequently they 
are inspected and whether furniture and fixtures are secured against quakes.

MAN RECEIVES 10 DAYS IN JAIL IN HAWK SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Sylmar man was sentenced to 10 days in jail Tuesday for shooting 
a red-tailed hawk, which is protected by state law, with an air gun as it 
perched on a utility pole near his home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvyn Antonio Rodriguez, 22, pleaded no contest to one count of unlawfully 
taking a bird of prey, according to a statement by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The red-tailed hawk, which is on the state's list of protected species, was 
taken in by a neighbor who saw the bird fall to the ground after it was shot 
with a pellet gun. It was treated and released, said Donald Cocek, the deputy 
city attorney who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was cited by the state Department of Fish and Game on July 6 after a 
neighbor reported the shooting, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his jail term, which begins Sept. 7, Van Nuys Municipal Court 
Judge Michael Knight ordered Rodriguez to make a $500 donation to the Raptor 
Rehabilitation and Release Program in Simi Valley.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN HELD IN SHOOTING OVER SNAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale man who was apparently terrified of snakes tried to kill one in his 
yard Tuesday, then shot another man who taunted him because of his fear, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Osborne, 30, tried to kill a nonpoisonous snake in the yard of an 
apartment complex in the 38700 block of 20th Street East when the victim, who 
was not identified, picked up the snake and began taunting Osborne, said Deputy 
Paul Ullman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman described the victim as a 36-year-old resident of the same apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne and the man argued for several minutes before Osborne went back to his 
apartment and returned carrying a .357 magnum revolver and shot the victim once 
in the stomach, Ullman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was in critical condition at Palmdale General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and was being held on 
$545,000 bail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, Ullman said.

A STRAY SURVIVOR; FELINE WAS SEALED IN AN ATTIC WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Curiosity didn't kill this cat, but it came awfully close. 
</P>
<P>
 A cat was found alive after being trapped in the attic of a Sand Canyon house 
for more than two weeks with no food or water, despite several days of 
record-breaking heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the feline sneaked through a hole in roof made Aug. 5 while 
workers repaired earthquake damage to the house's chimney and was sealed 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The black, female cat, estimated to be about a year old, was discovered in the 
attic Sunday by Georgia George when she returned home from a vacation to 
Europe. George said she and her niece, Mary Mingo, of Reno, heard faint 
meowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was on the roof, so we looked all over the roof with a 
flashlight and we couldn't find anything," she said. "The more we listened to 
its little meow, the more we figured out it was in the attic." 
</P>
<P>
 Mingo placed a dish of water near the attic's entrance to lure the cat, George 
said. She said the cat was so thin she could put her fingers around it "like a 
bracelet." 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't believe how lightweight it was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposed water pipes in the attic may have saved the cat's life by providing 
condensation, George said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been feeding the cat small amounts of food at a time and it appears to 
be recovering its strength. In fact, she said, it has started scratching her 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for the real owner because I really don't want a cat," she 
said, adding she will keep and feed it outside if nobody claims it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat is the second Santa Clarita Valley feline to become trapped because of 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Tiffany, a 10-year-old Persian mix, panicked 
during the earthquake and ran into a storage shed. Neighbors found her barely 
alive 41 days later. She died of malnutrition several days later.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PEITZ PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN WIFE'S SLAYING; 
COURTS: MAN ORDERED HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN DEATH OF NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH ACTIVIST, 
WHOSE SHOOTING HE BLAMED ON VAGRANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 38-year-old postal worker pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he 
killed his wife, a Neighborhood Watch activist whose death he initially blamed 
on an intruder who was angry about her crime-fighting work. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief arraignment, Antelope Municipal Court Judge Ian R. Grant ordered 
that Jeffrey D. Peitz of Palmdale continue to be held without bail. Grant 
scheduled the next court hearing in the case Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz, dressed in yellow county jail clothes, said little more than "Yes, your 
honor," during the hearing. His attorney, Deputy Public Defender Felicia Grant, 
declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sheriff's investigators continued to compile evidence Tuesday to 
support their belief that Peitz -- and not a home intruder upset about the 
family's crime-fighting work -- shot Teri Lynn Peitz, 37, to death Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't buy into the Neighborhood Watch thing," said Los Angeles County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo. 
</P>
<P>
 He said sheriff's investigators were looking into reports that Jeffrey Peitz 
was romantically involved with a co-worker and was anxious to collect insurance 
money stemming from his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Peitz told investigators and reporters that he had a happy marriage, 
"there is evidence that there was substantial discord in that house," the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Portillo said, crime lab technicians were running tests on a 
homemade silencer recovered from the family's home to determine whether it had 
been used in the slaying. The silencer, made from a tennis ball slit open on 
one side, was designed to be placed over the barrel of a rifle to muffle the 
sound, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that it has two holes on the other side that may have been caused by 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo said gun residue tests conducted on Jeffrey Peitz's hands came back 
negative, but said the tests are not effective if a suspect washes his hands 
after a shooting or wears gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said several discrepancies have surfaced in Peitz's 
initial account of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz told deputies that he was upstairs folding clothes, and that his wife 
had just tuned in the "Cops" show on television downstairs when he heard 
popping sounds. He said he went downstairs and saw a man running out the screen 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave deputies the man's name, saying he, his wife and other Neighborhood 
Watch members had confronted the man for being an illegal squatter in a local 
house. But investigators said the man named by Peitz produced proof that he had 
flown to Michigan before the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz said the shooting happened just after "Cops" began at 9 p.m., but 911 
records show that he did not call for help until 9:34 p.m., Portillo said. That 
would have given him about half an hour to remove evidence from the crime 
scene, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Peitz denied to deputies that he was having an 
extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week with a reporter, he also dismissed the insurance 
money as a motive, pointing out that many couples have such policies. "It would 
have been smarter if she had killed me," Peitz quipped. "I have better 
insurance."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CABLE FIRM SUED OVER SALES CALLS; LAW: ANNOYED 
WITH TIME WARNER CABLE TELEMARKETERS, BOB ARKOW IS ASKING FOR DAMAGES AND SOME 
PEACE OF MIND IN SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man fed up with telemarketers has filed a civil lawsuit against his cable 
company, claiming its representatives have called him repeatedly, despite his 
requests to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arkow, 44, said he is suing Time Warner Cable in Canyon Country because 
hanging up the phone doesn't send the right message. "They wind up saying, 
'This sales pitch he didn't take,' and they try to give you the next one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow said he was called by a telemarketer twice last year, but did not file a 
lawsuit because the company gave him $500 worth of free service and promised 
not to call him again. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he received another call July 14 and filed the small claims 
lawsuit after several discussions with the company, which offered no 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Binder, general manager of Time Warner, declined to discuss the 
allegations in the lawsuit stating he doesn't want to invade a customer's 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Binder said Time Warner hires reputable telemarketing companies that do 
business nationwide, and that they only call customers once or twice a year to 
sell promotional packages for premium channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel most of our customers are not offended," he said. "I haven't been 
taking a large number of complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Newhall Municipal Court, seeks $2,000 for punitive 
damages and breach of contract, plus unspecified legal fees so Arkow can obtain 
a restraining order preventing the company from calling his home or business. 
The case is set for trial Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow is used to tackling telemarketers head-on. He belongs to Private Citizen 
Inc., a nationwide group with about 3,000 members.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, which has as its phone number (800) CUTJUNK, sends a membership 
directory to various telemarketing companies, demanding a $500 fee from the 
company for any member contacted, said President Robert Bulmash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to tell telemarketers to knock it off," Bulmash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow also filed a small claims suit earlier this year against the computer 
network service Prodigy Services when the company failed to heed his request 
not to call again. The case was settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Arkow claims to have successfully battled off most of the 
telemarketing companies trying to pitch their wares to him. He said his secret 
is playing along with the telemarketer: complimenting the caller's 
professionalism, getting his or her name, the name of the company, supervisors' 
names and any other information he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he talks to a company supervisor, finding out if the business has a 
federally mandated do-not-call policy that requires the company not to make any 
subsequent calls to a customer who makes such a request. Arkow said many 
companies don't -- but the threat of legal action ensures they don't call 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow also has taken his case to City Hall by drafting a proposed ordinance 
making it illegal for telemarketers operating within Santa Clarita to call 
people without their written permission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson said he has given Arkow's ordinance to 
city officials for legal review, although he doesn't know if the matter will 
ever come before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said he "supports the idea" of what Arkow is trying to do, but would 
prefer a less restrictive policy that would prohibit companies from callings 
residents who ask not to be contacted. This is similar to what already exists 
at the federal level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Pederson said he already has a foolproof system for handling 
telemarketing calls, at least from one company who calls often. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lie to them every time," he said. "I say, 'No hablo Ingles.' "

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RESIDENTS ASKED TO REPORT STREET QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local residents have until Friday to report earthquake-related street or 
sidewalk damage to the city, which will then use federal emergency funds to 
hire a contractor to do repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has a list of "a hundred or so" locations needing repair because of 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and its aftershocks, said City Project 
Engineer Bill Yee.He said residents are being asked to report damage so nothing 
will be overlooked when a final list is submitted for bid Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will get those they previously thought were insignificant," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has spent $1.2 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) funds to repair streets, gutters, curbs and sidewalks, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yee estimated that less than $100,000 worth of repairs remain. They are 
scheduled for completion in October. 
</P>
<P>
 To report damage, call (805) 255-4954.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; $1 MILLION WORTH OF DRUGS SEIZED IN BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators have made one of the 
largest drug busts in the Antelope Valley this year, seizing $1 million worth 
of cocaine, methamphetamines and marijuana, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found five pounds of methamphetamines, four pounds of marijuana, six 
ounces of almost pure cocaine and an ounce of hashish after serving a search 
warrant at the Ramada Inn in Palmdale last Thursday, according to Sgt. Larry 
Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recovered was $3,000 in cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were arrested at the hotel and a third person was apprehended a 
short distance away, authorities said. They are being held at the Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station on suspicion of possessing illegal drugs for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 The names of the suspects were not released. Bail was set at $100,000 for 
each, Boyce said.

 Last month, a smoldering cigarette tossed from a passing car touched off a 
one-acre fire near the ignition point of last October's devastating Laguna 
Beach fire. Last weekend, a rifle bullet fired at a metal target ignited a 
brush fire that blackened 180 acres in the Cleveland National Forest.And the 
worst of the Southern California fire season is not yet upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 One top official of the Los Angeles County Fire Department warned last week 
that dry weather and brush have created a potential for disastrous fires. The 
traditional fire season will not begin until next month but already there have 
been flare-ups that are worrisome, particularly at a time when memories of last 
year's fires in Altadena, Malibu and Laguna Beach are so fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Some individuals' lack of safety concern has been astounding. One Orange 
County fire official said he was speechless at learning that someone had 
discarded a burning cigarette in an area where 400 homes were destroyed by fire 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland National Forest blaze also illustrated the need for caution. A 
firearms instructor told investigators that one shot from a rifle at a metal 
target set off sparks that ignited the fire, which spread from private property 
to the federal forest. The no doubt unintentional disregard of the dangerously 
dry conditions resulted in the need to call in hundreds of firefighters and 
three water-dropping helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of little rain and with the Santa Ana winds on the horizon, it is 
especially important now to clear brush and use common sense.

VOTES ON CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past 30 years more than 500,000 people have died from gunshot wounds; 
each year 37,000 lives are lost because of gunfire, and 150,000 individuals are 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods are pleading for help, law enforcement officials are outgunned, 
but our legislators are listening to the National Rifle Assn. The next 
tough-on-crime speech we hear from any of the Orange County delegates who voted 
no, to a man, on (the crime bill) may sound a bit hollow. People want action, 
not words.

LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST EDUCATORS' FUND; COURTS: INVESTORS' CIVIL ACTION ALLEGES 
THAT UP TO $100 MILLION HAS BEEN LOST. COMPANY OFFICIALS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR 
COMMENT.

<P>
 A lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that a real estate investment fund that raised 
as much as $1 billion from 60,000 California educators has lost up to $100 
million of the investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers Management & Investment Inc. of Newport Beach -- a 26-year-old fund 
marketed by teachers for teachers across the state -- may be insolvent, 
according to the suit, which was filed in Orange County Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks immediate appointment of a receiver to run the company, which 
invests educators' retirement funds in dozens of real estate limited 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think TMI has degenerated into a Ponzi scheme," said Ron Rus, attorney for 
the four investors who filed the suit. "Some of the partnerships have property 
that has become worthless, and they are now using money from the good ones to 
keep the bad ones going." 
</P>
<P>
 TMI officials could not be reached for comment on the allegations. An employee 
at the company's headquarters said the firm's general partners, James R. Martin 
and Maurice Shuman, were traveling. Shuman's wife, reached late Tuesday at the 
couple's Newport Beach home, said her husband was traveling and that she did 
not have a number where he could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 interview with The Times, Shuman noted with pride, "In its 20 years, 
TMI has never had an investor lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI officials lost millions of dollars of investors' 
money in a "systematic and increasingly sophisticated pattern of prohibited 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the firm erected an elaborate maze of bankruptcy 
filings for its 40 or more limited partnerships and commingled funds in what 
amounted "to a Ponzi scheme undermining the security of possibly as much as $1 
billion in retirement funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit also accuses TMI of fraud, breach of contract, 
misrepresentation and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't put the money we paid where it was supposed to go," said Jean M. 
Sweeney of Fullerton, one of the investors who filed the suit. She and her 
husband, Jack, a professor at Fullerton Community College, invested $530,000 of 
their retirement funds in about two dozen TMI partnerships, she said. Jean 
Sweeney said it is unclear what her nest egg is now worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rus said the allegations in the suit have been sent to the state Department of 
Corporations, which regulates firms that sell limited partnership investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the department investigated complaints by former TMI employees and 
sales agents alleging that the firm -- then under different ownership -- 
underreported sale prices of properties to its investors to mask more than $3.5 
million in excessive real estate brokerage commissions. After a two-year 
inquiry, the department found no violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI has nothing to do with the State Teachers Retirement System, the state 
pension fund for California educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned TMI, formed in 1968 by a group of educators and real estate 
specialists, has been a vehicle for teachers and school administrators to 
sweeten their retirement funds. The money, invested through self-directed 
individual retirement accounts, has gone mainly into real estate partnerships, 
though the company also offers other investments such as mutual funds, stocks 
and bonds. The firm's motto is "Teachers Helping Teachers," and its symbol is a 
shiny red apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has supplemented its staff by hiring educators who moonlight as 
sales agents. In recent years, investors other than educators have been invited 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state's real estate market was booming during the 1970s and '80s, 
TMI investors saw annual returns that went as high as 30%. But when the market 
collapsed in the late 1980s, those handsome returns ended, according to Kay 
Seibert of Anaheim Hills, a retired college business professor who has $50,000 
of her retirement funds in TMI properties and is one of the four investors 
suing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI's real estate pools own land that cost far more 
than it is worth today and that, in some cases, loans have been refinanced 
several times so that the property is now highly leveraged. Martin and Shuman, 
both accountants, have owned the firm since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after putting some of its partnerships into bankruptcy, the suit states, 
TMI has continued to ask investors to put more money into the failed ventures, 
saying that may help them recoup their lost funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that TMI's general partners set up private management 
companies to which the firm paid large sums for services -- allegedly paying 
themselves millions of dollars a year more than the management fees stipulated 
in various partnership agreements and prospectuses.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MEXICANS ARE SEEING AND SEIZING BIG OPPORTUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Mexico's election is over and confidence about its future is running 
high, it's a good idea to look for a window or two on the Mexican economy. And 
Americans with long experience here and the Mexican president of one of the 
country's most prestigious universities offer a few. 
</P>
<P>
 When Adolf Horn Jr. retired from the U.S. foreign service here in 1963, he 
suggested to Mexican business friends that they invest in an ice cream 
business, modeled on chains such as Baskin-Robbins that Horn knew from the 
United States. Horn, then 52, saw himself keeping active as marketing 
consultant to such a business. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1963, Mexican investors were unwilling to back such a new idea. So Horn 
and his wife, Lena Bingham, started the business themselves, naming it Helados 
Bing, using the Spanish word for ice cream and part of her last name. The 
formula was simple: good ice cream, sold through walk-up windows from small, 
clean stores with bright pink, white and green decor. 
</P>
<P>
 And the business succeeded. By 1983, Helados Bing had grown to 14 stores, 
employing 200, and had introduced ideas about marketing and attractive retail 
premises to Mexico. Horn had declined offers from major firms, including 
Coca-Cola, to buy the little company. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only the first part of the story. In 1983, Horn sold Helados Bing 
because Bingham was ill with cancer. (She died in 1991.) He didn't sell to a 
big company, he explains, "but to a Mexican entrepreneur, Jose Luis Gonzalez, 
who had graduated from Monterrey Tech and worked with Coca-Cola." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn has kept an office at Helados Bing's small, white headquarters over one 
of its stores here in leafy, sprawling Guadalajara, as Gonzalez has expanded 
the chain to 340 stores by franchising throughout Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has also bought out Mexican competitors -- who arose in imitation of 
Helados Bing's success -- and become the agent for Baskin-Robbins, which now is 
spreading franchises in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 How quickly entrepreneurship has sprouted! In the span of a single generation, 
Mexican business people have been transformed from a reluctant, skeptical breed 
to risk takers eager to own a business franchise. Small business is red hot in 
Mexico despite an utter lack of low-cost credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talent in this country," says Horn, who works actively with 
the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico. "The future of this place will be 
superb; in four years we'll look back and marvel at all that has been 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Rangel-Sostmann, president of the Institute of Technology and Higher 
Education of Monterrey, looks at Mexico through a different window and is more 
restrained: "Mexico is supposed to be creating 1 million jobs a year, and we 
are not doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel, 53, heads a remarkable institution. The Monterrey Tech, as most people 
call it, was founded in 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada, patriarch of a family that 
started a brewery in Monterrey and went on to build some of Mexico's largest 
companies, including the glassmaker Vitro, which owns the U.S. firm Anchor 
Hocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza Sada, who was killed by terrorists in 1973, wanted a Mexican school 
modeled on his own alma mater, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His 
brainchild has grown into something considerably larger, however. Today, 
Monterrey Tech educates 65,000 students on 26 campuses in 25 cities throughout 
Mexico and has affiliations with more than a dozen U.S. universities, including 
UCLA and the universities of Texas, Rice and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the school trained managers for Mexico's big companies. But now 
that focus must change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our students are going to become entrepreneurs of relatively small 
businesses," says Rangel, who holds a doctorate in computer engineering from 
the University of Wisconsin. A recent survey showed that 49% of Monterrey Tech 
graduates -- including Jose Luis Gonzalez, the man who bought Helados Bing -- 
own their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "But education is not enough," says Rangel. "Look at Russia and Cuba -- their 
education is good but they remain poor." Specific training is needed, he says, 
especially in Mexico, a young country where 25 million people are in school but 
only 1 million get formal vocational training and another million get higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is to train Mexico's small companies "as first-class suppliers to 
global industry," Rangel says. He notes that the AC Delco division of General 
Motors is working with local suppliers of catalytic converters. Vitro of 
Monterrey has a program to train small supplier firms. C.A. Spalding, a 
Philadelphia tool and die maker, is working with small firms in Guadalajara to 
make dies for auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Monterrey Tech has opened a school of computer science and a 
school of environmental quality and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunities are very large," says Rangel. "Mexico is still a country 
lacking a lot of industrialization and needing many services." 
</P>
<P>
 In the election aftermath, all eyes turned to the Mexico Stock Exchange, where 
prices rose on Monday, then fell back on Tuesday as traders took profits. But 
short-term focus can be confusing. Rangel is talking about real business 
opportunity, of the kind Adolf Horn saw in Mexico 30 years ago. Horn, at 83, 
still sees marvels being accomplished, and the difference today is that Mexican 
entrepreneurs agree with him.

BLOCKBUSTER AND VIACOM MAY BE WED AFTER ALL; MERGERS: BLOCKBUSTER'S BOARD BACKS 
THE DEAL, WHICH COULD AGAIN FALL THROUGH IF VIACOM'S STOCK PRICE DROPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Directors of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. voted unanimously Tuesday to 
recommend a once-doubtful merger with Viacom Inc., setting a Sept. 29 date for 
a shareholders meeting to vote on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome could still be a cliffhanger, however, if Viacom's stock price 
drops as it did in the months following the Jan. 7 merger agreement struck by 
the two companies. But with 22% of Blockbuster's stock pledged by the company's 
founders and certain key executives, approval by a majority of Blockbuster 
shareholders appears likely, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would create an entertainment giant with operations spanning film 
and TV production, video rentals and sales, broadcasting, cable, syndication, 
publishing, sports and new media. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster shares rose 62.5 cents to $27.875 on the New York Stock Exchange 
before the announcement. Viacom Class B shares closed at $35.25, down 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Blockbuster merger agreement that gave Viacom a $1.25-billion cash 
infusion and enabled it to win a costly bidding contest in February for 
Paramount Communications Inc. But afterward, the price of Viacom stock tumbled 
to the low 20s. In early May, Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga warned 
shareholders that the board might be unable to recommend the deal, even though 
he personally was obligated to vote his shares in favor of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pundits declared the Viacom-Blockbuster merger all but dead, but the deal 
had a "drop dead" date of Sept. 30, and a "wait-and-see" attitude developed. 
Viacom's stock began to recover as the company announced certain asset sales 
and released two of the summer's biggest box office hits with Paramount's 
"Forrest Gump" and "Clear and Present Danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sources said Viacom is likely to declare a winner this week in the 
auction of its Madison Square Garden asset acquired in the Paramount takeover. 
A joint venture formed by Cablevision Systems Corp. and ITT Corp. is believed 
to have made the high bid at nearly $1 billion, but negotiations have continued 
with rival bidder Tele-Communications Inc. TCI has also proposed the 
acquisition -- through an affiliate -- of Viacom's cable TV systems and the 
merger of two pay cable services, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry sources have speculated that Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone 
would be just as happy not to complete the Blockbuster merger, because it would 
require issuing more Viacom shares and reducing his own equity from 46% to 24% 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 But one associate said Sumner left his office smiling Tuesday night, and 
others remarked that the tough-minded businessman may well be getting 
Blockbuster at a cheaper price than initially negotiated. (On the day the 
merger agreement was struck, Viacom shares closed at $41, while Blockbuster 
closed at $28.375.) 
</P>
<P>
 At Viacom's recent price, Furman Selz analyst John Tinker called the 
Blockbuster acquisition "mildly anti-dilutive to Viacom" and predicted that 
earnings could be "marginally higher" than for Viacom and Paramount alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction of Blockbuster is its strong cash flow and formidable presence 
in home video retailing. Blockbuster is expected to generate about $585 million 
in operating cash flow this year, while Viacom (with Paramount) will generate 
about $1.4 billion. Once combined, the three companies would reduce the debt 
load Viacom assumed with the Paramount acquisition to a more comfortable level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a win-win situation," said Lawrence Haverty of State Street 
Research, whose investment firm controls more than 3 million Blockbuster 
shares. Haverty, a vocal critic of the merger when Viacom shares tumbled, said, 
"Frankly, I'm surprised that the Viacom stock is where it is, but it's there," 
adding that "we will listen very carefully to the recommendation of the 
Blockbuster directors." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long and sometimes bumpy road," Huizenga conceded in a statement 
released after the board's action. " . . . We are pleased with the recent 
improvement in Viacom's stock prices. We believe that the combination with 
Viacom will result in significant value for our shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the deal, each Blockbuster share would be exchanged for 
0.08 share of Viacom Class A stock, 0.69615 share of Viacom Class B and a 
"variable common right" representing the right to receive up to 0.13829 share 
of Class B stock depending on market prices during the year after the merger.

SEC CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON STOCKBROKERS; WALL STREET: AGENCY LETTERS URGING 
THAT THE EXCHANGES REVIEW THEIR POLICIES ARE A FIRST STEP TOWARD TOUGHER 
ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the first step toward 
directing the nation's stock exchanges to impose harsher penalties and 
otherwise crack down on dishonest brokers at major Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters dated Aug. 4, copies of which were obtained Tuesday by The Times, 
the SEC urged the exchanges "to review and, if necessary, enhance sanctions" 
against brokerage employees who engage in improper sales practices. The letters 
went to the heads of the New York Stock Exchange; the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, and seven other 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the SEC's directors of market regulation and enforcement, the 
letters also called on the exchanges to make more frequent, detailed 
examinations of member firms for evidence of sales practice violations. These 
illegal practices include making trades that customers never requested, 
churning accounts by rapidly buying and selling securities to boost brokerage 
commissions, and putting customers into unsuitably risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also asked the exchanges to put more effort into investigating reports 
of such violations made in customer arbitration cases. In May, the agency found 
that the exchanges were not doing enough to follow up on these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations in the letters include new, stiff punishment of firms 
that don't comply with rules requiring them to promptly report to the exchanges 
disciplinary problems and customer complaints against their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD and the stock exchanges are "self-regulatory organizations" that have 
the power and responsibility to discipline member firms and their brokers for 
violations of securities rules. The SEC has long left most enforcement of sales 
practice rules to these organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly two years of study, the SEC reported in May that some leading 
brokerages had failed to weed out employees with long records of defrauding 
customers. The agency said it had launched disciplinary cases involving a 
quarter of the 161 brokerage branch offices it examined as part of the study. 
Three major firms were reported to have especially bad records, but the SEC 
refuses to name them. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was launched in response to a 1992 series of stories in The Times 
that found that brokerage firms, the exchanges and the SEC were lax in 
protecting small investors from rogue brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schlein, counsel to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., on Tuesday 
described the report and recommendations as "pretty hard-hitting, and we're 
following up to make sure that they get implemented."  
</P>
<P>
 The SEC asked that the exchanges respond by Monday. A NYSE spokesman said the 
exchange has not yet replied to the SEC's letter, and an NASD spokesman said 
senior officials were traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the NASD announced proposed rules that would ban brokers from 
taking free travel and other gifts from outside firms whose mutual funds or 
variable annuity contracts they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 NASD officials said they had no evidence of abuses by mutual fund or insurance 
firms, but they said they wanted to eliminate even the possible appearance of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules would not ban brokerages from giving their own brokers 
gifts for selling in-house products, such as the firms' own mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A special SEC committee is already studying broker pay issues.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; ROBOTS ROLL UP THEIR 
SLEEVES; TECHNOLOGY AIMS TO HELP THE ELDERLY AROUND THE HOUSE 
</P>

<P>
 Sitting squarely on a couch with a joystick in her hand, Frances Turner is 
dusting a lampshade that's a good 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the joystick and accompanying control panel, Turner, a 72-year-old 
retired accountant, maneuvers an eight-foot-long robotic arm clutching a 
feather duster. Up and down, back and forth she steers it, until declaring: 
"This spot is very well dusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner and the bright-yellow robot -- called Sidekick -- may someday be happy 
housemates as a result of an ambitious effort to develop automated "smart 
apartments." These futuristic lodgings would come with a variety of space-age 
machines to make independent living more manageable for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elderly could use various types of help to stay in their apartments 
longer, and with an ever-increasing number of people over 85 and the current 
pressure on expenses, we figure this is the way we'll be going in the future," 
said Bob Stark, the director of NASA's Far West Regional Technology Transfer 
Center, which is building a prototype smart apartment in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for it," Turner said. For starters, he would use a robot such as 
Sidekick to reach items on the top shelves of cabinets. "I think everybody 
should have them. They make you more independent, and independence makes you 
feel more secure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the number of older people in need of home assistance rising steadily -- 
and the aggregate cost of caring for them expected to triple over the next 25 
years -- smart apartments could save billions of dollars each year, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 They could also mean jobs for Southern California's unemployed aerospace 
engineers. They are ideal candidates to pioneer the service robot industry, 
says K. G. Engelhardt, the NASA scientist spearheading the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology is mature enough now to start talking about very practical 
applications" of robots, she said. "My real goal is to make California the 
robot capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike industrial robots, which have been on factory floors since the 1960s, 
service robots are designed to extend human abilities and work with people 
rather than as substitutes for them. The industry is so new that even the 
International Service Robot Assn. is still conducting a market study.

 "Service robots are just beginning to make their mark in the United States," 
said Jeff Burnstein of the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based robot organization. 
"Commercial applications have emerged in hospitals, warehouses and at hazardous 
(materials) sites to perform tasks such as delivering meal trays, security and 
environmental monitoring and nuclear cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
 For the smart apartment, Engelhardt has brought together a handful of small 
robotics companies from across North America that have developed robots capable 
of performing tasks in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Manhattan Beach prototype, a small robot arm on the kitchen counter can 
open a microwave oven door, clutch a plastic container in its claw-like "hand," 
slowly lift it into the oven and then shut the door, in response to two voice 
commands: "microwave" and "proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Another robot -- about the size of a dishwasher -- roams around the living 
room to clean the carpet. That robot, developed by Cyberworks Inc. of Orillia, 
Canada, uses pivoting sensors to find furniture and other obstacles and drives 
itself around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next month, the NASA engineers hope to rig the Cyberworks robot so 
that it can push a wheelchair and walk a dog. Hooked up to a video camera, the 
robot can answer the doorbell and check on a pot of boiling water, said Vivek 
Burhanpurkar, president of Cyberworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sidekick robot arm was developed by Robotics Assistance Corp. of Santa 
Ana. Founder Peter Movsesian said he wanted to develop a robot that could 
assist a disabled or elderly person at home without requiring major changes in 
the living environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can open a cabinet, get a glass of water, pick something off the floor -- 
chores that could be a strain" for an elderly person, Movsesian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engelhardt of NASA got the project rolling in May by convincing companies with 
suitable products to loan them to NASA for a smart apartment. The machines were 
modified to fit the Manhattan Beach prototype, and they're now testing it with 
older residents of the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you develop new applications for a core technology, then you can create a 
whole new industry," Engelhardt said. "These are useful tools, and they can 
create jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 If the smart apartment market takes off, Movsesian said he could sell enough 
of the $8,500-robot arms to employ as many as 100 people in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyberworks, which sold "several million dollars" worth of robots last year, is 
considering moving 2,500 miles to Southern California, Burhanpurkar said. "NASA 
is trying to lure us to the States, and we may end up being there as a result," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Joe Engelberger, a robotics pioneer whose Connecticut company builds service 
robots for hospitals, said the opportunities for the smart apartment concept 
are "tremendous." But he warned it will not be simple. With a unique set of 
obstacles and a constantly changing environment, the home is one of the most 
complicated places for robot uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got stairs, you've got glass, you've got visitors -- there are a lot 
of unpredictable things," Burnstein said. "But there could be a huge payoff, 
because if you could do something that could keep people at home longer (rather 
than going to nursing homes), that not only makes their life better, it saves 
money." Using Technology for Seniors' Care 
</P>
<P>
 As the populations ages, demand for assisted-living care is expected to soar. 
"Smart apartments" can allow some older people to live on their own with the 
help of robots that can perform household tasks.

 QVC Reports 12% Drop in 2nd-Quarter Earnings: The company cited the costs of 
expanding television home shopping to Britain and Mexico, which resulted in a 
$6.1-million loss after taxes in the last quarter. Net income for the three 
months ended July 31 was $11.7 million, or 25 cents a share, down from $13.3 
million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 15.6% to $303.3 
million from $262.4 million. In trading on the Nasdaq stock market, QVC was off 
6.25 cents a share to close at $44.8125. Company officials said the decline in 
earnings was unrelated to QVC's recent agreement to a $1.42-billion buyout by 
its two biggest shareholders, cable companies Comcast Corp. and Liberty Media 
Corp.

 Labor Leader Denies Nigerian Oil Strike Broken: The fired president of 
Nigeria's white-collar oil union denied reports that most members of the union 
were heeding a back-to-work decree from military ruler Sani Abacha."The claim . 
. . is a hoax," Bola Owodunni told Reuters. "Only people on essential duties 
have resumed, and they are mostly management staff." Industry officials, 
meanwhile, said it was too early to tell if the 7-week-old protest was over. 
Abacha, after firing the union leaders, set Thursday as the deadline for the 
strikers to resume work.

 Goldman Sachs Invests in Polo Ralph Lauren: The country's biggest investment 
banking partnership purchased a 28% stake in the upscale fashion house for $135 
million, said a spokeswoman for the clothing, home design and toiletries 
company.Chairman and Chief Executive Ralph Lauren and Vice Chairman Peter Strom 
together own the remaining 72% of the privately held company. Lauren approved 
the sale to beef up the 26-year-old firm's financial base and to finance 
growth, the spokeswoman said. Observers were surprised by the low price paid by 
Goldman, which implies that the entire Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. is worth $482.1 
million, less than what they had believed. Goldman declined to comment on the 
investment.

 Deere Posts Strong Earnings: Citing strong sales in North America and 
overseas, the Moline, Ill.-based company, the world's largest maker of 
agricultural equipment, reported record earnings for its fiscal third quarter. 
John Deere & Co. said it earned $157.8 million, or $1.82 a share, for the 
three-month period ended July 31, up from $90.9 million, or $1.19 a share, for 
the 1993 period. Sales climbed to $2.3 billion from $2 billion. Deere stock 
soared $3.625 to $69.625 on the New York Stock Exchange in response to the 
better-than-expected results. Analyst Robert Smith of Hancock Institutional 
Equity Services said equipment inventories are low and that that should spur 
farm machinery purchases.

FIRM WILL UNVEIL HOME DIALYSIS MACHINE; HEALTH: BAXTER INTERNATIONAL SAYS ITS 
DEVICE IS LIGHTER, EASIER TO USE THAN FORERUNNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Baxter International Inc. was to introduce today a portable dialysis machine 
that kidney patients will be able to use at home while they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Dialysis cleanses the blood of wastes, replacing the function of weak or 
failed kidneys. The big medical equipment company is hoping its HomeChoice 
system will help doctors take some people off the conventional routine, which 
requires spending about four hours in a clinic three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Home dialysis equipment has been available since 1978, but Baxter executives 
said Tuesday that the new system's computer technology makes it lighter, more 
portable and simpler to use than earlier products. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said switching to HomeChoice will save about half the cost of 
conventional dialysis -- which runs between $20,000 and $35,000 a year -- 
because using it will not require the services of a doctor, nurse or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, there are three steps to follow and (patients) can set up the 
machine in five minutes," said Arthur Holden, a Baxter vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidney specialists applauded the announcement, saying the machine could make 
home dialysis available to thousands of people. About 85% of the 600,000 
dialysis patients in the world are treated away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeChoice "seems to be an effective and valuable addition," said Dr. Garabed 
Eknoyan, a member of the board of the National Kidney Foundation. "It can do 
the job, and it works at night without supervision." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeChoice uses a relatively new method called peritoneal dialysis. A sterile 
solution of mostly water and sugar is pumped into the abdominal cavity via 
tubes. The peritoneal membrane, which lines the cavity, filters out wastes from 
the blood and transfers them to the fluid. Later, the fluid is pumped out with 
the wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 In conventional hemodialysis, the kind available in clinics, the blood is 
pumped out of the body and through a machine that cleanses it and pumps it back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, which gets $1 billion of its $9 billion in annual revenue from 
dialysis machinery and chemicals, is a pioneer in home peritoneal dialysis. The 
method has not caught on, however, because the machines weigh about 200 pounds 
each and are cumbersome to handle, especially for older patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter's stock was unchanged at $27.625 a share Tuesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

LOAN ARRESTS TRAIN LIGHT ON PACKAGERS; LENDING: SBA BLAMES FRAUDULENT 
APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED BY UNSCRUPULOUS CONSULTANTS FOR A RECENT RASH OF 
DEFAULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This week's arrests of six people indicted on allegations of making false 
statements on their income tax forms to obtain Small Business Administration 
loans has thrown light on the fast-growing but unregulated business of loan 
packagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many loan packagers -- independent consultants who help put together SBA 
applications for a fee -- are legitimate and perform a useful service, 
officials say. But some unscrupulous operators are being blamed by the agency 
for many fraudulent loan applications that have led to a rash of SBA loan 
defaults -- particularly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the problems we have with (phony) tax returns are with loan 
packagers," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general for the SBA in 
Washington, whose investigation of loan packagers and fraud in California has 
extended to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA investigators say that a slender middle-aged man from Westminster put 
together SBA applications on behalf of the six defendants. Those six people -- 
who have not been available for comment -- borrowed a total of almost $1 
million worth of government-backed loans. SBA investigators now say that false 
tax returns -- with inflated income figures and false invoices -- were used to 
apply for the loans, all of which ultimately went into default. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the Westminster man is just one of eight loan packagers on the 
West Coast who are at the center of the SBA's three-year investigation, which 
involves more than 100 troubled loans. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many packagers of SBA loans operate in California or 
elsewhere, because the industry is unregulated and anyone can do it. In fact, 
accountants, financial planners, unemployed bank employees and even real estate 
brokers -- working to supplement their incomes -- have long helped potential 
borrowers assemble parts or all of the voluminous materials that must accompany 
an SBA application, which the federal agency estimates would take on average 
about 21 hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past few years, as the volume of SBA loans surged while 
conventional lending dwindled, the number of people specializing in packaging 
SBA loans has swelled and so has the suspected fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the loan packagers under investigation allegedly drew customers from 
ethnic communities where business people have language barriers and are 
unfamiliar with U.S. lending practices and thus more likely to seek out such 
consultants. All six of the people indicted this week, and the Westminster loan 
packager, are Southeast Asians. And government officials say most of the other 
packagers who are under scrutiny also worked in immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles with some loan packagers have cast a cloud on others who are 
operating legitimately. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stultz, a Newport Beach consultant who has been packaging SBA loans for 
20 years, says he knows of 20 people in Southern California whose main business 
is packaging SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers and SBA officials agree that there is a need for such loan packaging 
consultants because most people can't put together the applications on their 
own. Loan packagers "have done a lot more good than bad," said Steve Mattern, 
senior vice president of Truckee River Bank in Northern California, one of the 
state's largest SBA lenders.

BROADWAY REPORTS HIGHER SALES, SMALLER LOSS; RETAILING: CHAIN'S SECOND-QUARTER 
RESULTS POINT TO IMPROVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Broadway Stores Inc. reported better-than-expected second-quarter results 
Tuesday, saying sales rose and losses narrowed during the period -- another 
sign that the California economy may be improving slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based retailer -- operator of the Broadway department store 
chain -- reported a loss of $12.9 million for the 13-week period ended July 30. 
In contrast, the company recorded a loss of $42.5 million for the same period 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had operating earnings -- income before interest and taxes -- of 
$10.6 million for the quarter, contrasted with an operating loss of $20.8 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-store sales -- revenue from stores open at least 12 months -- were $457 
million, a 1.2% increase over the same period a year ago. Men's apparel and 
cosmetics were among the strongest areas, but sales of women's apparel also 
increased, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the continuing difficult economic climate, we are optimistic that the 
significant strides we made this quarter . . . will enable the company to 
achieve substantial overall improvement in our fiscal 1994 performance," said 
David Dworkin, Broadway's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an improving California economy, Broadway's performance 
reflects positive consumer reaction to the retailer's store remodeling program 
and marketing changes, said Ira Hersch, an analyst at Fourteen Research. 
Broadway has reduced the number of sales promotions in favor of lower everyday 
prices on more items. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is still marking prices down excessively to generate sales, but 
they're heading in the right direction," Hersch said. Ed Johnson, an analyst at 
Johnson Redbook in New York, also cited the quarterly results as evidence of a 
gradual resurgence at the company. "Store remodeling can be disruptive, but 
their sales are improving despite that work," said Johnson, who predicted that 
the company will post a profit in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 The retailer last reported a quarterly profit for the 13 weeks ended Jan. 30, 
1993. It had a net income of $27.8 million during that period. The company 
reported a net loss of $18 million for the 13 weeks ended Jan. 29, 1994, but 
would have had net income if not for a $20-million charge for costs associated 
with the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake.

N.Y. OFFICIAL THREATENS TO BLOCK MACY MERGER; RETAILING: ATTORNEY GENERAL 
PROPOSES THAT 12 OF ITS 13 STORES IN STATE BE SOLD. FEDERATED REJECTS THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York's attorney general stepped into the planned merger of R.H. Macy & Co. 
and Federated Department Stores on Tuesday, announcing that he will seek to 
block it on antitrust grounds unless 12 of the 13 Macy's department stores in 
that state are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated immediately rejected the idea, which would all but erase the 
venerable Macy's name -- including the flagship department store and, 
presumably, Macy's annual Thanksgiving parade -- from New York City. But both 
sides said they hope to negotiate a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated and the New York-based Macy, which also operates the Bullock's and 
I. Magnin chains, reached a tentative merger agreement July 13 and plan to 
combine operations by December. Although the Federal Trade Commission said last 
week that the merger poses no antitrust problems, state Atty. Gen. G. Oliver 
Koppell feels differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department store market is so concentrated that in some areas of New 
York, a combined Macy-Federated chain would have a virtual monopoly," Koppell 
said. "Vendors would be squeezed, jobs would be lost, prices would rise and 
consumer choice would be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Koppell said he is proposing the sale of 12 Macy's stores situated in five New 
York state counties because Federated, which operates the Bloomingdale's and 
Abraham & Straus chains, also has stores in those communities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Koppell, speaking at a news conference in New York City, also said he 
would consider alternative proposals from Federated. Koppell asked Federated to 
respond by Aug. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated said it will continue to negotiate with the 
attorney general's staff to develop a plan that would address Koppell's 
concerns. However, the retailer expressed no interest in Koppell's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal would effectively wipe out Macy's name on the New York retail 
horizon, which makes little sense," Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said. 
"This matter is negotiable, but it's also a matter that could wind up in 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, Koppell could file a lawsuit 
in state or federal court. However, Macy is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization and a Bankruptcy Court could claim jurisdiction of the matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Koppell's announcement came four days after the FTC, normally the last word on 
such antitrust matters, OKd the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that state officials have the power to sue to 
block mergers on antitrust grounds. However, it is unusual for a state attorney 
general and the FTC to reach different conclusions on merger-related issues, 
said David Slawson, a USC law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York (antitrust) law may be stricter than federal provisions -- or the 
New York state attorney general may think that's the case," Slawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated wants the merger because department stores have been losing market 
share to specialty apparel chains and to discount chains, said Kurt Barnard, a 
New Jersey-based retail economist. Such a merger would give the retailer more 
leverage with vendors, allowing it to buy products more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of department stores competing only with other department stores are 
gone forever," Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts suggested that Koppell's decision might be politically 
motivated. Koppell faces a primary election Sept. 13 and might benefit if he 
appears to be protecting consumers. Koppell denied that charge Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous New York attorney general investigated the impact of a proposed 
merger between Federated and Macy in 1988, when Macy was trying to acquire 
Federated, said Richard Barr, a spokesman for Koppell. Because state officials 
were concerned that a Macy takeover of Federated would eliminate meaningful 
competition, Macy agreed to sell 11 stores, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, Robert Abrams was state attorney general, and there was no 
election scheduled that year," said Barr, arguing the legitimacy of the 
antitrust issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Campeau Corp. eventually acquired much of Federated in a 1988 compromise that 
allowed Macy to obtain Federated's Bullock's and I. Magnin chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy has 111 Macy's and Bullock's stores nationwide. In California, the 
retailer has 24 Macy's stores, 20 Bullock's and 11 I. Magnin stores. Federated 
has 232 stores nationwide, none in California.

joint firm to provide computer services to tourism and transport companies as 
part of the 10-year agreement. The deal will push Delta Air Lines Inc. into the 
profitable transportation information business and give AT&T Corp. a solid edge 
in overhauling Delta's computer systems.The partnership between the 
telecommunications giant and the nation's third-largest airline will develop 
new information technology services to be used by Delta and sold to other 
travel and transportation companies. The deal excludes airline and travel 
agency computer reservations systems. The venture, which has not yet been 
named, will supply computer services to Atlanta-based Delta, which is 
overhauling its communications as part of a restructuring.

 United to Take Over Denver Baggage System: The airline said it will assume 
control of the problem-ridden automated system at the new Denver International 
Airport as part of a deal with the city to open the facility by Feb. 28."This 
will be a United automated baggage system, not an integrated baggage system," 
United senior vice president Steven Steers said. The city will proceed with 
plans for a $50-million alternative baggage system using conveyor belts, tugs 
and carts that will be used by other carriers until the automated system can 
handle the load. Denver has repeatedly delayed opening the new $3.7-billion 
airport because of problems with the high-tech baggage system.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: MEXICAN, BRAZILIAN STOCKS MAY PAUSE, BUT NOT FOR 
LONG

 Latin American stock markets look ripe for profit taking after their 
rocket-like moves of recent weeks. But expand your time horizon and the allure 
of these markets isn't much changed from 1993, many pros say: The long-term 
growth potential remains far better than that of U.S. stocks as a whole -- if 
you can handle the volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa stock index eased 3.44 points to 2,755.53 on 
Tuesday. The Bolsa has surged 12% since July 29, betting on the ruling party's 
victory in Sunday's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Bovespa index gave up 1.5% on Tuesday, after soaring 
28% the past three weeks. Brazil, too, faces an election (in October) and also 
is in the midst of its eighth anti-inflation plan in 12 years. Investors have 
been optimistic on both fronts, though the buying may have become too frenzied, 
some money managers warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because their markets are Latin America's biggest by far, Mexican and 
Brazilian stocks automatically dominate Latin American investment funds. So 
their prospects are key to Latin funds' performance, short- and long-term. 
Here's how some pros view Mexico and Brazil now: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico. The Bolsa index is up 5.9% year-to-date, but to get this far 
investors had to weather an Indian rebellion, political assassination and an 
economic slowdown -- all of which helped crush the index to as low as 2,000 in 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 While ruling party candidate Ernesto Zedillo's victory Sunday assures that 
Mexico's free-market economic reforms will remain in place, investors' concern 
now is profit growth. 
</P>
<P>
 William Truscott, co-manager of the Scudder Latin America stock fund in New 
York, has 37% of the fund's assets in Mexico. But he concedes that "we're a bit 
cautious" now on the market. "Stock values are not extremely compelling" in 
light of weak first-half corporate earnings, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are expecting Mexican firms' earnings to grow at a 20% to 30% annual 
clip longer-term, Truscott says, but that will only be possible if sales growth 
also picks up -- the missing element so far. In the meantime, he notes, the 
market isn't cheap, with many stocks selling for 15 to 20 times estimated 1994 
earnings or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Until sales growth comes, Truscott is focusing on what he terms the 
best-managed Mexican companies whose businesses can't be readily duplicated by 
hungry U.S. competitors: Phone giant Telmex, for example, and retailer Cifra, 
which has formed a joint venture with Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Dennis, Latin stock strategist with Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York, 
agrees that Mexican stocks are due for a pause. But he still sees the Bolsa 
index reaching 3,150 by year's end. "I think that because a lot of investors 
have missed this rally, any correction will be limited." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Zedillo, and with the help of free trade, Dennis sees Mexico growing 5% 
a year, versus 3% annually over the last six years. His favorite plays: 
Infrastructure stocks, such as construction firm Empresas ICA; and banks like 
Bancomer, whose earnings should rise as Mexican interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brazil. Many Latin fund managers are vastly more excited about Brazil than 
Mexico, even though the Bovespa index is up more than 60% this year in dollar 
terms, and even though a selloff is overdue. "We think the market can at least 
double again" before it reaches expensive levels, says Soraya Betterton, 
manager of the GT Latin American fund in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Mexico, the near-term optimism in the Brazilian market rests on the 
expected victory of a free-market presidential candidate -- in this case, 
Fernando Cardoso. It is his anti-inflation plan that took effect on July 1, 
giving Brazil a new currency and an economic program designed to bring down an 
inflation rate that routinely topped 500% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than two months, the plan has cut inflation to 5% a month. F. Rowe 
Michels, analyst at Latin stock specialist D.A. Campbell Co. in Los Angeles, 
says the market is sensing that if this program works -- admittedly still a big 
'if' -- "Brazil is headed toward economic and political stability that will 
allow Brazilian companies to make much more efficient use of their assets." 
</P>
<P>
 And because Brazilian firms already are considered among the best-managed in 
Latin America, their potential in a true working economy has investors 
wide-eyed. With many stocks priced at just 10 to 15 times estimated 1994 
earnings, Brazil "is going a lot higher if the anti-inflation plan works," says 
Truscott. The Latin Funds

 A firmer dollar and a mild bond market rally helped spark a broad advance in 
stocks Tuesday, in surprisingly heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 24.61 points at 3,775.83, though it 
fell back from a gain of nearly 40 points at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, winners topped losers by 13 to 8, and volume 
surged to 307 million shares, an active session for a late-August day. 
</P>
<P>
 Among industrial stocks, investor interest was revitalized as farm machinery 
giant Deere reported strong quarterly earnings, sending its shares up 3 5/8 to 
69 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market was helped by a minor recovery in the dollar, which has been 
slumping in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar edged up from a five-week low against the Japanese yen and gained 
on the German mark in an advance fueled partly by rumors that Japan's central 
bank was a big buyer of the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 97.90 yen, up from 97.83 on 
Monday. It also rose to 1.5318 marks, up from 1.5273. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's firmness and a healthy reception at the Treasury's auction of 
two-year notes gave the bond market a boost early in the day, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $17.26 billion in two-year notes at an average yield of 
6.27%, which was lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But demand for longer-term securities waned as trading wore on, and the yield 
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.54%, down only slightly from 
7.55% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traders were reluctant to buy bonds ahead of today's government report on 
July durable goods orders, which, if stronger than expected, could renew fears 
that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit again in September or 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some analysts are growing optimistic about the stock market's 
prospects, even if the bond market sputters again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that every piece of bad news possible has been thrown at this market, 
and they haven't been able to get stock prices down," said Robert Kahan, 
trading chief at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's rally was impressive for its breadth, analysts said. Retail, 
industrial, casino and biotech stocks, among others, drew buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, which has led the 
recent market advance, gained another 5.69 points to 747.98, its highest since 
April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York, 
warned that if the dollar tumbles anew, it will hurt U.S. stocks because 
foreigners will be encouraged to sell their U.S. holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much to hold the stock market," Stovall said. Even though 
corporate earnings have been strong, stock prices are already high relative to 
those earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Deere & Co.'s quarterly earnings report -- and its upbeat comments about the 
rest of the year -- helped draw buyers to other heavy-industry stocks. 
Caterpillar zoomed 4 3/8 to 111 5/8, Clark Equipment surged 1 7/8 to 68 1/2, 
Navistar rose 3/4 to 16 5/8 and Tenneco was up 1 1/8 to 46 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover speculation boosted some biotech issues. Immune Response jumped 
15/32 to 7 31/32, Chiron leaped 4 1/4 to 65 3/4, Biogen soared 2 7/16 to 50 3/8 
and Amgen was up 1 to 56. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewhere in the health care sector, Health Systems rocketed 2 3/8 to 26 
1/8, Wellpoint Health gained 1 3/8 to 26 1/4 and PacifiCare Class A added 1 3/4 
to 68. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks advancing included May Department Stores, up 1 1/4 to 40 1/8; 
J.C. Penney, up 1 1/2 to 49 5/8; Mercantile Stores, up 7/8 to 36 1/4; Staples, 
up 2 to 29, and Toys R Us, up 3/4 to 36 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino stocks were also strong. Caesars World jumped 2 1/4 to 45, Mirage 
Resorts added 7/8 to 20 1/4, Hilton rose 1 1/8 to 59, Hollywood Park leaped 1 
3/4 to 22 1/2 and MGM Grand gained 5/8 to 30 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among tech issues, Novell rose 7/8 to 14 7/8 and Microsoft added 7/8 to 55 
1/2, after the rival software companies said they had met to discuss ways to 
make their products work better together. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newbridge Networks dropped 2 15/16 to 29 after the once-high-flying 
computer networker reported slower earnings growth than Wall Street had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among consumer stocks, Philip Morris jumped 1 3/8 to 56 5/8 amid speculation 
that the tobacco giant might raise its dividend by 5% to 10% or announce a new 
share repurchase program at its Aug. 31 board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Tokyo stocks closed weaker, with the Nikkei 225-share 
average easing 13.80 points to 20,380.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index lost 15.92 points to 2,107.87, while in London the 
FTSE-100 index added 3.8 points to 3,175.1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 3.44 points to 2,755.53, after an early 
rally above the 2,800 mark faded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. municipal bond market, the city of Los Angeles sold $111 million 
in general obligation bonds, and traders said the securities were 
well-received. Yields were close to levels on the state's recent offering of 
general obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, bond-rating agency Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its outlook for 
the city's credit rating to "stable" from "negative," citing in part a 
stabilizing economy. S&P rates the city's debt AA, which is higher than the A 
rating S&P gives the state's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, coffee prices surged anew amid concern that dry 
weather in Brazil will further damage a crop already harmed by two frosts. 
</P>
<P>
 December coffee futures jumped 8.10 cents to $1.976 a pound on the Coffee, 
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.

MANY CREDIT RATES INCHING HIGHER; CONSUMERS: ISSUERS OF VARIABLE CARDS DON'T 
HAVE TO NOTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE ADJUSTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to start reading the fine print on your credit card statement again. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadily declining interest rates have lulled many card holders into believing 
credit costs are a problem of the past. As consumer and political pressures 
rose in recent years, many card issuers did reduce rates, especially for their 
better customers. From 1990 until last year, according to Ram Research Corp., a 
research and publishing firm in Frederick, Md., average credit card interest 
rates fell from 19.23% to 17.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 But many card issuers also made another change. They switched from fixed to 
variable interest rates, meaning that every quarter, or even monthly, they can 
raise the rates they charge. Issuers of variable-rate credit cards aren't 
legally required to tell customers, said Robert B. McKinley of Ram Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of variable-rate cards can tell if the rate has changed by looking at 
the little box at the bottom of the monthly statement, noting the rate and 
comparing the statement with others from previous months, McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuers of fixed-rate cards must still notify customers of any rate change and 
give them a chance to stop using the card. But about 60% of the cards in use 
now are variable, McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are seeing is the first spike in rates in two years," he said. "There 
has been a steady decline as rates have worked their way down, but there is 
good news and bad news: Consumers should be paying much lower rates (from a few 
years ago), but the bad news is, most of the cards are variable and (consumers) 
will be feeling (increases) more quickly than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Variable-rate cards typically are indexed to some general market rate. This is 
often the prime rate but may be something else. Signet Bank, for example, 
offers a Visa card indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as 
Libor. The key rates have risen several times this year; the prime has gone to 
7.75% from 6% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 If your statement shows your rate has risen, you have alternatives. The 
business remains very competitive. Some issuers haven't raised rates; others 
will cut a deal to keep a good customer. Still others, anxious to expand their 
market share, are offering low introductory rates, typically for a few months 
but in some cases for as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a lot of teaser rates, but if a teaser rate lasts at least a 
year it's worth getting," said Ruth Susswein of Bankcard Holders of America, a 
consumer group based in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 In McKinley's view, if you find the rate on your card is more than 15%, it's 
time to go shopping. The first step is to call your issuer's customer service 
line and ask for a lower rate. Say that you will close the account if you don't 
get one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bear in mind, if you carry a balance of at least $2,000, charge at least 
$3,000 a year and have a responsible record, you have a great deal of 
leverage," McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the issuer won't deal, you can call local banks or refer to a listing of 
low-rate cards. McKinley's group offers such a list for $5; Bankcard Holders 
has one for $4.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; COPYING CHLOROPHYLL CONVERSION

 Nature easily beats any human efforts to capture energy from the sun: Nothing 
matches photosynthesis, the process by which plants use chlorophyll to convert 
light into food. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by a University of Southern California chemist shows that a purple 
bacteria found in pond scum uses light energy with almost 95% efficiency -- 
more than four times that of the best manufactured solar cells. By better 
understanding the bacteria's energy-conversion process, the chemist, Chi Ho 
Mak, believes it may be possible to one day re-create it as an artificial solar 
energy cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mak and Reinhold Egger of the University of Freiburg, Germany, have used a 
supercomputer to create a model of chlorophyll's energy conversion process. In 
the purple bacteria the two studied, photosynthesis began when a special pair 
of chlorophyll molecules absorbed a unit of green light radiation (a photon). 
In a reaction lasting only three-trillionths of a second, the chlorophyll 
transferred a high-energy electron to a nearby molecule of a substance called 
pheophytin, storing the solar energy in what amounts to a biochemical battery. 
</P>
<P>
 A complex series of chemical reactions then converted the energy of the 
electron into products the bacterium needed to live, grow and reproduce. The 
research has a long way to go, but it is a first step toward re-creating a 
photosynthetic reaction center in a manufactured device. 
</P>
<P>
 Running on Air: Student researchers at UC Riverside have come up with a novel 
twist on that much-sought-after vehicle, the non-polluting, gasoline-free 
automobile. They've developed a modified golf cart that runs on the electricity 
generated by hydrogen and oxygen in the air around us. 
</P>
<P>
 The cart uses a fuel cell originally developed for space applications. When 
hydrogen stored in a tank comes into contact with oxygen and phosphoric acid, 
it gives off electrons that are collected in the fuel cell, which then becomes 
a source of electricity. The only byproduct is water vapor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel cell promises to be about 2 1/2 times more efficient than the 
internal combustion engine. The hydrogen itself is produced at UC Riverside's 
Solar Hydrogen Research Facility, by a solar-powered electrolyzer that splits 
ordinary water molecules into individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms. James 
Heffel, the project manager, believes the hydrogen can be produced for the 
equivalent of $2 to $3 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fuel-cell vehicles could meet the zero-emissions standards recently 
adopted by the California Air Resources Board. In theory, they would have 
greater range than electric cars that have to be recharged from an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sound of Location: When bats fly, they send out a sonar signal to guide 
them along. But how does one bat distinguish its own signal from those of 
hundreds of other bats around it? The answer to this question has relevance, it 
seems, not only for mouse-like flying mammals and sonar-guided torpedoes but 
for electric companies trying to locate downed power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the bat's enviable signal-processing capabilities, Edward 
Titlebaum, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Rochester 
in New York, developed a series of codes for the Navy several years ago. The 
codes guaranteed that signals from sonar-guided torpedoes remained distinct and 
did not become crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Titlebaum is working with engineers from Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. to 
apply these codes to help track down faulty power lines. Now utilities must 
wait for customers to telephone complaining of a downed line. Titlebaum's idea 
is to outfit each power line with a transmitter that every so often sends a 
distinctive signal back to the utility. A missing signal would indicate that a 
line was down. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a family of codes known as hyperbolic congruence frequency hop codes -- 
in which a signal hops across several frequencies per second -- Titlebaum was 
able to create these distinguishable signals. The reason these codes are 
distinctive is that only one or two frequencies are congruent. A correlation 
receiver looks for the exact sequence of frequencies it is supposed to receive.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; COMPTON'S NEW MEDIA 
FOUNDER IS OUSTED; MULTIMEDIA: TRIBUNE CO. REPLACES FLAMBOYANT ENTREPRENEUR 
NORMAN J. BASTIN ONE YEAR AFTER IT TOOK OVER COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after acquiring Compton's New Media, the largest publisher in the 
burgeoning multimedia market, Chicago-based Tribune Co. has ousted the firm's 
founder and general manager, Norman J. Bastin, and replaced him with veteran 
Tribune executive James N. Longson. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up is the latest in a trend that observers say will likely 
accelerate as corporate investors and venture capitalists who rushed to stake a 
claim in the interactive wilderness over the last year or two begin to look for 
their much-anticipated returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty typical that the entrepreneur doesn't mesh with the corporate 
bureaucracy," the flamboyant Bastin said Tuesday, a day after his ouster. "I 
don't do very well in suit meetings in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, CD-ROM software publisher Sanctuary Woods replaced founder 
Brian Beninger as chief executive, though Beninger will retain the role of 
chairman of the board. And La Crescenta-based Knowledge Adventure -- which 
Tuesday announced an alliance and investment said to be worth approximately $10 
million by Random House -- last week hired a new president to handle day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stakes have gotten very high very quickly," said Bruce Ryon, multimedia 
analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose-based consulting firm. "In an emerging market 
like this, you have people who are very entrepreneurial, creative, loosely 
structured. But at this point, with the investment levels you're talking about 
to get out a good title, you need someone who has a good mix of creative and 
management skill sets." 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that the industry is getting serious," Knowledge Adventure Chairman 
Bill Gross said. "A few years ago, I could run the whole show myself and it 
didn't matter much to me. But this is not a kindergarten game anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some say replacing the start-up visionaries may not be good for 
business in the long run. And many multimedia entrepreneurs who are 
deliberating their next move are placing a high value on independence as they 
watch what becomes of some of their peers and rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're choosing our investors very, very carefully," said Drew Hoffman, a San 
Francisco-based multimedia developer who recently received funding from two 
venture firms. "If somebody came in here and offered us a lot of money to do 
things their way, our answer would be no. Our strategy is to concentrate and 
not to worry whether we get filthy rich this year. And we're not going to get 
filthy rich this year -- we've figured that out. But we are going to make some 
cool stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement with Random House announced Tuesday, Knowledge Adventure 
will jointly develop and market children's reference multimedia titles based on 
the publisher's library of material, and Random House will distribute to 
bookstores the multimedia firm's current software titles. The first joint 
CD-ROM, due out in November, will be a children's encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been partly the intense competition in the multimedia encyclopedia 
market -- which Carlsbad, Calif.-based Compton's created pretty much 
single-handedly a few years ago -- that led to Bastin's removal, analysts said. 
Compton's market share has been eroded by popular encyclopedia products from 
Microsoft Corp. and Grolier's. And Bastin was more interested in diversifying 
the company's product line into areas such as entertainment and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastin, one of the best-known figures in the multimedia industry, said he 
plans to start his own new-media firm. "I was in the acquisition business for a 
long time, so I knew at some time we were going to loggerheads. It's standard 
fare to buy a company for what it's done and intends to do and then come in and 
try to change it. And I'm not exactly your best corporate citizen."

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; HOW TO CLEAN UP THAT WINDOWS CLUTTER SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've been working with Microsoft Windows for a year or two, you may have 
noticed that it tends to take over your computer with a bewildering number of 
program files stored in all sorts of sub-directories identified by cryptic 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 The more Windows application programs you install, the worse the mess gets. 
It's a lot like a city with no building standards and no zoning laws. You never 
know what's going to show up on your hard disk, or where. Sooner or later, you 
need to clean things up by getting rid of programs and data files you no longer 
use -- and that's when big problems can occur. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you know which files belong to which program? It isn't wise to just 
open up the File Manager program within Windows and begin deleting files. If 
you delete the wrong one, you could cripple your computer to the point that it 
won't run properly. 
</P>
<P>
 What you need is the equivalent of an urban renewal program for your computer 
to safely get rid of all that blight. Fortunately, there is a solution: 
UnInstaller, version 2, published by MicroHelp Inc. of Marietta, Ga., ((800) 
922-3383) can be purchased for about $45 at software stores. UnInstaller is not 
perfect, and it requires considerable care. But it's much safer than trying to 
delete the program files on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with Windows applications is that they contain dozens -- sometimes 
hundreds -- of files, which is why they usually come on more than one diskette. 
They all come with a built-in installation routine, but rarely do they include 
one for uninstalling them. 
</P>
<P>
 UnInstaller 2 was designed to take most of the guesswork out of getting rid of 
unwanted Windows applications and to make the task easy. (It is also a Windows 
application, but it is probably the last one you'd want to get rid of. It can't 
-- and won't -- attempt to uninstall itself, but the manual tells you which 
files to get rid of to do the job yourself.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you are the type who never reads computer manuals, here's a painfully 
learned word of advice: Read the UnInstaller 2 manual before you start using 
the program. It is short, and you'll learn a lot about how Windows application 
programs are constructed. Most of all, you'll learn how to use the program 
judiciously so that you are unlikely to use it to delete files that are needed 
to run Windows itself or applications you still want to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can plunge ahead without reading, and probably end up crashing Windows 
altogether so that it has to be reinstalled from diskettes. Which raises an 
important issue: How many of you actually have diskettes stored away from which 
you could reinstall Windows or other applications that came on your computer? 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, new computers have been sold with Microsoft 
Windows and a collection of other programs already installed on the hard disk. 
Typically, no floppy disks are included from which you could reinstall the 
programs if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is a utility program that will copy the files onto diskettes 
for safekeeping if you will only take the time to do so. If you haven't made 
these backup copies of the programs that came on your computer, do so today. 
Buy several boxes of high-density, pre-formatted diskettes and give yourself 
plenty of time at the machine for it to make the copies for you. Without those 
diskettes you have no way to recover if you do something wrong with UnInstaller 
(or File Manager). 
</P>
<P>
 There are two important things to remember about using UnInstaller 2: Be sure 
to exit out of all your other programs before you begin to use it, and always 
run the Smart Links routine before you begin choosing which programs to get rid 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart Links reads through all of your Windows programs and files and figures 
out which files belong to which programs. This is critical because sometimes 
programs share use of the same file. Smart Links can see that connection, and 
UnInstaller 2 will then tell you not to delete that file. 
</P>
<P>
 When everything works smoothly, getting rid of a Windows program with 
UnInstaller is merely a matter of a few mouse clicks. First you click on the 
image of the Windows group icon containing the program, then you click on the 
program icon itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe way to carry out the next step is to instruct UnInstaller to make a 
trial run at deleting the program. It will analyze the files and identify those 
it would delete. If you approve, you can cause the files to actually be 
deleted. Or you can take the precaution of just having them removed to a 
compressed backup format to see if your computer still runs properly without 
them. If there are problems, the removed files can be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to removing files, UnInstaller 2 will also remove program, file 
and Windows group icons where appropriate. It will also clean out sections of 
the WIN.INI file, where some programs have a bad habit of inserting information 
about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The UnInstaller 2 manual warns that its methods work about 90% of the time. 
But there are instances that can mislead UnInstaller 2 and cause you grief. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, I just installed version 2 of Procomm Plus for Windows, a 
communications program. It deleted unneeded files from the previous version, 
overwrote some files and added some new files, all in the same sub-directory as 
the old version. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also created a new Windows group icon, leaving the old one in place. 
When I ran UnInstaller 2, it revealed the old Procomm group and indicated that 
I could safely delete files and icons from it. But those icons now came from 
new Procomm programs. Had I allowed UnInstaller 2 to remove them, I would have 
been deleting new program files that the Procomm installation had just updated. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson here is that you really do have to achieve some understanding of 
how your computer works so that you can make intelligent decisions when you 
need to make some modifications. You'll find the UnInstaller 2 manual to be an 
excellent primer in helping you understand how Windows behaves.

NO END PREDICTED TO NOVELL-MICROSOFT RIVALRY; COMPUTERS: DESPITE TALKS, 
COMPETITION IN NETWORKING WILL REMAIN FIERCE, ANALYSTS SAY.

<P>
 Novell Inc. and Microsoft Corp. will remain fierce competitors in computer 
networking and business applications despite the easing of hostilities between 
the two companies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell's new chief executive, Robert Frankenberg, met with Microsoft Chairman 
Bill Gates last month for a broad discussion on cooperation between the two 
companies, Microsoft officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing formal that came out of it," said Bob Kruger, Microsoft 
director of strategic relations and standards. "They talked about getting 
together a couple of times a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some analysts said they were pleased to hear about the meeting 
after years of antagonism toward Microsoft by recently retired Novell Chairman 
Ray Noorda. 
</P>
<P>
 It was under Noorda that Novell actively encouraged investigations of 
Microsoft's business practices. The probes by European and U.S. government 
agencies were settled last month with an agreement widely seen as a victory for 
Microsoft, the world's largest software company. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Frankenberg's July 7 meeting with Gates at Microsoft's Redmond, 
Wash., headquarters apparently signals an era of improved cooperation that 
could benefit customers who use products made by both firms.  
</P>
<P>
 But they said the companies will remain fiercely competitive, both in Novell's 
core area of computer networking and in the word-processing and spreadsheet 
areas Novell recently entered through its acquisition of WordPerfect and 
Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet products. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two companies are on a collision course, and it's their destiny to be 
competitive with each other, but they also need to work together," said Rick 
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others said customers such as big firms that use software made by both 
companies could benefit from any improvement in cooperation between Provo, 
Utah-based Novell and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of complexity is increasing every day, and you want your vendors 
talking to each other," said Paul Merenbloom of Piper Jaffray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Customers have complained that Microsoft's Windows operating software does not 
work well with Novell's Netware, which dominates personal computer networking 
with 80% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's Kruger acknowledged those complaints and said Microsoft is 
dedicated to improving the compatibility of Windows and Netware, including 
through the imminent release of Windows NT 3.5, the latest version of its 
advanced operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he hopes that with Novell being headed by Frankenberg, whom he 
described as "more level-headed and pragmatic" than Noorda, the two companies 
can make progress in other areas, such as providing better service to customers 
that have mixed systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Merenbloom noted that Microsoft and Novell have necessarily had professional 
working relationships for years despite the hostility between their top 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't breaking down the Berlin Wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said the meeting was an example of Frankenberg's determination 
to make changes "which go right down into the cultural fibers of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're seeing from Frankenberg is the beginning of a 
restructuring of Novell," he said.

IBM PRICE CUTS EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO COMPAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. is expected to slash prices today on 
many of its personal computer products -- in some cases by as much as 25% -- as 
a much-anticipated price war begins, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will be the first major PC vendor to slash prices in response to a move by 
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which last week cut prices on several 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq's price cuts ranged from 11% to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter of the year, Compaq surpassed IBM as the top PC seller 
and stayed on top in the second quarter -- well ahead of its nearest 
competitor, Apple Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the IBM cuts will be on selected models across the board, with 
the exception of ThinkPad notebook computers and the PS/1 line. An IBM 
spokeswoman declined to comment except to say, "We have always said we would 
remain competitive."  
</P>
<P>
 Personal computer makers are beginning to feel pressure to cut prices of their 
systems based on the 486 computer chip as the prices for PCs designed around 
Intel's next-generation chip, the Pentium, begin to decline and users move to 
those machines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Dell Computer Corp. introduced a fully configured Pentium-based PC 
family, starting at less than $3,000. Dell was also the first PC maker to 
introduce a Pentium-based PC for less than $2,000, earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, Compaq and other PC makers will also introduce more Pentium-based PCs, 
servers and notebooks this fall.

NOT JUST FOR KICKS; MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT HOPES EXPERTISE BRINGS FILM FAME, 
FORTUNE 
</P>

 Trieu Chung Ha says he has never thrown a punch in anger, and probably never 
will. Nonetheless, he's building a dream with his fists. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 8, Ha escaped Vietnam by boat with his father, a former officer in 
the South Vietnamese army, and a younger brother to begin a new life in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 23, Ha, a fifth-degree black belt, is considered one of the top martial 
arts experts in the world. Last weekend he won the kata grand championship -- 
which stresses precision technique -- for the third straight year in the Ed 
Parker international karate championships in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha and his brother, Dong Quan Ha, who was a finalist this year, hope that 
their performances in the 31-year-old tournament may lead to successful acting 
careers such as the ones enjoyed by Chuck Norris and the late Bruce Lee, who 
got their first big breaks when they were spotted competing in the prestigious 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with their father, Quoc Huy Ha, an eighth-degree black belt who is just 
a notch from the highest ranking in his martial arts style, the Ha brothers 
have already appeared as stuntmen in a couple of movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Dong Quan Ha is currently in the cast of a television pilot that would compete 
with the popular "Power Rangers" series. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is good news to the Ha family, who only last year thought their 
American dream had ended when the martial arts school they operated in 
Westminster, Vo Dao Vietnam Dojo, burned down. Without insurance, they lost 
everything in the fire, including trophies, training tapes and uniforms for 
their students. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and I have to continue competing in tournaments to let people know 
that our style exists," said Trieu Chung Ha. "This style is very unique and it 
earns respect from other (martial arts) schools." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that winning tournaments enhances the reputation of their martial arts 
style, which combines Japanese, Okinawan and traditional Vietnamese fighting 
techniques. Eventually, they hope, the reputation will attract new students and 
allow them to reopen their school. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fire, the Ha family has been forced to hold classes at the 
Westminster Boys and Girls Club, which, they said, is not equipped for martial 
arts lessons. Student enrollment has fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the mission of my father, my brother and myself: to build a (martial 
arts) school," Ha said. "Without a school, you can't teach your art and your 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Trieu Chung Ha, who is also a law student at USC, impressed judges at the 
two-day Long Beach tournament with his mastery of the unusual technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very flexible," said Leilani Parker, who has run the tournament since 
her husband, Ed, died three years ago. She said Ha can point a leg straight up 
in a sort of standing split, which nobody else in the tournament could do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the kata or "forms" competition, participants fight an imaginary opponent, 
trying to score points with precise punches and kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must show your concentration by your facial expression and the power 
coming out from your arms and legs," Trieu Chung Ha said, adding that it takes 
years of training and daily practice to perfect the execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha and his brother train at least eight hours per day before a competition, 
including four hours of sparring every day. There are days, he said, when he 
doesn't feel like training, "but I don't have a choice really. My father makes 
us do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who have enrolled their children at the Has' martial arts school cite 
the discipline the Has instill in their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Mihn Pham credits the school with keeping his 17-year-old son, Tuan, busy, 
particularly on weekends, and with teaching the boy respect for elders. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to martial arts lessons, the school, which attracts a largely 
Vietnamese clientele, teaches family values and Vietnamese history. The 
teachers have named punches and kicks after kings, dynasties, mountains and 
rivers in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the elder Ha bought a 16,000-square-foot vacant parcel in Garden 
Grove, where he hopes to build the school under a new name, Quyen Dao Vietnam. 
They are remodeling a cottage on the overgrown lot, where they now live, and 
hope to convert it to an office with sleeping quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the family has no money to build the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father has used all his energy in trying to reopen the school," Trieu 
Chung Ha said. "With the school, there will be a foundation (for) his style."

JUDGE PONDERS FATE OF TWO CHARGED IN SPEARING DEATH; COURTS: THE REPUTED GANG 
MEMBERS ARE ON TRIAL FOR MURDER IN ATTACK ON 17-YEAR-OLD SAN CLEMENTE YOUTH IN 
MELEE AT A BEACH LAST FALL. 
</P>

<P>
 A judge on Tuesday began weighing the case against two teen-agers charged with 
murder in connection with the death of a San Clemente youth who was speared 
through the head with a paint roller during an altercation at a beach last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey said he will issue a 
decision Thursday in the non-jury trial of Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, and Hector 
Penuelas, 17, both of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments of the weeklong trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer told 
the judge Tuesday he believes the teens are guilty of second-degree murder, 
while defense attorneys Dennis McNerney and Duane Neary contended the killing 
was a tragic accident and urged a ruling of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and Penuelas are among six young men and teens -- all described by 
authorities as gang members or associates -- charged with killing Steve Woods, 
a 17-year-old San Clemente High School student who died 25 days after suffering 
the bizarre injury on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was a passenger in a vehicle that was pelted by bottles, rocks, beer 
cans, blocks of wood and other items in a parking lot at Calafia Beach County 
Park in San Clemente. His friends testified they were trying to flee the beach 
and did nothing to provoke the confrontation. The defendants, however, 
testified that they acted in self defense. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments, lawyers for the defendants characterized the fatal 
confrontation as a "series of coincidences" and "tragic circumstances," and one 
that had nothing to do with gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neary, who represents Bonilla, said his client and the others honestly 
believed that the vehicles speeding toward them posed a threat, however 
unreasonable a belief that might seem to some. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants "anticipated trouble" from the other groups because of an 
altercation with one of Woods' friends moments earlier, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that altercation, Bonilla testified, he pushed Sterling Breckenridge, whom 
he said made an obscene finger gesture at him several days earlier. Bonilla 
said he grabbed a pipe, which he later threw, because he thought Breckenridge 
had rounded up friends on the other side of the parking lot to return for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Breckenridge, however, testified there were no hostilities between him and the 
other group. He testified he pulled up to the group and asked about a party in 
San Juan Capistrano when he mistook them as acquaintances. After being hit, 
Breckenridge testified he drove back to his buddies and warned them to get out 
of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor disputed the defendants claims to self defense, and said Woods 
and his friends were vulnerable "sitting ducks" as they tried to leave the 
parking lot through the one and only exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing about self defense is self serving," Paer told the judge 
during his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer contended that the case is gang-related, saying the trouble started when 
Breckenridge mentioned San Juan Capistrano, which set off the reputed gang 
members, whose rivals are from that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sterling did not know it, but mere mention of San Juan was enough of an 
insult," Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not clear who actually speared Woods with the paint roller, 
Paer said all the defendants are legally responsible for Woods' death because 
they participated in the fatal attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys said last week they chose to allow the judge to decide 
the innocence or guilt of the teens because they didn't believe a jury could 
fairly assess the case, which stirred angry protests and revealed racial 
divisions in San Clemente. The defendants are Latino, while the victim was 
white. Some Latinos said they case helped resurrect racial stereotypes and 
question whether police and community response would have been the same if the 
victim had been a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla and Penuelas were juveniles at the time of the attack but are being 
tried as adults because of the seriousness of the charges. In addition to 
murder, each is charged with conspiracy, assault and a felony count of throwing 
items at a moving vehicle. If convicted, the teen-agers also could face a 
sentencing enhancement for gang involvement.

COMPLAINTS LED TO FIRING, EX-AIDE TO CONROY SAYS; LAWSUIT: ROBYN BOYD DETAILS 
CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, ALLEGING IT WAS 'VERY COMMON' FOR THE ASSEMBLYMAN 
TO MAKE UNWANTED GESTURES. 
</P>

<P>
 A former legislative aide who is suing Orange County Assemblyman Mickey Conroy 
for alleged sexual harassment came forward Tuesday to detail her charges, 
saying the 66-year-old lawmaker kissed her several times, made repeated sexual 
comments and ultimately fired her after she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Boyd, 35, said during a news conference with her attorney present that 
it was "very common" for the Republican from Orange to put his arm around her 
and make other provocative but unwanted gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 A married mother of three young children, Boyd said she put up with the 
harassment without complaining for several months out of fear it would hurt her 
standing in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be liked," Boyd said. "I wanted to be part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, who was privately disciplined by the Assembly Rules Committee over his 
handling of the case, continued Tuesday to deny the allegations, saying only 
that Boyd was taking events and reshaping them "out of context." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's free to file any lawsuit she wants to, free to say anything she wants 
to," Conroy said. "I'm not free to say what I want because it's a matter of 
litigation. I'll have to save what I have to say until the proper moment." 
</P>
<P>
 But another female employee who once worked in Conroy's office came to the 
assemblyman's defense Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey is so harmless," said Yolanda Benson, who worked as a legislative 
assistant for Conroy over a 1 1/2-year period before leaving in early 1993 to 
work for another lawmaker. "I just can't believe it. I was with him alone on 
numerous occasions and never did anything like this happen. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson said she left to join Assemblywoman Andrea Seastrand (R-San Luis 
Obispo) because the new position was a promotion and paid better. During her 
tenure with Conroy, Benson said, the assemblyman and other members of the staff 
treated her well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd give me a hug with his wife standing there," Benson said. "He's such a 
good man, I can't imagine him doing anything that could be misconstrued like 
this. He used to tell jokes, but they were corny, not off-color." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, however, painted a decidedly different portrait during her short news 
conference at an office building across from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the problems she experienced were a "pervasive" part of Conroy's 
office. During her first week of work in March, 1993, she attended an outdoor 
memorial service with Conroy. The weather was cool, so the assemblyman put his 
arm around her "and kind of pulled me in his jacket" instead of simply offering 
Boyd his coat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such experiences aside, Boyd said she viewed Conroy for the first couple 
months as a "grandfatherly figure." But then the unwanted encounters got worse, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, Conroy called her over during a fund-raising event, told a 
man standing with him to "watch this" and "puckered up his lips," Boyd said. 
Faced with the prospect of making her boss feel "humiliated," Boyd kissed 
Conroy. "I'm ashamed to say that I did it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said Conroy regularly made sexually suggestive comments. She recalled how 
Conroy draped his arms around her and another female employee one afternoon 
while they were walking to a political event at a Sacramento hotel. Conroy 
commented that "he didn't know if he should get one hotel room or two hotel 
rooms" because he had a woman on each arm, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said she talked with the other legislative aide, Michelle LaFranca, about 
Conroy's advances, but that "she seemed to play into it. For her, it wasn't an 
issue, I guess." LaFranca died in an auto accident earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Other staff members gave Boyd little solace, she said. At one point, she asked 
one "if Mickey was a 'lech,' " Boyd said. The colleague told her not to worry, 
that Conroy was a grandfatherly figure who was simply enjoying "his day in the 
sun," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she approached Conroy's chief of staff, Pete Conaty, to inquire about a 
salary increase he had promised, he put an X-rated weekly on her lap and "asked 
me how open-minded I was," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaty declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the treatment grew so bad that Boyd decided to complain. She said 
she talked it over for several days with her husband, trying to figure out an 
appropriate way to "let them know it wasn't OK to treat me as a sex object." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, she complained to Conaty, who is also named in the lawsuit. 
Instead of resolving the problem, Boyd said, the complaint resulted in her 
being ostracized and ultimately fired. After her dismissal, she went to the 
Assembly Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee hired two attorneys to conduct an investigation, and they 
determined that Conroy and Conaty had violated Assembly policy by not reporting 
Boyd's sexual harassment charges to the state Equal Employment Opportunity 
counselor assigned to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy and his chief of staff were privately disciplined. Rules Committee 
investigations of sexual harassment cases are conducted behind closed doors and 
punishments are kept private unless the committee publicly censures a member. 
But one Assembly insider said that the brunt of the punishment fell on Conaty, 
who was docked a week's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was given a job in a clerical post, but left that job in December, 1993, 
because she was so upset over the problems she was experiencing, she said. She 
is seeing a psychiatrist for emotional trauma she has suffered as a result of 
the alleged harassment. These days, she said, "my sense of self-worth is not 
quite what it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Long Beach, Boyd has a master's degree in audiology from Cal State 
Long Beach. She was staying home with her children before she got a part-time 
job in Conroy's office. Her goal was to work into a full-time position and help 
write legislation pertaining to the health field. Conroy sits on the Assembly 
Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, contends that Conroy's behavior 
was "intentional and malicious" and that Boyd was arbitrarily terminated 
without just cause, ruining her chances for a future in the state Capitol.

AGRAN WANTS URBAN-AREA PRIMARIES; POLITICS: EX-IRVINE MAYOR SAYS CITIES COULD 
SHOWCASE THEIR NEEDS IN NON-BINDING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. EXPERTS GIVE HIS 
IDEA MIXED REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Agran has a political innovation he hopes will force the nation to face 
the dire problems of cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Having learned his lessons firsthand as mayor of Irvine from 1982-84 and again 
from 1986-90, Agran pushed to get urban issues higher on the national agenda 
when he ran as a dark horse Democratic presidential candidate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While campaigning for months in New Hampshire for the state's presidential 
primary, he noticed something that fundamentally changed his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 While New Hampshire is rural, Agran said, the majority of Americans are urban. 
And while New Hampshire residents are mostly white, he said, the rest of the 
United States is ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real voters and the people confronting these problems every day live in 
America's cities," the former mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, an idea was born, something he calls a "national urban primary," to lift 
the level of federal interest in local urban issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Agran's plan: Give people -- all people -- a voice by organizing non-binding 
presidential primaries in 15 to 20 cities across the country to be held in 
November, 1995, in conjunction with the cities' local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The primaries would be early enough in the 1996 campaigns to have a major 
impact, he believes. And they would raise city issues to a new national stature 
by forcing candidates to visit a representative cross-section of American 
cities to discuss such urban concerns as housing, economic development and 
crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't replace the Hew Hampshire primary," he said of the proposed national 
urban primary, "but I do think it will redress an inexcusable imbalance. New 
Hampshire is a beautiful state but completely unrepresentative of the country. 
This will change the national political landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After completing his unsuccessful presidential campaign, Agran said, he 
persuaded the U.S. Conference of Mayors to adopt a resolution favoring his 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he conducted a study pointing to its need, and for the past two years, 
he's been directing the effort from the Irvine offices of an independent 
nonprofit organization called CityVote.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, according to Agran, the group has spent about $150,000, mostly 
donated by individuals and private foundations. By 1995, he said, he expects it 
to spend another $200,000 to $450,000 to provide information, brochures and 
technical assistance to cities considering or planning participation in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage of scheduling the primary to coincide with local elections, he 
said, is that cities will be able to participate without underwriting the cost 
of a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have to do," he said, "is add the names of the candidates to the 
ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, according to Agran, six cities have agreed to do so: Minneapolis and 
St. Paul, Minn.; Baltimore; Spokane and Olympia, Wash.; and Pasadena. Other 
cities considering participation, he said, include Boston; Durham, N.C.; New 
Haven, Conn.; San Francisco; Houston; Cincinnati; and Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Agran said, he is targeting Santa Ana, which he called "one 
of the country's biggest cities, which . . . happens to have a Hispanic 
majority that makes it . . . very reflective of the changing demographics of 
Southern California and the entire region." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said Tuesday that he was only vaguely aware of 
the project and had no plans to pursue it. "We have not discussed it, don't 
have a position on it and it's not on our agenda," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sal Mendoza, president of the Santa Unified School District -- the only 
entity holding an election in November, 1995 -- said that he liked the idea and 
had already instructed the district's superintendent to look into its legal 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to see it happen," Mendoza said of the proposed national urban 
primary. "We need to follow up on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions elsewhere in the country have been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee told The Christian Science 
Monitor that the project is a bit irrelevant because President Clinton already 
has urban issues clearly on his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Republican National Committee said she saw no harm in 
it, but that the party would not tell its candidates whether or not to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hess, a political scientist with the Brookings Institution in 
Washington, described the idea as a bit absurd. "Delegates are elected by 
states, not by cities," he told the Monitor. "If you're going to have 
'primaries' for a set of special pleaders, why not have straw votes for farmers 
or miners?" 
</P>
<P>
 None of the criticism, however, has shaken Agran's belief that this is an idea 
whose time has come. "It's no longer just an innovative idea," he said. 
"CityVote is now a growing reality on the political landscape."

TWO FOOTBALL PLAYERS HELD IN VEGAS SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested two Fullerton College football players during practice Tuesday 
on murder warrants in connection with the slaying of a woman in Las Vegas in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on information provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police 
Department, Fullerton Detective Tom Basham, a gang investigator, went to the 
school's campus on East Chapman Avenue about 3:45 p.m. and arrested Anthony 
Steven James, 20, and Malcolm Lathion Gray, 19, both of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken to Fullerton City Jail and later transferred to Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was identified as Amy Tuttle, who was killed May 5 at the Mission 
Apartments in Las Vegas, according to Las Vegas Police Officer Dave Radcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Police here and in Las Vegas could provide no further details of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Coach Gene Murphy said the two players were "walk-ons," Anthony a running 
back and Gray a linebacker. They had not played in any games. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder warrants for James and Gray were issued Monday by the Clark County, 
Nev., district attorney's office, Radcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were the result of a joint effort by Corona and Fullerton police, 
Radcliffe said. Nevada expects to extradite the men for trial, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD OKS $438,000 FOR GRAFFITI PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reinforcing a commitment to wipe out graffiti in the county, the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to spend $438,000 for an aggressive program that 
already has eradicated more than 800,000 square feet of graffiti vandalism in 
its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the program has been considered a success, county officials say they 
need to continue efforts to stop graffiti vandals from spreading their urban 
scrawlings on buildings, freeway signs, walls and other targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to say that we can declare a victory on the war on graffiti, but the 
truth is we can't," said Charles Ferguson, coordinator of the county's Graffiti 
Abatement Program. "We've won some major battles, but the war goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who was stepping down as director of the program to take another 
county position, received a commendation from the board Tuesday for helping 
lessen the county's graffiti problem. His duties will be assumed by the public 
works maintenance manager, Tom Connelie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made a huge difference," Ferguson told the board. "I just had the 
pleasure of leading the parade for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The program funding approved by the board is a slight reduction over last 
year's $510,000, partly because the coordinator position is being eliminated 
and assumed by the public works manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the program focused on graffiti removal, improving 
coordination of graffiti abatement efforts in cities and local agencies and 
strengthening efforts to prosecute vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the program's accomplishments was removing graffiti on the average of 
2.8 days after it was reported, according to a report by the county's 
Environmental Management Agency, which heads the program. County officials said 
they eventually hope to bring the removal time to one or two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the cleanup was done by people fulfilling court community service 
obligations. More than 65 people completed nearly 5,000 community service hours 
painting over graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who has played a key role in the program, praised 
the accomplishments of the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep the heat on the graffiti vandals," Vasquez said. "I believe 
we need to continue this program if we are ultimately to win the war." MATT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PROBLEMATIC TREES WILL BE REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Molokai Place was first. And Gibraltar Avenue, just around the corner, could 
be next. 
</P>
<P>
 Some trees in Costa Mesa are starting to destroy sidewalks, leaving city 
officials with no choice but to cut down Mother Nature for the sake of 
preserving the infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 About 16 Brazilian pepper trees were cut down this week along Molokai Place -- 
and now residents in the old section of Mesa Verde are trying to come to a 
consensus on which trees to plant in their place. 
</P>
<P>
 The American gum tree, the top contender, will be considered for approval 
tonight at 6:30 by the Parks, Recreation Facilities and Parkways Commission at 
City Hall, 77 Fair Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brazilian pepper tree was a beautiful thing, but living with it was a 
complication," resident Frank Pap said. "It dropped leaves all the time, and it 
had these little red berries that could ruin the paint on your car. And I've 
got bills to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, the roots to the pepper tree were too shallow and beginning 
to cause noticeable cracks in the sidewalks and gutters -- much like the ficus 
trees are doing along Gibraltar, except on a smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The city decided to give them the ax and replace them with jacarandas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pap and fellow residents last week had a petition opposing the jacaranda and 
offering the American gum tree as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The gum tree turns colors in the fall, has fewer leaves than the jacaranda, 
and stays bare for about a month -- the type of quality residents along Molokai 
Place are looking for in their arbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnolia is also being mulled over as a possible replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pepper tree, at least the one I had, used to have white leaves that 
people would track into the house," said resident Ron Barnett, who stood at the 
curb pointing out the cracks in the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each tree has its problems, that's just life," Pap quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Alkema, the Costa Mesa's parks superintendent, said the American gum 
trees, if planted, will resemble those growing in the median in front of Orange 
Coast College on Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the city) feel it's a suitable tree," he said. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TOLL ROAD SURVEY WORK PERMITTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency will be allowed to do 
limited survey work and erosion control on a disputed stretch of tollway that 
cuts through environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon and is the subject of a 
lawsuit in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for a coalition of environmental groups, which sued to stop 
construction on 4 1/2 miles of tollway between El Toro Road and Newport Coast 
Drive, approved the limited construction work in an agreement reached with the 
toll road agency Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals halted construction on the 4 1/2-mile 
stretch in June, when the court issued an injunction to allow tollway opponents 
additional time to prepare a lawsuit contending that federal officials approved 
the project illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists charge that the Federal Highway Administration violated 
environmental laws when it approved construction of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reached by both sides last week allows the tollway agency to 
survey the center line of the road and take measures to identify and protect 
plants and locate the nests of birds in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the agency will be permitted to place straw bales and sandbags in 
previously graded areas. Tollway agency attorney Rob Thornton said the work 
will not involve further grading or ground disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Mike Weinberger, who represents the coalition of environmental groups 
that filed the lawsuit, said the limited agreement "does not signal an 
acceptance of the toll road on our part." 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be going in and putting erosion controls in place to ensure that 
the grading done in a hurry in June does not lead to problems this winter when 
the rains come," Weinberger said. "The other activities are mostly in the 
nature of documenting environmental resources."H.G. REZA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FARES FOR VAN RIDES TO RISE 20 CENTS JAN. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disabled bus passengers who rely on door-to-door access vans will see fares 
increase 20 cents to $1.70 beginning Jan. 1, instead of $2 as originally 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority approved the smaller increase this 
week and voted to use money from a $1-million-a-year reserve of Measure M sales 
taxes to help pay for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was the first in three years for the approximately 5,000 people 
certified to use the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit agency spokesman John Standiford said the vans used for door-to-door 
service make about 15,000 trips each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The vans are used by disabled and elderly passengers who cannot use regular 
bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers must make advanced reservations before they are picked up at home 
and driven to any destination within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare increase from $1.50 to $1.70 per ride represented a compromise. 
Earlier this year, users of the service objected to the proposed 50-cent 
increase, and the transportation authority held three public hearings in May 
and June to discuss the proposed fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearings, transit officials decided to tap into the annual 
$1-million reserve fund, which is set aside specifically to stabilize fares for 
seniors and disabled persons. The fund will subsidize 55% of the fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 A special task force formed to review the access program will meet again in 
September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency said the periodic reviews are necessary because of possible 
changes in projected ridership, revenues and costs.H.G. REZA

 Residents living near a Victoria Street house in which a woman was found shot 
to death told police Tuesday that they had heard gunshots Sunday night but had 
not called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old woman's body was found by a friend Monday.Police said she had 
bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just baffles me," said Lt. John FitzPatrick. "That they heard shots (and 
didn't call police) is really unbelievable. And it's very unusual for this 
city. In most parts of the community, people are very conscious about a thing 
of this nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the neighbors questioned Tuesday heard the gunfire as well as 
screams. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they don't know if the woman, who was shot several times, 
would have lived if she had been found sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was not identified pending notification of relatives. Police said 
they did not know if she lived in the house in the 800 block of Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs of robbery and police have no suspects, FitzPatrick 
said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SADDLEBACK DISTRICT OKS 9% BUDGET JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Saddleback Community College District board has approved a $71.7-million 
operating budget for the new fiscal year, which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is a 9% jump over the previous year.Trustees unanimously approved 
the spending plan during their Monday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the budget increase can be attributed to $3.7 million the college 
district received in delinquent local property tax revenue dating back to 1992, 
district spokeswoman Diane Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riopka said the money was a one-time-only lump sum of "catch-up" funds that 
the district will not receive next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, we've been told that this would no longer apply," Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $71.7-million budget covers day-to-day operations of the college district 
and doesn't include capital outlay expenditures.JEFF BEAN

<P>
 Thomas E. Stringer, the managing partner of a Lake Forest nursing home, has 
been appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson to the state's Continuing Care Contract 
Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee helps the State Department of Social Services draw up 
regulations for companies that open nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer of San Clemente is the committee's only representative from a 
for-profit nursing home. He is a partner in the Freedom Management Co., which 
owns Freedom Village in Lake Forest and the Village in Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can work together to make life better for the residents," Stringer 
said. "We need to look at the overall structure and finances of corporations 
that run continuing care facilities. We need to look at the background and 
experience of the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Orange County Supervisor 
Thomas Riley recommended Stringer, 48, for the unpaid position. Stringer has 
been involved in the nursing home business since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's office also named three other people to the Continuing Care 
Committee. They are: Charles Everett Cable, 50, and Ted Radamaker, 68, both of 
Claremont; and John Hayes Breux, 45, of Rancho Murieta.LYNN FRANEY

<P>
 He wasn't planning on any moves, but after just 11 months as chief of police 
services for the city, Randy Blair got an offer he couldn't turn down. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly appointed captain in the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Blair 
will take his unexpected promotion and make way for the new police chief, 
Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Kim Markuson on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a point in my career where you don't really anticipate promotion 
yet," said Blair, 48. "Needless to say, I'm pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime resident of Mission Viejo, he's getting ready for the long commute 
to Santa Ana. Blair isn't sure what he'll be doing, because Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates hasn't issued his permanent assignment yet. 
</P>
<P>
 His replacement is a veteran of the Sheriff's Department who completes an 
eight-year assignment with the county narcotics division. 
</P>
<P>
 An Irvine resident, Markuson started his career in the early 1980s as a patrol 
officer and an investigator in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed by how much the area has grown since I was working here," he said, 
"particularly Aliso Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
 Markuson has spent time in Mission Viejo over the past few weeks, learning 
about his new job and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mission Viejo has always been known as a place that possesses a lot of 
community spirit and pride," he said. "That makes working in that kind of 
environment very inviting." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't plan any changes at first. Anti-crime efforts such as the South 
County regional graffiti and gang prevention task force are running "like a 
well-oiled machine," Markuson said. "It's not like I have to come in and 
reinvent the wheel."FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; ARF TO LEAD DRIVE FOR DOG PARK FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Animal Rescue Foundation, or ARF, has offered to lead a fund-raising drive 
for a proposed city dog park. But some residents have criticized it as an 
example of bureaucratic waste and placing pets' needs before those of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Laguna Niguel members are ready and willing to help," ARF spokeswoman 
Mary Obenberger said. "It's good for animals to come together and have their 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 ARF's fund-raising offer comes as welcome news to Laguna Niguel residents who 
had argued that money spent installing a dog park -- which the city manager had 
said might reach $80,000 -- could be better spent on more recreational 
facilities for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know that there would be private fund-raising," said resident Retta 
Mullaney, who originally argued against the plan but who now, after ARF's 
announcement, said it might be an acceptable development. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Janet Godfrey suggested several months ago that the city look into 
building a park where dogs could run unleashed. She had said at the time that 
she expected pet lovers to help pay for the park. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar dog park in Laguna Beach is a popular gathering spot for South 
County dog owners, Godfrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog park would probably be located next to Fire Station 49 on Street of 
the Golden Lantern. It would include benches, drinking fountains for people and 
different ones for the dogs, a plastic bag dispenser and a wrought-iron fence 
along Golden Lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative plan had called for building a new parking lot, but the Parks and 
Recreation Commission recommended instead that an existing lot on one side of 
the station be used and connected to the park by a path. 
</P>
<P>
 City landscape architect Nancy Palmer is finalizing the dog park plans, which 
will be considered by Park and Recreation commissioners at their Sept. 12 
meeting.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; FRESHLY PAINTED JAIL IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's first privately run jail is now open for business. And with a 
fresh coat of paint, laundry-fresh linens and remote-control color televisions 
in the larger cells, the Seal Beach City Jail is almost like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for those big iron doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Grossman, former Western Region director of the federal Bureau of Prisons, 
spent $50,000 to renovate the never-used City Jail, which he expects to 
generate a profit for himself and for the city. The new jail opened about three 
weeks ago behind the Seal Beach Boulevard police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman figures that after the first year of operation the jail will earn the 
city about $100,000 a year in fees from other cities and law enforcement 
agencies that use the jail. Some prisoners will have the option of paying to 
stay at the City Jail to avoid incarceration at the County Jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would rather be in this small jail than the county jail," said 
Grossman, a 62-year-old Brea resident who was appointed by a federal court to 
oversee conditions in the Orange County Jail from 1985 to 1988. "They feel 
safer here." 
</P>
<P>
 City and police officials say the privately run jail is one of only a few such 
facilities in the state and the only one in Orange County. Irvine has a 
privately run holding facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail, which can house 30 inmates in six cells, has a large, rubber-floored 
detoxification room. The maximum stay is one year. Only low- to moderate-risk 
prisoners will be held at the City Jail, where there are currently three men 
convicted of drunk driving and an embezzler. All four prisoners leave the jail 
during the day on work furloughs and return each night. They were ordered by 
the court to pay the city for the cost of their imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although City Council members were initially concerned about the safety of a 
privately run jail, they unanimously approved the venture last April, saying it 
would help increase badly needed revenues without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper than if we ran it ourselves," said Mayor George Brown, adding 
that the jail was never used after its construction in 1978 because of concerns 
over operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jail also saves the city the $158-per-prisoner booking fee charged by 
the County Jail. But police say those charged with more serious crimes such as 
rape, armed robbery and murder will continue to be sent to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail employees are hired and trained by Grossman's company, Corrections 
Services Inc. But Seal Beach police Capt. Gary Maiten oversees jail operations, 
and the city has the right to close the jail within 180 days if the experiment 
proves unsuccessful. The city and Grossman's company split operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said San Diego has the only other privately run city jail in the 
state. The Seal Beach jail is his first entrepreneurial venture, but Grossman 
sees a growth market in crime, thanks to prison overcrowding and the high cost 
of building new facilities. His next project is the creation of a 320-bed 
prison for youthful offenders in Century, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 90 privately operated jails and prisons throughout the 
country," Grossman said. "That's only 2% of the market. There's plenty of room 
to grow."RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; OIL-WATER MIXTURE FLOWS ONTO STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A backed-up pipeline sent more than 100 gallons of an oil-water mixture 
bubbling from beneath three manhole covers Tuesday, forcing officials to divert 
traffic as they cleaned up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The smelly black substance began flowing onto State College Boulevard between 
Commonwealth and Chapman avenues about 2 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton firefighters erected several dirt dikes in an effort to contain the 
mixture and prevent it from oozing into storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a small amount got into the drains, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suction hoses were used to remove the stuff from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they aren't sure what caused the pipeline to back up. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe sends oil and water from a Unocal oil field in Fullerton to a 
clarification plant in Anaheim, said Sylvia Palmer, spokeswoman for the 
Fullerton Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said fire officials are investigating whether the oil mixture leaked 
out of a valve or whether the pipeline ruptured. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CASA CARRILLO GETS PERMIT FOR 2 PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casa Carrillo Restaurant has been granted a temporary permit to provide live 
and recorded music for two family parties to be held at the restaurant this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council issued the permit last week as a test of whether the 
establishment, which was denied a permit six months ago, can hold orderly 
parties at its La Habra Boulevard location. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Carrillo, which had an entertainment permit two years ago, lost it last 
year because of residents' complaints about noise, loitering, littering, public 
urination and inadequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's owner, Jose Carrillo, tried for a year to win approval of 
another entertainment permit, but finally gave up in March, ending his fight to 
have live music at his eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing in February, the council refused to grant a permit for 
live and amplified dance music, telling Carrillo to seek a permit for softer 
mariachi music, which does not require amplification. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo applied for such a permit but withdrew his application when it became 
clear that even mariachi music would not win council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing four months ago, Councilman William D. Mahoney said he 
didn't like mariachi music and that Carrillo should cater to customers who 
enjoy eating Mexican food without having to hear mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Carrillo has played only recorded background music at his 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary permit granted last week allowed for a live four-member band 
without amplification and recorded music spun by a disc jockey until 11 p.m. on 
two Saturdays this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a great number of problems in the past" with Casa Carrillo, City 
Manager Lee Risner said. "If this does not work well, it's going to be very, 
very difficult to grant a permit for any kind of entertainment" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo's son, Jose Carrillo, told the council he did not expect his 
neighbors to complain about loud music or disorderly conduct during the two 
private parties because he planned to halt the music at 11 p.m. and keep the 
noise levels down so neighbors won't hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council granted the temporary permit, Mayor David M. Cheverton said 
it was "a good way to test the good neighbor policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Police will issue a report on how many complaints are received from neighbors, 
Risner said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; UNION MAY GO TO COURT OVER LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A union has threatened legal action if the City Council does not offer 
acceptable severance pay to five city maintenance workers scheduled to be laid 
off in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last month unanimously voted to lay off five landscape employees 
as a budget-cutting move. The council said it is cheaper to hire a private firm 
to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff vote prompted protest speeches at the July 25 council meeting by 
members of the Cypress Maintenance Employees Assn., a union that represents the 
45 maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members were back at the City Council meeting this week. Their staff 
representative, Robin Nahin, told the council that the union will seek a court 
injunction to halt the layoffs if the workers are not given an agreeable 
severance package. 
</P>
<P>
 "You offered your employees essentially nothing at all; you just got rid of 
them," Nahin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahin also charged that city government has refused to negotiate for an 
acceptable severance package for the five maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because legal action was being threatened, City Council members said they 
generally could not comment on Nahin's charges. But Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age 
told Nahin that the city is still trying to negotiate with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey C. Freedman, a lawyer who represents the city in labor negotiations, 
told the council he disputed Nahin's accusations. "I think the facts were 
somewhat falsely represented to you," Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "There has been no cutoff of negotiations" with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahin, in an interview outside the council chambers, said that an acceptable 
offer to the maintenance workers would be some short-time medical coverage and 
a week's pay for every year they have worked for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials did not disclose what offer, if any, they are making to the 
workers scheduled to be laid off. Nahin said the city had tentatively offered a 
flat $2,000 to each worker. She said the city's offer does not account for 
differing seniority among workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahin also charged that the city picked workers for layoff without regard for 
their seniority. BILL BILLITER

COUNTY CALLS FOR NEW FIRE STANDARDS AND CODES; DISASTER: SUPERVISORS SEEK TO 
AVOID A REPETITION OF LAST FALL'S DEVASTATING FIRESTORMS. PLAN STRESSES 
FIRE-RETARDANT BUILDINGS AND BRUSH CLEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to prevent a repeat of last year's devastating wildfires, the Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday encouraged cities and the state to adopt a host of new 
fire-prevention and firefighting measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, proposed by members of a countywide task force, include 
establishing new uniform building and fire codes, stricter brush-clearance 
standards and more intense training for firefighters who battle blazes in areas 
that mix urban and rural environments.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their findings were not surprising," County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms told 
the board. "People in Orange County love to live surrounded by wildlife 
habitat," he said, but "unfortunately any single date can bring about disaster 
and our scenic countrysides can turn into infernos." 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said the wildfire problem requires strengthening fire-prevention and 
firefighting standards and goes beyond spending money to acquire more 
firefighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Wildland/Urban Interface Task Force spent eight months 
analyzing the causes of last October's firestorms that burned about 36,000 
acres in Laguna Canyon, Anaheim Hills and Cleveland National Forest, destroying 
or damaging nearly 470 houses. Total damages were put at $528 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenes that we saw are indelibly painted in my memory forever," Holms 
said, adding that the task force was a cooperative effort of about 70 people 
representing fire departments, the county, cities, developers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, county supervisors unanimously endorsed the task force's plan, 
which included a recommendation that local government agencies adopt amendments 
that would go beyond the state's uniform building and fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those codes specify what types of fire-resistant building materials should be 
used in "high fire hazard" areas. They also regulate landscaping, property 
setbacks and structural designs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Holms said, houses in high-risk areas should have fire-retardant 
roofs, enclosed eaves and fire-resistant vegetation, such as ice plant, around 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a slide presentation, Holms noted that an entire street in Laguna Beach had 
been leveled by the fire except for one home, which was built to better defend 
against fires and where brush had been cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When fire strikes our communities, it's too late," he said. "Those homes that 
are in the path of that fire that cannot defend themselves . . . stand a very 
high chance of being lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also recommended that the county, cities and state adopt a 
common set of guidelines for clearing or reducing brush near homes and other 
buildings, set minimum training levels for firefighters who work in areas prone 
to brush fires and increase the number of drills and controlled burns that 
local and state firefighters conduct together.  
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will be circulated throughout the county and state, fire 
officials said. Holms said he hopes all the task force's findings will be 
adopted by the county's cities and the state.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner echoed that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real model, and I hope it is used by other communities," he 
said.

MAN GETS 5-YEAR SENTENCE IN ATTEMPTED KIDNAPING OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Tustin ice cream vendor was sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison after 
pleading guilty to breaking into a neighbor's home and kidnaping a 7-year-old 
girl who was later rescued -- unharmed -- by her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Vasquez Bojorquez, 35, gained access to his neighbor's home across the 
street by slipping in through an unlocked sliding door.He snatched Fabiola 
Lopez as she slept, draping her over his shoulder as he tried to make his 
getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bojorquez's movements awakened the girl's uncle, Hernan Salazar, who was 
dressed only in his undershorts when he chased Bojorquez down the street. 
Bojorquez dropped Fabiola and hid in some nearby bushes, where he was later 
found by a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Carlisle-Raines said Tuesday she would not 
speculate about Bojorquez's intentions when he kidnaped the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender MacDonald Becket said his client was intoxicated on the 
night of the attempted kidnaping and has been extremely remorseful since his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very intoxicated, confused, disoriented," Becket said. "I can say that 
he meant the little girl no harm. This is a situation that he has been very 
remorseful about since he was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Municipal Court Judge Donna L. Crandall sentenced Bojorquez 
immediately after he pleaded guilty Tuesday to felony burglary and kidnaping 
charges.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his June 29 arrest, Bojorquez told police two men were trying 
to rob him and he believed he would be safe from an attack if he were carrying 
the child in his arms.

MAN SUFFERS SEVERE ELECTRICAL SHOCK AT POWER STATION

<P>
 A man suffered a severe electrical shock Tuesday when he touched a 
high-voltage transformer at Southern California Edison's Gisler Avenue power 
station, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, believed to be in his 40s, suffered second-degree burns over about 
70% of his body and was in critical condition at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange.He could not be immediately identified because his clothes were burned 
and firefighters could not find any of the man's identification, Costa Mesa 
Battalion Chief Ken Soltis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim apparently climbed over a fence at the power station and somehow 
made contact with a transformer, Soltis said. The electrical shock, estimated 
to be more than 20,000 volts, set the man's clothes on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Soltis said fire officials don't know why the man entered the power station.

ANAHEIM DROPS PLAN FOR PRIVATE GOLF CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to turn over operations of two municipal golf courses to a private 
contractor was rejected unanimously by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by American Golf Corp. to run H.G. Dad Miller and Anaheim Hills 
golf courses lost the support of Mayor Tom Daly and Councilman Irv Pickler, who 
had supported the idea, following their review last week of a cost analysis by 
an independent management consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very educational process," Daly said. "We've all learned what the 
private sector is willing to pay and (city staff) is committed to meeting it, 
matching it and maybe beating it." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action was a relief to opponents of the plan, who have shown up 
at several meetings this summer to voice their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy for golf employees and for the city, too," said Sharon Ericson, 
president of the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn. "Those courses are 
definitely moneymakers for the city, and it would have been ridiculous to 
contract them out. There was no public support for it whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 American Golf's proposal to operate the courses would have brought an 
estimated $85,000 to city coffers annually for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The private contractor would have made about $2 million worth of improvements 
to the irrigation systems at the courses and would have paid rent of $1.6 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Fred Hunter and Bob D. Simpson have opposed such a move while Daly, 
Pickler and Councilman Frank Feldhaus had favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council postponed voting on the issue to give the city's Budget 
Advisory Commission a chance to review an independent report by KPMG Peat 
Marwick Management Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed with city analysts, who said the financial benefits are 
minimal and do not justify the risk of losing control over the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was ordered in June following conflicting testimony on how much 
revenue a private contractor could bring to the city.

ANAHEIM PUTS OFF VOTE ON BILLBOARD BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Temporarily leaving a 25-year city ban intact, the City Council Tuesday 
postponed until December a vote on a controversial proposal to allow freeway 
billboards.  
</P>
<P>
 The council could not summon the votes to either reject or approve a proposal 
by Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc. to erect 10 freeway signs throughout the 
city. After a lively debate, the council voted 4 to 1 to revisit the sign 
proposal Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency's latest bid marks the company's fifth attempt in a decade to persuade 
Anaheim to permit the freeway billboards. The Los Angeles firm's last proposal 
was voted down in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's been like Dracula," said Mayor Tom Daly, who failed to obtain a 
second on a motion to defeat Regency's plan. "I wish I could just drive a stake 
through its heart tonight so it would go away." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Irv Pickler, who cast the lone vote against postponing a 
decision, praised Regency's plan, because it would mean three fewer signs in 
the city. In exchange for approving the 10 signs, Regency would tear down 13 
smaller ones on arterial roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we can eliminate a sign," Pickler said, "I feel we have something to 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Regency President Brian Kennedy said after the vote he will resubmit his 
proposal to the council in December. Kennedy blamed "special interests" for 
delaying approval of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen speakers, many of them prominent in business in the city, spoke 
against Regency's proposal Tuesday night. They argued that freeway billboards 
would add clutter to the city and diminish its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wished they would have killed it right from the top," Disneyland Vice 
President Ron Dominguez said. "Now we are going to have to go this whole 
exercise again. But at least it's delayed for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Regency proposed to put four of the billboards at the junction of the Orange 
and Riverside freeways. The signs would be up to 60 feet above the road and up 
to 950 square feet. They also would be at least 500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Department opposed Regency's plan Tuesday night, arguing the 
roadway signs could threaten a $1-million landscaping project. Planning staff 
also said the Regency proposal would interfere with efforts to improve the 
appeal of the city's tourist areas.

OCTA, DRIVERS UNION REACH PACT ON CALLING OUT BUS STOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Bus drivers who fail to announce stops at major intersections will not be 
fired after the first offense, under an agreement reached by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority and the Teamsters Union, which represents the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials had threatened to fire two drivers for failing to call out 
the stops and had imposed less severe discipline on two dozen others for the 
same violation.Federal law requires drivers to call out major intersections for 
visually impaired passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, transportation authority spokesman John Standiford said 
the agency had received complaints from riders who said drivers failed to 
announce major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers and union officials said that when drivers forget to do that, it's 
usually because they are trying to maneuver safely in traffic and deal with 
passengers at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But transit officials considered the infraction serious enough that they had 
begun termination proceedings against two drivers.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, reached between the union and the agency, drivers will 
receive a warning letter for the first offense. A second offense within a year 
could lead to termination. 
</P>
<P>
 The union will continue to contest written warnings given to drivers before 
the agreement was reached this week.

SAVE RAMS TASK FORCE TO MAKE ITS PITCH TODAY; SPORTS: GROUP HOPES OFFER OF $50 
MILLION FOR MINORITY INTEREST, STADIUM IMPROVEMENTS WILL KEEP TEAM IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just 12 days before what could be the Rams' last season opener here, the Save 
the Rams task force today will unveil its game plan to buy part of the team for 
$50 million and keep it in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-ditch proposal, however, doesn't contain the one thing Rams President 
John Shaw has said he wanted most, an element other cities are offering: a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, members of Save the Rams, a group of about 45 local businessmen and 
elected officials, are confident that their proposal for a refurbished stadium 
contains enough enticements that Shaw won't be able to dismiss it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a package of substance and can't be ignored," said Orange 
County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who is scheduled to help present the 
proposal to Shaw at the Rams' Los Angeles headquarters this morning. The Rams 
"don't have done deals in any of the other communities," Steiner said, "and 
frankly I think it would be foolish for John Shaw to reject it flat out." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who has not shown much interest in the Orange County group thus far, has 
been meeting with officials from St. Louis and Baltimore for months. Both 
cities are offering the Rams new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But two weeks ago, Shaw put talks with St. Louis on hold until officials there 
work out a lease dispute over the city's new 70,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole scenario has changed quite a bit," said Paul Salata, a 
potential investor in the team and a member of Save the Rams. "Two months ago 
there was no chance. Now Shaw's having a meeting with the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the enticements being offered Shaw and Rams owner Georgia 
Frontiere are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $50-million infusion of cash in the form of a minority purchase of the 
team. Save the Rams members have indicated that 10 yet-to-be-chosen investors, 
from inside and outside the group, will contribute $5 million each to buy 
approximately a third of the team, which has been valued at $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't finalized yet by any stretch," said Ron Lane, a Newport Beach 
developer and Save the Rams member. "If the Rams were to accept it, then we'd 
work out the investors." 
</P>
<P>
 * A revamped, football-only Anaheim Stadium complete with improved sight lines 
to the playing field, more than 100 plush luxury boxes and lucrative club 
seating with waiter service -- all financed by city bond money. Save the Rams 
members have said in the past that the renovations would cost $50 million to 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Season ticket sale guarantees would also be part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and Save the Rams members are considering constructing a new, 
smaller baseball stadium nearby for the Angels, Anaheim Stadium's other tenant. 
The new ballpark would be financed with public and private money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, whose lease ends in 2001, also have made it known that they are 
not happy in the 28-year-old stadium. City officials and task force members 
have said it would be cheaper to build a new baseball stadium, which would cost 
about $100 million, than a football arena, which could cost nearly double that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new Rams corporate headquarters and practice facility that would include a 
two-story, 40,000-square-foot building, 2 1/2 football fields, a weight room, a 
locker room and 400 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 After a much-publicized spat with the city and the Magnolia School District 
earlier this year, the Rams signed an extension of their lease at their current 
practice field, Rams Park, at the former Juliette Low Elementary School in 
Anaheim. Rams officials have complained that the park is inadequate for their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a further enticement, the proposal includes the development of a 
100,000-square-foot "mixed-use sports-oriented" retail center near the practice 
facility, which would include such tenants as Legends Sports Bar & Restaurant 
and Sportsmart, a major sporting goods chain. A portion of the property tax 
produced by the retail stores could be used to offset the Rams lease, Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The training facility -- which would cost about $5 million -- the new 
headquarters and the retail center are scheduled to be built on the current 
26-acre site of the Stadium Drive-In movie theater in Orange, Steiner 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel, bordered by Main Street on the east and Katella Avenue on the 
south, is immediately across the Santa Ana River from The Pond in Anaheim, 
which could use the training facility's parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's 400 parking spaces there and parking is $6," Steiner said. "There's 
so many events at the (arena) now that are sellouts, it's a real potential 
revenue source." 
</P>
<P>
 The package could be funded with redevelopment money, parking fees and private 
funds. "It would not be using any existing tax money," Steiner added. 
</P>
<P>
 * To catch Frontiere's attention, the Save the Rams proposal would also 
include her pet project, a retirement home for football players similar to one 
established for movie actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth said Tuesday that the Save the Rams 
presentation is not being made by the city or on behalf of the city. But Ruth 
said committee members have been assured that the city would be willing to 
consider renovating Anaheim Stadium should the team decide to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is certainly willing to look at retrofitting the stadium," Ruth 
said. "The city is willing to do certain things -- if we get the cooperation of 
everyone -- that could enhance revenues for the Rams or another NFL team." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams members said they don't expect Shaw to respond to the proposal 
today. The group simply hopes its pitch will open the door to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really just the start of the process," said Frank Bryant, president 
of the Rams Booster Club.

ZEDILLO OFFERS TO CONSULT WITH OPPOSITION ON POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, the self-declared winner of Mexico's landmark presidential 
election, sought Tuesday to consolidate his imminent victory for the 
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, offering to meet opposition 
leaders and craft a common platform for his government. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final counting late Tuesday night showed that Zedillo would probably 
win with the PRI's smallest percentage in six decades -- and with independent 
reports of ruling party fraud starting to come in from the countryside -- Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, the charismatic second-place candidate, did not reject 
Zedillo's invitation outright. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fernandez, who as the National Action Party candidate had received 26.6% 
of the vote with 87.8% of returns tallied, called Zedillo's offer premature and 
said it smacked of political gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first place, I have not received any invitation," Fernandez, a former 
opposition leader in the Mexican Senate, said at PAN headquarters. "But I would 
like to respectfully suggest to Mr. Zedillo that, out of prudence and respect 
for the institutions that are judging and carrying out this process, that he 
wait to know who is finally going to be legally declared president in Mexico 
before extending these kinds of invitations." 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-independent Federal Electoral Institute, which continued to count 
returns from the most remote districts through the night, is required to 
announce final results today. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's director general, Arturo Nunez, announced figures late Tuesday 
that statistically ensured Zedillo's victory, probably with slightly more than 
50% of the vote. Nunez also stated that the PRI was leading in 278 of the 300 
legislative districts and that it would win a clear majority in the 128-seat 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot for the opposition was in Mexico City, where Nunez said 
the governing party was leading in just 40% of City Council races. 
</P>
<P>
 At a victory celebration cocktail party at a luxury hotel in downtown Mexico 
City, progressive aides to Zedillo cringed as they heard the latest figures. 
With such a large margin of victory for the PRI, several expressed concern that 
the 42-year-old economist would have difficulty pushing his promised political 
reforms through the party's Old Guard -- particularly in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts have speculated that if Zedillo is confirmed as the winner, he 
may invite opposition representatives into his Cabinet -- a first for a party 
that has ruled with an authoritarian hand since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said he would not serve in Zedillo's Cabinet but added that the 10 
million votes he is expected to win should be represented in the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are facing a historic opportunity to design and share a common platform of 
government in which we all recognize each other," Zedillo declared Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Jones, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, issued a statement praising the three 
leading presidential candidates. He declared the elections "a milestone in 
Mexico's progress in political reform and democratization" and a "complement" 
to the dramatic economic reforms that Zedillo has pledged to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of third-place presidential hopeful Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who 
was garnering 17.1% of the vote, could not have disagreed more. They marched 
again in protest of Zedillo's victory, even as Cardenas, the leader of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, repeated his assertion that Sunday's election 
was the most fraudulent in Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear how much weight Mexican voters would give to Cardenas' 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 International and Mexican monitors weighed in Tuesday with their preliminary 
reports on the election -- most of them contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
 The first foreigners returning from remote polling stations -- targeted 
because of their tradition of ruling-party fraud -- brought specific, though 
anecdotal, descriptions of electoral violations. And it was from those regions 
that the latest returns pushed Zedillo's total to 50% for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Global Exchange and Grassroots International -- two U.S.-based groups that 
were among the first foreigners authorized to witness a Mexican election -- 
reported widespread electoral abuses by the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Alliance, an umbrella group of Mexican pro-democracy activists 
formed to oversee the election, also released its final report Tuesday night 
documenting widespread rural fraud. More than one-third of the 2,168 precincts 
where it stationed observers reported that the vote was neither secret nor 
free, and other polling stations documented other abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But 80 delegates sponsored by the National Democratic Institute, the 
International Republican Institute and the Carter Center in Atlanta offered a 
more positive view of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting there were irregularities -- including ruling-party abuse of state 
resources, biased media and "significant" disenfranchisement at hundreds of 
special voting booths that ran out of ballots -- Paul Kirk, the Democratic 
Institute's chairman, told a news conference that his group still had concluded 
that Sunday's polls were Mexico's cleanest and fairest ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not received evidence that would indicate the problems we have seen . 
. . have materially affected the outcome of the presidential contest," said 
Kirk, former Democratic Party chairman, adding that his group had included 
Cardenas' claims in its analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk stressed that the delegation's seven-page preliminary report was not 
intended "to certify or invalidate" the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group did conclude that "this election represents a significant step 
forward for the Mexican democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also stressed that the ruling party's money and state powers gave it 
a big edge over the opposition, adding that monitors "noted with concern the 
large disparity of resources between the governing party and the other 
political parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of other foreign delegations, who monitored remote areas such as the 
Isthmus of Tehuantepec in rural southern Oaxaca, told The Times they witnessed 
that advantage -- and worse -- in stark terms at dozens of polling stations 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no pretense whatsoever about fraud," said Bernie Eisenberg, 60, a 
computer consultant from Mar Vista who spent Election Day at a remote site he 
described as "a PRI assembly line." PRI workers were stationed at both ends of 
the precinct all day, he said, often marking ballots for peasants or joining 
them in the voting booth. When the counting finished, Eisenberg said he was 
unsurprised by the result: 600 votes for the ruling party, eight for the PRD 
and one for PAN. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear to me in talking to some of the voters and even the PRI 
officials that housing, electricity and jobs are all dependent upon party 
patronage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Kennedy, a lawyer and professor of community planning at the University 
of Massachusetts in Boston and a board member of Grassroots International, had 
a similar experience at 24 polling sites in the state of Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 At one station, she said, the "secret ballot" was so public that the curtained 
booth wasn't used. At another, the local PRD poll watcher said he didn't object 
to practices such as PRI officials stuffing ballots into boxes; that's because 
the previous week he had received a death threat from a local party boss, 
warning him if he openly complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it was a totally unreliable election," Kennedy said. "My mouth 
was dropping open." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the more positive assessments by other groups, Kennedy said 
she disagreed. Intimidation and fraud, she said, were typical election conduct 
reported by other delegates from her group in rural areas, home to about 25% of 
Mexico's registered voters, principally Indians and peasants. "Even if it was 
only 25% of the vote, you've got a whole group of people who were essentially 
disenfranchised," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, though, Kirk said it was not up to the international 
visitors to decide on the credibility of Mexico's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican people are certainly sophisticated enough to decide for 
themselves," he said. "All we are saying is that these elections, we believe, 
have made enormous strides forward to giving the Mexican people more confidence 
in the electoral process. Now it is up to them to decide."

COLUMN ONE; LEARNING TO TELL CUSTOM FROM ABUSE; CHILDREN'S WELFARE OFFICIALS 
ARE WORKING WITH IMMIGRANT PARENTS TO CLEAR UP CULTURAL MISPERCEPTIONS THAT MAY 
LEAD TO FALSE REPORTS OF TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Her first thought when police arrived was that her two youngest children were 
in trouble. Then the recent immigrant from Ho Chi Minh City realized that she 
was the reason for the visit, prompted by concern over the angry-looking red 
streaks on her 6-year-old son's neck and temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, it didn't take long for authorities to confirm that the marks were 
from coining, a common Vietnamese practice of massaging away fevers and aches 
with a heated coin or piece of metal that draws blood to the surface of the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has it done. You feel good after," the Northridge woman explained 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being prosecuted on abuse charges or having her son placed in 
foster care, the middle-aged mother of nine received three visits from a 
Vietnamese social worker from the Los Angeles County Department of Children's 
Services. They chatted in their native tongue and he explained some American 
dos and don'ts on parenting. Meanwhile, following routine procedure, he 
discreetly made sure the child was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 As Southern California's immigrant population and cultural diversity continue 
to swell, authorities are getting better at differentiating misunderstood 
customs from potential abuse, and at working with parents who have yet to learn 
that some child-raising practices in their homelands are not socially 
acceptable here. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of culture clashes and a 24% increase in calls to the Department 
of Children's Services hot line in recent years, the agency now emphasizes 
bilingual skills when recruiting workers and requires training in cultural 
sensitivity. (Department Director Peter Digre estimates that his staff 
encounters up to 16 languages regularly, although English and Spanish 
predominate.) 
</P>
<P>
 When trouble arises, the department's 18 general family preservation programs 
allow children to remain at home while pairing families with caseworkers who 
know their language and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local experts attribute the increased calls to an overall rise in family 
strains caused by a bad economy and to heightened public awareness, but also to 
the racism and ignorance simmering within the county's cultural potpourri. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspicion of people who are different sets up a predisposition to see 
parental neglect where it would not be seen if the people were like yourself," 
said Rino Patti, dean of USC's School of Social Work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Children's Services, which does not keep statistics on all 
ethnic groups represented among its clients, says immigrants are only a 
fraction of the families it monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But sorting out misperceptions makes the role of culture "extremely important 
and challenging and complex and . . . one of the big priorities we struggle 
with every day," Digre said. 
</P>
<P>
 The innocent but sometimes baffling practices confronting police, social 
workers and judges can range from coining to arranged teen-age marriages to 
swatting unruly children with sticks, as common in some cultures as was 
spanking with belts in Depression-era America. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one case of alleged sexual abuse involved a rare custom practiced 
by a San Gabriel Valley man originally from an island off Taiwan. In "the 
kissing of the flower," the father held up his 6-year-old daughter before 
relatives and briefly kissed her vagina to mark the passage from infancy to 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, the father, whom police describe as a professional, was arrested 
and his then-preteen daughter was briefly placed in foster care after she 
described the experience at school to horrified friends and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Tom Sirkel, who investigated the case, said 
he was perplexed at first. But after a few interviews and a little research, he 
concluded that there was nothing secretive or sexual about the gesture, which 
is openly performed with boys as well. The charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some dilemmas," said Sirkel, who is assigned to the child abuse 
detail. "Does the cultural behavior constitute a crime when done in the state 
of California? It may be parentally inappropriate in our eyes, but does it 
violate the law? Even if it violates the law, is prosecution the best answer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates for unassimilated parents say that despite the county's best 
efforts, some of their clients remain victims of Western, middle-class bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's dozens of cases in which the system, which is a white, Anglo-Saxon, 
Protestant-oriented system, has made bad calls," said attorney Pete R. Navarro, 
whose private practice includes defending immigrant parents in the county's 
Juvenile Dependency Court -- where families monitored by the Department of 
Children's Services are divided and reunited daily in one gut-wrenching hearing 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro cited a Latina preschooler who was placed in foster care for two weeks 
after a day-care worker assumed that the birthmarks on her back were bruises 
and, adhering to the state's mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse, 
notified the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child had what we call . . . 'la Mancha Mogolica,' " Navarro said, a 
Mongolian spot -- a large, purplish birthmark usually seen among Asians, Native 
Americans or Latinos with Native American ancestry. He said the badly 
traumatized girl was returned to her parents after he initiated a court-ordered 
exam at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid was released to her parents and DCS still wanted to intervene because 
of the emotional reaction she had to being separated . . . to give counseling," 
Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Pacoima-based therapist recalled a large family from rural Mexico that 
became a Department of Children's Services case after a school nurse found lice 
on one daughter -- considered to be a warning sign of neglect. The children 
were allowed to remain at home, family counselor Alicia Trelles said. The 
mother and father -- mortified at having their personal hygiene and 
housekeeping under official scrutiny -- were referred to parent education 
classes and to Trelles, who works with El Nido, a nonprofit group that is part 
of the department's family preservation network. 
</P>
<P>
 "That father's role in the family and his power was completely reduced to 
nothing," Trelles said. "He felt so embarrassed that he didn't know how to do 
things in the city, in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Had lice been found on a white, middle-class child, the nurse probably would 
have sent home a note explaining how to kill the common pest and that would 
have been that, said attorney Jo Kaplan, whose nonprofit, county-funded firm 
handles dependency cases for indigent clients. 
</P>
<P>
 For "people with language barriers, who are frightened and not used to dealing 
with people in authority, those cases are treated differently and the worst is 
presumed," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty can play as much of a role as culture. About 75% of the department's 
cases involve clients who are eligible for welfare, according to Digre. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that fewer resources make it more likely for 
abuse and neglect to occur," said Commissioner Martha E. Bellinger, who reviews 
35 to 40 cases a day from her toy-strewn bench in Dependency Court. "People get 
depressed and desperate in that setting. It leads to more substance addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it is difficult for department workers to separate the effects of 
poverty and culture. For example, do parents sleep with their children because 
they can't afford more space or because in some countries a shared family bed 
is the norm? Either way, Kaplan and Navarro said, it can be held against them 
and children are often kept in foster homes until their parents get them their 
own beds. 
</P>
<P>
 (A department official said sleeping arrangements alone "would never be an 
obstacle for a child returning home." The issue should only arise in cases 
involving alleged sexual abuse, said department Police Director Renee Powers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional bias against poor Latino and Asian parents recalls the 
experience of Southern and Eastern European immigrants at the turn of the 
century, USC's Patti said. Back then, he noted, scores of children were taken 
from their parents in Boston and New York and sent to work on Midwestern farms 
by Protestant charities who were aghast at the way immigrants' children were 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal has been written about the use of 'child protection' as a way of 
expressing in not-so-disguised fashion the racism or repugnance of the dominant 
white society for the habits of particularly southern, Catholic Europeans," 
Patti said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sees a parallel in that era's anti-Catholic movement with today's 
backlash against illegal immigrants and concern "that they're taking jobs that 
should properly go to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, people feared Italians were taking jobs the good, sturdy white 
Americans should have had," Patti said. "So the whole sense of these people was 
a sense of them threatening the American way of life, of diluting the values 
that good white Protestant Americans had created." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, ironically, it is immigrant parents who are often appalled by American 
values and this country's relatively lax standards of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors can complicate matters. Under California's broadly worded child 
protection laws, only simple spanking is generally considered appropriate; the 
use of a belt or a slap to the face, under certain circumstances, can be 
grounds for court intervention. Thus, corporal punishment generates many of the 
child abuse reports against unsuspecting immigrants who, like some Americans, 
may hit disrespectful children with sticks, shoes and fists -- the way their 
parents punished them in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressures of assimilation often aggravate friction between children and 
parents, authorities say. "A lot of over-disciplining is due to the 
frustrations of what the Western world is doing to these kids," said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Mike Houchen, who oversees child abuse investigations 
in West Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Many cases he sees involve 
Middle Eastern families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to deal with parents and tone them down and say, 'Hey, 
when in Rome. . . ,' " Houchen said. "All of a sudden, the police are involved 
in what has been a private domain for eons, especially in the East, where 
family matters are handled by family." 
</P>
<P>
 In screening the 90 to 150 reports his office receives each month, Houchen 
looks at three main issues: whether marks were left on the child, the intent of 
the parent, and a history of complaints. It is common for him to leave matters 
with underlying cultural issues, especially first-time offenses, to the 
Department of Children's Services rather than opening criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's child welfare bureaucracy is also less inclined to separate 
families in which there is no clear-cut risk of physical or sexual abuse. 
Parents reported for hygiene, folk remedies, even corporal punishment are prime 
candidates for the family preservation programs, which emphasize education over 
separation. Joined with networks of community groups, the projects also help 
families gain housing, clothing and other essentials to help keep them 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the 18 such projects involve about 3,000 children of all backgrounds 
in a third of the county, in areas that generate the most foster care 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldworkers also receive what the department calls "ethnographic training," 
or instruction in the cultural nuances that can lead to tragic 
misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 Among some cultures, for example, direct eye contact is considered rude and 
well-mannered people avert their eyes during conversation. But to an 
uninitiated American investigating possible abuse, that type of behavior could 
be misinterpreted as a sign of guilt or evasiveness, said Cecilia Reza, who 
heads the department's American Indian Family Preservation Program. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the kind of miscommunication that the department is hoping to avoid. 
In the case of the Northridge mother who had coined her son, there was little 
room for misunderstanding, for instance, because her caseworker and his 
supervisor were Vietnamese. During the last of the social workers' visits, the 
woman's home, with its dimly lit shrine, simmering broth and crowing pet 
rooster, evoked the scents and sounds of their homeland, and everyone seemed 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 The men smiled knowingly as the woman demonstrated coining. First, she dabbed 
a strong-smelling oil onto an adult son's back, then she briskly rubbed his 
skin with a piece of metal until a pattern of red streaks emerged. He said it 
did not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you catch the bad wind, you have to get the wind out," the woman 
explained through workers Bao Truong and Phuoc (Frank) Nguyen, who heads the 
Asian/Pacific Island preservation project. What she meant, they said, was that 
the massage draws out the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman added that although she still planned to coin her husband and grown 
children, she would no longer practice the home remedy on her school-age sons, 
as Truong and Nguyen had advised her. They smiled, satisfied that their mission 
was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to bridge the gap," Nguyen said. "We don't try to accuse."

AGREEMENT STEMS FROM U.S. BANK PROBE. COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES MAY SHORTEN 
TERM.

 Los Angeles Kings President Bruce P. McNall, the sports entrepreneur credited 
with turning Southern California on to professional ice hockey, has agreed to 
plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud 
investigation, sources close to the case confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, hailed as recently as a year ago as one of the nation's most 
successful and innovative sports executives, has signed a draft agreement 
negotiated by his lawyers and federal prosecutors. That agreement calls for 
guilty pleas to one count of bank fraud, two counts of mail fraud and one count 
of conspiracy, the sources said. A federal grand jury has been investigating 
McNall for allegedly falsifying loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is possible for McNall to receive probation from a judge, sources 
with knowledge of the agreement said that was unlikely, adding that under 
federal sentencing guidelines and the current plea, McNall probably would face 
a maximum prison sentence of six to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentencing ceiling could be lowered, however. It would depend on such 
factors as assistance he provides authorities in investigating his business 
associates and lenders, repayments made to creditors and his degree of 
culpability for certain losses from his business operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the agreement, Tom Pollack, McNall's criminal defense lawyer, 
said: "We have had discussions with the government. At an appropriate time, 
there will be more information." McNall has been making no public statements on 
his situation, allowing Pollack to speak for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities with the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall would most likely enter a formal plea no earlier than mid-September, 
with sentencing sometime next year, the sources said. For the moment, McNall 
has no plans to leave his post as Kings' president, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, 44, was sole owner of the Kings from 1988 until May, when he was 
forced to sell a 72% interest in the team to investors Jeffrey Sudikoff and 
Joseph Cohen because of severe financial problems that eventually led to his 
filing for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. McNall remains a 
minority partner in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a brash, free-spending executive, McNall brought glitz to the Kings. He 
boldly acquired superstar Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 in 
what remains the sport's most significant trade ever. Celebrities were drawn to 
the team, and soon McNall was mingling at games with actors, actresses and 
former presidents. Such film stars as Kevin Costner were known to show up in 
the Kings' dressing room to meet the players. 
</P>
<P>
 His Canadian football team, the Toronto Argonauts, became trendy, too, after 
McNall signed former Notre Dame star Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. The Argonauts won 
the Canadian Football League's Grey Cup the first year McNall owned the team 
and the Kings nearly won the Stanley Cup, losing the 1993 finals in five games 
to the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall swiftly moved into a position of power in the National Hockey League, 
and was elected in June, 1992, to the post of chairman of the league's board of 
governors. He then personally courted such prominent executives as Walt Disney 
Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner of Anaheim's Mighty Ducks and Blockbuster Video 
mogul H. Wayne Huizenga of the Florida Panthers, helping to bring both teams 
into the league last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The gregarious and quotable McNall became a celebrity, lauded as one of the 
country's most accessible sports team owners. He became an adept public speaker 
and turned his gift of gab into yet another business venture, lecturing 
audiences a little more than three years ago for $48 a head on "Turning Your 
Passions Into Profits." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before venturing into the high-profile world of sports, McNall was one of 
the most important figures in the business of ancient coin trading. He put 
himself on the map by spending a then-world record of $420,000 on an ancient 
coin called the Athena decadrachm at a Swiss auction in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also became a partner in a movie production business that produced such 
hits as "The Fabulous Baker Boys" and "Weekend at Bernie's." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development Tuesday, securities giant Merrill Lynch, moving to 
distance itself from McNall's legal problems, confirmed that it has settled 
lawsuits filed on behalf of 3,500 investors in three ill-fated partnerships it 
organized with McNall that invested in rare coins and ancient art. 
</P>
<P>
 A Merrill Lynch spokesman said that the company expects to eventually pay 
between $20 million and $30 million. A source familiar with the agreement put 
the settlement amount at around $35 million. Merrill Lynch said that it is 
"extremely concerned" that McNall's problems could hurt investors in the funds. 
McNall is the former managing general partner of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Merrill Lynch, the coin funds case has mushroomed into a public relations 
problem in the past six weeks. The Times disclosed in early July that 399 coins 
bought for $3.3 million are mysteriously missing from the funds and that 
investors are suing over the matter. Merrill Lynch has reported the incident to 
Los Angeles police and the FBI. In addition, Florida authorities have confirmed 
that they have started an informal investigation into sales pitches made for 
the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another development Tuesday, Joanna Orehek, former vice president and 
controller of McNall's chief holding company, McNall Sports and Entertainment, 
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud in 
connection with a scheme to defraud four financial institutions -- Bank of 
America, Credit Lyonnais, the Bank of California and First Los Angeles Bank -- 
of more than $138 million in loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's investigation has been bolstered by the continuing 
cooperation of Orehek, 46. She was visibly shaken before she entered the 
courtroom of U.S. District Judge Richard Paez, and about midway through the 
arraignment Orehek began crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a woman from a small town in middle America who was caught up in 
McNall's web," said William Greysen, a Century City attorney representing 
Orehek. " . . . She made a misjudgment against her better judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She feels the pain and the hurt. It goes back to her basic fundamental values 
of honesty. She had the option to fight the case. She said, 'Why make a bad 
thing worse? I want to come forward.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Greysen asserted that Orehek was "charmed and manipulated" by McNall to change 
her lifelong values, saying: "He kept on persuading her: 'We really need your 
help.' She constantly needed reassurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded McNall lawyer Pollack: "I am sympathetic to the position Miss Orehek 
finds herself in, but her lawyer's effort to minimize her role by pointing to 
others is refuted by the very charges to which she pleaded guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Orehek will be sentenced Jan. 30 by Paez. She faces a maximum of 10 years in 
prison, a fine of $500,000 and supervised release of three years as a result of 
her guilty pleas, but is cooperating with the government in hopes of receiving 
a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Orehek is one of about a dozen former McNall employees who have been 
negotiating pleas with the government.

U.S. MAY LIFT MOST SANCTIONS AGAINST CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is weighing a possible end to most remaining 
sanctions that the United States imposed on China for crushing the 1989 
democracy protests in Tian An Men Square, despite President Clinton's 
assurances three months ago that he was extending the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown confirmed Tuesday that the Administration 
is thinking about lifting the prohibitions on U.S. trade assistance to China 
and on the Overseas Private Investment Corp. program, which provides insurance 
and financing for American companies. These are virtually the last two 
sanctions left in effect from the time of the Beijing massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 At a breakfast, Brown characterized Clinton's policy toward China as "in 
transition." Brown is preparing to play a central role in the policy changes 
when he flies to Beijing on Saturday as head of an official, White 
House-sponsored delegation of American business leaders seeking commercial 
contracts in China. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were the latest indications that, in the wake of Clinton's 
decision in May to unconditionally extend China's trade benefits in this 
country, the Administration is moving rapidly to restore and upgrade relations 
with Beijing's Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Defense Secretary William J. Perry welcomed to the Pentagon Xu 
Huizi, who as deputy chief of staff is one of the top leaders of the People's 
Liberation Army. Perry greeted him with an honor cordon, a lunch and extensive 
talks. They were the highest-level U.S. contacts with the Chinese military 
since it shot its way into downtown Beijing in 1989, killing about 1,000 people 
by Western estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also plans to invite Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
to Washington for an official visit in September, and Perry is expected to 
visit Beijing in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's China policy is starting to attract the same 
denunciations from Republicans that former President George Bush got from 
Democrats. Last week, Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) contended that the warm welcome 
given to the Chinese general was "a mark of shame upon everyone associated with 
this kind of ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech at the Democratic National Convention accepting the presidential 
nomination, Clinton attacked the Bush Administration for "coddling dictators" 
in Beijing. Between 1989 and 1992, other Democratic leaders criticized Bush and 
his top aides for sending then-National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft on a 
conciliatory visit to Beijing six months after the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked Tuesday how Clinton's policy toward China differs from Bush's, 
Brown did not mention human rights. Instead, he responded that the 
Administration has opened the way for a "new commercial relationship" with 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Clinton is moving toward "a greater engagement that we believe can 
lead to an enhanced relationship which is good for both China and the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 26, when Clinton granted China an unconditional extension of its trade 
privileges in this country, he said he would leave intact sanctions imposed on 
China in 1989. "In view of the continuing human rights abuses, I am extending 
the sanctions imposed by the United States as a result of the events in Tian An 
Men Square," he said in a televised news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 His pledge to extend the sanctions apparently was aimed at easing the impact 
of his most-favored-nation decision and deflecting possible congressional 
criticism. Earlier this month, the House voted, 270 to 158, to uphold his 
policy on most-favored-nation status for China. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's claim was somewhat misleading, because by May a number of the 
sanctions imposed in 1989 had already been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration had opened the way for resumed high-level official 
visits between Washington and Beijing and had given a green light for renewed 
World Bank lending to China. The Clinton Administration had ended sanctions on 
U.S.-China military contacts and on official, regular exchanges by 
Cabinet-level commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three Tian An Men Square sanctions still in effect: the ban on OPIC 
insurance guarantees for American companies, the prohibition on trade 
development assistance and the sanction prohibiting official U.S. military 
sales to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown indicated Tuesday that the Administration is talking about lifting the 
first two sanctions, both of which involve government support for American 
business in China. "No decision has been made," he said. But he said ending the 
two restrictions is "being considered -- action to be taken on them in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration terminates these sanctions, the only significant 
restriction left would be the prohibition against American military sales to 
China. No one believes this ban will be lifted anytime soon, in part because 
China has little interest in having it lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials do not want to buy more U.S. military equipment, because 
they were badly burned when the post-1989 sanctions caused several military 
programs to be held up for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Tuesday that while he is in Beijing he will meet with Premier Li 
Peng, who was closely involved in the 1989 crackdown on democracy forces and 
has served as the action's principal defender since that time. He said he may 
also meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

BATTERED WIFE WHO KILLED HUSBAND GETS EARLY RELEASE; PRISONS: PANEL SETS 1995 
DATE. THE CASE IS THE STATE'S FIRST IN WHICH CLEMENCY HAS BEEN GRANTED ON SUCH 
GROUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brenda Denise Aris, who killed her sleeping husband eight years ago, on 
Tuesday became the first convicted murderer in California to earn an early 
release from prison by arguing that she committed her crime because she was a 
battered woman. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-member panel of the Board of Prison Terms decided unanimously that 
Aris was a suitable candidate for parole after hearing from Aris and several 
relatives of the murder victim, who issued emotional pleas on behalf of the 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Aris' three daughters, ages 11, 13 and 16, listened to the proceedings and let 
out cries of joy upon hearing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel set a parole date for Aris that could allow her to be released from 
prison in less than a year. Had Gov. Pete Wilson and the parole board not 
granted her leniency, Aris probably would have remained behind bars at least 
until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 It now appears that Aris will serve a total of 8 1/2 years in custody on her 
second-degree murder conviction. Penal officials said the average time in 
prison for that offense is 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Aris' attorney, Chee Davis, characterized the decision as a precedent-setting 
victory for battered women, although she said she was disappointed that Aris 
would not be released sooner. "There is absolutely no reason to keep this woman 
incarcerated another day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Theodore Rich, executive officer of the Board of Prison Terms, said the 
earliest parole date the board could have given Aris was July 25, 1995. Under 
the decision rendered Tuesday, she can get out Aug. 18, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned at the hearing about the events that led her to kill, Brenda Aris 
said that for nearly 10 years she endured beatings from an increasingly violent 
husband. Finally, on a warm August night in 1986, as she nursed a swollen face 
and blackened eyes, she said she decided she could endure no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that her husband might kill her when he awoke, she said she pumped 
five bullets into his body as he lay sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot him once and he jumped like he was coming back at me," she said. "I 
closed my eyes and just kept shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Aris' allegations were confirmed by members of the murder victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen her bruises, witnessed the beatings," said Betty Aris Cooke, Rick 
Aris' sister. " . . . We thought one day he'd kill her, not the other way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another sister, Linda Roccia: "I loved my brother and I always will, but 
I believe he was the meanest person I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
 The slain man's father, Leslie Aris, did not testify but submitted a letter 
urging the panel to release his daughter-in-law so she could care for her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can forgive her for killing my only son, then why can't the state?" Aris 
wrote. "It's time to let the whole family heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Aris is one of nearly 100 women in California who say they were driven 
to commit their crimes after years of physical and emotional abuse. She is the 
only prisoner among them to win the sympathy of the governor for this argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, responding to petitions urging him to recognize battered women's 
syndrome as a consideration for clemency, Wilson reviewed petitions from 19 
women. He commuted the sentences of Aris and another woman, the latter for 
reasons unrelated to the abuse she suffered. Six cases are pending in his 
office and 65 are awaiting investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Aris was the only one who could reasonably claim battered women's 
syndrome as a mitigating factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Aris' husband, Rick, as a man "chronically guilty of the most 
extraordinary cruelty," Wilson in May, 1993, took the unusual step of commuting 
her sentence from 15 years to life to 12 years to life. Wilson, noting that his 
decision would mean she would be eligible for parole much sooner, said he hoped 
the Board of Prison Terms would release her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the parole panel did not give a reason for its decision, panel 
members indicated that they had been influenced by some of the same factors 
that had impressed the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But to a Riverside County deputy district attorney, who was the only person to 
request that Aris not be paroled, the shooting was not an act of desperation 
but cold-blooded, premeditated murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about this killing shows a callous disregard for human life," 
Barbara Hayden Marmor said. "Though this inmate has been a model prisoner . . . 
she does remain a killer . . . and she deserves to remain in prison until she 
has learned her lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Marmor said "battered women's syndrome" should not become a license to kill, 
and argued that women share some responsibility if they remain with spouses who 
abuse them. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed after the hearing in an office in the administrative wing of the 
California State Prison for Women, Aris said Marmor showed a lack of 
understanding about battered women. Wives constantly beaten by husbands, she 
said, become "their total possession. They have total control over you." 
</P>
<P>
 Aris said she will not really believe she is going to be released until she 
walks through the prison gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "But before this hearing, I could not see the future," she said. "Now I can 
see the future. Now I can make plans." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's decision is subject to confirmation by the governor, who is 
expected to approve Aris' early release, which he called for in his clemency 
order. The decision could be reversed by the full Board of Prison Terms, but 
that is considered unlikely.

JUDGE LETS HENLEY TRAVEL BUT INCREASES BAIL TO $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rams cornerback Darryl Henley, under indictment on drug charges, was granted 
permission Tuesday to travel to road games, but a federal judge stunned Henley 
and his attorneys by raising his bail to $1 million and requiring that he be 
accompanied at all times -- even while on the bench -- by a court officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, charged in a federal indictment with being the mastermind of a cocaine 
ring that transported drugs using a former Rams cheerleader as a courier, 
sought a change in his bail restrictions that would allow him to travel outside 
a seven-county area that includes Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henley and his attorneys gasped when U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor 
suggested that his previously set bail of $200,000 was too low and should 
probably be increased to $2 million or $3 million to ensure that he doesn't 
flee while he travels with the team throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about playing football," Taylor said firmly when Henley's 
attorneys objected. "This is a case that has a maximum sentence of life in 
prison and a very large minimum sentence. . . . This is a dangerous and 
important case." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor increased bail to $1 million, saying he believed the previous bond was 
too low when set by a federal magistrate last year. Taylor had expressed 
similar reservations when he recently set bail at $500,000 for Henley's uncle, 
Rex Henley, who is also charged in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine but is 
considered a lesser player in the alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's $1-million bond, Taylor ruled, could come from a "responsible" third 
party, such as the Rams, which would have to pledge in an affidavit to pay 
should Henley flee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Henley will have to come up with $100,000 cash up front, to be 
paid to the clerk of the U.S. District Court. The money is refundable should 
Henley make all court appearances and meet the other terms of his bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said that amount will likely come out of his $350,000 contract with the 
Rams. He said his agent, Marvin Demoff, will meet immediately with Rams 
President John Shaw regarding the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the judge ruled that Henley must be accompanied on the road by a 
court officer -- someone from either pretrial services or the U.S. marshal's 
office -- at all times, even when Henley sits on the bench during the games. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that Jessie Flores, his pretrial services officer, will be 
assigned to accompany Henley. Whoever gets the assignment, it will be at 
Henley's expense, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he has no problem with a court officer accompanying him on 
out-of-town games and is in no way a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why in the heck would I flee?" he said. "Why would I run? I've been (out on 
bail) for nine or 10 months. This isn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had initially suggested to Henley's attorneys -- Gerald L. Chaleff and 
Roger L. Cossack -- that it might be embarrassing to the Rams for such an 
arrangement to be made, especially because the team is so visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the videotape now of lots of guys in uniform sitting on the bench 
and then there's someone in civilian clothes and people are wondering, 'Who's 
that?' " Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chaleff and Cossack agreed to the suggestion, even as they were arguing 
against bail being raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Cossack called Taylor's initial mention of $2-million to $3-million bail "a 
major stumbling block" and said it would be impossible for Henley or his family 
to come up with anywhere near the $200,000 to $300,000 that a bail bondsman 
typically requires to secure the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Henley's lawyers were clearly displeased that bail had been 
raised and said that Henley would require the Rams' assistance or the money 
probably could not be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be up to the Rams or some other party," Chaleff said. "He cannot make 
$1-million bail." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Henley said he was happy to be able to travel and hoped to 
play in Thursday's exhibition game in San Diego. His attorneys said they would 
be busy trying to meet all of the terms of the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing eight away games," said Henley, wearing a double-breasted 
burgundy suit, matching socks and a yellow and green patterned silk tie. "And 
I'm not getting any special treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley took issue with a report in The Times quoting defense attorneys for 
other defendants connected with Henley's case as saying that the football star 
was getting preferential treatment. Some of the other defendants with lesser 
roles in the alleged crimes were not afforded bail and are awaiting the January 
trial in prison while Henley is playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of special treatment am I getting?" Henley asked. "I haven't gotten 
anything. I have not pleaded guilty to anything. I am innocent and that's what 
I've said all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he won't practice today because of a hamstring pull he suffered in 
practice Monday, and that he's questionable for Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other restrictions ordered Tuesday, Henley's salary will go directly to 
the pretrial services division and will be held in escrow, only to be paid to 
Henley for necessities, such as legal fees and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henley is on the road and is not on the playing field, in team meetings, 
or otherwise connected with official team gatherings, he must stay in the 
team's hotel and cannot join in "social or extracurricular activities," Taylor 
said. He is also prohibited from talking with any of the other defendants or 
witnesses in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's decision, however, frees Henley to join the Rams for Thursday's 
exhibition game in San Diego and for eight regular-season games throughout the 
country, including Atlanta, which according to the federal indictment was one 
of the drop-off points for the cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was indicted along with a former Rams cheerleader and three others 
named as participants in a conspiracy to transfer two shipments of cocaine last 
year from Henley's home in Brea to locations in Atlanta and Memphis, using the 
cheerleader as a courier. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerleader, Tracy Ann Donaho, has pleaded guilty and is expected to 
cooperate with the government against Henley and the others.

IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID, CUBAN RAFTERS ADMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At a new department store in the seaside suburb of Miramar -- dollars only, 
please -- Cuban shoppers browsed Tuesday along well-stocked aisles: rice 
cookers from China, boom boxes from Taiwan, Mexican toothpaste, Brazilian 
paints, Black Flag insecticide made in the United States, a Sears refrigerator 
for $1,117. 
</P>
<P>
 A child's Mickey Mouse water toy costs $14. Inner tubes and rubber rafts were 
sold out, a sales clerk said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile away, a young woman named Miriam nervously paced Miramar Beach as her 
5-year-old splashed in the clear shallows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a degree in economics and a government salary of around 200 pesos a 
month. That's less than $2, and it buys around five pounds of rice," she said. 
"We can't live on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Miriam, her son and six friends boarded a makeshift sailboat 
with a prayer and steered north through the moonlit sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask on any beach in Cuba: It is economics that is driving Cubans from their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafters do not talk much about politics as they await the welcoming night. No, 
like everybody else in Cuba, they talk about bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-Cold War collapse of a stolid Marxist economy has been lately 
aggravated by the creation of a crazy, two-tier peso-dollar economic system. It 
is breeding inequality, resentment and corruption. And it is fueling the exodus 
toward the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The long and the short of it is that Cubans with dollars -- acquired legally 
or otherwise -- get by. Cubans who live on pesos are out of luck, and they are 
voting masterfully with their oars, undismayed by U.S. efforts to dissuade 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cuba today there are few jobs, and jobs that pay in pesos are not worth 
the time it takes to do them," said Rogelio, an articulate young mason who 
planned to be at sea this morning in the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heyday of the revolution, it was illegal for a private citizen to hold 
dollars in Cuba. More than money, for the Fidel Castro government the dollar 
was the symbol of the despised Yanquis . That changed last year, when the 
government allowed Cubans to receive money from abroad and to hold foreign 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 As Soviet subsidies and sweetheart deals with other formerly communist 
countries ended, the Cuban government's need for foreign currency could not be 
slaked by its exports and the earnings from dollar-based tourism. Oil that once 
flowed regularly from the Soviet Union, for example, now must be purchased with 
dollars on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with Draconian belt-tightening to save money, the government has 
tried to sop up dollars sent legally to Cubans by relatives abroad -- up to 
$300 per household per quarter has been coming in -- by expanding the network 
of dollar stores and stocking them with goods otherwise unattainable in an 
ever-more-rationed economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we sell is in dollars, but we don't ever ask a customer where the 
dollars come from. As employees of the state, we, of course, are paid in 
pesos," said one of the managers at the 5th Avenue and 42nd Street store in 
Miramar on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now has cut off the flow of dollars to Cuba to punish the 
Castro government for allowing rafters to leave. But Cubans are confident that 
savvy relatives in places like Miami will quickly find ways to circumvent the 
ban. After all, they ask, isn't the longstanding American trade embargo by now 
almost laughable? The Miramar store, case in point, stocks everything from 
Crest to Coke to Ajax to Black & Decker. 
</P>
<P>
 In Havana nowadays, there is hardly anything to buy at official prices, so who 
wants pesos anyway? There are dollar hotels, dollar restaurants, dollar taxis, 
dollar hairdressers, dollar prostitutes, dollar beggars. 
</P>
<P>
 The pell-mell rush for dollars has distorted life at many levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a health care system to be proud of. But who wants to wash 
hospital clothes for a dollar a month? I don't think they're as clean as they 
used to be," said a Cuban journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the economy in perpetual crisis, thousands of peso jobs have dried up 
in the years since the Berlin Wall crumbled. On getaway beaches, it is common 
to find rafters complaining that they have been trained for trades and 
professions in which there is no work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good carpenter. But who in Cuba today is building anything except 
boats?" asked a man named Ernesto as he waited to launch from a beach east of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people would leave if they could. So many men have already gone from 
this town in hopes of real jobs that we are calling this place the Isle of 
Women," said a middle-age housewife at Cojimar Beach as she watched two large 
rafts push off into the evening surf. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployed and the peso-underemployed pinwheel through the city and 
scramble for dollars and a ride north. Carlos, one of Tuesday's sailors from 
Miramar, sold his clothes for dollars to raise money for building materials. 
One pediatrician is stoking his escape chest by buying avocados in the 
countryside for pesos and hawking them in Havana for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing with state-owned dollar taxis are the usually over-educated owners 
of rickety cars who will go anywhere to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of prehistoric Hudsons, DeSotos and 20-year-old Fiats made in Argentina 
flocked around dollar-rich Cubans as they left the Miramar merchandise mecca 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them stood a salesman with the mien of a man selling dirty postcards. 
</P>
<P>
 " Cebollas ," he whispered. "Fresh onions. One dollar."

FOLEY SAYS HE'D ACCEPT LIMITED HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major concession that could alter the most fundamental elements of the 
health debate, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) indicated Tuesday that 
he would settle for a limited package of insurance reforms this year and put 
off more ambitious efforts for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, offering a candid assessment of President Clinton's central domestic 
policy initiative during a breakfast with reporters, said that he still hopes 
to enact broad legislation to restructure the health care system and provide 
coverage to the 37 million people who lack it. 
</P>
<P>
 But failing that, he said, Congress would be better off sticking to minimal 
insurance reforms or a modest expansion of coverage, as long as those measures 
do not create inadvertent consequences, such as raising health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a bill could be found that deals with one or more of those issues in a 
significant way and doesn't bar future improvements and consideration, I think 
that would be worth doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, where progress on health reform has been stalled, Sen. Tom 
Daschle (D-S.D.), a strong Clinton supporter, sounded the same note. "Let's not 
be captive of the rhetorical goals we've laid out . . . if there's some way to 
make discernible progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's attention this week has been diverted to crime legislation, and 
there is wide speculation that it may adjourn for what remains of its August 
recess without acting on health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping change in the tone of the debate reflects an acceptance of the 
reality -- increasingly apparent on Capitol Hill -- that the likelihood of 
enacting broad health legislation this year appears less and less likely. But 
Foley's comments marked the first time that a member of the Democratic 
leadership has conceded publicly that Congress may be left only two options: a 
minimal measure or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, his take-what-we-can-get stance stands in stark contrast to the bold 
-- and, in retrospect, brash -- vow that Clinton made in January, as he stood 
before both houses of Congress brandishing a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private 
health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this 
pen, veto the legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over 
again," the President had declared. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, polls indicated the American people were ready for major 
changes in the way they receive and pay for health care. Now, they appear more 
concerned that Washington will make the current system even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that of the almost 25,000 calls her 
office has received regarding health care, a heavy majority are urging that 
Congress do nothing or proceed slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do it incrementally," she said. "That's what most people want." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley conceded as much, saying that failure to pass a major bill would not 
cause a backlash among voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) also agreed. "Permission has been withdrawn (by the 
public) to do a lot," he said. "But permission is still there to do a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey said he agrees with Foley about the acceptability of enacting a modest 
reform package. "It would be wrong not to do it," he said. "That will improve 
immeasurably the lives of many Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House sought to downplay Foley's remarks, noting that the Speaker 
had responded to a hypothetical question. "We believe that Speaker Foley will 
continue to fight for the leadership bill," said Lorrie McHugh of the White 
House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said he could support a bill that does not guarantee universal coverage 
so long as it makes "real progress in coverage, real progress in insurance 
reform and protection without untoward consequences . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Such a bill "has to show progress toward meeting some of these goals in order 
to justify passage," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that can't be done, if we can't find a consensus for that, the other 
instance is to probably say we have to pick it up in the next Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's remarks prompted skeptics of incremental reform to renew their 
warnings that such actions, particularly if phased in over a long period and 
unaccompanied by universal coverage requirements, might actually prove worse 
than doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), the leading House backer of a 
government-financed, Canadian-style health system commonly called "single 
payer," said he fears that Congress is headed toward "some meddling around the 
edges and phasing it in over 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a "halfway job" might make it difficult for those who seek further 
changes in future years, McDermott said. "We're almost to the point where it 
might be better to do nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the pressure to pass a bill remains intense, in large measure because 
Congress wants to convince the public that it is capable of action. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Foley said he does not believe Congress ought to "just put 
something together that doesn't really do anything at all and say this is 
health care reform, in order to satisfy the public that we've done something." 
</P>
<P>
 The House will not reconsider the health issue until next month, after it 
returns from its August recess and receives estimates of the costs of the 
various proposals before it. 
</P>
<P>
 The House leadership is backing a bill offered by Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.), which claims to achieve Clinton's goal of universal coverage 
through a version of his proposal to require employers to pay 80% of their 
workers' health premium costs. At this point, many believe that the leaders are 
dozens of votes short of what they need to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has put forward a 
proposal that falls well short of universal coverage. His legislation is 
projected to cover 95% of the population by the turn of the century, largely 
through market incentives and subsidizing people who cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 If that does not work, the plan then would impose a so-called "employer 
mandate" of 50%, starting in the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mitchell's plan appears increasingly unlikely to pass without major 
modification, and he has been meeting with a bipartisan group of about 20 
"mainstream" senators who are offering a more modest reform package.

SIMPSON TEAM ZEROS IN ON POLICE TECHNICIANS; COURTS: JUDGE IRRITATED AS SESSION 
STRAYS FROM ISSUE OF ACCESS TO BLOOD SAMPLES. HAIRS IN CAP RESEMBLE 
DEFENDANT'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushing the limits of a narrowly focused court hearing involving DNA evidence, 
O.J. Simpson's defense lawyers hammered away Tuesday at the procedures and 
qualifications of police technicians who gathered blood samples after the 
murders of the football legend's ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, at the close of the two-day hearing on 
whether the defense should be given immediate access to the samples for 
independent testing, said he would rule Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the judge concluded the session -- which was marked in equal 
parts by tedium and testiness -- tempers had frayed all around. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Ito grew so irritated by defense lawyers' repeated straying from 
the issue at hand that he began raising and sustaining his own objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Move on to something that has to do with the size of the samples," Ito 
ordered Simpson lawyer Peter Neufeld after Neufeld persisted in asking 
questions the judge had ruled irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already directed you 12 times," the judge admonished him. "Next time I 
have to warn you there are going to be sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, sources close to the Simpson investigation said 
Tuesday that FBI analysts have completed microscopic examination of hairs 
recovered from a blue knit watch cap found near the bodies, and have concluded 
that they resemble Simpson's. A Municipal Court judge last month ordered 
Simpson to give investigators samples of his hair, and those were compared to 
the hairs recovered from the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation comes after court papers Monday disclosed that some new DNA 
tests of blood from the murder scene appear to match Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lawyers, said he had not reviewed the 
latest hair results, but added that they are not definitive. DNA testing can be 
far more conclusive than examination of evidence under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's microscopic (analysis)," Shapiro said. "The best microscopic can do is 
say that it has basic similarities with O.J.'s hair." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Shapiro said the handling of evidence by police investigators was 
so inept that it compromised any scientific testing of hair as well as blood 
samples recovered from the murder scene and from Simpson's Brentwood mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the defense attorneys at every turn have tried to attack the 
credibility of DNA test results that in some cases implicate Simpson in the 
June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Defense 
attorneys on Tuesday contended that police bungled the collection of the blood, 
mislabeled a sample and assigned a trainee criminalist to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's courtroom skirmishes over DNA testing of the blood samples indicate 
how crucial physical evidence will be during trial of a case that has no known 
eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld, a DNA expert for the defense, seized on the relative inexperience of 
LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola, who collected most of the blood droplets from 
the door of Simpson's Bronco parked at a curb outside his estate, from the 
property itself and from droplets leading away from the bodies at the murder 
scene two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning, Mazzola acknowledged that she was a trainee who had been on 
the job just six months at the time and had "zero" experience at crime scenes 
in which she had the primary responsibility for collecting evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, another police criminalist, Collin Yamauchi, told attorney Barry 
Scheck, the defense's other DNA expert, that he had mislabeled one blood 
sample. However, Yamauchi insisted he took pains to protect evidence, 
approximating measurements of some blood samples to avoid touching them with a 
ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to risk contamination so I made approximations," he said. "I 
tried to avoid touching them as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamauchi, who performed some of the earliest tests on the Simpson blood 
samples, also acknowledged that his first experience in DNA testing was six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Long stretches of testimony Tuesday were confined to small technical details, 
such as how blood droplets were swabbed onto swatches of cloth, how the samples 
were labeled and what happened to the evidence after it was taken to a police 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject matter was so dry that even the most avid court watchers stayed 
away. A month ago, would-be spectators had lined up before dawn to get a seat, 
but on Tuesday -- for the first time since the closely watched Simpson case hit 
the courthouse -- there were empty seats and plenty of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the testimony was on the dull side, the rhetoric was full of fury as 
the hearing ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Gerald F. Uelman accused prosecutors of trying to stymie 
defense efforts to conduct independent tests. He reminded Ito that the 
prosecution only recently informed defense attorneys of three previously 
undisclosed blood swatches that were about to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the prosecution deliberately hid the swatches from the 
defense in a "sophisticated game plan to burn up the evidence" in DNA tests, 
which often consume the material being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, the prosecution's in-house DNA expert, 
repeatedly apologized to Ito for raising her voice while defending her office 
against such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been nothing but good faith," Kahn insisted, saying some of the 
points of contention stem from misunderstandings that have cropped up as the 
case moves quickly toward trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a (DNA) case that has had this kind of involvement at this 
stage," Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead prosecutor Marcia Clark also maintained that the prosecution has acted 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done everything in our power to accommodate the defense and serve the 
people of California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The grand jury currently hearing testimony about the events leading up to 
Simpson's six-hour disappearance on June 17 called additional witnesses, 
including Cathy Randa, Simpson's administrative assistant for 20 years. The 
panel may be asked to bring charges against longtime Simpson friend Al Cowlings 
for allegedly aiding his former teammate's flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Robert Kardashian, a lawyer and also a Simpson friend, filed a 
sealed motion seeking to quash his grand jury subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and Cowlings were at Kardashian's house the morning Simpson was 
charged with two counts of murder. The two fled in Cowlings' Ford Bronco, 
surrendering that night after a nationally televised freeway pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian's motion was filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another member of the defense team, forensic expert Henry Lee, is scheduled to 
testify before the grand jury today. Lee also was at Kardashian's Encino home 
before Simpson and Cowlings slipped away from the residence. Virtually everyone 
who was with Simpson that morning has been subpoenaed. The only exceptions, 
sources say, are Simpson himself and attorney Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, in a rare public comment on the 
Simpson case, praised members of his department for their investigative efforts 
and urged the public to rally around the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a microscopic examination of every detail of the case, investigators 
and others involved "have all continued to perform their duties with the 
highest level of integrity and professionalism that I have seen in law 
enforcement," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams urged members of the public to praise officers who do a good job, 
stopping them in the street or writing to his office to express their feelings. 
Williams said he would see that any letter commending an officer or other 
department employee was made part of the employee's personnel file.

SENATORS URGE LINKING BASES TO PREVENT CLOSURES; MILITARY: THE 'SOUTHWEST 
COMPLEX' WOULD INCLUDE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE AND OTHER STATE WEAPONS-TESTING 
SITES. EAST COAST LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE THE PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's U.S. senators have urged the Pentagon to link Edwards Air Force 
Base and several other high-tech weapons-testing installations in a "Southwest 
Complex" that could help shield bases in the southwestern United States from 
defense cuts next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer said the Southwest Complex would save money, boost efficiency and 
promote interservice cooperation while "preserving and expanding the 
world-class military capabilities that currently exist in California, Utah, 
Arizona and other nearby states." 
</P>
<P>
 But the California senators face opposition from lawmakers representing 
Florida, Maryland and New York, where jobs at local bases and defense firms 
could be lost if Feinstein and Boxer prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California bases that would be part of the Southwest Complex are the 
Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station in Ventura County and the China Lake Naval 
Air Weapons Station, Ft. Irwin Military Reservation and Twentynine Palms Marine 
Corps Base in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Bases in the Southwest have long been used to evaluate aircraft, missiles and 
other airborne weapons. Under the Southwest Complex plan, testing from other 
bases across the country would be consolidated in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The military has made some effort to consolidate test and evaluation 
operations in recent years, and the services have engaged in some joint weapons 
tests. Navy cruise missiles launched from the Pacific Ocean are monitored en 
route to targets on land by microwave relays at Vandenberg Air Force Base near 
Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Boxer's proposal for a Southwest Complex comes as members of 
Congress throughout the country scramble to find ways to protect bases in their 
states from a new round of cuts expected to be recommended by the federal Base 
Realignments and Closures Commission in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Base closures and cutbacks from 1988 to 1993 eliminated about 200,000 military 
and civilian jobs in California, according to a recent state report. But 
military installations that perform weapons testing and research have been 
largely spared. The base closure commission is expected to take a hard look at 
such posts next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Boxer said bases that would make up the Southwest Complex have 
major advantages because they are in areas largely free of residential 
encroachment and have access to vast air, sea and land test ranges. Edwards, 
100 miles northeast of Downtown Los Angeles, covers more than 300,000 acres on 
the western edge of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the bases are relatively close to one another as well as to defense 
contractors. The lawmakers said the Southwest Complex would save money, but a 
Feinstein spokesman said he did not know how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft and air-weapons testing is performed at bases in a number of states, 
and Feinstein and Boxer did not specify any posts outside California, Utah and 
Arizona that they believe should be cut to provide work for the Southwest 
Complex. But forming southwestern bases into the nation's premier air-combat 
test complex would put pressure on the military to cut back or close bases 
elsewhere that perform similar work, and the Californians' proposal has been 
sharply criticized by East Coast lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. senators from Florida and New York angrily rebuked California lawmakers 
recently for urging Perry to ignore a study that the East Coast politicians 
said recommended closure of the air-combat test range at China Lake Naval Air 
Weapons Station, located near Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, Boxer and nine U.S. House members from California had urged Perry 
in a May 27 letter to overlook the study because it "may fail to accurately 
portray the costs and capabilities of California bases." The lawmakers also 
complained that previous defense cuts have hurt the state badly. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 11 letter, Florida Sens. Connie Mack and Bob Graham joined New York 
Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato in warning Perry that the 
Californians were trying to inject politics into the base closure process. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Coast senators said the study concluded that taxpayers would save $94 
million over five years if the China Lake range is closed and another 
air-combat range over the Gulf of Mexico operated by Florida's Eglin Air Force 
Base is kept open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proponents of a (Southwest Complex) would have you discard the 
magnificent capabilities of (Eglin) and attempt to duplicate them in the 
Western states at enormous and totally unnecessary cost to the taxpayer," the 
East Coast lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Connell, who heads a private Ridgecrest-based group lobbying for the 
Southwest Complex, said both Eglin and Patuxent River Naval Air Warfare Center 
in Maryland perform test activities that could be done at Edwards, the Air 
Force's top flight-test center. Patuxent River is home to the Navy's main 
flight-test facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell said the Western bases have clear advantages because they have 
excellent flying weather, huge open spaces for aircraft and missile testing 
and, with relatively few homes nearby, plenty of room to expand.

 Under Feinstein and Boxer's proposal, all armed services would be allowed to 
conduct flight tests at Edwards, an Air Force domain since 1946. The lawmakers 
also want to open Edwards' famed test pilot school -- which has supplied dozens 
of skilled fliers for the U.S. astronaut corps -- to other military branches.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN AIRS SEQUEL TO DRAMATIC 
COMMERCIAL; HER ANNOUNCEMENT OF 1978 SAN FRANCISCO SLAYINGS WAS USED IN A 1990 
AD CREDITED WITH HELPING HER WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR. IT 
SEEKS TO SHOW LEADERSHIP AND AN ANTI-CRIME STANCE.

<P>
 For political insiders, the new campaign commercial Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
began broadcasting Tuesday is likely to be called "Son of Grabber." 
</P>
<P>
 It contains 10 of the most dramatic seconds ever seen in a campaign ad, 
showing Feinstein at an emotional news conference shortly after the 1978 
assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey 
Milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "The Grabber" when it was first broadcast during Feinstein's 1990 race 
for governor, the spot found a permanent place in California political lore 
when it triggered a dramatic shift in which Feinstein's stumbling campaign 
leapfrogged over two leading Democratic opponents and won the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot . . . and killed," 
Feinstein announces to a bank of jostling television cameras outside the 
mayor's office. On the tape, there are loud groans and a woman's screams. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening scene is the only segment of the 1990 commercial that voters will 
see in the new ad for Feinstein's campaign against Republican challenger Mike 
Huffington. But the themes of the two spots are also similar -- an attempt to 
cast Feinstein as a tough and capable leader who not only fights against 
violence, but has experienced it. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, the campaign manager who ran the "Grabber" spot in 1990, said 
its original purpose was to introduce Feinstein to a state that already knew 
parts of her story. By highlighting her support for the death penalty, it also 
sought to underscore her image as a moderate Democrat for many voters who 
assumed a woman Democrat from San Francisco was liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's new Senate ad also attempts to establish her foothold in the 
middle of the political spectrum by calling attention to her differences with 
the Democratic Party at the same time it highlights her work with Republicans 
on crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows the tragedy of violence," a narrator says. "For 21 years, she's 
been a strong, sometimes lonely voice for the death penalty in the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Senate, she won Republican votes to ban assault weapons, wrote the law 
to expel any student who brings a gun to school, fought for the toughest 
anti-crime package ever to put more cops on our streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-crime package refers to a sweeping bill that is pending in the Senate 
and is at the center of a major showdown between President Clinton and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow, who is not working for Feinstein this year, predicted that political 
insiders might be critical of Feinstein's rerun of a commercial from a previous 
campaign. But he said the ad should be effective because the themes of 
anti-crime and leadership are germane to the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign was sharply critical of the new ad. The Republican 
campaign has repeatedly cast Feinstein as a liberal. Huffington said Tuesday 
that the new commercial is another attempt to mislead voters about Feinstein's 
political philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Feinstein is trying to cloak her liberal record in conservative 
rhetoric, but the facts speak for themselves," said Huffington, who is heading 
to Hawaii with his family this week for a brief vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington cited Feinstein's decisions between 1960 and 1966 as a member of 
the California State Parole Board to grant releases to a number of violent 
criminals. He also noted that Feinstein previously opposed the death penalty. 
The senator said she changed her mind in 1973, when she served on the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein released a second new ad Tuesday in which she expresses concern for 
the fears of working families over taxes, safety and education. It notes her 
support for the balanced budget amendment and her vote for Clinton's 1993 
deficit reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington countered Tuesday that Feinstein "is one of the biggest taxers and 
biggest spenders ever in the U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the "Grabber" spot, the second new ad also calls attention to her support 
of elements in the anti-crime package.

LUNGREN SEEKS TOUGH LIMITS ON CARD ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren on Tuesday urged lawmakers to approve a legislative 
proposal to impose tough new controls on California's growing card room 
industry or face an increase in illegal activities plaguing card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow the gambling industry to become an under-regulated giant, we 
would be leaving our state open to a crime problem never seen before here in 
the state of California," Lungren told a Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren was accompanied by police officials, including a representative of Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who said lucrative card rooms are magnets 
for crime, including loan-sharking and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with two Democratic lawmakers, Republican Lungren is pushing a bill to 
establish a seven-member gambling commission to license card rooms and set up a 
new bureaucracy in his department to investigate and keep tabs on card club 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 With pressure mounting for new clubs, especially in Los Angeles County, 
Lungren seeks to replace the current patchwork system of regulation in which 
cities authorize the state's 265 card rooms and Lungren's office investigates 
card room applicants. His three-member review staff faces a backlog of 
applicants who propose opening 525 new card tables statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said one version of the proposal was approved 49 to 10 earlier this 
year in the Assembly, but stalled when opponents were granted reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been criticized by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who have 
complained about a special provision to limit new card rooms opening in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren on Tuesday agreed to strip that provision from his measure. Instead, 
he would bar out-of-state casino operators from buying card rooms for two 
years, as a way to hold off an onrush of new clubs while the commission gets 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Lungren's counterproposal, Hollywood Park, one of the bill's biggest 
backers, would be able to directly operate a new card room recently opened at 
its Inglewood racetrack. The law now bars such publicly traded companies as 
Hollywood Park from operating card clubs, so the track must lease out its card 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said Lungren's proposal was getting closer to something that he could 
support. But he contended that the measure still was chock-full of "some 
goodies for every special interest in town."

WILSON SIGNS LAW ALLOWING PUBLIC SCHOOL UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation Tuesday permitting school districts to 
adopt dress codes requiring their students to wear uniforms on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the proliferation of gangs, Wilson said uniforms would allow students 
to focus more on academics and less on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that students only had to worry about putting together clothes 
that matched," Wilson said. "Today, the wrong combination can get you killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed the bill by state Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) at a ceremony in 
his office attended by about a dozen uniform-clad elementary school students 
from the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Also present was Jesse Atondo, 17, the student body president at Arvin High 
School near Bakersfield. Atondo's campaign to persuade his school board to 
adopt a uniform policy prompted the legislation Wilson signed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Current law allows schools to ban the wearing of colors associated with gangs 
and permits schools to adopt voluntary uniform policies. But school districts 
said they did not believe they had the authority to require students to wear 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, requires districts considering uniform 
policies to consult with principals, teachers and parents before choosing a 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 The district must give parents six months notice of any change and provide an 
alternative if they do not want their child to wear a uniform. Children who 
want to participate but cannot afford the uniform must be provided one. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill sailed through the Legislature with bipartisan support and the 
backing of most of the major school lobbying groups. The only formal opposition 
came from the American Civil Liberties Union, which contended that there was no 
evidence that uniforms reduce crime or improve learning.

ON CALIFORNIA: ANOTHER MODEST PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop the Big One now.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Newman 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Texans started it. They came out here to what they call, in their superior 
Texas way, the Left Coast and tried to woo away Taco Bell. This could not be 
tolerated. Move the brain trust of Taco Bell to Texas and surely the fragile 
California economy would crumble. So our great and bold leaders decided to make 
an example of Texas, to fight back as only they know how. They took out a 
newspaper ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, declared the ad published a few weeks ago, "is telling tall tales about 
California." Business executives would need "big boots to wade through all the 
promises." The California advertisement went on to mention Texas hurricanes, 
Texas humidity, Texas mosquitoes. In response, Texas Gov. Ann Richards wrote a 
letter to Pete Wilson, telling him to grow up, pipe down or look out. At this 
report, the Californians remain in their bunker, contemplating their 
counteroffensive to this Texas counteroffensive. 
</P>
<P>
 And here, with apologies to Jonathan Swift, I'd like to make a modest 
proposal. I'd suggest we do more than ratchet up the rhetoric with Texas. We've 
let enough out-of-state buzzards pick on the California carcass, wallowed too 
long in self-pity. It's time for something extreme, something like a good 
little war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with California that could not be fixed by going to war 
with Texas. Peace has wrecked the California economy. Thousands of aerospace 
engineers have been shuffled off to arc-welding class. They need to be put back 
to work making weapons of mass destruction. It's their God-given talent. It's 
what California does best. 
</P>
<P>
 This would only begin the recovery process. Restart the defense industry, and 
engineers again would flock to California. There would be riveting jobs for new 
generations of Rosies. Paychecks would flow. Houses would be in demand. 
Suburbia would resume its long march into the California desert. Where date 
palms now wave in hot winds, strip malls would flourish. It would be heaven, 
full employment and a nail salon on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential spoils of this war are enormous. Subdue Texas, and the great pox 
of illegal immigration would be wiped away. No longer would we need to rely on 
a working underclass of Mexican volunteers. Texas prisoners could be brought 
west by the trainload to clean our cars, clip our lawns, pick our fruit, wash 
our dishes. Just like the good old days of the Okies! Yes, there would be 
language problems, but in time most Texans can be trained to speak a passably 
understandable English. In any case, California's immigrant bashers would be 
pleased, if only because Texans do not look like they come from . . . somewhere 
else.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Texas contains 266,697 square miles of nothingness, wide open country 
California could fill in a hurry. Reduced to essentials, there is but one 
public policy issue in our state -- where to put things. California is so 
pretty the whole place ought to be a park. This makes it tough deciding where 
to install society's more unpleasant necessities. Like prisons, of which we 
never can build enough. And trash. And nuclear waste. And trailer parks. Win 
the war, and the answer in every case would be simple: Stick it in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California politicians surely must sense the opportunity. They have spent the 
past decade straining to appear tough. Tough on criminals, tough on poor 
people, tough on any individual or cause stupid enough not to contribute 
freely, and preferably in cash, to their reelection campaigns. In fact, any 
hack pol would tell you, it's getting tough anymore to find novel ways to get 
tough. All the easy targets have been taken. They need new red meat. They need 
Texans. 
</P>
<P>
 The common people of California, though, would receive the war's biggest 
boost. Their morale has been shaken. They have turned mean. Everybody blames 
everybody else for everything. This war could be a great unifier. No more North 
vs. South. No more CEO vs. full-time temp. No more surf Nazi vs. Boogie 
boarder. We'd engage as one against a common enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we might get whipped. Californians are famous for making weapons. 
Texans actually know how to shoot the damned things. Still, in war, it's 
possible to win by losing. After surrender, the soldiers move on, the lawyers 
take the field and negotiations begin. We've got Shapiro. We'll do fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, it will be bloody. California vets will straggle home with 
stories of horror to tell: They kept screamin' 'Remember the Alamo!' and 'How 
'bout them Cowboys!' It was pure hell. Maybe then Californians will comprehend, 
at last, the folly of their bellyaching. Maybe they will look back and realize 
how good they had it back in '94, before the big Texas war. And so yes, all 
things considered, on to Texas. It's a wonderful idea, so wonderful it scares 
me.

GUN ADVOCATES SQUARE OFF AGAINST ROBERTI BILL; LEGISLATION: FIGHT IS OVER A 
PROPOSED EXPANSION OF ASSAULT-WEAPON BAN, WHICH FACES TEST IN ASSEMBLY 
COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a showdown reminiscent of last spring's recall election, gun rights 
advocates were once again squaring off against state Sen. David A. Roberti, 
whose bill to expand California's assault-weapon ban is up for a do-or-die 
committee hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by their apparent success in targeting other gun-control bills in the 
final weeks of the Legislature, firearms rights groups notified supporters in a 
letter to pull out all the stops in telling lawmakers that they oppose 
Roberti's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take lightly his 'give me a vote for old times sake' pitch," wrote 
former state Sen. H. L. Richardson, founder of Gun Owners of California and an 
old nemesis of Roberti, who will be ousted by term limits in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The face-off calls to mind the political battle played out in the heart of the 
San Fernando Valley in April as gun owners furious over the Van Nuys Democrat's 
assault-weapon ban sought to have him recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roberti emerged victorious from the recall election, he lost a June 
bid for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer -- largely because he had 
little money remaining to wage his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's bill, unveiled in April at a shooting range, with Democratic 
gubernatorial hopeful Kathleen Brown at his side, would plug loopholes in his 
earlier assault-weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun distributors and manufacturers learned to get around the 1989 law -- which 
listed forbidden military-style weapons by name -- by giving guns a different 
name or slightly changing their features. 
</P>
<P>
 In wording similar to a proposed federal assault-weapon ban, the bill 
scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee today would add 
a generic, blanket description of so-called "copycat" military-style guns to 
the 5-year-old ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun owners' lobbying push, backed by an editorial in Tuesday's Orange 
County Register, had Roberti fuming as he tried to round up the 12 committee 
votes he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm appalled yet fascinated," Roberti said, responding to the editorial. 
"It's a degree of uncompromising fanaticism that is dangerous to the body 
politic." 
</P>
<P>
 Chastising the senator for his "flimsy logic," the editorial called Roberti's 
bill "the vehement gun controller's Parthian shot against the Second Amendment" 
right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Months after his announcement that he will retire from politics, Roberti 
remains a magnet for attacks stemming from his gun-control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think they would have tapered off, but they haven't," Roberti said. 
"We only seem to be able to win when we have a massive amount of press -- and 
you usually need a massacre to go along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 A California Rifle and Pistol Assn. flyer alerts supporters that "the dumbest 
show on Earth is continuing its long run in Sacramento" and that "the main 
attraction is led by 'Ringmaster' David Roberti as the politicians scamper and 
frolic in the center ring of the circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's letter to members said: "We humiliated David Roberti. He 
rightfully attributes his defeat to us gunners. And he wants revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Gun Owners of America release sent to members of Congress weighing a 
federal ban, the group boasts of depleting Roberti's financial resources, and 
warns: "Before you vote on the crime bill, remember . . . David Roberti of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Legislature winds up its final days of the two-year session, California 
gun rights groups are close to declaring victory in their attempts to squash or 
stall significant gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are cautiously optimistic at this point," said John Stoos, executive 
director of Gun Owners of California.

U.S. MAY SPEND MILLIONS FOR BLACK-MARKET FUEL IN HAITI; CARIBBEAN: GASOLINE 
MEANT FOR AID AGENCIES WAS SEIZED BY ARMY. PAYMENTS FOR NEW SUPPLIES WOULD 
ENRICH MILITARY, ITS ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States plans to pay millions of dollars to Haitian black marketeers 
violating U.S.-designed sanctions so it can replace more than half a million 
gallons of petroleum stocks confiscated by the military regime from 
humanitarian groups, U.S. and private aid officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the humanitarian aid effort, which feeds almost 1 million Haitians 
and will run out of fuel within weeks, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager 
said, "We will do whatever we have to do to keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
 He told reporters this includes U.S. government financing of fuel purchases by 
humanitarian groups from what he referred to as "the spot market," a diplomatic 
reference to the extensive black market controlled by Haitian army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to let the program die," Shrager said when it was pointed 
out that such purchases would not only violate a U.S.-supported international 
embargo against gasoline imports but would encourage increased smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of this choice could be $4.4 million at current prices, about $8 a 
gallon. The confiscated fuel totals 550,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness of this option is even sharper because almost all the gasoline 
brought into Haiti is in the hands of businessmen and army officers blamed by 
the United States for creating the current crisis; they ousted Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, the country's duly-elected president, 35 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sweet, isn't it?" said a young businessman who smuggles gasoline from 
the neighboring Dominican Republic. "The Americans have made me rich with their 
embargo, and now they are going to make me even richer." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. decision not only promises even greater riches to the military and 
its supporters, it also leaves the regime with a gasoline stockpile, allowing 
it to protect its strategic reserves if the fuel flow is reduced. "It's just 
sitting there under their control," said an official for one humanitarian 
group. "They don't have to use it; just having it gives them more room. It's 
like found money." 
</P>
<P>
 The present problem surfaced a month ago when the regime refused to release 
550,000 gallons of fuel permitted by the sanctions and designated for use by 
CARE, Catholic Relief Services and several smaller private agencies that 
provide food and medicine to about 960,000 of Haiti's poorest citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The supply was to last two months, but the military sealed the storage tanks 
and has refused to permit any distribution, demanding that high-ranking aid 
officials and senior U.S. diplomats negotiate with them for the fuel's release. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is impossible, Shrager said, because the United States -- which 
finances most humanitarian programs here -- will not deal directly with the 
military or its puppet civilian government, arguing "they are both illegal and 
illegitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had expected Haitian authorities to relent this week. But 
Shrager said Tuesday that the optimism had faded and that there was "no 
indication" the fuel would be distributed. Some small groups are already out of 
fuel; the largest groups say their supplies will last for two or three weeks 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The humanitarian food program, designed to offset the worst effects of the 
international embargo, "is crucial to us," Shrager said, explaining the plans 
under way to purchase smuggled gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time U.S. officials have dipped into the gasoline black 
market. The U.S. Embassy is the single largest purchaser of illicit fuel, 
buying thousands of gallons of gasoline, sources involved in smuggling said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sources said that at one point earlier this year, embassy fuel purchases, 
made at higher-than-street prices to ensure delivery, put the mission's budget 
$300,000 in the red and led to State Department threats to reduce staff and 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials defend their black-market fuel purchases and the plan for 
helping aid agencies, noting there are no alternatives. "We have to be 
realistic," Shrager said. "There is no other source." 
</P>
<P>
 The inability in the last three years to stop fuel smuggling has been a major 
reason why the Americans have failed to drive the military from power and 
restore Aristide, by the accounts of most diplomats and Haitian experts. "If 
the Americans do this," said one diplomat, commenting on reports of impending 
black-market fuel purchases, "it will guarantee the life of this regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to U.S. distress has been the failure to gain meaningful cooperation 
from the Dominican Republic in closing its border. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite constant pledges by the Dominicans to stop smuggling -- and the 
deployment of a U.S.-Canadian military force to monitor the border -- President 
Joaquin Balaguer's government has refused to cooperate, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balaguer finds first one excuse, then another," said a diplomat whose 
government is involved in the negotiations. "The fact is that his military is 
getting rich from the smuggling, and they aren't ready to give it up -- not 
now, not ever."

 Typhoon Fred killed more than 700 people in eastern China's Zhejiang province 
and caused more than $1 billion in damage, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The typhoon pounded the coastal region south of Shanghai over the weekend, 
collapsing thousands of houses and demolishing river embankments. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the provincial foreign affairs office said by telephone that 
at least 700 people had died. But there was no final tally of deaths and 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to official figures, the storm resulted in the collapse of 100,000 
homes with damage to 700,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million people were surrounded by floodwaters, and 560,000 have 
moved to drier areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The official New China News Agency said heavy rains lashed most of the 
province for 43 consecutive hours. Rainfall exceeded eight inches in some 
areas, with flooding up to three feet. Tides in some areas reached 20-year 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reaching China, Fred killed three people in Taiwan.

CIVIL RIGHTS; SPENT BY UPHEAVAL, NAACP MUST NOW REVIVE FINANCES, IMAGE; AFTER 
CHAVIS, THE GROUP IS HOBBLED BY DEBT AND DOUBTS. IT SEEKS A NEW LEADER AND A 
RETURN TO ITS INTEGRATIONIST ROOTS. 
</P>

<P>
 On April 9, 1993, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the freshly elected NAACP executive 
director, struck a confrontational pose as he attempted to reverse the moribund 
image of the 85-year-old civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen months later, Chavis was history -- fired last weekend, in the words 
of one board member, for racing the group's engines "too hard, too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's back to the future for the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in less than two years, the proud and revered civil rights 
organization is lurching toward yet another change in direction -- away from 
Chavis' aggressive black nationalism toward its traditional, integrationist 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as it does so, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
remains ensnarled in the Chavis fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Chavis' lawyers argued in a Washington federal court that his 
firing violated NAACP bylaws and would cripple his ability to seek another job. 
"He has been accused . . . of stealing from the NAACP," said Abbey Hairston, 
who represented Chavis at the hearing. "The NAACP has a long history of 
survival. But what will Dr. Chavis do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis is seeking a preliminary injunction to prohibit the NAACP from removing 
him from his $200,000-a-year job. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon said he 
would decide the case this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 NAACP attorneys argued that Chavis breached his responsibilities as executive 
director when, without board knowledge or approval, he disbursed $64,000 of the 
cash-strapped organization's money -- and promised to spend up to a total of 
$332,400 -- to settle a threatened sex discrimination and wrongful discharge 
suit brought by Mary E. Stansel, a former aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is critical to the survival of the association to restore the confidence 
of contributors," NAACP attorney Lawrence Greenwald told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP's problems only begin with its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major woe is the search for a new executive director, which will 
require a time-consuming and potentially divisive sift through a roster of 
black leaders for someone with the talent, desire and charisma to lead the 
NAACP. As was the case when Chavis was hired, the demeanor of the next 
executive director will suggest the public image and posture of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members say they were alarmed to learn that Chavis turned a $1.5-million 
surplus into a $2.7-million deficit. Some say he bankrupted the group by 
spending lavishly on unbudgeted items, such as trips to South Africa, meetings 
with gang members and a series of leadership summits for black nationalist 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was spending our money like it was Monopoly money," said board member Marc 
Stepp. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Jonas, who has been a major NAACP fund-raiser for 30 years, said the 
board's "preoccupation has to be with survival, and the way to do that is to 
rally the 1,200 branches and all of our members" under new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was underscored by Earl T. Shinhoster, one of two interim directors 
selected to serve until a replacement for Chavis is hired by the board. 
"Membership and money is the lifeblood of the NAACP," he said, urging the 
organization to commit to "a special 30-day campaign to increase money coming 
into the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Shinhoster, who had served as the group's national field 
secretary before Chavis' firing, and Fred Rasheed, who had spearheaded the 
NAACP's economic development programs, suggest the seriousness the board has 
placed on untangling its financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 As national field secretary, Shinhoster was the third-ranking NAACP official 
behind board chairman William F. Gibson and Chavis. Last year, he was one of 
the four finalists for the executive director's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasheed is a longtime NAACP official, best known for developing the group's 
Fair Share program, which negotiated business and employment deals on behalf of 
black Americans with major businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to asking members to contribute more money, the interim leaders 
pledged to recruit enough new members to push the NAACP's roster to 1 million 
by the end of the year and to try to strengthen its administration, management 
practices and develop new programs to generate revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the people who have supported the NAACP in the past interpret (Chavis' 
firing) as a return to the basic mission of the NAACP," Jonas said. "That is 
the first step we have to take to restore the integrity and credibility of our 
organization so the funders will continue to support us." 
</P>
<P>
 Last time around, the selection of a new executive director took more than a 
year. Jesse Jackson was the apparent early favorite, with strong support from 
Gibson. Jewel Jackson McCabe, president of the National Coalition of 100 Black 
Women, a New York-based social service organization, mounted a strong 
pro-feminist challenge to the male leadership of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 The board finally settled on Chavis, figuring he was less likely than Jackson 
to overshadow Gibson and his supporters on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be very cautious this time around," said one board member who 
supported Chavis' election a year ago. "As it turned out, the one thing we 
feared most happened. We got an executive director who did what he wanted and 
not what the board wanted him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "God, I can't believe I'm saying this, but Jesse would look 
mighty good to us right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, Shinhoster and other NAACP officials say it's too early for them to 
begin speculating on who might be the next executive director. "We should be 
just as deliberate this time as we were before," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one board member: "I can't imagine anyone of prominence who would want 
the job after all we've been through." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the board's search may be frustrated by a paucity of well-known black 
leaders who are able to span the increasingly diverse interests of African 
Americans and form congenial ties with supportive corporations and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dawson, a University of Chicago political scientist who studies black 
politics, said many black leaders are representatives of narrow interest 
groups, not national leaders with name recognition or broad constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is a record number of black elected officials and middle-class 
blacks who have gained a larger stake in the nation's mainstream than at any 
time in history, Dawson frets that "the nation has its lowest level of critical 
voices in the black community now than at any time in the 20th Century. Most of 
those in leadership (positions) are all competing about what road black people 
should take, but none have much of a national following." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, leadership of the NAACP still is a prize holding tremendous 
prestige within and beyond the nation's various black communities, suggesting 
to NAACP officials that they will have no problem finding a new executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of potential choices includes Jackson, Shinhoster and many of those 
who turned the group down last time: former Atlanta mayors Maynard Jackson and 
Andrew Young; William H. Gray III, a former congressman from Philadelphia who 
heads the United Negro College Fund, and Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, 
the Washington-based international lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, the new leader will be a woman, given that some women within the 
NAACP are considering new challenges to the old-school, male leadership of the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 McCabe has begun campaigning for the job. Board member Myrlie Evers, the widow 
of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, and Spelman College President 
Johnetta Cole are among the names heard most often.

ELECTION LEAVES OPPOSITION IN CHIAPAS BITTER AND ANGRY; MEXICO: THE PRD AND ITS 
ALLIES BELIEVE THEY WERE CHEATED OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S POST. PRO-ZAPATISTA 
GROUPS CALL FOR CAMPAIGN OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Hours after polls had closed, hundreds of Indians, peasants and opposition 
activists crowded into the historic town plaza here chanting, "Fraud!" 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged at the way the elections had been conducted, they seized a voting box 
Sunday and began a public tally, holding each ballot aloft to cheers and boos 
from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, they announced they would not accept the ruling party's local 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, far from pacifying troubled Chiapas state, Mexico's elections left 
opposition forces here bitter and angry, inflaming tensions and increasing the 
possibility of further violent confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 With an armed guerrilla force encamped in the nearby forest-covered mountains, 
the prospects for lasting peace and stability have been thrown into question by 
the opposition's perception -- still unproven -- that it was cheated out of the 
chance to elect one of its own as governor, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process has become more urgent," said Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz, mediator between the rebels and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 With 93% of the votes counted in the governor's race, the official tally gives 
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 49% of the vote to 30% for 
Amado Avendano, a crusading newspaper publisher who ran on the leftist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano's candidacy -- nearly ended by a suspicious car wreck -- was 
supported by grass-roots groups and rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army, whose New Year's Day uprising dramatized demands for democracy and 
justice for the country's Mayan masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a general impression that the elections at a national level were 
cleaner than most in modern Mexico's fraud-filled history, opposition forces 
here have compiled numerous reports of vote-buying, intimidation and rigged 
counts that they claim deprived Avendano of a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups who backed Avendano's candidacy -- and who share the Zapatistas' 
demands -- have proclaimed him governor-elect and announced a three-month 
campaign of civil disobedience starting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are peaceful, but actions planned range from marches and 
roadblocks to the takeover of government buildings -- actions sure to rankle 
the conservative Chiapas elite, area ranchers and the PRI Establishment, 
already on edge because of the challenge to their power and privileges that the 
Zapatista movement represents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the election and we want peace," Avendano told supporters Monday night 
in a rare public appearance. "We are ready to fight and we will not negotiate 
the will of the Chiapas people." 
</P>
<P>
 Concepcion Villafuerte, Avendano's wife and an outspoken leftist leader, 
declared, "Starting today, we begin to take power." 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries Avendano sustained in a July 25 wreck that killed three of his 
campaign associates have prevented him from making public appearances. He spoke 
Monday night to about 200 supporters who cheered him with Zapatista slogans, 
according to La Jornada newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Zapatista territory, where officials said 73.7% of the 20,000 
people voting cast ballots for the PRD, the official results giving the PRI the 
lead are consistent with pre-election polls; PRI partisans were expected to 
dismiss opposition claims as sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the real results, if the opposition comes away from these 
elections unable to trust the system, it is unlikely to have much faith in 
government promises to make Mexico more democratic, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a danger that many people who participated (supporting opposition 
candidates) will be discouraged," said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. "They 
will believe that only a Marcos-type approach will foster change here," he 
added, referring to Subcommander Marcos, the masked leader of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas, whose 12-day revolt in January left 145 people dead before a 
cease-fire was declared, had threatened to retaliate if the elections were 
deemed fraudulent. But the role they will play in what many here are calling 
the next phase of the conflict is unclear: No longer regarded as a significant 
fighting force, they also find their military options limited by the presence 
in the region of an estimated 12,000 Mexican army troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the Zapatistas, aware that military options were exhausted, had 
already begun a process of ceding the initiative to civilian political forces. 
Renewed warfare is not seen as likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Zapatistas hold on to their weapons and have shown a remarkable 
skill at manipulating world opinion and forcing concessions from the national 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 And persistent reports of armed groups in Guerrero, Oaxaca and other parts of 
southern Mexico, consistently denied by the government, raise the specter of 
Zapatista-inspired violence elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Chiapas also fear violence from powerful landholders and ranchers, 
emboldened by a PRI victory and angry over recent seizures of parts of their 
land by pro-Zapatista peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army has not yet announced its judgment of 
the elections and is believed to be holding an internal assembly to analyze the 
voting and results. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the election, Subcommander Marcos said he would not order an 
immediate military response to fraud. But he cautioned that his troops "will 
remain alert in case the door to peaceful change closes once again." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, the government's representative in 
negotiations with the rebels, indicated that he felt the Zapatistas would react 
positively to the fact that thousands of Indians voted for the first time in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace cannot be reduced to an electoral process," Madrazo Cuellar said 
Tuesday. "The elections are one step in a process, and the process must 
continue. I believe we are on the threshold of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the opposition is to use civil disobedience to prevent Eduardo 
Robledo, the PRI candidate, from assuming office Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 There is precedent: Government opponents who felt they were cheated out of an 
electoral victory in 1988 eventually forced PRI candidates to step aside in the 
states of San Luis Potosi, Michoacan and Guanajuato. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition groups, who range from the left to center and include Indian 
organizations, are also demanding a recount, spokesman Arturo Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 They want Avendano to preside over a transitional government that will write a 
new constitution for Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo Lopez Angel, a Chamula community leader who ran for the legislature on 
the PRD ticket, said people are angry because they feel their desires were 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won and the PRI is cheating us out of our victory," he said. "If the PRI 
will not leave (office) peacefully, they will leave by force." 
</P>
<P>
 He was surrounded by Chamula Indian men, few of whom spoke Spanish but who had 
begun calling Lopez Angel "Senor Diputado" -- Spanish for Mr. Congressman.

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR PROPERTY SEIZED BY SOVIETS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE; RUSSIA: 
TIGHT LIMITS ON RESTITUTION MAY WORK AGAINST NEED TO BUILD CONFIDENCE THAT THE 
STATE WILL RESPECT PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For all you heirs of dispossessed Russian counts out there, wondering if you 
might someday get the old family estate back, the Justice Ministry sent a clear 
signal Tuesday: Don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin had announced new procedures Monday for returning or paying for 
"illegally confiscated property," raising the prospect that Russia might go the 
way of much of Eastern Europe, giving back castles and farms to their 
pre-Soviet owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Justice Minister Anatoly M. Stepanov clarified Tuesday that, 
although Russia is beginning to accept claims from victims of Soviet political 
repression who lost their property, it is not about to begin wholesale 
compensation for everything the Bolshevik regime seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing that was nationalized will be returned, nor will property lost because 
of war, Stepanov said. No land will be given back. Only property that was 
confiscated from people convicted, exiled or killed for "political" crimes is 
included, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he praised the compensation rules as "the next, very important step in 
the further democratization of our society, in the further reform of our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers here are trying hard to convince Russians that private property will 
remain sacrosanct, despite the historical traditions of the old Communist 
regime, which seized property from nobles, the Russian Orthodox Church, farmers 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Russians believe the state will not take away all they own, they will 
refuse to buy into the new capitalism and will continue to invest billions of 
dollars abroad instead of at home. And to instill that belief, reformers say, 
the government must begin to redress the injustices of the Communist 
confiscations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scale of the legal tangles Moscow will face if it tries to give 
everything back far outdoes anything in the Czech Republic or the Baltics. The 
prospects are so unnerving that the government does not even appear to be 
contemplating such a move. Instead, at this point at least, it has opted for 
the largely symbolic value of the new rules on property return and 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 And actually, considering the sorry state of the Russian budget, the 
government has gone well beyond mere symbolism, allotting 750 billion rubles 
(about $355 million) for property claims for 1994 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 For the victims of repression, however, the compensation's limits are almost 
laughable. The maximum that can be paid out on any one claim is 2 million 
rubles (about $950) if the confiscated property itself cannot be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was unclear what the rules would mean for Chechens, Ingush and other 
former Soviet peoples who suffered mass deportations under dictator Josef 
Stalin and whose homes were then occupied by others. Conflicts over such cases 
have already led to bloodshed in Ingushetia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The compensation money comes in addition to benefits the victims of repression 
have already received, ranging from free rides on public transport to a onetime 
payment -- also modest -- for every month they spent imprisoned unjustly. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people -- some believe as many as 20 million -- were killed and 
imprisoned under Stalin, and few of those who suffered the repression are still 
alive to stake a claim. But their heirs have the right to property or 
compensation, the new rules say. Foreigners are eligible to apply, but the 
exact procedure by which they should go about it has not been worked out yet. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Memorial Society, the main Russian group dedicated to documenting and 
redressing Stalinist repression, activists welcomed the new rules. "This is 
definitely a step forward and, although modest, a sign of progress and hope 
that those people who were unfairly punished will not be left stranded," said 
memorial activist Alexander Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel warned, however, that the new procedures would run into problems 
because the special commissions that are supposed to decide which claims are 
justified do not exist yet. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the idea that the government might some day give back all that its 
Soviet predecessor confiscated -- he dismissed it out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, for over 70 years, the Communists robbed the people. They managed to 
appropriate most of the property in Russia," he said. "I don't really see how 
all this property illegally confiscated from the people starting from Nov. 7, 
1917, could be returned to the victims. It would be totally unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 It does appear that certain chunks will, indeed, be given back, though. Prime 
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said Monday that the government is preparing a 
decree to give back all the property that had been seized from the Russian 
Orthodox Church under the Communist regime's policy of militant atheism. Many 
Russian churches have been used for decades as warehouses, and at least one was 
revamped into a hockey rink.

IN NOD TO JORDAN, U.S. MOVES TO END BLOCKADE OF RED SEA; MIDEAST: ALLIES 
ENFORCING EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ WILL ALLOW SHIPS TO BE INSPECTED IN PORT BY 
PRIVATE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a political gesture to Jordan, the Clinton Administration took the first 
steps Tuesday toward ending the allied naval blockade of the Red Sea that has 
been used to enforce the U.N. embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse announcement, the Pentagon said the Navy will temporarily suspend 
its inspection of merchant vessels outside the Jordanian port of Aqaba and 
instead allow agents of Lloyd's Register, a London-based firm, to verify 
contents of vessels after they dock. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, requested formally by King Hussein, came in the wake of Jordan's 
peace accord with Israel last month and rapidly improving diplomatic and 
economic relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 If the onshore inspections prove satisfactory in a monthlong test, the United 
States and its U.N. allies will end their naval blockade in the Red Sea area 
and turn the operation over to Lloyd's, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and allied warships will continue to enforce their 4-year-old naval 
blockade against Iraq in the Persian Gulf, which, like the Red Sea, serves as a 
major sea lane for cargo ships carrying goods to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, imposed just before the Persian Gulf War, was initially designed 
to persuade Iraq to leave after it invaded Kuwait in August, 1990. It was 
continued after the war to ensure that Iraq did not rebuild its arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The allies began intercepting ships outside Aqaba after U.S. intelligence 
agencies suggested Jordan may have been helping Iraq get around the embargo. 
Hussein was critical of the allied offensive against Iraq, calling it a war 
against all Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the interdiction of ships bound to and from Aqaba has long been a goal 
of Jordan, which has regarded the operation as an encroachment on its 
sovereignty and a slap in the face politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's relations with Jordan have warmed considerably since Hussein made 
peace with Israel, and President Clinton is now asking Congress to write off 
Amman's almost $700-million debt and sell Jordan more military spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department said the United States and the 13 other allied 
countries participating in the naval embargo have intercepted 21,392 vessels in 
the Red Sea and Persian Gulf and have boarded 9,710 of them since the blockade 
was imposed Aug. 18, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the vessels boarded, about 500 have been diverted, mostly because their 
manifest papers were not in order or because their cargo holds were 
inaccessible, the Pentagon said. Most were cleared after closer inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said U.S. naval vessels will continue to conduct routine 
patrols in the Red Sea area, as they have for years, even if the job of 
enforcing the embargo against Iraq is moved ashore. The area serves as a 
strategic naval hub for the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan are negotiating bilateral agreements on issues ranging from 
providing for joint management of the Dead Sea to setting up more border 
crossings for tourists. 
</P>

RWANDAN REFUGEES LEAVE CROWDED ZAIRE TOWN FOR NEW CAMPSITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of Rwandan refugees packed their bags and headed out of Bukavu on 
Tuesday as tempers in the increasingly filthy and congested Zairian town became 
more and more frayed. 
</P>
<P>
 From early morning, there was a steady flow of Hutus out of the city center 
going toward Hongo, a new campsite opening up for 80,000 people on the 
wind-swept shores of Lake Kivu. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are clearing out of town incredibly fast," said Jane Pope of the CARE 
charity's Canadian branch. "They are vacating the sites and there's been a 
steady stream of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of a move from Bukavu came as a relief to the aid agencies, who have 
warned that the presence of 100,000 refugees in the city center risks 
triggering epidemics and increasingly violent confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials say Zairians are already beginning to catch the debilitating 
dysentery the refugees brought with them. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that once epidemics like measles start, there will be a far higher 
death rate among Zairians, who are vaccinated only occasionally, than Rwandans, 
who have benefited from a comprehensive vaccination program. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in this picturesque lakeside town has been transformed by the influx of 
tens of thousands of refugees who are convinced that the Tutsi-dominated 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, which won the civil war, will crack down in the wake 
of France's weekend troop withdrawal from a "safe zone" in southwest Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line supporters of Rwanda's ousted Hutu administration have been accused 
of the massacre of about 500,000 minority Tutsis after the April 6 death of 
Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Bukavu squatters set out on foot, trucks provided by aid agencies took 
many refugees from the Rwandan side of the Rusizi River across the frontier 
toward Nyamanangwe, another new camp. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially closing its Bukavu border crossings Saturday on the grounds 
that it did not want a repeat of last month's Goma catastrophe, Zaire agreed 
under pressure from the aid agencies to open the lesser used of two bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim was to force the refugees to bypass central Bukavu, crammed to the 
bursting point, and settle in the camps. No Hutus were being allowed to walk 
across the Rusizi 2 bridge south of town on Tuesday; instead, they were being 
carefully herded onto trucks heading directly to the camps.

SENATOR WILL END HIS NRA MEMBERSHIP

<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. suffered another congressional defection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) disclosed that he will not be renewing 
his membership in the 2.5-million-member NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), a longtime member of the NRA's 
board of directors, had announced in a dramatic speech on the House floor that 
he was resigning from the board and then voted in favor of the crime bill with 
its ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, in an interview to be published in today's Denver Post, protested 
what he called "strong-arm tactics" of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way they (the NRA) can lobby is through threats and intimidation," 
said the first-term senator, who supported the ban on assault weapons but said 
he would continue to oppose other gun control measures, such as national 
registration.

WHITE HOUSE URGES OTHER NATIONS TO TAKE CUBAN REFUGEES; IMMIGRATION: CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION HOPES THAT DETAINMENT OUTSIDE THE U.S. WILL DISCOURAGE RAFTERS. 
COAST GUARD IS STILL RESCUING HUNDREDS A DAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed 
a dozen Caribbean and Latin American governments Tuesday to provide internment 
camps that officials hope will prove less attractive to refugees than the U.S. 
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the Cubans would be transferred from 
Guantanamo Bay, on Cuba's southeast coast, to alternate sites just as soon as 
arrangements can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the refugees at Guantanamo are held behind barbed wire, to many, the 
base seems less forbidding than a foreign internment camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They believe that Guantanamo is part of the U.S.A.," said Victor Fraga, 35, a 
Cuban now living in Miami who reached the United States during the 1980 Mariel 
boat lift. "When they get to Guantanamo, they are in the U.S. They have food. 
They have jeans. They have freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more freedom in a jail in the U.S. than in Cuba," said Orlando 
Abelindo, who arrived in the United States Aug. 14 after casting away from Cuba 
on a raft made of Styrofoam packing material. "In Cuba we are slaves. When they 
get to Guantanamo, they know for a fact that they are in U.S. territory and 
Castro can do nothing to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Graciella Cruz-Taura, a professor of history at Florida Atlantic University, 
agreed. "For Cubans, going to Guantanamo is not going to a foreign land. 
Legally it may be U.S. property, but for a Cuban to be told he is going to 
Guantanamo, it is in fact part of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have the same psychological impact as being sent to a foreign 
detention camp," said Cruz-Taura, a Cuban American who came to the United 
States in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after President Clinton sought to stop the outpouring of Cubans by 
decreeing that refugees will be rounded up and detained instead of gaining 
almost automatic asylum in the United States, the pace of emigration continued 
to accelerate. On Tuesday, the Coast Guard rescued 2,886 more rafters, the 
largest single-day total since the Mariel boat lift, which brought 125,000 
Cubans to Florida over five months. The Coast Guard had rescued 2,548 rafters 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that this is unprecedented," said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Howe of 
the U.S. Coast Guard. "With Mariel, you had a shrimp boat with 100 people on 
it. With this, you have a tire with a guy in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe said the Coast Guard had called in 10 more ships from as far away as the 
West Coast and the Great Lakes to join the 20 vessels already patrolling the 
Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen anything quite like this," he said. "We're throwing 
everything at it that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Administration officials said they remain hopeful that the flow 
of Cubans soon will abate, just as the exodus of Haitians stopped several weeks 
ago after it became clear that refugees were going to a tent city at Guantanamo 
instead of to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will just take time for the message to sink in that they are not going to 
the United States," an Administration official said. "It took a while with the 
Haitians." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is becoming increasingly clear that Cubans and Haitians view the 
Guantanamo facility differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration hopes that facilities on other islands or in Central 
America will prove to be more of a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said that the Administration is asking governments 
that have indicated they will accept Haitian refugees to take Cubans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has signed agreements with Suriname, St. Lucia and Dominica 
to accept Haitians, so those three governments are at the top of the priority 
list for Cuban camps, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government that takes office in Panama on Sept. 1 has expressed 
willingness to offer a haven for Haitians and is expected to do the same for 
Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Washington has agreements in principle but has not signed 
contracts with Grenada and Antigua. Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala 
and El Salvador have said that they will consider the U.S. request to take both 
Cubans and Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some refugees might reconsider their flight if Cubans are sent to 
camps in Suriname or Panama, recent immigrants interviewed in Florida said that 
they expect their countrymen to keep coming. Some said that jail is better than 
life in Cuba. And others expressed confidence that the Administration 
eventually will relent and permit the refugees to settle in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaldo Alonzo, 49, a Cuban immigrant who beat the new policy by reaching 
Miami a week ago, said that his brother-in-law and hundreds of other Cubans are 
continuing to risk their lives in the Florida Straits even though they know 
that Clinton intends to deny them entry to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks that eventually he'll get to America," Alonzo said. "I think he 
will be processed at Guantanamo and then they will let him come here -- just 
like they let me and the rest of the family in." 
</P>
<P>
 People will keep flooding out of Cuba, he added, because the impulse to leave 
is so great. "It's impossible to live there. Anywhere is better." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Information Agency prepared to increase its television broadcasts to 
Cuba to try to discourage rafters. The Fidel Castro regime effectively jams the 
signal of the TV broadcasts, which air daily from 3:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that they plan to extend their broadcast until 8 a.m. and will 
begin transmitting information about the dangers of attempting to cross the 
Florida Straits and details of the Administration's detention policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, at the request of Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, Clinton dispatched a 
delegation to South Florida to assess efforts to cope with Cuban refugees being 
detained there. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jose Cabanas of the Cuban Foreign Ministry acknowledged that his 
country has loosened its emigration policy, although he said Cuba remains 
opposed to illegal departures and he blamed the United States for prompting the 
current exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to dissuade as much, as much as possible, candidates from emigrating 
in rafts," he said in a statement carried by the Prensa Latina news agency. 
</P>

 Kempster reported from Washington and Shogren from Miami. Times staff writers

WOMAN KILLED AT HUSBAND'S GRAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 An elderly woman tending the grave of her husband was shot and killed Tuesday 
when a group of bank robbers apparently saw her while changing vehicles at the 
cemetery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Parker, 81, was shot near this central Texas town, about 100 miles north 
of Houston, after eight men robbed the Normangee State Bank of about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Texas state trooper was also injured in the incident when he was shot in the 
shoulder during a car chase as the bank robbers left the cemetery in two 
vehicles, the Leon County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the eight bank robbers were later captured. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded officer was listed in stable condition at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Normangee said the shooting of Parker was believed to be the 
first homicide in the town of about 600 people in the last 25 years.

POLICE FIRE ON EACH OTHER AT N.Y. SUBWAY STOP; 3 HURT

 Police officers from two different agencies responded to a report of a man 
with a shotgun on a packed subway platform and mistakenly opened fire on each 
other as panicked passengers dove for the floor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty city police officer, an undercover transit officer and a bystander 
were wounded during the rush-hour pandemonium in mid-town Manhattan. One of the 
officers was in critical condition Tuesday with multiple wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was chaos," commuter Kelly Ramchandnani said. "There were people all over 
the place. Everyone went down on the floor, in the station and inside the last 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commissioner William Bratton called it "a friendly fire situation. It's 
going to take us a while to see what transpired." 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old woman was wounded in the leg, apparently by the man with the 
shotgun. She was treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began shortly after 7 p.m. Monday, when several passengers told a 
pair of uniformed transit officers that a man with a gun was on the platform 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 Four undercover transit officers working pickpocket detail on a different 
platform responded, as did an off-duty city police officer who was taking the 
subway home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were handcuffing one of two suspects when a loud bang rang out, 
apparently from the shotgun, Bratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the subsequent fusillade, undercover transit officer Desmond Robinson, 31, 
was shot four times in the torso; doctors said a bullet nicked his heart. He 
was in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital. Off-duty city officer Peter 
Del-Debbio, 31, was hit once in the arm and was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all likelihood," Transit Police spokesman Albert O'Leary told New York 
Newsday, "it appears that DelDebbio fired and hit Transit Police Officer 
Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
 Damal Parham, 16, was charged with criminal possession of a .22-caliber 
handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers recovered a sawed-off shotgun at the scene and later arrested Shea 
Kisine Davis, 17, on charges of assault, reckless endangerment and criminal 
possession of a weapon.

 Regular exercise has been found to protect older people from a dangerous type 
of internal bleeding that kills thousands of elderly Americans every year, 
according to a study. "People who are physically active are at lower risk of 
having a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage," said Dr. Jack M. Guralnik, an 
epidemiologist at the National Institute on Aging in Chicago and a co-author of 
the study. Elderly people who exercised at least three times a week, even if 
they just walked or worked in their gardens, were found to be 30% less likely 
to suffer severe or fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhages.

LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE APPROVES FINANCING FOR SOME ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY BOULARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing the possible loss of up to $3 billion in federal Medicaid funding if 
they did not act, the Louisiana Legislature agreed on Tuesday to allow public 
financing of abortions for poor women whose pregnancies result from incest or 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate voted, 28 to 8, for the measure, and the House, which has 
balked at the legislation in the past, went along on a 59-40 vote. The bill 
will keep the state in line with a federal law passed last year allowing 
federal funds be used to help poor women pay for abortions in the case of 
incest or rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana had allowed such funding only to save the life of the mother, but 
last month a federal judge ruled that the state could be denied any future 
Medicaid funding until it complied with federal law. Last week, U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Antonin Scalia denied an emergency request by Gov. Edwin W. 
Edwards and other state officials to lift the lower court order requiring the 
state to pay for the abortions or give up the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging the Legislature to amend its abortion law, Edwards said the loss of 
federal funding could jeopardize the "health services for approximately 600,000 
people in Louisiana . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers meeting in special session since last weekend saw the debate as one 
pitting access to abortions against the need for federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about life versus money, that's what it really comes down to," 
said state Rep. Louis (Woody) Jenkins, a Baton Rouge Democrat who urged the 
state to stick to its original law. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Dastugue, a Republican representative from the New Orleans suburb of 
Metairie, said the loss of Medicaid money might be a good thing. "If we lost a 
couple of hundred million dollars, I think that would be great. It's time for 
us to stop relying so much on the federal government and maybe start thinking 
about cutting back on what we spend." 
</P>
<P>
 But state Sen. Diana Bajoie, a New Orleans Democrat, argued "we should never 
have a double standard for people in this state, especially for a woman who 
finds herself in such a traumatic situation where she's had a tremendous 
violation committed to her body." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, faced with the loss of a huge federal subsidy, the voting wasn't 
close. Edwards promised to sign the bill immediately.

TEACHER SUSPENDED FOR DEFYING MOMENT-OF-SILENCE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of school, Brian Bown's American government class listened to 
a lecture while the rest of the school observed a state-ordered moment of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was suspended Tuesday for refusing to comply with the law, which he says is 
unconstitutional. Legislators pushed the bill as a first step toward getting 
prayer back in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have to say is very important to say, and they're not taking a minute 
from me," said Bown, a teacher at South Gwinnett High School in suburban 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes started Monday at many schools in Georgia, and that was the first time 
many teachers had to order their students to sit quietly for up to one minute 
at the beginning of the day. The law took effect July 1 and was enforced during 
summer school in some districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar measures are on the books in other states, although Georgia appears to 
be alone in strictly enforcing a mandatory moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the Georgia law said it would help students reflect on their 
activities. Opponents said it was an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's 
ruling against organized prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Bown's students paid attention to him during the moment of silence 
Monday. One student, sophomore Kelly Stock, bowed her head in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwinnett County Supt. George Thompson told Bown that he would be fired if he 
didn't comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is divisive when an American government teacher openly violates 
the law in front of students. It could encourage them to do the same thing," 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Bown told Principal Delores Hendrix that he still would not comply 
with the law, then left the building. Berney Kirkland, spokeswoman for the 
school district, said Bown was suspended with pay. A hearing on Thompson's 
recommendation to fire him will be held within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bown's the best teacher in this school," said Justin Paul Grogan, a 
senior. "He's standing up for what he believes in."

U.S. JUDGE THROWS OUT MUCH OF SOUTH DAKOTA ABORTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has gutted a large part of South Dakota's controversial 1993 
abortion law, saying its requirement for parental notification when an underage 
girl seeks an abortion cannot be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Monday by U.S. District Judge Richard Battey of Rapid City also 
threw out sections of the law dealing with criminal penalties and civil 
lawsuits, saying both would have a chilling effect on the availability of 
abortion services in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said it is legal for the state to require doctors to give women 
information on the medical risks at least 24 hours before an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 No parental notification requirement can be ordered unless the law also allows 
judges to be approached by minors wishing to prove they are mature enough to 
make the decision themselves or that the decision to get an abortion is in the 
minor's best interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned Parenthood and Dr. Buck Williams contested the abortion law last year 
in federal court. Williams, of Sioux Falls, is the only doctor in the state who 
performs abortions.

 Cooler, calmer weather slowed the spread of forest fires in the Northwest, 
helping fire crews extend fire lines and easing the threat to houses. Across 
the West and the Plains, 30 major fires continued burning after charring 
494,000 acres in Washington, Idaho, Montana and Oklahoma, according to the 
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Ida. The weather also helped 
firefighters working on blazes in Washington state, and crews said they were 
within a day of fully containing the month-old Tyee Creek fire, which had 
covered 127,500 acres.

 The elephant that killed a trainer at a show in Honolulu went on a similar 
rampage at a circus in Altoona, Pa., last year, damaging a building and 
terrifying thousands of children, said Ed Migley, owner of the Rhode 
Island-based Circus America. Tyke's handlers said she became agitated when 
someone walked behind her. That also appears to be what set the 9,000-pound 
elephant off at the show in Hawaii.

TRADING ON MISFORTUNE?; DEALERS ARE OFFERING FOOTBALL CARDS AUTOGRAPHED BY 
SIMPSON WHILE IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derrick (DJ) Johnson glanced down at the four plastic-encased trading cards on 
his coffee table and briefly, happily, considered their worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're $1,000 right now, easily," Johnson said, grinning. "By the time the 
trial actually starts, $1,600 to $2,000. And once they're all gone and the 
trial's over, you set the price." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what Johnson is betting. The card collector and dealer will 
not disclose exactly what he paid for the four O.J. Simpson trading cards he 
received from a Washington state dealer Tuesday, but says it was well over $700 
apiece. And he hopes to sell them for much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards are among the first made available from a group of 300 cards 
recently signed by the Hall of Famer as he awaited trial in the June murders of 
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Another 2,500 
cards, also signed by Simpson in jail, are being marketed by a Fleetville, Pa., 
trading card company and are expected to be sold later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's cards, though, along with the other 296 distributed by dealer Darren 
Adams of Washington, are special, they say. Not only were the cards signed by 
Simpson while in custody, they were dated by him and numbered in two groups of 
150 by his agent, Mike Gilbert, and come with a letter of authenticity signed 
by Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,500 cards in the other set are also numbered and dated, a company 
official said, but do not come with a letter of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups of 150 display different photographs of Simpson -- one from his 
USC days, the other from when he played for the Buffalo Bills -- and the 
dealers predict that many collectors will want one of each. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests -- sparked by an ad in a trading card collectors digest -- are 
already pouring into Adams' office in Federal Way, Wash., about 15 miles south 
of Seattle. And many are requesting specific numbers of the run, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been offered $4,000 for the pair of No. 1 or No. 32 (Simpson's jersey 
number)," Adams said. Other people want No. 61, reflecting Simpson's career 
touchdown total, or other numbers correlating to years he broke NFL rushing 
records, won the Heisman Trophy or was inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy was so fanatical," Adams said. "He said he had every article he'd 
read on O.J. from the '60s. He wanted No. 68," the year Simpson won the 
Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 35, said he expects criticism from people who believe he is 
capitalizing on Simpson's situation. To a certain extent, he acknowledges he 
is. But he said, "People want to buy this stuff right now, and you can bet 
they're going to find a place to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 He draws a distinction, though, between what he is doing and the vendors 
hawking T-shirts, bumper stickers, POGs and other Simpson memorabilia outside 
the courthouse where another preliminary hearing in the case was held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, Johnson said, Simpson is profiting too, probably getting at 
least $50,000 -- or $200 a signature. Adams would not disclose the amount of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, Simpson's agent, and Leroy Taft, the sports star's personal attorney, 
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

SENATE OKS BILL ON RIGHTS FOR UNWED COUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate narrowly passed legislation Tuesday night allowing gay and other 
unwed couples to register as domestic partners to obtain limited benefits 
reserved for married people. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) was approved by a 21-17 
vote, the exact majority required in the 40-member Senate, and returned to the 
Assembly for approval of Senate amendments. Gov. Pete Wilson has not taken a 
position on the bill, a spokesman for the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For hours, the bill lingered one vote short of passage. It won approval when 
Democratic Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) left the sickbed where he was 
recovering from surgery and cast the crucial 21st vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (AB 2810) would enable unmarried couples, regardless of sex, to 
officially register their "domestic partnership" with the secretary of state. 
It specifically prohibits any other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Registered domestic partners would be allowed to visit their companions at 
hospitals on the same basis as close family members and would be permitted to 
act as conservators for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very minimal rights. They are rights that every couple, every 
individual, ought to have an opportunity to participate in," said Sen. Gary K. 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, similar legislative efforts have failed, chiefly because of 
opposition from conservative Christians, who say such bills erode legal rights 
traditionally reserved for married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 But this session, Katz and his supporters -- including religious, labor, 
health, civil rights and senior citizens organizations -- changed tactics. They 
marketed the bill as offering a humanitarian hand to unmarried senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said some unmarried elderly people live together for "companionship, 
security and independence." He said they often choose not to marry because that 
would reduce their Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the bill also shifted their lobbying tactics to meet the 
challenge. The Traditional Values Coalition added to its list of moral 
arguments an assertion that the bill would be bad for business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition said the bill may undercut court decisions and result in 
extension of employment-related benefits.

COST HIKES WON'T KILL DISNEY HALL, OFFICIALS SAY; ARTS: LEADERS SAY THE EXTRA 
$50 MILLION CAN BE RAISED, ALTHOUGH SOME VOICE SURPRISE AT THE SIZE OF THE 
INCREASE DISCLOSED MONDAY. DONOR'S FAMILY PLEDGES CONTINUED SUPPORT.

<P>
 While arts and government leaders expressed surprise that the cost of the 
Disney Concert Hall has risen $50 million over original estimates, they voiced 
guarded optimism Tuesday that the extra money could be raised, even in a 
struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors called for a 
detailed explanation of why the price of the new home for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic will rise to $260 million, including a county-financed parking 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surprised and obviously concerned as to the escalating prices," said a 
spokesman for Supervisor Gloria Molina, whose district includes Disney Hall's 
Downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Los Angeles Music Center have attributed the increase to 
rising materials costs and earthquake-related factors, including a shortage of 
qualified bidders for the construction and stronger seismic safety requirements 
for steel-framed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the substantial cost increases, many civic leaders said in interviews 
that they believe the funds will be raised because the project is important to 
improving the image of Los Angeles. They also noted that the project's 
association with the Disney family name will aid in what will still be a 
difficult fund-raising task. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Tuesday, Walt Disney's widow, Lillian B. Disney, pledged the 
family's continued support in seeing the project completed, although they made 
no immediate commitment to further family donations. The project was initiated 
by a 1987 gift of $50 million from Lillian Disney, and since then the family 
gift has grown to $93 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said she is confident that the Music Center, the Philharmonic and other 
supporters will succeed in opening the hall. "I fully expect to play a role in 
assisting . . . in formulating and executing their financial plan for these 
additional funds," she said. "I look forward to being in attendance at their 
first performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of a 2,500-space garage, which is financed with county-issued 
bonds, is nearing completion. Construction of the Frank O. Gehry-designed 
Downtown concert hall was scheduled to begin in mid-1995, financed mainly by 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials cautioned Tuesday that the county was in no position to help 
cover the increased construction costs disclosed Monday by the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina asked for a detailed accounting of the cost overruns, according to her 
press secretary, Robert Alaniz. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the present economy, we are wondering whether they will be able 
to reach their fund-raising goal," he said for Molina, who is vacationing. 
"Keeping in mind that the county is in no position to add funds to the project; 
it looks pretty dry out there now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alaniz said the supervisors were worried about cost overruns when the project 
was in the early planning stages. "Now we are looking at one that is pretty 
sizable," he said, adding that construction delays seem likely to take longer 
than the six months suggested by Music Center officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman emphasized that the financially strapped county cannot 
add funds to the concert hall project. In addition to making the Bunker Hill 
land available and financing the garage, the county has promised to operate and 
maintain the concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't offer any more help there," Edelman said Tuesday. But Edelman 
expressed confidence that private sources will succeed. "This is a problem. 
This is a setback," he said. "But I think it can be overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Koshalek, director of Downtown's Museum of Contemporary Art, said that 
raising the necessary money is "highly possible. It's not easy, it's going to 
be difficult, but I think the Music Center has the leadership strength (to do 
it)."  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critically important building to be built in Los Angeles," he said 
of the avant-garde limestone and steel structure that has been compared to a 
sailing ship. "I feel it is a strong statement of confidence in the city, as 
well as the city's commitment to quality architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Ansbach, president of Sacramento-based Ansbach & Associates, a 
fund-raising and public relations firm, said the Disney cachet could carry the 
project. "Fund raising is built on relationships," he said. "Certainly it has 
been my experience that certain organizations can raise a phenomenal amount of 
money while equally worthy projects (do not). 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A., as much as it has been hit with every possible disaster we could have 
conjured up, still has enormous wealth. There are very few projects that 
community couldn't take on." 
</P>
<P>
 Through a spokesman, Los Angeles Philharmonic chief Ernest Fleischmann and the 
Philharmonic board also expressed optimism. "The Los Angeles Philharmonic has 
been looking forward to occupying this exciting new hall as a willing and 
supportive tenant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hemmings, executive director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, said 
"this doesn't come as a complete surprise to us; we have been aware of problems 
recently. (But) we are confident that the Disney Hall will open in due course."

PROMOTION POLICY STIRS LAPD CLASH; POLICE: COMMISSION HEARS HEATED COMPLAINT 
AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF BERNARD C. PARKS, AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ADVOCATE WHO 
HAS BLOCKED ADVANCEMENTS. HIS ACTIONS HAVE DIVIDED THE RANKS ALONG RACIAL 
LINES.

<P>
 A bitter controversy surrounding the Los Angeles Police Department's 
second-ranking official came to a head Tuesday as critics and supporters of 
Assistant Chief Bernard C. Parks clashed in a tense appearance before the 
Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the LAPD's Narcotics Group, backed by the police union, have 
accused Parks of voiding recent promotions in that unit because the list of 
candidates did not include any women or minorities. Parks, an affirmative 
action proponent who has the backing of many City Council members, acknowledges 
that he blocked the promotions but says he did so because the process for 
picking the candidates was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Los Angeles Police Protective League filed a labor grievance against 
Parks last week, the issue has erupted into a major controversy within Police 
Department ranks, raising deep concerns about the LAPD's affirmative action 
policies, cleaving the department along racial lines and forcing league 
directors to defend themselves against accusations that they are failing to 
represent the interests of their female and minority members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, which represents about 600 African American 
LAPD officers, has urged its members to break with the protective league, while 
some white officers have accused that organization of exaggerating the racial 
dimension of the conflict with Parks in order to politicize what they consider 
a narrow dispute about the Narcotics Group's promotion process. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams was on vacation when the conflict erupted, but 
he was in the office last week, partly to be briefed on the situation, and he 
summoned the principals in the dispute to a meeting in his office Monday. That 
meeting included Parks as well as officials from the Narcotics Group, headed by 
Cmdr. Jimmy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said during Tuesday's commission meeting that he has asked department 
officials to investigate the complaint against Parks, adding that he hopes to 
have an answer within a few days. Once that investigation is complete, Williams 
said, he will make a public recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Williams declined to comment on the accusations, except to 
express his dismay that Parks was being singled out for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it very disturbing to hear this attack on one of the assistant 
chiefs," Williams said during a recess in the hearing. "He was following the 
directions of myself in trying to ensure that the department comply with court 
orders and the direction of the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's meeting was the first time the opposing sides met in public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of narcotics detectives filled the Police Commission hearing room and 
spilled into an adjoining corridor. Several addressed the commission, urging 
the policy-setting civilian panel to review the promotions process in narcotics 
and to question why Parks refused to accept that process in the most recent 
round of promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That process has been used at least the last six or seven times," said 
Detective Bob Baker, a spokesman for the group. "What is it that isn't valid 
about it now that was valid about it earlier?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another detective, Ray Martin, urged commissioners to abide by the 
department's code of conduct and refuse to endorse giving preference to 
minority candidates for jobs. "Stand up and do what's right, for a change," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Hernandez, the general counsel for the Protective League, said officers 
were not trying to level a personal attack at Parks. But he called the 
assistant chief's handling of the promotions process a matter "of extreme 
concern not only to the league but to the entire membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez conceded that some statements on both sides of the debate had raised 
racial tensions -- one league director publicly complained that Parks was 
attempting to embark on "ethnic cleansing" of the department, while Parks 
accused the league board of advocating a narrow view of fairness in part 
because its board has never included women or blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the intense emotions surrounding the allegations, Hernandez urged 
commissioners to conduct an independent investigation into Parks' handling of 
the promotions. Only three of the board's five members were present Tuesday, 
and they did not respond to that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, Sgt. Leonard Ross, president of the Oscar Joel Bryant 
Foundation, accused the narcotics detectives of protesting Parks' actions out 
of a desire to keep black officers from advancing into coveted positions in the 
mostly white unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a nice cozy little home, but it's time for a change," Ross said, 
prompting many of the narcotics detectives to grumble and a few to openly mock 
him. "I recognize the importance of their jobs, but it is time to spread the 
wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross also reiterated his criticism of the league for filing the complaint 
against Parks. "If this is the best job that they (the league) can do, they 
need to step aside," he said. His views were echoed by two other speakers, one 
representing the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and 
another addressing the board on behalf of a coalition of minority employee 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both commended Parks for his actions.

COUNCIL VOTES TO FACILITATE CLEAN NEEDLE DISTRIBUTION; HEALTH: MAYOR IS ASKED 
TO DECLARE AIDS EPIDEMIC A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE LAPD TO 
AVOID ARRESTING ACTIVISTS FOR GIVING OUT HYPODERMICS. 
</P>

 Saying Los Angeles needs to face reality and head off the further spread of 
AIDS, the City Council on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a motion designed to 
stop police from interfering with activists distributing clean needles to drug 
addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 10-1 vote, the council recommended that Mayor Richard Riordan declare the 
AIDS epidemic a state of emergency, a move that would suggest strongly to the 
Los Angeles Police Department that public health outweighs enforcing a law 
against possessing hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about life and death here," said council member Jackie 
Goldberg, who proposed the measure. "This is a health issue." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Riordan said the mayor was reviewing options and had made no 
decision Tuesday. Riordan, who has previously voiced support for "responsible" 
needle distribution, is expected to declare the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said narcotics users who contract the AIDS virus through contaminated 
needles are the top transmitters of the disease to non-drug-using 
heterosexuals. Protecting the needle exchange program, she argued, could help 
keep the HIV virus from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. voted against the declaration. "While we all 
want to turn Los Angeles around in the war on AIDS," he said, "we must not 
shift into reverse in the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Mike Hernandez countered: "Let's choose to deal with our 
realities," adding that thousands of lives are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg pushed for the declaration after activists in Clean Needles Now, who 
were distributing needles in Hollywood, were investigated by police officers 
responding to complaints from critics of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Edgington, who heads Clean Needles Now, said police arrested her June 29 
while she was distributing needles and have been investigating other activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgington said, however, that police have seemed reluctant to enforce the law 
against distributors of clean needles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know we're breaking the law," she said, "but they know it's for the 
greater good." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Police Chief Bernard Parks said the Police Department supports 
Goldberg's recommendation and has always placed little emphasis on interfering 
with needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of needles is very low on the priorities of enforcement," Parks 
said. He added that the department will take legal action only as a "last 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Gov. Pete Wilson has vetoed legislation that would legalize 
needle distribution. In 1993, San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan defied Wilson 
and declared a public health emergency so the city could fund needle exchanges. 
Riordan has written Wilson urging him to reconsider his veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting the declaration at the council meeting were several health experts, 
a member of a Hollywood homeowners association and a Hollywood attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 City AIDS Coordinator Ferd Eggan said Los Angeles has the second-highest 
population of intravenous drug users in the nation, an estimated 200,000. But, 
he said, a remarkably low number of drug users carry HIV, perhaps only 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have before us a tremendous opportunity for prevention," Eggan said.

BITTER BEQUEST; HEIRS, CHARITIES BATTLE OVER FUNDS FREED AFTER 20 YEARS

 Call it the Rip Van Winkle trust. 
</P>
<P>
 It sat for 20 years, waiting for legal complexities to be resolved, and grew 
from $178,000 to nearly $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that growth has triggered a bitter fight among four charities -- including 
the Salvation Army and Guide Dogs for the Blind -- and the relatives of Corinne 
Reisinger, the Marin County woman whose will established the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The charities say all of the money is theirs. The relatives counter that part 
of the money belongs to them and that the charities are only entitled to the 
$160,000 Reisinger specifically left them, plus some interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisinger's relatives -- three of whom live in Long Beach -- went to court in 
January and won a decision supporting their position. The charities say they 
will appeal, prompting Jeffrey E. Ehlenbach, the San Rafael lawyer representing 
Reisinger's relatives to quip: "Guide Dogs bite the hand that feeds them." 
</P>
<P>
 Reisinger's will, written in the late 1960s, specified that the Salvation 
Army, Guide Dogs for the Blind, the Masonic Homes of California's home for the 
aged and the Masonic Homes' home for children each receive $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth charity, the Marin Hospital District, was left $80,000, making the 
total legacy to the charities $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the hospital district, which had once considered joining the 
other charities in the appeal, said the $80,000 plus interest is enough money 
for the district. Nancy P. McCarthy, a district board member, called any appeal 
by the charities a "money grab." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the board before it decided not to join the appeal, McCarthy, 
an attorney, wrote: "I am just dying to know how many people in Marin would 
continue giving to the (hospital district) . . . if they were aware that we are 
fighting the relatives of other devisees in order to obtain money from an 
estate . . . far in excess of the amount specified in the will." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheldon H. Wolfe, the San Francisco attorney representing Guide Dogs for 
the Blind, said the charities' position is not "a grab of any kind. This case 
comes down to a very simple, narrow question of law: Simply, when are the 
rights of beneficiaries of a trust determined?" 
</P>
<P>
 The charities say such rights are determined when the trust ends as directed 
in a will -- 1974 in this case. The relatives, however, argue that those rights 
are only determined when the trust's assets are distributed to the 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisinger's will provided that any money left after the charities received 
their gifts was to be equally divided among the five children of her nephew, 
Ivan P. Wheaton Jr. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisinger died in 1971, and her husband died three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust's assets in 1974, however, were only about $178,000. Nothing would 
have been left for the great-nieces and a great-nephew had the money been 
distributed then. 
</P>
<P>
 And there lies the rub, the key point at the core of the charities' argument 
that all the trust's assets belong to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there was not enough money to give the charities their $240,000, "the 
charities became the owners of the entire assets in the trust," said San 
Francisco attorney Kim T. Schoknecht, who represents the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 A major asset in the trust -- land in the Marin County community of Tiburon -- 
was tied up in lawsuits in 1974. That undeveloped land was "gold," Schoknecht 
said, adding that "Tiburon is to San Francisco what Beverly Hills is to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The charities did not take their money or their interest in the land after 
Reisinger's husband died. Had they done so, they would have become defendants 
in the lawsuits surrounding the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a judge gave Bank of America, the trustee, permission to hang on to 
the trust until the suits were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America sold its trust accounts to Wells Fargo, and the lawsuits over 
the Tiburon land have long since been resolved. In October, Wells Fargo decided 
to distribute the Reisinger trust assets to the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust has more than enough money to pay the charities their $240,000, plus 
about $172,000 in interest, and leave about $481,000 to be divided among the 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charities argued that the bank has merely been taking care of their 
money for the last 20 years. The relatives objected and sought a court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin County Superior Court Commissioner Mary T. Grove agreed with the family 
in January, saying Reisinger wanted "to leave a specific amount to the 
charities and the rest to the relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The four charities plan to appeal Grove's decision because "this is not a case 
where if you snooze, you lose," Salvation Army attorney Schoknecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charities, he said, only allowed the assets to remain with the bank for 
the sake of convenience until the suits over the land in Tiburon could be 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reisinger's intent is crucial, relatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so obvious what Corinne wanted to do with the money," said one of the 
great-nieces, Karen Zeich of Joliet, Ill. "I think it's unconscionable that the 
charities want it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Grove said in an interview that she also believes Reisinger's 
"clear intent was that money go to relatives. This case could have gone either 
way and could still go either way. I just interpreted what I considered the 
will of the testator to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems strange that because there wasn't enough to give (the charities) the 
full amount in 1974, they (would) wind up getting much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Great-niece Gayle Guzman of Long Beach called the charities' appeal 
"aggressive pursuit and bad public relations." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she, her three sisters and her brother are "all just working 
folks. We're not rich charities. We had to go out and hire a lawyer. The court 
rules in our favor and the charities appeal. People won't want to leave money 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Reisinger, who lived in Belvedere, inherited her money from her father, a New 
York photographer who successfully invested in the stock market, relatives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had one brother whose only child, a son, had five children: Guzman, 45, a 
first-grade teacher in Paramount; Zeich, 49, a juvenile counselor; Kristen 
Price, 47, a secretary at the Long Beach Press Telegram; Kurt Wheaton, 36, 
owner of a Long Beach guitar store, and Susan Wells, 32, a homemaker in Bend, 
Ore. Each would inherit about $96,000 if Grove's decision is upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehlenbach, the relatives' attorney, said he has "no argument that if there had 
been a distribution of the trust's assets in 1975, the Wheaton children would 
get nothing. The will said, 'On the death of my husband, distribute.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America could have distributed the property with nothing left for the 
children, Ehlenbach said, "but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 That being the case, he said, nothing that has occurred in the last 20 years 
entitles the charities to more than the amounts left them in the will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corinne was generous," Guzman said. "She put (the charities) before us. Those 
were generous amounts in 1966 when she wrote the will. We feel they're using 
her generosity to pay lawyers to get the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Marin Hospital District board member McCarthy said she was outraged that her 
board was even considering pursuing the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people to do your tax planning around us," McCarthy said. "We'll help 
you write your will. And here we are going after this money on a legal 
technicality. That is bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using well-paid, high-powered attorneys to fight relatives is unseemly. It 
has a chilling effect on people who want to give money to charity." 
</P>
<P>
 Varnum Paul, an attorney who represents Masonic Homes of California, said 
McCarthy and Reisinger's relatives are, in effect, telling the charities: "If 
there is any question about it, you ought to give up your rights because you're 
a charity and you'll look in the eyes of the public as though you're greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My response is that there is not a bit of greed at all. It's a question of 
determining what the rights of the respective parties are." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoknecht said the Salvation Army "obviously doesn't want a reputation as 
being an overly aggressive charity that fights tooth and nail for every nickel. 
They realize that if every time donors name the Salvation Army, they've got a 
guaranteed will contest, donors are going to stop writing wills leaving money 
to the Army." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Salvation Army "rolls over and plays dead every time a disgruntled 
relative believes he or she didn't get what they were entitled to, the donors 
are going to say: 'I'm not going to leave money to the Army if they're just 
going to turn around and give it to my drunk brother-in-law anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Guide Dogs for the Blind has encountered a problem with a will, Wolfe 
said, its attitude has nearly always been: "Let it ride. Let's just forget 
about it because we don't want to be out there looking like a bunch of 
money-grubbers." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Reisinger trust, he said, there is a "matter of principle on a very 
narrow legal issue. The only thing at issue is should we be entitled to that 
money because at the time the trust terminated, there was only enough money to 
not quite pay the charities, and nothing for the family?"

 The Los Angeles City Council approved a new labor agreement Tuesday with 
firefighters and fire captains, who will receive a 7% pay hike over two years 
and a one-time $500 uniform bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the council had agreed to grant the same salary increase that 
police officers will receive. The council later approved a 7% raise for 
officers this year and next.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and fire captains will receive increases of 2% retroactive to 
July 1, another 2% on Jan. 1, 1.5% next July and another 1.5% on Jan. 1, 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Like police and other city employees, firefighters had worked without a raise 
for the last two years.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; MAN GIVEN 
PROBATION IN FEMA QUAKE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man who got federal temporary housing money by falsely claiming he 
lived in a quake-damaged Santa Monica apartment was placed on three years' 
probation and ordered to repay the $2,300. 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Barrett, 57, who was sentenced Monday by a federal judge, is one of 27 
Southern Californians who have been convicted of making false damage claims 
after the magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you knowingly receive government property that's not yours and you convert 
it to your own use, you've committed a crime, the theft of government 
property," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett claimed on a Federal Emergency Management Agency relief form that he 
was living in the Charmont Apartments when the quake hit. He was actually 
sleeping in a friend's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the streets for 20 years," said Barrett, explaining that he 
could not afford first and last months rent and security deposits required by 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the quake I found out you could get on the HUD program right away if 
you were a quake victim. It wasn't the fact I wanted to put in for the benefits 
-- although, sure, I could use the benefits," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an earthquake "victim," he said, "I knew I could get on the HUD program."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BELLFLOWER; POLICY OF 
KEEPING JURORS' NAMES SECRET IS CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles public defender's office has filed a challenge to a Los 
Cerritos Municipal Court judge's unusual policy of keeping secret the names of 
all jurors in all criminal cases tried in the Bellflower courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent petition, the public defender argues that Presiding Judge Philip 
K. Mautino's policy, implemented in January, is not authorized by the state 
Code of Civil Procedure and constitutes a "gross violation" of defendants' 
rights to a fair trial.An Aug. 31 hearing is set in Mautino's court. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino began keeping jurors' names secret to reduce possible fear of threats 
or harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office also has filed a challenge to Downey Municipal 
Judge David Lord's policy of using anonymous panels in every case in his 
courtroom. Lord denied that motion to reveal jurors' names. The public defender 
plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino's use of anonymous panels in every case in the courthouse over which 
he presides may be the only such policy in the country.

 Your tax dollars at work: R. Douglas Collins sent us a travel schedule drawn

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
FIRE CREWS GET OK TO TEST 'SUPERSCOOPER' PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County fire crews were given the go-ahead Wednesday to carry out a 
30-day test of the Canadian "Superscooper" water-dropping plane on Southern 
California wildfires.  
</P>
<P>
 Pilots of the aircraft, officially known as the Canadair Amphibian Air Tanker, 
can dump thousands of gallons of water on wildfires and then refill their tanks 
by landing on the ocean or a lake. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's disastrous wildfires, officials were criticized for passing 
up an opportunity to lease the planes. Some fire experts say the plane's huge 
capacity and quick turnaround time could have made the difference at a number 
of hot spots along the fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, in a unanimous vote, authorized the county Fire 
Department to negotiate an agreement with the province of Quebec to lease a 
Superscooper and hire the necessary ground and flight crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes don't come cheap. A month's rent will cost nearly $250,000, not 
including the $515-per-hour cost of flying the giant plane.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH GATE; TEACHER WHO 
TOOK GUN TO SCHOOL GETS 7 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A kindergarten teacher convicted for bringing a loaded gun to school and 
making terrorist threats against colleagues who turned him in has been 
sentenced to a maximum seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Jett Jr., 36, was arrested Feb. 24 at Montara Street Elementary School 
for having a handgun under the driver's seat of his car in the school's faculty 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He posted $20,000 bail on firearm possession charges and was released that 
afternoon. He was arrested again the next day when he returned to the school 
and threatened to "end the careers" of several teachers and the principal, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, who was convicted on four felony counts July 18 by a Norwalk Superior 
Court jury, began teaching at Montara Elementary in February. He had been 
employed by the school district since 1986, largely as a substitute teacher. 
According to documents submitted in the case, Jett previously had been 
reprimanded for teaching kindergarten classes in camouflage clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrests, a group of parents expressed support for Jett, describing 
him as a fine teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Juliana Dawson declined to comment on Jett's sentencing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; OFFICIALS 
ASK U.S. TO INSPECT SUBWAY-RELATED SOIL SINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two state legislators called Tuesday for federal inspections of the Metro Rail 
subway construction that has caused the ground to sink in a section of 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Transportation Committee, 
asked the Federal Transit Administration to conduct an inspection, and 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) made a similar request to the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Transit Administration has engineers monitoring the subway 
construction, but a spokesman said the agency had not received Katz's request 
and could not respond. There was no immediate response from the Corps of 
Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling was halted Thursday after a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard sank as 
much as nine inches and the Walk of Fame cracked and buckled. MTA officials 
believe the subsidence was caused by water leaks in loosely packed, sandy soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Ed McSpedon, president of the MTA's Rail Construction Corp., said 
in an appearance before the City Council that no decision has been made on when 
tunneling will resume. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of experts has been brought in to assess the project, and additional 
soil tests are being conducted. The MTA is considering injecting grouting into 
the ground to harden it before tunneling proceeds.

DEMAND RELEASE OF EX-BLACK PANTHER LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 protesters stormed Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti's office Tuesday, 
demanding the immediate release of Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt, a former leader of 
the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding signs reading "Free Geronimo," "Pratt -- Freedom Now," and "23 Years 
Is Too Many," the demonstrators chanted in the front reception area of 
Garcetti's office for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 sheriff's deputies escorted them into the hall of the Downtown 
Criminal Courts Building and told them to leave the building. No arrests were 
made. 
</P>

 "They were just demonstrators after a cause," said Evelyn Tapia, Garcetti's 
receptionist. "But I've never seen anything like this in the seven years I've 
worked here." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, the 46-year-old former deputy defense minister of the Black Panther 
Party, is serving a life sentence for the 1968 murder of a schoolteacher during 
a robbery in Santa Monica. His 13th parole hearing is scheduled for today at a 
state prison in Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt contends he was at a Black Panther Party meeting in Oakland at the time 
of the murder and was framed in an FBI effort to undermine radical groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters hoped to influence the district attorney to push for the 
immediate release of Pratt, said Doris Boyd-Snyder, who led the demonstration 
and is vice president of Local 399 of the Service Employees International 
Union.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT, TEACHERS UNION TO MEET WITH MEDIATOR ON DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers union will meet with 
a state mediator today in an attempt to break their deadlocked contract 
negotiations. Both sides have also agreed to enlist a nationally known labor 
arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both sides had earlier agreed to skip mediation, United Teachers-Los 
Angeles President Helen Bernstein said Tuesday that she thought it better "to 
give it a shot. We are not going to invest a lot of time in it, but I do hope I 
can get across to the district that this offer is not OK." 
</P>
<P>
 State mediator Draza Mrvichin, who was involved in talks that preceded the 
1989 teachers strike, will preside over today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and the district have agreed to bring in Thomas Roberts, a labor 
arbitrator who has ruled in landmark cases involving major league baseball, as 
a neutral fact finder. He will study the district's offer to teachers and write 
a report by Sept. 9.

EMERGENCY CHANGE SOUGHT IN CITY'S STEEL-FRAME BUILDING CODE; SAFETY: COUNCIL 
WILL BE ASKED TO ENACT STOPGAP MEASURE PREVENTING NEW CONSTRUCTION OF THE TYPE 
FOUND VULNERABLE IN QUAKES. MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS ARE GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City building officials recommended Tuesday that the Los Angeles City Council 
enact a temporary ordinance to alter the way steel-frame buildings are 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would change part of the building code section governing 
requirements for beam-to-column connections in steel-frame buildings -- the 
major source of problems in such buildings damaged during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been found that the connection doesn't perform adequately, and we don't 
want any additional buildings to be built with this connection," said Richard 
Holguin of the city's building department. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for an emergency design standard, expected to go before the full 
council next week, was made Tuesday during a special meeting of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Earthquake Recovery and was prompted by post-quake inspections 
that found serious problems in the welded connections of steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 110 steel-frame commercial buildings -- most of them in the San 
Fernando Valley and on the Westside -- were damaged during the quake. Another 
900 such buildings could suffer structural damage if there is another major 
quake here, according to the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows at this point that (the current code section) doesn't perform 
to the expectations of the engineering community," Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in steel-frame buildings, horizontal beams and vertical columns are 
welded together. In some buildings, these connections broke or cracked during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsection of the code that would be suspended by the temporary ordinance 
currently allows builders of steel-frame structures to build without conducting 
involved studies and tests to prove that their connections are sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin described the code section as "sort of a cookbook approach to the 
design of that connection. . . . It told you specifically, 'If you do this and 
this, you don't have to go into an elaborate test procedure to show that the 
design will work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would require builders to meet more detailed design 
requirements and perform a more in-depth study of the connections, Holguin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have to prove to the department that the connection will work, 
based on design, based on tests or both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailer Martin, a private structural engineer, showed photographs to the 
committee of welded joints that cracked during the quake. Some cracks were 
three-eighths of an inch long. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 steel-frame buildings Martin has inspected in West Los Angeles and 
in the Valley, he said 21 "have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would only apply to new buildings that have not been 
issued permits, not to existing buildings or those being repaired, Holguin 
said. It would remain in effect for a maximum of a year but would be followed 
by a proposal for permanent changes, Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final answer will depend on some of the testing taking place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, tests on steel-frame buildings are being conducted at UC Berkeley 
and at the University of Texas at Austin.

HOLY CRIME SCENE! 81 STORYBOARDS FOR 'BATMAN' STOLEN FROM STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty-one storyboards planning scenes for an upcoming Batman movie were 
stolen from a locked room at Warner Bros. studios, prompting an internal 
investigation at the Burbank lot, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81 pencil sketches, valued at about $4,000 because of the labor involved 
in producing them, were on 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheets, the size of notebook paper. 
They were stolen between 7:30 p.m. Aug. 18 and 8 a.m. Aug. 19 from Building 34 
on the Warner Bros. lot, Burbank Police Sgt. Leonard Doran said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of illustrators, he said, arrived "in the morning and discovered they 
were gone. There were no signs of forced entry." 
</P>
<P>
 Storyboards are drawings used to plan how scenes will look in a movie, 
sketching the sequence of action to help a movie's creators visualize scenes 
before they are filmed. Thousands of such drawings are needed for a movie, 
according to a Warner Bros. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. representatives had asked Burbank police to keep last week's 
theft secret while the studio launched its own investigation, Doran said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case was included on a list of newsworthy events regularly faxed to 
local newspapers by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police will sometimes honor a crime victim's request for secrecy in a 
case, said Doran, the department's press information officer. But there was 
nothing about the theft of storyboards to warrant secrecy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "From time to time, we've gotten (similar) requests from victims of crime or 
businesses," Doran said. "If it's something they feel is an inside job, they'll 
quietly find out who is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Batman Forever" is scheduled to begin filming in New York on Sept. 24 in 
spite of the theft, said the movie's director, Joel Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the sketches, Schumacher said, will have a minimal effect on 
production. "It's not like we lost the Mona Lisa. It's like losing the napkins 
you drew an idea on the night before. It's a thumbnail rendering of a suggested 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only concern was, did we lose anything irreplaceable and is there any 
damage control we need to know about? No, it's just a little extra work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Batman Forever" is the third feature film about the comic book hero. The cast 
includes Val Kilmer as Batman, Chris O'Donnell as Robin and Jim Carrey and 
Tommy Lee Jones as villains.

SUPERVISORS ORDER REVIEW OF FILM OFFICE AFTER DIRECTOR'S FIRING; SHOW BUSINESS: 
HEAD OF PRIVATE FIRM THAT RUNS THE OFFICE DECLINES TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION FOR 
THE DISMISSAL. INDUSTRY OFFICIALS DENOUNCE HIS ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday ordered a review of 
operations at the county film office after the dismissal last week of its 
popular director. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie H. Liner was fired from her job Aug. 16, surprising many county 
officials and entertainment industry executives who fear the dismissal could 
erode efforts to keep movie and television productions in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The film office issues about 2,800 permits annually for productions to do 
location shots in unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Liner's dismissal was ordered by Gary Conley, president of the private, 
nonprofit Economic Development Corp. that runs the film office under contract 
with the county. Asked to appear at a hearing on the issue Tuesday, Conley 
declined a public explanation of the firing but said he would cooperate with 
any probe of film office operations and would discuss privately the reasons for 
the termination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action I took was not a personal matter but a personnel matter," Conley 
said after repeated and heated attempts by supervisors to get him to explain 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand our responsibility to the county is to manage this office as 
effectively as possible," he said. "We regret a decision of this kind was 
necessary but feel it is in the best interests of all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 But several industry executives who addressed the board Tuesday denounced the 
firing and said it could set back production schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This termination at the peak of the production season raises a host of 
questions," said Jenny Barrett, a representative of the Alliance of Motion 
Picture and Television Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite distressing to all of us," said Frank Scherma, who produces 
commercials for television. "I must convince advertisers to come to L.A., and 
the earthquakes, fires and other disasters have had a negative impact. 
Stephanie had been trying to bring back advertisers and filmmakers to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Liner, who also had won high marks from entertainment industry officials for 
her efforts to ease bureaucratic obstacles and restrictions on filmmaking, said 
it apparently was her support of the merging of the county and city of Los 
Angeles film offices that led to her firing. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors already have approved combining the county office with the 
city's, and the concept is under consideration by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters argue that such a one-stop office would bring coherence to the 
current patchwork of requirements for permits, help reduce fees and expand the 
number of permitted productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the creation of a single-purpose organization that understands 
all the unique aspects of this industry is not only what is wanted by the 
industry but it is also what is needed," Liner wrote in an April memo to a Los 
Angeles city official. 
</P>
<P>
 Liner said the memo was the only explanation that Economic Development Corp. 
officials offered for her firing. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials familiar with the issue say the corporation was concerned 
about revenue losses if the film office is severed. Officials said privately 
that Liner also was openly critical of how the corporation was spending its 
annual revenue of $500,000 and had voiced concern that not enough of it was 
being used to recruit new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley acknowledged Tuesday that the film office has amassed a $118,000 
surplus but said his board thought it prudent to put the money in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, apparently in response to Liner's firing, are mulling the 
idea of creating a film liaison who would be a direct link between the 
supervisors and the entertainment industry and who could, in theory, bypass the 
film office. Several county officials said hiring Liner into the position would 
be a way for supervisors to appease industry executives and send a message to 
the Economic Development Corp. that they are displeased with her firing.

VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK BLAMED ON QUAKE'S DUST CLOUD; HEALTH: RESEARCHERS SAY THE 
VENTURA COUNTY CASES ARE THE FIRST KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO A TEMBLOR. AN L.A. 
COUNTY OFFICIAL DISPUTES THE FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A cloud of dust rising from the Santa Susana Mountains after the Jan. 17 
earthquake may have been responsible for the unprecedented outbreak of valley 
fever that struck Simi Valley and much of eastern Ventura County this spring, 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months of interviews and analysis, scientists at the federal 
Centers for Disease Control have concluded that residents caught in the dust 
cloud were most likely to contract the flu-like ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe that disease-bearing spores were stirred up by landslides 
caused by the quake and its aftershocks, then swept with the wind across the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spores are often in the ground, but they're pretty much just sitting 
there," said Richard Spiegel, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. 
"Basically from all the ground shaking, that unleashed significantly more dust 
than you might normally have." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 203 cases of valley fever were diagnosed among Ventura County 
residents in the weeks after the quake. That compares to 52 cases for all of 
1993. A 71-year-old Simi Valley man died in the 1994 outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC team will declare the Simi Valley outbreak the first known to be 
related to an earthquake when it presents its conclusions at a Stanford 
University conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for Los Angeles 
County, disputed the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 'Piddle paddle," Fannin said. "I have to tell you I disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley, hardest hit by the magnitude 6.8 quake, saw little 
change in its rate of disease, she said. Only 46 cases have been reported this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease, a fungal infection known to scientists as coccidioidomycosis, 
manifests no real symptoms in about 60% of cases. Other victims experience 
flu-like exhaustion, coughing, even high fever and pneumonia. Older people are 
usually more severely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin believes that Ventura County and the CDC overreacted to the valley 
fever scare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called everything with a positive lab test for antibodies a case of 
valley fever," she said. She explained that tests would have been positive if a 
patient had contracted the illness any time in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials do not count a case as valley fever until 
further tests or active symptoms confirm the disease, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC researchers defended their findings, saying all of the Ventura County 
cases were confirmed with blood tests. The direction of the wind or the amount 
of fungus found in the paved-over San Fernando Valley could account for the low 
incidence there, said Eileen Schneider, a CDC epidemiologist in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of the Valley did not 
experience the same landslide activity that occurred in the Santa Susana range 
near Simi Valley. Although the northern edge of the Valley also borders the 
Santa Susanas, winds were blowing toward Simi Valley after the quake, Schneider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake and each of its aftershocks brought up a cloud of ocher dust from 
the canyons around Simi Valley. The highest concentrations of valley fever 
cases occurred in the neighborhoods near the base of the mountains north of the 
city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A map hanging in Ventura County's Public Health Services Department shows 
graphically how valley fever spores may have spread. Dozens of pushpins are 
clustered in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The pins fan out on a southwest course, with several cases in Thousand Oaks, 
and thin out farther from the mountains on the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County and CDC officials believed from the start that the earthquake 
had kicked off the valley fever outbreak, but conducted tests this spring aimed 
at proving their theory. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked valley fever victims if they had been in a dust cloud, and more 
than a third responded that they had. 
</P>
<P>
 They tested a random sample of the Simi Valley population for overall exposure 
to the fungus causing valley fever and found fewer than 6% had been exposed. 
They tracked the cases and found that the incidence of the disease returned to 
normal levels about two months after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they studied the age, race and other demographic factors for victims 
and found nothing to suggest another reason for the outbreak, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes it name from the San Joaquin Valley, where it is most 
commonly found.

SMALL BUSINESS LOAN PROCESS DRAWS CROOKS; CRIME: SOME PACKAGERS USE PHONY TAX 
RETURNS, CHARGE HIGH PRICES FOR A COMPLICATED JOB, FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This week's arrest of six people indicted for allegedly making false 
statements on their income tax forms to obtain Small Business Administration 
loans has shed new light on the fast-growing but unregulated business of loan 
packagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many loan packagers -- independent consultants who help put together SBA 
applications for a fee -- are legitimate and perform a useful service, 
officials say. But some unscrupulous operators are being blamed by the agency 
for many fraudulent loan applications that have led to a rash of SBA loan 
defaults -- particularly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the problems we have with (phony) tax returns are with loan 
packagers," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general for the SBA in 
Washington, whose probe of loan packagers and fraud in California has extended 
to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The six indicted, including two couples, are Giam Buu Truong of Fountain 
Valley; Long Chan Quach, formerly of Cerritos and now of Pinellas Park, Fla.; 
Meng Hong Phou and Lim Chou of Colton, Calif., and Harris Hoang and Linh Diep 
of Irvine. All except Quach were arrested and arraigned on Monday and have been 
released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA investigators say that a slender, middle-aged man from Westminster put 
together SBA applications on behalf of the six defendants, none of whom have 
been available for comment. The six borrowed a total of almost $1 million worth 
of government-backed loans. SBA investigators now say that false tax returns -- 
with inflated income figures and false invoices -- were used to apply for the 
loans, all of which ultimately went into default. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the loan packager has not been disclosed because he is still 
under investigation, allegedly having had a hand in a dozen additional 
SBA-guaranteed loans that went sour. But officials say he is just one of eight 
loan packagers on the West Coast who are at the center of the SBA's three-year 
investigation involving more than 100 troubled loans. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA investigators say they expect some of these packagers, as well as other 
borrowers who allegedly participated in filing fraudulent applications, to be 
prosecuted soon. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many packagers of SBA loans operate in California or 
elsewhere, because the industry is unregulated and anyone can do it. In fact, 
accountants, financial planners, unemployed bank employees and even real estate 
brokers looking to supplement their incomes have long helped potential 
borrowers assemble parts or all of the voluminous materials that must accompany 
an SBA application. The SBA estimates it takes about 21 hours, on average, to 
complete the task.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the past few years, as the volume of SBA loans has surged and 
conventional lending has dwindled, the number of people specializing in 
packaging SBA loans has swelled -- and so have the allegations of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe fraud related to loan packagers will likely cost 
taxpayers and SBA-participating banks tens of millions of dollars. The problem 
is acute in Southern California because these packagers have also tapped into 
federal disaster loans after the riot and earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the packagers under investigation are said to have drawn customers 
from immigrant communities where some business people have language barriers 
and are unfamiliar with U.S. lending practices and thus are likely to seek out 
such consultants. All six of the people indicted this week, and the Westminster 
loan packager, are Southeast Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a more extensive problem in ethnic communities," said Deborah 
Jones, a special agent at the SBA inspector general's office in Los Angeles, 
which is conducting the investigation. Jones said most of the other packagers 
who are under scrutiny also worked in immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles with some loan packagers have cast a cloud on the legitimate 
ones.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stultz, a Newport Beach consultant who has been packaging SBA loans for 
20 years, says he knows of nearly two dozen people in Southern California whose 
main business is packaging SBA loans. Stultz, who does most of his work on 
referrals from banks, says he put together 120 such applications last year, 
charging on average a flat fee of between $1,000 and $2,000 for each. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the packager who aided the six business people recently indicted 
allegedly received a 3% commission on the loans his clients received -- or 
almost $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers and SBA officials agree there is a need for loan packaging consultants 
because people often have trouble putting together the applications on their 
own. They "have done a lot more good than bad," said Steve Mattern, senior vice 
president of Truckee River Bank in Northern California, one of the state's 
largest SBA lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattern is a member of a national task force, which includes SBA officials, 
that is studying whether to establish standards or regulations for loan 
packagers. Mattern believes some standards are needed, but he also says banks 
and other commercial lenders themselves need to monitor the applications 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the driver's seat," said Mattern. "I'm not captive to any packager." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the SBA began its investigation in 1991, Truckee and other banks in 
California have been cross-checking tax returns filed by SBA applicants against 
filings with the Internal Revenue Service. That step, which is likely to be 
taken on a nationwide basis as an SBA requirement, has cut down on the number 
of false tax returns submitted, bank officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that has not completely stopped the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 David Scherer, senior vice president of the Bank of Yorba Linda, one of Orange 
County's largest SBA lenders, said his bank has been cross-checking all of the 
SBA applications with the IRS for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Yorba Linda does not deal much with applications packaged by outside 
consultants, he said, because its bank employees do the packaging work for 
applicants for a flat fee of $600. Even so, in the last 12 months, out of about 
65 completed SBA applications, two or three of them contained false tax return 
information, Scherer said.

BY INVESTORS CLAIMS THAT UP TO $100 MILLION HAS BEEN LOST. OFFICIALS FROM TMI 
WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT.

<P>
 A lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that a real estate investment fund that raised 
as much as $1 billion from 60,000 California educators has lost up to $100 
million of the investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers Management & Investment Inc. of Newport Beach, a 26-year-old fund 
marketed by teachers for teachers across the state -- may be insolvent, 
according to the suit, which was filed in Orange County Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks immediate appointment of a receiver to run the company, which 
invests educators' retirement funds in dozens of real estate limited 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think TMI has degenerated into a Ponzi scheme," said Ron Rus, attorney for 
the four investors who filed the suit. "Some of the partnerships have property 
that has become worthless, and they are now using money from the good ones to 
keep the bad ones going." 
</P>
<P>
 TMI officials could not be reached for comment on the allegations. An employee 
at the company's headquarters said the firm's general partners, James R. Martin 
and Maurice Shuman, were traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman's wife, reached late Tuesday at the couple's Newport Beach home, said 
that her husband was traveling and that she did not have a number where he 
could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 interview with The Times, Shuman noted with pride, "In its 20 years, 
TMI has never had an investor lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI officials lost millions of dollars of investors' 
money in a "systematic and increasingly sophisticated pattern of prohibited 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the firm erected an elaborate maze of bankruptcy 
filings for its 40 or more limited partnerships and commingled funds in what 
amounted "to a Ponzi scheme undermining the security of possibly as much as $1 
billion in retirement funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit also accuses TMI of fraud, breach of contract, 
misrepresentation and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't put the money we paid where it was supposed to go," said Jean M. 
Sweeney of Fullerton, one of the investors who filed the suit. She and her 
husband, Jack, a professor at Fullerton Community College, invested $530,000 of 
their retirement funds in about two dozen TMI partnerships, she said. Jean 
Sweeney said it is unclear what her nest egg is now worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rus said the allegations in the suit have been sent to the state Department of 
Corporations, which regulates firms that sell limited partnership investments.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the department investigated complaints by former TMI employees and 
sales agents alleging that the firm -- then under different ownership -- 
underreported sale prices of properties to its investors to mask more than $3.5 
million in excessive real estate brokerage commissions. After a two-year 
inquiry, the department found no violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI has nothing to do with the State Teachers Retirement System, the state 
pension fund for California educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned TMI, formed in 1968 by a group of educators and real estate 
specialists, has been a vehicle for teachers and school administrators to 
sweeten their retirement funds. The money, invested through self-directed 
individual retirement accounts, has gone mainly into real estate partnerships, 
though the company also offers other investments such as mutual funds, stocks 
and bonds. The firm's motto is "Teachers Helping Teachers," and its symbol is a 
shiny red apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has supplemented its staff by hiring educators who moonlight as 
sales agents. In recent years, investors other than educators have been invited 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state's real estate market was booming during the 1970s and '80s, 
TMI investors saw annual returns that went as high as 30%. But when the market 
collapsed in the late 1980s, those handsome returns ended, according to Kay 
Seibert of Anaheim Hills, a retired college business professor who has $50,000 
of her retirement funds in TMI properties and is one of the four investors 
suing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI's real estate pools own land that cost far more 
than it is worth today and that, in some cases, loans have been refinanced 
several times so that the property is now highly leveraged. Martin and Shuman, 
both accountants, have owned the firm since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after putting some of its partnerships into bankruptcy, the suit states, 
TMI has continued to ask investors to put more money into the failed ventures, 
saying that may help them recoup their lost funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that TMI's general partners set up private management 
companies to which the firm paid large sums for services -- allegedly paying 
themselves millions of dollars a year more than the management fees stipulated 
in various partnership agreements and prospectuses. How TMI Works 
</P>
<P>
 * Property pools: When high interest rates and rising prices during the 1980s 
made it difficult for developers to buy and hold large chunks of property, 
syndicates were formed to raise money from investors and use the funds to buy 
land, improve it and then sell it at a profit to developers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eye on educators: As a syndicator, Teachers Management & Investment Corp. of 
Newport Beach targeted teachers as potential investors and eventually enlisted 
more than 60,000 educators in its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting in on the action: When TMI began, investors paid $500 a share for 
stakes in real estate holdings such as raw land or commercial establishments 
such as hotels or business centers. Eventually shares went to $1,000 each.  
</P>
<P>
 * Reaping returns: Investors also made additional regular contributions to the 
pool to pay for improvements on the properties. When the real estate was sold 
or developed, the teachers shared the proceeds after a load, or sales charge, 
was deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hitting a snag: TMI's holdings declined dramatically in value during the 
real estate downturn, a group of investors says in a lawsuit. The group accuses 
the syndicate's managers of using income from some holdings to cover losses on 
others. TMI's general partners could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit, 
filed Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana.

SYSTEMED SUED BY SHAREHOLDER OVER 'POISON PILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SysteMed Inc. is being sued by a shareholder who contends the company's board 
is unfairly deterring potential takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks class-action status, asks the Delaware Chancery Court in 
Wilmington to revoke the shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," adopted by 
the board on Aug. 17.Poison pills are designed to make hostile takeovers 
prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Thursday, also attacks an amendment to SysteMed's bylaws, 
enacted the same day, that limits who may call a special meeting of the 
company's stockholders. It names SysteMed and its board members as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholder, Croyden Associates, whose SysteMed stake was not disclosed, 
claims board members are seeking to protect their jobs at the expense of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at SysteMed headquarters in Laguna Hills said the company has no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 SysteMed, a manager of prescription drug programs, has not said what triggered 
its board's actions, but on Aug. 5 a financing unit for National Intergroup 
Inc. took a 6.3% stake in SysteMed and said it may seek control, according to 
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Intergroup then lifted its stake to 7.8%, or 1.68 million shares, on Aug. 12. 
Intergroup, which is based in Carrollton, Tex., distributes a line of 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug makers Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co. and SmithKline Beecham Plc have 
recently paid hefty premiums to acquire drug claim managers such as SysteMed. 
The drug companies see the acquisitions as a way to control distribution to 
large buyers of pharmaceuticals, such as managed-care plans.

IBM TO CUT PC PRICES TO MATCH COMPAQ'S MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. is expected to slash prices today on 
many of its personal computer products, with cuts of up to 25% as a 
much-anticipated price war begins, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will be the first major computer vendor to slash prices in response to a 
move by Compaq Computer Corp. Last week, Houston-based Compaq, the nation's 
leading seller of personal computers, announced price cuts of between 11% to 
22%.Analysts said the IBM cuts will be on selected models across the board with 
the exception of ThinkPad notebook computers and its PS/1 line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kirkey, vice president for sales and marketing at Advanced Logic Research 
Inc. in Irvine, said the price cuts reflect declining prices for the central 
processing chips around which personal computers are built. 
</P>
<P>
 ALR's desktop PCs are already priced below comparable IBM and Compaq machines, 
Kirkey said, and his company does not plan to lower prices further in response 
to moves by the other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for AST Research Inc., one of the world's leading manufacturers of 
desktop PCs, which also is based in Irvine, said Tuesday that the company had 
no comment on the expected price cuts by IBM.

CAKE DECORATING GOES HIGH TECH AT ANAHEIM TRADE SHOW; INNOVATION: MACHINE PUTS 
PHOTO IMAGES ON FOODS. OTHER EXHIBITS INCLUDE EDIBLE BUSINESS CARDS, 
PERSONALIZED CANDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Kitos thinks he has a simple recipe for success. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Huntington Beach resident has blended a central processing 
unit, a photograph scanning device and an ink-jet printer to produce a cake 
decorating machine that scans color photographs and produces high-resolution -- 
and highly edible -- images on cakes and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Edison machine shop inspector began toying with ideas 
for a cake-decorating machine four years ago. His company now hopes to begin 
delivering the $18,500 machines in the fall for sale to bakeries and grocery 
stores. Kitos said several companies have expressed interest, including a 
pastry chef at one of Orange County's large hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitos was among dozens of exhibitors showing their wares Tuesday at 
Confections West, a cake and candy trade show at the Disneyland Hotel. The 
computerized cake-decorating machine was part of a growing trend among 
confection industry players to offer consumers added value for their money -- 
and, in the process, allow retailers to bolster profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 One row over from Kitos' high-tech exhibit, Norma Parrish demonstrated a 
silk-screening system that uses a syrupy chocolate concoction to customize 
candy and cakes with edible designs and slogans. Parrish's fourth-generation, 
Gardena-based company has sold the screening technology to politicians, resorts 
and a handful of companies that use it to produce edible business cards made of 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Gorman Inc., a food broker in Tustin that represents dozens of gourmet 
confection companies, exhibited a machine that lets retailers customize 
coin-shaped, foil-wrapped chocolates with imprints of customers' names or 
images. Again, the intent is to give retailers an added value to pass along to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the closing day of the trade show, Kitos' machine pumped out hundreds of 
edible pictures atop small slices of cake for bemused conventioneers, who lined 
up with drivers' licenses and baby pictures in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine, about the size of an office printer, scans and digitizes 
photographs. A full-color ink-jet printer hidden in a mechanical arm applies 
the decoration using a proprietary blend of food dyes that are approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to operate than a bank ATM, and it can decorate anything from a 
tortilla to a six-inch-tall cake," said Gordon McGilton, a former TRW executive 
and Kitos' business partner.

 Starship Supplies: One "Star Trek" fan is hoping that fellow Trekkies will 
boldly go where they've never gone before: The Trekker, a new Santa Ana shop 
featuring memorabilia from the various "Star Trek" TV shows and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trekker "goes beyond the usual assortment of plastic figures and ship 
models available in toy stores," said head Trekkie Jerry Lazar, who opened the 
shop after leaving a career in the escrow business."We've gathered a variety of 
items of interest to the adult fan that could previously be found only at 'Star 
Trek' conventions or via mail order." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from 75 cents for a Klingon bookmark to $750 for a lithograph 
signed by Patrick Stewart, the actor who plays Capt. Jean-Luc Picard in "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, 40, said he has been a Trekkie since he was 12 years old. He decided to 
change careers, he said, because "I was looking for something that would allow 
me to be 12 years old again."
