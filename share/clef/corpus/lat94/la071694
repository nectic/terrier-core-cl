HUFFINGTON SAYS HIS SPENDING TOPS $9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Huffington, the multimillionaire Republican challenger to U.S. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, reported Friday that he has spent more than $9 million of his 
own money in the campaign so far, closing in on another national record for 
political spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal campaign finance statements filed Friday also show that the 
freshman congressman from Santa Barbara has opened a wide financial lead over 
Feinstein, who is herself one of the top fund-raisers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Huffington's campaign has totaled about $9.5 million, with all but 
about $300,000 coming from the candidate's pocket. In contrast, Feinstein's 
rigorous coast-to-coast fund-raising schedule, which started more than a year 
ago and has included two major events with President Clinton as host, has 
generated about $5.9 million in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent almost all of his $9 million between Jan. 1 and June 30, the 
closing day of the report, while Feinstein has only spent about $3 million this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, whose fortune comes from his family's Texas petroleum company, had 
been expected to spend more than Feinstein during the spring because he faced 
former GOP Rep. William E. Dannemeyer in the June 7 primary. He was also 
largely unknown in California and he needed extensive use of television 
commercials to make himself competitive with the well-known Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when both campaigns unleashed their heaviest barrage of television 
commercials beginning in early June, Huffington maintained a sizable spending 
advantage over Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six-week period covered by the latest reports, from late May through 
the end of June, Huffington spent more than $100,000 per day, compared to about 
$62,000 per day for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 1, Huffington's campaign has averaged about $50,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington is currently about $1 million short of the national record for the 
most personal money ever spent by a candidate for Congress, according to Common 
Cause, a Washington-based watchdog group for campaign finance. That record was 
set in 1984 when Democrat John D. Rockefeller IV, scion of his 
great-grandfather's oil empire, spent about $10.2 million from his pocket to 
win a seat in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington "has bragged that he will spend whatever it takes," said Feinstein 
campaign manager Kam Kuwata. "People didn't think earlier this year that he 
would spend $20 or $30 million (by November's election), but when push has come 
to shove . . . he has basically spent $10 million (so far). And it is generally 
thought that candidates spend significantly more in the general (election) than 
they do in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see him spending, out of his own pocket, more money than the combined 
total of (both candidates in) the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be about $25.9 million, a record established in 1984 by the race 
between Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and then-Gov. Jim Hunt. Whether Huffington 
breaks that record by himself or not, most political observers expect that his 
race against Feinstein will make the record books. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has committed to spending a minimum of $15 million in his campaign 
and he has said the amount could exceed $20 million. Friday, Huffington's 
campaign declined to comment on the finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the numbers speak for themselves," said Huffington campaign manager 
Bob Schuman. "I'm just not going to comment on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 46, already holds the record for the most expensive U.S. House 
race in history. In 1992, he more than doubled the previous high by spending 
about $5.2 million of his own money to unseat veteran GOP Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, Huffington's money has changed the race from an 
anticipated sure thing for Democrats into one of the nation's most competitive 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
 In late May, when a series of statewide polls revealed that the race had 
become extremely competitive, political observers in California and Washington 
expressed shock. Both campaigns have been advertising on television almost 
nonstop ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, in a breakfast meeting with reporters, Feinstein said her 
campaign wanted to respond to Huffington's springtime television ads -- most of 
which attacked her record in Washington -- but did not have the money.

EMOTIONS SPILL FORTH IN LETTERS SENT TO SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The emotions, spilled single-spaced across five pages of ruled yellow paper, 
are heartfelt, almost raw. The earnestness borders on the desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never . . . have I felt so much empathy for anyone in my life," begins the 
letter, one of tens of thousands sent to O.J. Simpson as he sits in a Los 
Angeles County jail cell. "I pray God will let this letter reach you." 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the personal, even intimate tone of many of the letters, the 
48-year-old Vermont woman matter-of-factly refers to her 13 years as a battered 
wife and describes the happiness she found with her fourth husband, her 
childhood sweetheart. She tells the former football player and movie actor 
about her four children, one of whom once finished third in a beauty contest, 
and her two surgeries for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she invites Simpson to visit when he is out of jail and to bring his 
children. "You will feel loved and unencumbered," the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson has not yet seen that letter, his attorneys have been 
delivering a small fraction of his mail each day to his cell, where he awaits 
trial in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the murders more than a month ago, the Simpson case has been a 
collective experience for the American people, with millions of people getting 
caught up in the drama of a charismatic sports hero who had been welcomed into 
their living rooms for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters reveal the emotional depth those events have plumbed in the 
psyches of people ranging from a convict in a Florida prison who addresses 
Simpson as "brother" to a Long Island, N.Y., nun who sent the wealthy former 
athlete a $10 check to help cover legal bills; from a 6-year-old Pasadena boy 
who said he prayed for police to find the true killer to a Miami woman who 
wrote that "even if you did commit the crime I am still in support of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some letters, mostly from men, urge Simpson to confess. The vast majority of 
the letters are from women. Some proselytize. In one, the writer wonders if 
Simpson recalls running into him when the writer was getting off the No. 15 bus 
on Kearney Street in San Francisco in the late 1970s. Most reveal profound 
loneliness, sadness, religious zeal and love. 
</P>
<P>
 With the permission of Simpson's defense lawyer, The Times was allowed to read 
several hundred missives at random from a small mountain of mail that included 
25 cardboard boxes and nine large-sized garbage bags -- only a small part of 
all that has come in. The mail included numerous Bibles, inspirational books, 
videotapes, recorded cassettes, photographs, drawings, a set of pressed cotton 
handkerchiefs and birthday cards from all over the United States and some 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service Terminal Annex in Downtown, where mail comes for 
prisoners throughout the county jail system, is receiving 1,500 to 2,000 pieces 
a day for Simpson, requiring one or two extra clerks for processing, a 
spokesman said. The volume is so great that jail officials turn all of the mail 
over to Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's attorney, rather than delivering it to him 
in his seven-by-nine-foot cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail addressed to Simpson is also going directly to Shapiro's office, to the 
San Francisco 49ers, the last team Simpson played for, and to the Los Angeles 
Police Department, some in care of Chief Willie L. Williams. The proper address 
is O.J. Simpson, No. 4013970, Los Angeles County Jail, P.O. Box 86164, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90086-0164. 
</P>
<P>
 Some letters, Shapiro said, are from investigators, attorneys and even experts 
in dog behavior who want to help in the defense effort. Others purport to offer 
evidence in the case. The mail has to be sorted, he said, because "there might 
be one person who saw something who is writing a letter" that might provide 
helpful evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Five law students have been enlisted to help with that task, after which all 
but the small percentage of letters that attack Simpson are given to him a few 
at a time to read. Some of the letters, such as one that was unsigned without a 
return address, urge Simpson to "Be a Real Man. Tell the Truth." One demands 
the death penalty if he is found guilty. Some are obscene. A few attack 
Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 One letter sent from Arizona recounted a dream in which the writer saw a 
"mean-looking white man" with a "dirty, stubbly face" fighting with Nicole 
Simpson. A Mailgram from Gary, Ind., says ominously that "your freedom may rely 
on contacting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Most letters, however, are written as if to an old friend. Some are tinged 
with hopes of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's me again," starts a letter from a woman in Montgomery, Ala., who 
enclosed blank paper and an envelope in hopes of receiving a reply. She asks 
Simpson, at his next court appearance, to "show me your beautiful smile a 
little more . . . or a wink at the camera would be even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Halford Fairchild, a social psychologist who teaches at Pitzer College in 
Claremont, said that most people who write such letters are troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because our own lives are, for the most part, comparatively empty, without 
direction and meaningless we obtain gratification . . . vicariously" by 
reaching out to celebrities, said Fairchild. "How can any rational person 
expect O.J. to come visit them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The response is particularly strong in the case of Simpson, he said, because 
he has projected a positive image during his various careers as an athlete, 
actor, sports commentator and pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see O.J. going through these very troubling times . . . we see 
ourselves, just regular folks, going through some troubling times" as well, 
Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many of the letters recount tales of woe that would have caused Job's 
faith to waver. 
</P>
<P>
 An Alabama woman, explaining her letter, writes that "I wanted to share with 
you a little of what I have been through and let you know there is a mighty 
force that can help you." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband founded a sausage factory that was generating $6 million 
annually in sales when he was hit by an electric shock. Depression and the loss 
of the business followed. Then the couple's son contracted leukemia and 
eventually died. The family lost its 7,000-square-foot mansion and moved into 
public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard, I mean extra hard," she writes. "If we had not had Jesus . . . 
we would be dead and buried today." 
</P>
<P>
 In one four-page handwritten letter, a mother from Stamford, Conn., describes 
how her son was arrested for beating his wife. "The problem was that he was too 
sensitive and too kind to her. That was his only crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Edward Stainbrook, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at USC and an expert 
in the cultural influences on behavior, said the letters to Simpson are 
overwhelmingly positive because those who write identify with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us have . . . an unspoken sin in our lives . . . and so we tend to 
identify with someone who has been apprehended for something sinful or 
wrongful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another aspect of it, he said, is that the writers perceive that "this is 
somebody who is getting a raw deal . . . and therefore you are going to help" 
by writing. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes through in the way the various characters in this drama are 
portrayed in most of the letters. The prosecutors are condemned. Simpson and 
his attorneys are beloved, as is Al Cowlings, who was accused of abetting his 
escape the day he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the letters are emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 A July 4 letter from Boston is one paragraph and includes a crisp $5 bill. 
"Your Independence Day is closer than you might think," it says. "On the Day 
You Are set free, Please have a beer on me." 
</P>
<P>
 A letter written by a woman from the Bronx expresses simply the fascination 
felt by many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't seem to get you out of my mind," she writes. "I'm finding it 
difficult to focus on anything."

COLUMN ONE; WHEN THE LAWYER'S BILL IS OUT OF BOUNDS; A RISE IN REPORTS OF 
OVERCHARGING HAS RAISED CONCERN. MOST ATTORNEYS ARE CONSCIENTIOUS, OFFICIALS 
SAY, BUT THE PRESSURE TO PUSH UP FEES IS HIGH. 
</P>

 Randy Blim winced as he pored over the legal bills in his Hollywood office. 
Tens of thousands of dollars in charges had almost no documentation. When he 
called his firm's respected New York lawyer for an explanation, the attorney 
brushed him off as a rube. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what you get when you hire a big New York City law firm," Blim said 
the lawyer chided him good-naturedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Blim backed off but resented the lawyer's superiority. He would later learn 
that the lawyer had, among other things, dined at client expense at the 
priciest of restaurants and charged the Hollywood post-production company for a 
female friend to accompany him on a business trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Blim's dilemma is not uncommon, according to legal fee auditors. Clients often 
hesitate to challenge their lawyers' bills because they are uncertain about how 
much such services should cost and, more significantly, fear alienating a hired 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal consultants say there are plenty of reasons for clients to worry. 
Many lawyers inflate their bills, whether by charging $1 a page for a facsimile 
that costs the firm 15 cents or by charging for a paralegal when the work was 
performed by a lesser-paid secretary. In some cases, the offenses are more 
egregious. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the American Bar Assn. acknowledges the problem. "One major factor 
contributing to the discouraging public opinion of the legal profession," the 
association wrote in guidelines issued in December, "appears to be the billing 
practices of some of its members." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-eight percent of 270 lawyers responding to a 1991 survey of a 
cross-section of the American Bar acknowledged that clients are occasionally 
billed for work not performed, and 17% admitted they had charged more than one 
client for the same work. Most common, according to fee auditors, are charges 
for unnecessary work or for training less-experienced lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lawyers are conscientious, said Lawrence J. Fox, an ABA official who 
helped write the overbilling guidelines, but the pressure to bill hours, 
combined with the economic downturn, has "created an environment" that may 
encourage some lawyers to bill for more hours than they work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of reported instances of billing abuses has increased," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 billing disputes in California were assigned to private 
arbitrators last year. In one small program run by the State Bar, California 
lawyers were found to have overcharged last year in at least 33% of 128 
disputed cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in April castigated the prestigious Los Angeles law firm of 
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for charging for repetitive and unnecessary work and 
excessive hours in a bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly galling to the judge: Gibson's $99,000 charge for time spent 
preparing its bill. The firm launched an internal investigation of the case. 
"We are certainly looking at what happened," said Gibson managing partner 
Ronald Beard. He said he knew of no past instances of overbilling. "This is the 
only time I'm aware of" such a problem, he said, adding that the lawyer who 
oversaw the case left the firm last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the nation's top law enforcement officers was implicated in 
overbilling. Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell resigned this year amid 
reports that his former Little Rock firm was investigating him for inflating 
his legal charges in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Laser-Pacific Media Corp., lawyer Lewis Eslinger had initially impressed 
executives, including Blim, a senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 A hefty man with silver-streaked hair combed straight back and monogrammed 
shirts, Eslinger oozed confidence and competence, Laser-Pacific executives 
said. He also possessed a credential that meant a lot to the Hollywood company: 
He had represented Sony, an industry giant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Laser's new attorneys, Eslinger was supposed to prevent 
competitors from infringing on its patent for converting video from the 
American television standard to the European standard. He filed lawsuits 
against the competitors on Laser's behalf, and they, in turn, filed 
counterclaims against Laser. 
</P>
<P>
 His bills, "reasonable" at first, became "enormous" as the months stretched 
into nearly two years, Blim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no itemized breakdown of the bills, just line items with the dates 
and a big dollar amount," Blim recalled, sitting in his modest office, where 
cardboard boxes of legal files line one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser-Pacific lost its patent battle. A federal judge ruled that the patent 
was invalid, forcing Laser to spend more than $1 million to settle its 
competitors' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling from the losses, the company eventually instructed the Los 
Angeles-based firm of Kindel & Anderson to sue Eslinger and his law firm, 
Cooper & Dunham, for malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is an example of a client who really got intimidated by his 
lawyer," said Manuel Klausner, Laser's attorney in the malpractice action. 
</P>
<P>
 Eslinger should have told his client that he had qualms about the strength of 
its case, Klausner said, so the company could have settled and avoided losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eslinger, reached in New York, declined to comment, citing the pending 
litigation. His lawyer in the case also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing for the lawsuit, filed in January, 1993, Klausner and his 
colleagues eventually obtained the receipts for Eslinger's expenses -- which 
were later entered into court records. 
</P>
<P>
 They were staggered by some of the charges. While visiting Los Angeles, the 
lawyer and others had dined lavishly at Laser-Pacific's expense -- L'Orangerie, 
$561, Jimmy's, $474, L'Ermitage, $306. 
</P>
<P>
 He had racked up a $547 charge for dinner for nine at a New York restaurant 
and played golf in Phoenix at the company's expense, although Laser-Pacific had 
no business there. 
</P>
<P>
 He also submitted charges for air fare for the female friend and hotel, rental 
cars and groceries for his wife, according to Laser's new lawyers, and billed 
the company $116 for a Chinese takeout meal delivered to his house. 
</P>
<P>
 For one day, Eslinger billed Laser-Pacific and other clients a total of 25 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn depositions, Eslinger said he had inadvertently charged Laser-Pacific 
for some expenses, but properly charged the company for meals where Laser's 
case had been discussed. He could not always remember, however, who had dined 
with him on those occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he tabulated his expense charges while watching television," Klausner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eyes of Barry Kaiman, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Eslinger's 
firm, the dispute boils down to "an unhappy client trying to shoot the 
messenger that brought the bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiman refused to comment on the propriety of the bills, but said 
Laser-Pacific had disputed only $17,000 of the New York firm's approximately 
$100,000 in expenses. Klausner called that estimate "vastly understated."  
</P>
<P>
 Consultants who audit lawyers' bills said extravagant spending for travel and 
meals is less common than other billing abuses. They traced the excesses to the 
1980s, when the legal profession, like the rest of the economy, was booming.  
</P>
<P>
 Law firms grew, and the new bureaucracies became more expensive to run. Some 
firms began charging for office overhead. Photocopying became part of the 
profits. Clients noticed curious charges on their bills: "HVC" -- heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning -- or word processing (typing) or filing. 
</P>
<P>
 One attorney recalled that during the 1980s, she and others in her San 
Francisco firm would go to lunch and decide at the restaurant whose client 
would be billed for it. Sometimes two or three attorneys would attend, 
sometimes many more if they were celebrating a birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody does the lunch," said the lawyer, who asked that her name not be 
used. "You say: 'I had to go out to lunch to discuss your case with a partner.' 
You try to be ethical. You talk about the client for 10 or 15 minutes and then 
you have a nice lunch. We used to do it once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the rich clients got soaked for those meals, she said. Now she is working 
for a firm that represents poorer people, and the expensive meals and 
first-class travel are gone. "Now I stay at Holiday Inns and below," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers usually bill by the hour. Rates vary widely, but tend to range from 
$85 to $400 an hour. An associate at a small San Francisco firm told Santa Rosa 
litigation consultant Jim Schratz that a senior partner instructed him to bill 
for any time he thought about a case, even if it was in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are getting paid by the hour," legal bill auditor Gary Greenfield 
said, "there is an inherent inefficiency. The more time you spend, the more 
money you make, so there is a disincentive to be efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Associates, usually the less experienced lawyers in a firm, are fired if they 
do not meet minimum billing requirements. Some resort to billing for more time 
than they work. An hour may become an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure (to bill) is unbelievable, oh unbelievable," said a young San 
Francisco attorney who left private practice because she could no longer endure 
it. She is now a government lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her former associates frequently padded their time and thrived on 
minimum billing requirements, a common practice whereby firms do not bill for 
any time less than 10 or 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lawyer may write a one- or two-sentence letter: 'Enclosed are responses to 
the interrogatories. Please get back to me,' " said Greenfield, founder of 
Oakland's Litigation Cost Management. "That is a 45-second letter that gets 
billed for 15 minutes. That is a widespread practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Clients began watching their legal bills more carefully when the economy 
turned bad, and insurance companies hired auditors such as Greenfield to go 
into law firms and comb their files. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scrutiny stemmed some of the abuses, but many continue. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Northern District bankruptcy Judge Edward Jellen cited several billing 
abuses by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher when he decided in April to disallow half of 
its $1.35-million bill for representing creditors in the bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
 If the hours billed were correct, the judge calculated, a senior attorney at 
the firm had reviewed a mostly boilerplate retention agreement "at the 
incredible rate of 14 minutes per page, or 4.3 pages per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys are allowed compensation in bankruptcy cases for the costs of 
preparing fee requests. But Jellen complained that the Los Angeles firm's 
$99,000 charge for compiling the bill was a "staggering" 7.3% of its fees in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson "is not entitled to be compensated for overhead, general record-keeping 
and accounting, or multiple reviews of the same material by numerous 
attorneys," Jellen wrote. "It is also not entitled to be compensated for the 
excessive time that an army of paralegals spent reviewing and redoing each 
other's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Legalgard Inc., one of the biggest legal auditing firms in the country, has 
found that some firms charge more when the client is not paying particular 
attention to the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Marquess, chief executive officer and general counsel of the 
Philadelphia-based firm, calls it "cost-shifting." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Legalgard's audits since March showed the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Phoenix firm charged a client $1 million for creation of a database that 
"had nothing to do with the client's business." Although the longtime client 
eventually would benefit from the system, so would other clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Philadelphia lawyer charged for time in depositions that he did not 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Cleveland lawyer charged a client for the purchase of a suit when he ran 
out of clothes during a trial. "The response was, 'Get them dry-cleaned,' " 
Marquess said. 
</P>
<P>
 * A New York City law firm submitted a bill for $500,000 -- half of it for 
educational conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Miami firm charged a client $2,000 for preparing his $40,000 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers also tend to train young associates or new lawyers at client 
expense, consultants said. When a lawyer leaves a firm or moves onto another 
project, the client may be billed for the hours it takes the new lawyer to 
become familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms also may charge for a partner's time to review an associate's work, part 
of the training process for new lawyers that consultants say should be taken 
into account when billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although clients want their lawyers to be prepared for all possibilities, some 
consultants believe that firms do more work than is necessary when the client's 
potential liability is low. "Unfortunately, big law firms are in the habit of 
giving a Cadillac defense in cases that require only a Chevette defense," said 
Schratz, the Santa Rosa consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging a lawyer about a bill often saves the client money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them will very quickly cut 25% of the bill," said John W. Toothman, 
founder of Devil's Advocate in Virginia, a litigation consulting firm that 
examines legal bills, "especially if they think it will repair the relationship 
and keep your business." 
</P>
<P>
 State bar associations try to guide lawyers in appropriate billing. The 
California State Bar is developing recommendations based in part on guidelines 
from the American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to these guidelines, lawyers should not charge for normal overhead 
but may for photocopying, computer research, secretarial overtime and telephone 
calls if the charges reflect the actual costs to the firm or the client has 
agreed to them in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers also should not charge more than one client for the same work. For 
example, an attorney who spent four hours at a courthouse for three clients on 
the same day may not bill each of the clients for four hours, the ABA said, 
even though each case by itself would have required four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer who flies across the country for one client and works on the plane 
for another may not bill both clients for that time, according to the 
guidelines. Nor should a firm charge a client for research when it is recycled 
work done for another client. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Bar of California said it received 865 allegations of legal fee 
improprieties last year and referred some of the complaints to arbitration. A 
Bar spokeswoman said figures were not available on how many lawyers were 
disciplined for improper billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who blatantly overcharge clients are occasionally prosecuted. A 
30-member San Jose law firm recently pleaded guilty to 12 counts of felony mail 
fraud after prosecutors accused its partners of telling the accounting 
department to add arbitrary time on bills. The firm primarily practiced 
workers' compensation defense law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some counties, including Los Angeles, have discovered fraudulent billings by 
attorneys appointed by the court to represent indigents. Six Los Angeles 
criminal defense lawyers agreed in 1986 to settlements totaling $129,500 for 
allegedly overbilling the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the patent case, Laser-Pacific received bills from the New York firm for 
about $1 million. After Laser sued for fraud and malpractice, the New York firm 
filed a counterclaim for unpaid fees and expenses of about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiations dragged on and the depositions mounted, the New York firm 
agreed to remove all of Eslinger's time and expenses from the bill -- about 
$400,000. He was the lead lawyer, but others in the firm also worked on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 It has yet to be resolved. Laser's new lawyers are seeking at least $2 million 
and potentially $60 million in damages. A trial was scheduled for this month, 
but the case may be settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lay person in a litigious society is, to some degree, defenseless," said 
Emory Cohen, Laser-Pacific's president. "If you find you can't necessarily 
trust your lawyer, where are you?"

FIRMS LOWER RATINGS OF STATE'S LONG-TERM BONDS; FINANCES: WALL STREET CREDIT 
WATCHERS REACT TO WOBBLY BUDGET. AS A RESULT, CALIFORNIA WILL PAY HIGHER 
INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the state's wobbly financial condition, the big three Wall Street 
credit-rating firms Friday downgraded their opinion of California's long-term 
bonds, marking a fall in just three years from the top of the ratings ladder to 
a spot near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The action means that in the future, California will be forced to pay more in 
interest to issue new long-term bonds to compensate investors for the higher 
risk. But exactly how much more interest the state will have to pay is a matter 
of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, when California enjoyed a coveted AAA rating, the state has seen 
its grade lowered three times by all three ratings firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's reduced its rating on California bonds from A+ to A, one 
step from the cellar occupied by New York in the company's rating chart. 
Moody's Investor Service dropped the bonds from Aa to A1 and Fitch Investors 
Service revised its rating from AA to A. The states with the highest bond 
ratings -- such as Utah, Virginia and Maryland -- generally have balanced 
budget plans set on time and do not rely on overly optimistic revenue 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time all three firms lowered their rating of the state's bonds was in 
1992 during the 63-day budget crisis that forced the state to pay its bills 
with IOUs. The ratings affect the sale of the state's long-term general 
obligation bonds, usually sold in 20- or 30-year increments and used to finance 
the construction of schools, prisons, water systems and other projects. 
California sells about $3 billion of such bonds each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The news from New York was disappointing to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, whose 
reelection is being challenged by Democratic Treasurer Kathleen Brown. Indeed, 
even as the downgradings were being disclosed, Brown was holding a telephonic 
news conference to blame the governor for the bad report from Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, state Finance Director Russell Gould downplayed the significance 
of the announcements and complained that Brown, with whom he visited Wall 
Street this week, had "undermined efforts to obtain the best credit rating for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gould conceded that the news was disappointing for Wilson, who last 
week signed a $57.3-billion state budget that depends on a highly unlikely 
$2.8-billion federal bailout, at least $4 billion in borrowing, and a standby 
measure that could trigger automatic across-the-board reductions in all state 
programs except education. 
</P>
<P>
 All three provisions were singled out by the rating agencies as among the 
reasons to lower the state's bond rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In making its announcement, Standard & Poor's cited the budget's "reliance 
upon a blunt trigger mechanism to reduce spending" and said "these potentially 
Draconian automatic cuts could disrupt state operations, particularly in fiscal 
1996." 
</P>
<P>
 S & P and the other two rating services also cited the budget's dependence on 
a "questionable" federal bailout to pay for the cost of illegal immigrants as 
well as restrictions imposed by Proposition 98, the voter-approved measure that 
guarantees a minimum proportion of state revenues for kindergarten through 
community colleges, and the persistent budget deficit that requires heavy 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite an improving economy, the state has been unable to enact a realistic 
plan to fund the accumulated deficit" without heavy borrowing, Moody's 
announcement said. Indeed, the state had to pay Bank of America and a 
consortium of international lenders $30 million just to co-sign a record $4 
billion loan to keep the state afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Zimmerman, a San Francisco-based executive in S & P's municipal finance 
department, said his firm had foreshadowed Friday's announcement in February by 
issuing a negative outlook for California. He said his company decided to drop 
the ratings because the state's financial situation "had deteriorated." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman said that although the lowering means that California is a riskier 
borrower, S & P still anticipates that the state will pay off its debts and not 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the decision by credit rating agencies should not affect billions 
of dollars in short-term debt the state is borrowing next week. In fact, 
Zimmerman noted that the short-term notes backed by the consortium of banks 
were given a top rating by S & P. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the ratings announcement made Friday a "grim day for the Golden 
State" and for taxpayers, noting that California's rating is now among the 
nation's worst. 
</P>
<P>
 She contended that the downgrading "is directly tied to the state's budget and 
the failure of the governor to present a credible plan to pay off the 
accumulated deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Gould said Brown's criticism of the Wilson Administration has 
not "been helpful in terms of sustaining our rating and I think that's 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould said he could not immediately estimate the cost to taxpayers of the 
lowered rating and maintained that the state's economy is rebounding with "very 
positive signs." But Brown's office said the lower rating would cost the state 
roughly $1 million a year for each $1 billion borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer's office says general obligation bonds issued since the first 
downgradings in 1991 will cost the state an extra $529 million over the 
lifetime of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Wall Street criticism, Gould said it is unlikely that the 
automatic cuts in the budget will be triggered and that the mechanism reflects 
fiscal discipline by Wilson and the Legislature. Moreover, he backed Wilson's 
efforts to obtain reimbursement from the federal government for services 
rendered to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic Controller Gray Davis said Friday's actions show that Wall 
Street is skeptical that Washington will bail out California. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is making a massive bet on the (outcome) -- Wall Street is saying 
it is a bad bet," Davis said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's reliance on $3.5 billion in federal money has forced us to go 
to extra lengths to shore up our short-term borrowing. The ratings agencies are 
saying short-term investors should have no fear, but the state has long-term 
problems that must be corrected."

LEADERS OF ISRAEL, JORDAN AGREE TO HISTORIC MEETING; MIDEAST: PRIME MINISTER 
RABIN AND KING HUSSEIN WILL CONFER IN FIRST OFFICIAL TALKS, CLINTON ANNOUNCES. 
NO PEACE TREATY IS EXPECTED FROM THE EVENT IN WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton announced Friday that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel 
and King Hussein of Jordan will confer at the White House this month in the 
first acknowledged face-to-face meeting between leaders of countries joined by 
geography but divided by half a century of animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Middle East is entering a new era," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 25 meeting -- announced simultaneously in Washington, Jerusalem and 
Amman -- "reflects the courageous leadership and the bold vision which both 
King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin have displayed as they work together to 
create a new future for their people and for all the region," the President 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlining the occasion's significance, Rabin and Hussein, accompanied by 
Clinton, will address a joint session of Congress. The Israeli and Jordanian 
leaders will be guests at a White House state dinner, only the second such 
event since Clinton took office 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Middle East breakthrough comes at a welcome time for Clinton, giving him a 
genuine foreign policy success to counterbalance criticism of the 
Administration for allegedly uneven handling of crises in Haiti and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said the Rabin-Hussein meeting is comparable to 
President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977 that cleared the way for the 
Israel-Egypt peace treaty, the first -- and, as yet, only -- pact between 
Israel and any Arab government. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this meeting will not produce the emotional wallop of Sadat's 
unprecedented initiative, officials said, conceding that it will not lead 
directly to a peace treaty. But it demonstrates, as one U.S. official put it, 
that Israel is becoming accepted by its Arab neighbors "as a normal part of the 
landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 Following by less than a year the peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, the Hussein-Rabin meeting is added evidence 
that the Arab world has given up on its once-singular objective of expelling 
the Jewish state from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein has met secretly with Israeli prime ministers and other top officials 
for more than 20 years. But this is the first time either side has publicly 
acknowledged the contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is great significance to the fact that it is being done openly, in the 
light of day," Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israeli television. 
"This puts an end to the secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for which we have yearned for a long time," Peres 
said. "This is not only an encounter at the top but a very fundamental change 
on the ground. This is the beginning of a new era in the relationship between 
us and Jordan and in the whole Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher conceded that the Hussein-Rabin talks 
"will not result in the signing of a peace treaty." Instead, he said, the talks 
are part of a process intended to produce Israel-Jordan cooperation on economic 
projects such as tourism and exploitation of the mineral-rich Dead Sea and the 
agricultural potential of the Jordan River valley, which straddles the border. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said Israel and Jordan are reversing the usual order of 
diplomacy between former enemies. Instead of starting with a peace treaty, 
Jerusalem and Amman are negotiating details of normal, friendly relations while 
maintaining a technical state of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-level economic talks begin Monday in a tent pitched on the border. 
Christopher meets Wednesday at a resort hotel on the Jordanian side of the Dead 
Sea with Peres and Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, who doubles as Jordan's 
foreign minister, to prepare the way for the Washington meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden progress in Jordan-Israel negotiations seems to push Syria and its 
hard-line president, Hafez Assad, to the margins of the Middle East peace 
process. Israel and Syria have deadlocked over the key details of a peace 
treaty after agreeing in principle more than a year ago to make peace based on 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional experts said Assad is furious at Hussein for forging ahead and at the 
United States for encouraging the Israel-Jordan rapprochement. Clinton 
telephoned Assad on Friday morning to inform him of the Rabin-Hussein talks and 
to try to soothe his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 But regional specialists expect Assad to retaliate in some way. In previous 
years when Jordan broke with Syria, Jordanian diplomats have been assassinated, 
presumably by Syrian intelligence operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they believe that Hussein will stop short of signing a 
formal peace treaty to minimize Assad's anger. But they said that Hussein 
clearly has decided to pursue what he considers to be Jordan's national 
interest without waiting for Syria to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher will try to push the Syria-Israel negotiations off dead center 
when he begins his trip to the region Sunday night. "It's essential that 
(Israel and Syria) move forward in these discussions, and I am prepared to 
engage intensively with them," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jordan and Syria regard peace with Israel as a back-door way of improving 
their relations with Washington. Both hope to get economic assistance from the 
United States as a reward for making peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said Hussein had indicated he was ready to meet Rabin in a visit 
to Washington last month. At the same time, the Hashemite monarch said Jordan 
needs debt relief and wants U.S. weapons to modernize its military arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with them and intend to work with them on both of those 
problems," Christopher said. "The United States has always been prepared to 
work with those in the Middle East who are committed to peace and help achieve 
a peace settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan owes about $700 million to the United States, an amount that the 
kingdom's troubled economy is unable to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's agreement to meet Rabin is a clear victory for the Israeli prime 
minister, who wants his government to deal with Arab states one at a time 
instead of trying to negotiate a comprehensive peace with all of Israel's 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been Israel's strategy ever since the Camp David conference that 
paved the way for the Egypt-Israel treaty in 1979. But Rabin now seems to be 
the first Israeli leader since 1979 to break Arab solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israel-Jordan relationship has always been a curious one because the 
countries share so much geography and history. Both states were carved out of 
the territory of the British Palestine mandate, and Israel's border with Jordan 
is by far its longest. Both countries have long recognized the value of joint 
economic development, although their frosty political relationship has made 
that impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Israel have a territorial dispute in the Jordan River valley, but 
it is less of an obstacle to peace than the Israel-Syria dispute over the Golan 
Heights. Before the 1967 Mideast War, Jordan controlled the West Bank and the 
eastern part of Jerusalem, and for years the Hashemite kingdom demanded return 
of those territories. But in 1988, Hussein ceded Jordan's claim to the PLO.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ARAB-ISRAELI TALKS ENTER DECISIVE PHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace talks in the Middle East are entering a potentially decisive phase, 
which, after half a century of wars declared and undeclared, could bring the 
Arab-Israeli conflict to an end -- and possibly within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors are developing a momentum 
that is carrying them forward at a pace that people thought impossible but 
necessary following a long and bitter stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, immense problems loom before all the parties -- Israel, Jordan, Syria, 
Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization; painful compromises will be 
required to resolve the very tough issues at the core of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all the parties are gingerly approaching those issues with a new eagerness 
for peace and an apparent willingness to strike the high-stakes bargains 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 They realize, for example, they are not only ending the long state of war 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors but replacing it with collective security 
arrangements under which the region's moderate nations will protect each other 
from extremist threats. 
</P>
<P>
 A peace treaty of this type between Israel and Jordan is rapidly taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein are 
not expected to sign such an accord when they meet in Washington later this 
month, Israeli officials say an agreement could be reached in weeks on the two 
countries' borders, sharing of water resources and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO are working to broaden the self-government accord they 
signed last September by giving the new Palestinian Authority enhanced powers 
throughout the occupied West Bank, pulling back Israeli troops in the region 
and planning for the Palestinians' first national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 And Israel and Syria are probing each other's positions on Israel's withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, security guarantees and the nature of their future 
relations with hints of compromise. Both hope for a breakthrough in their 
long-stalled talks when Secretary of State Warren Christopher visits the region 
next week, and Egyptian officials this week predicted a basic Syrian-Israeli 
pact within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 All this movement stems, first, from the dramatic breakthrough in secret talks 
last summer between Israel and the PLO. The willingness of Israel and the 
Palestinians to share land over which they had fought for a century released 
Israel's other Arab neighbors to make their own peace with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Syria also fear they will be left behind as Israel and the PLO push 
ahead. Hussein wants the stability of a peace treaty with Israel as a 
Palestinian state emerges on the West Bank and Muslim fundamentalists challenge 
his rule. Syrian President Hafez Assad, who saw himself as the architect of the 
future Middle East, felt himself being marginalized. 
</P>
<P>
 A final element is real concern that the "window of opportunity," opened two 
years ago with Rabin's election with a commitment to negotiations and 
compromise, could close -- and the chance for peace be lost -- if a 
comprehensive peace is not achieved before the next Israeli elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin wants to turn those elections, due by June, 1996, into a referendum on 
agreements he has reached and to get a mandate for the final phase in the 
negotiations with the PLO -- talks that will decide the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the return of 
hundreds of thousands of exiled Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive peace settlement that would, for the first time, put Israel at 
peace with its immediate Arab neighbors would likely turn the election into a 
landslide for Rabin, his Labor Party and its leftist allies. 
</P>
<P>
 But should Rabin and his Labor Party lose the election, a right-wing coalition 
led by the Likud Party, which opposes the Palestinian accord and withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, would quickly break off negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the political imperative not only for Rabin but for Arab leaders is to 
strike far-reaching agreements over the next year and certainly before Israel's 
serious pre-election politicking begins in late 1995, with a leader and 
political party whose future depends on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leaders themselves -- Rabin, Assad, Hussein and PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat -- there is a strong desire to bring peace to the region and shape its 
future before their generation passes from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Key moves were made in the past week by Israel and its Arab partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In a televised, hourlong speech to the Jordanian Parliament last weekend, 
Hussein told his nation that, after years of secret meetings with Israeli 
leaders, he was ready to meet Rabin openly and soon to advance peace prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of Jordan's lawmakers are Muslim fundamentalists or leftists opposed 
to the peace process; the monarch's announcement was a bold signal he is 
determined to proceed, moving ahead of other Arab countries. "Jordan has 
decided to act primarily according to its own national interest," Hussein 
declared, stressing its need for political stability and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres responded with important commitments, 
including recognition of Jordan's sovereignty and the legitimacy of the 
Hashemite dynasty there and acceptance of its role as a protector of Islamic 
shrines in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Hussein wrote President Clinton he was prepared to move up a 
meeting with Rabin from the autumn to July 25. Hussein also made clear in his 
letter that his move was contingent on increased U.S. aid -- modernization of 
Jordan's army and air forces and forgiveness of about $700 million Jordan owes 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a team of Israeli officials completed arrangements for a formal 
visit by Peres to Jordan as part of the accelerated negotiations to conclude a 
peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, meanwhile, Syrian officials expressed their hope that Christopher 
can break the prolonged deadlock in talks with Israel during his forthcoming 
trip. Assad was ready, Syria's state-controlled press said, to discuss future 
relations with Israel once it declared its readiness to withdraw from the Golan 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres responded with a major shift in Israel's negotiating position. "We have 
recognized Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights, time after time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He implied an Israeli willingness to withdraw to the international border in 
return for "full peace" if security arrangements and other issues could be 
agreed upon. Until now, Rabin had only said Israel would pull back on the Golan 
Heights but had refused to specify the line of withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials said Friday that the coming Christopher shuttle would test 
Syria's sincerity and the forthcoming meeting between Rabin and Hussein will 
put pressure on Assad to move ahead -- or simply be left behind.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FRANCE'S BIG GAMBLE PAYS OFF IN RWANDA; AFRICA: SKEPTICS HAD 
FELT PEACE MISSION COULD HAVE BEEN 'ANOTHER SOMALIA.' 
</P>

<P>
 The experts doubted it would work. They suspected the French would take sides. 
And they spoke darkly of "another Somalia," from where U.S. troops had been 
forced by American public opinion to beat an ignominious retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 But three weeks ago, as the United States and every other nation did little 
more than wring their hands about the ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda, France 
airlifted 2,500 of its young sons and daughters in uniform into the heart of 
the Central African conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the decisive French gamble, in sharp contrast to the American action in 
Somalia in 1992, appears to have already paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 French troops have, without a single French casualty, been able to prevent at 
least some ethnic killing in western parts of the country. Most of the fighting 
has ended with a rebel takeover of the capital, Kigali. And now the French, 
still holding to their "humanitarian mission," are appealing for help for 
several million displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the French have succeeded, thus far, is linked to this country's 
colonial past -- and present -- in Africa, its self-image of a world leader, 
the strong support from the French public and a long penchant for intervening 
on the African continent without apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "France sees itself as a world power," Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
explained in a recent television interview. "This is its ambition and its 
honor, and I wish for it to preserve this ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the impetus for the armed intervention in Rwanda may have less to do 
with power and more to do with guilt. A broad spectrum of the French public has 
supported the intervention, but for widely different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some saw it as an opportunity to make amends for France's support of dictators 
across Africa, not the least among them Rwanda's late president, Juvenal 
Habyarimana. The Hutu strongman came to power in a 1973 coup and quickly won 
military backing from France. When his plane, a gift from the French 
government, was shot down April 6, his death reignited the genocidal war 
between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 But others in France considered the intervention a golden opportunity to 
re-exert French influence in the tiny, densely populated nation, by saving 
lives and protecting their friends in the Rwandan government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French have a long tradition of getting involved in Africa, and they've 
gotten involved for much less worthy causes, on behalf of all sorts of skunks 
without there being the least hue and cry back home," said a non-French Western 
diplomat with long experience in Francophone Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, during the Cold War years the United States also helped out 
notorious dictators, including the late Samuel K. Doe, who ruthlessly ruled 
Liberia, and Mobutu Sese Seko, who has siphoned off millions from the 
impoverished people of Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 But France, alone among the former colonial rulers in Africa, has maintained 
military as well as political links with its former colonies and other 
French-speaking countries, such as the former Belgian colony of Rwanda. Over 
the years, French troops have rushed to Senegal, Gabon, Chad, Zaire, the 
Central African Republic, the Comoros and Togo to easily put down unseemly 
uprisings and keep friendly rulers in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Rwanda, the politics for France are more complicated. Some in the 
United Nations were squeamish about giving France the OK to intervene, and five 
Security Council members abstained from the vote, because of France's deep, 
often-secret previous ties with the Hutu government. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1975, France had a military agreement with the Rwanda government and it 
welcomed generals into the most prestigious French military academies. The 
government's main opponents were in a Tutsi rebel movement, known as the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, which was based in Uganda, a former British colony. 
Many of its rebel leaders, driven into exile in the 1960s and 1970s, received 
their military training in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 When French troops arrived in Rwanda last month, the rebels were advancing on 
Kigali, which was still held by the government. And the French government 
believed that the victims of the killing were about evenly divided between 
Hutus and Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 To their surprise, though, they discovered that the wave of genocide had been 
started primarily by the Hutu-dominated government. And French soldiers found 
themselves facing hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fleeing Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The French also originally thought they could save the Hutu-dominated 
government from defeat by the rebels. But when the rebels took control of 
Kigali, the thinking in France changed. President Francois Mitterrand declared 
that the rebels "are not our enemies, and we are not trying to prevent them 
from winning the civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 That marked a turning point in the French intervention. French officials, 
after negotiations with the new leaders, carved out a "safe zone" in the 
southwest, and the French vowed this week to keep armed militia from the old 
government out. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Tutsi-led rebels have picked a Hutu as the prime minister 
as a gesture of reconciliation in the country. And although the new leaders 
still distrust the French, they appear to have decided to tolerate the foreign 
soldiers for now in the interests of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, they increased France's diplomatic discomfort by demanding 
that the French arrest Hutu government leaders hiding behind their troops in 
southwestern Rwanda. The French said they would consult with the United Nations 
about the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious questions remain, meantime, about the rebels' ability to bring 
democracy to Rwanda. They represent less than 15% of the population, and any 
free election could drive them from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the rebels celebrate their apparent victory, some fighting in rural 
areas continues and the humanitarian disaster is escalating alarmingly. Aid 
agencies say upward of 1 million displaced people roam the hilly countryside; 
more than 500,000 have crossed the western border into Goma, Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mandate for the French deployment runs out Aug. 21, and the United 
Nations has promised to replace the troops with a force drawn mostly from other 
African countries.

PENTAGON AIDES SEE PERILS IN STEWARDSHIP OF A-ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Senior Defense Department officials are becoming worried about the safety and 
reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons under the stewardship of Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary and are concerned that they soon may be unable to meet the 
nation's potential military needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a top secret-letter to O'Leary in late May, Deputy Defense Secretary John 
Deutch said that the Energy Department was failing to maintain the nation's 
nuclear weapons plants and lacked the political muscle to obtain sufficient 
funds to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that the present (Energy Department) nuclear weapons 
research, development and test budget does not provide sufficient resources to 
maintain the technological capability that is required for future nuclear 
weapons missions," Deutch told O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch wrote the letter as chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Council, the 
joint defense and energy authority that sets policy for nuclear weapons. It has 
two other voting members: an Energy Department executive and the chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary was traveling in India this week and could not be reached for comment. 
In recent interviews, Energy Department officials have defended her but also 
acknowledged that the department is facing a rapid erosion in its capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department's concerns have prompted serious suggestions that the 
Energy Department get out of the weapons business. Though the Pentagon is not 
seeking a transfer of weapons responsibility to itself, defense officials 
acknowledged that the subject has been broached. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a serious question," Frank Miller, principal deputy undersecretary of 
defense for international security policy, said at a seminar in June on 
strategic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Such suggestions reflect widespread concern among military leaders that the 
nuclear weapons complex's labs and factories are rapidly losing the expert 
staff necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of the 6,000 warheads that 
the United States intends to hold permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has also signaled concern. A Senate subcommittee approved legislation 
earlier this year that transferred responsibility for the production of 
tritium, an important explosive booster used in hydrogen bombs, from the Energy 
Department to the Defense Department. The provision, although it did not become 
law, indicated the level of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, charged in a Senate speech recently that "Mrs. 
O'Leary has surrounded herself with a team of professional anti-nuclear 
activists," who have put the U.S. nuclear stockpile at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurmond asserted that O'Leary's advisers come from, among others, the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, a prominent critic of the weapons complex. The 
Savannah River nuclear weapons site, which processes tritium and at one time 
produced plutonium, is the largest employer in Thurmond's home state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mario Fiori, the Energy Department's chief at Savannah River and a former 
Navy submarine captain, said in a recent interview: "I am not going to 
criticize Hazel. . . . Hazel O'Leary is working very, very hard to create 
credibility for a department . . . that never had much for many many years." 
</P>
<P>
 An Energy Department spokesman said that, even before Deutch wrote the letter 
to O'Leary, the department had notified the White House National Security 
Council that it would need a budget increase in 1996 and beyond to maintain the 
stockpile. "We believe today the stockpile is safe and reliable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming into office, O'Leary has made a number of controversial 
disclosures about the Energy and Defense departments' nuclear weapons 
experiments on Americans several decades ago. Defense officials said that those 
embarrassing disclosures are not the underlying reason for their concern about 
her leadership, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials cited two crucial concerns about the nuclear weapons 
stockpile: that it remain safe and that future presidents have absolute 
assurance of its reliability if it must be committed to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal policy, the risk of an accidental nuclear detonation under 
normal conditions is not supposed to exceed 1 in 1 billion, a standard far 
higher than the reliability of any spacecraft, medical device or complex 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the production and handling of 70,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War, 
there have been no accidental detonations, according to Sidney Drell, a noted 
weapons expert and physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one hell of a record," Drell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that record can be maintained is what concerns the Pentagon. Officials 
worry that O'Leary is unwilling to commit the political capital necessary to 
fight off efforts to cut the nuclear weapons budgets in favor of environmental 
and other programs not related to weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Energy officials) have been good stewards but their inability to defend 
the kinds of budgets needed is a cause of grave concern," said a senior defense 
official, speaking on background. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Energy Secretary Victor Reese, who is responsible for the 
department's weapons complex, voiced his own concerns that its capability may 
be eroding too rapidly. "I'm not sure that we might have gone a little too 
fast," he said, particularly in ensuring the health and safety of the nuclear 
stockpile.  
</P>
<P>
 Former officials of the George Bush and Ronald Reagan administrations are 
among the most outspoken critics of O'Leary, saying that she lacks the depth of 
knowledge to manage the nuclear stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
 "While clearly a very bright person, Secretary O'Leary has no background in 
this area and as a result the department lacks the necessary clout in 
Washington to carry out its linchpin mission," said former Defense 
Undersecretary Don Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial issue is whether the Energy Department will have the funds 
necessary to support the two existing nuclear weapons labs, Los Alamos and 
Lawrence Livermore. Because the United States has agreed to a moratorium on 
underground testing, Pentagon officials said, it will be crucial for several 
years to have two labs that can review each other's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Barker, assistant to the president at Livermore, said that the fiscal 1995 
Energy Department budget may not be adequate to ensure the safety and 
reliability of nuclear weapons. Funding for stewardship has dropped below the 
levels recommended by an interagency study, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to turn this job over to amateurs," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiscal 1996 funding will be even tighter, perhaps too low to support two labs, 
according to an expert involved in a major nuclear weapons study. This year, 
the overall budget for the Energy Department's defense program -- essentially 
the weapons complex -- is about $4.4 billion, down from $5.8 billion in fiscal 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the absence of 
underground testing, which was abandoned during the Bush Administration, is 
comparable to ordering General Motors to stop making new cars and even to 
refrain from starting any old cars -- and at the same time having complete 
confidence that in two or three decades GM could start a car at a moment's 
notice and restart production. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain a stockpile of even 6,000 weapons, about 100 bombs a year should 
be torn apart and rebuilt. Electronics, wiring and batteries must be routinely 
replaced and decayed tritium replenished. That would require a new nuclear 
reactor to produce tritium, production of special batteries, electronic wiring 
and detonators, as well as special facilities to test conventional explosives 
used to trigger the plutonium pits in the warheads.

LATIN AMERICA; FEARS IN MEXICO HEATING UP AS VOLCANO STIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A plume of steam and gases can frequently be seen rising hundreds of feet 
above Popocatepetl volcano near Mexico City this summer, providing a visible 
focus for scientists' concern that the volcano's first eruption in 50 years may 
not be far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Arizona State University geologists, flying over the crater this month at 
the invitation of Mexican volcanologists, measured sulfur dioxide emissions at 
an ominous 3,000 metric tons (about 6.6 million pounds) a day, double the rate 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumaroles -- vents often surrounded by intensely glowing red sulfur deposits 
-- have grown substantially in number since 1986, and a crater lake has changed 
color from clear green to milky green and heated up from 84 degrees Fahrenheit 
to 149 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the signs that the famous volcano, at 17,887 feet one of the 
highest in the world, is stirring. But so far the number of earthquakes, often 
the most imminent sign of an eruption, has remained low. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading Mexican volcanologist, Servando de la Cruz Reyna, messaged Robert I. 
Tilling, a volcano expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, this week that the 
Mexican government has now approved funding for a network of seismic recording 
stations on the mountain to try to more precisely gauge the seismicity, 
measuring even the tiniest quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz Reyna, meanwhile, was reported by an associate, Manuel Mena, to be high 
on Popocatepetl to monitor the fumaroles and check for ground deformation, a 
significant precursor of an eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Popocatepetl is of special concern because of its location, just 45 miles 
southeast of Mexico City and even closer to the city of Puebla. More than 20 
million people live within 62 miles of the crater, and while most of the 25 to 
30 eruptions of the past 600 years of recorded history have been relatively 
weak, there is evidence on the ground of great, disastrous eruptions in 
prehistoric times. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the potential that has scientists on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley N. Williams, one of the Arizona State geologists who measured the 
sulfur dioxide emissions, says that "absolutely the next thing that has to 
happen now" is for the Mexican government to initiate hazard mitigation steps 
in Mexico City and Puebla. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important of these would be to educate the population about what 
would happen during a heavy ash fall from an eruption, particularly the 
importance of sweeping or hosing ash off roofs, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single greatest cause of death in 1991 in the Pinatubo eruption in the 
Philippines was the collapse of roofs in nearby towns covered by large amounts 
of ash," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 French experts have prepared hazard maps indicating that mud and lava flows, 
as well as the superheated mixture of rock and gases known as pyroclastic 
flows, from a major Popocatepetl eruption could cut road and rail 
communications between Mexico City and Puebla, and affect small cities near the 
volcano's base. 
</P>
<P>
 Such flows, which can occur rapidly, unexpectedly and even explosively, could 
cause a significant loss of human life, because the Mexico City-Puebla road and 
rail lines are both vital and busy.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most direct impact on Mexico City and Puebla would probably be the 
ash. Not the least of the ash impact could be on civil aviation. With Mexico 
City's airport lying on the capital's eastern side, toward Popocatepetl, all 
air travel would have to be suspended during an ash fall at the airport. During 
the past 20 years, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report, more than 60 
airplanes worldwide, mostly commercial jetliners, have been damaged by 
encounters with ash clouds.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Williams noted, depending on wind direction, Mexico City could be 
spared most of any Popocatepetl ash, just as Portland, Ore., was spared during 
the 1980 eruptions of nearby Mt. St. Helens. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading Mexican volcanologists, Cruz Reyna, Hugo Delgado Granados and 
Gerardo Suarez, have been seeking government money for not just seismic 
stations but many other types of monitoring at Popocatepetl during the present 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite monitoring, the exact time of an explosive eruption can be a surprise, 
as it was at Mt. St. Helens. But the more extensive the monitoring, the greater 
the chance that a combination of signs may allow timely evacuations to save 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Popocatepetl's last eruptive period was between 1943 and 1947, but the last 
really major eruptions are believed to have occurred in the century before the 
Spaniards under Hernando Cortes arrived in 1519. Monitoring a Giant 
</P>
<P>
 The 17,887-foot-high Popocatepetl volcano, which is showing signs of impending 
activity, is located 45 miles southeast of Mexico City. More than 20 million 
people live within 60 miles of the crater, which has lately been emitting about 
3,000 metric tons of sulphur dioxide a day.

ASIA; SOUTHEAST NATIONS FINALLY GET SECURITY WATCHDOG: ARF; THE NEW FORUM FACES 
SEVERAL CRISES WHEN IT CONVENES JULY 25. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Europe has the Conference on Security and Cooperation. The Western Hemisphere 
has the Organization of American States. But as the recent nuclear crisis in 
North Korea demonstrated, when security problems boil over in Asia, there is no 
regional forum where countries can seek a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1980s, a number of Southeast Asian nations have been pressing the 
big powers to join them in a semi-permanent conference to discuss security 
matters. But the Americans always balked, in part because of concerns about 
allowing the former Soviet Union to legitimize its nuclear Pacific presence. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Cold War's end, Southeast Asian countries led by Thailand revived 
the idea, and after two years of intense lobbying, the goal of a multi-power 
Asian security conference will finally be achieved with the convening of the 
ASEAN Regional Forum here July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will bring together six members of the Assn. of Southeast Asian 
Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines 
-- with foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, China, Japan, South 
Korea, Canada, Vietnam, Laos, Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 An Australian diplomat wisecracked that the discussions leading to the 
founding of the forum, known by the unfortunate acronym of ARF, were started in 
the Year of the Dog, but otherwise the preparations are proceeding in deadly 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 The region has no shortage of simmering crises: China and Vietnam have been 
close to armed conflict over oil concessions in the South China Sea, and the 
conference's host, Thailand, has been accused of trying to bring down the 
freely elected government in neighboring Cambodia by supporting the notorious 
Khmer Rouge insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats say it is unlikely that such contentious issues will get a 
detailed hearing at the first forum, out of concern there will never be a 
second. The real news, they say, is that the talks are happening at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai diplomats, who have been in the forefront of efforts to get the forum 
moving, are fond of referring to the meeting as "preventive diplomacy," as 
opposed to crisis intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Pramudwinai, director general of the Thai Foreign Ministry's East Asian 
department, said there are no specific issues on the agenda. "Participants will 
probably touch on various principles they adhere or accede to that can be set 
out as guidelines for developing future relations," he told a news conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks this year will focus more on "confidence-building measures," such as 
getting countries in the region to declare their defense policies, make public 
their armaments and allow regional military attaches to observe army exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may seem modest, countries in the region have watched with mounting 
concern as China has been acquiring a huge arsenal of modern weapons capable of 
projecting military power great distances without declaring what the arms 
buildup is for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants China to get used to coming to the negotiating table while it 
is preoccupied at home with economic development," a diplomat said. "They want 
to housebreak the Chinese while they are still housebreak-able." 
</P>
<P>
 The countries are also expected to deal with less contentious issues touching 
on "transnational security," including drug smuggling, political refugees and 
illegal aliens. Bangkok, for example, has become a shipment point for illegal 
emigrants from China heading to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 These talks will come on the heels of next week's ASEAN ministerial meeting 
where two other regional breakthroughs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam, shunned by ASEAN countries because of its Communist government, is 
expected to be formally invited to join the organization. Full membership is 
expected to be granted in about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite arm-twisting by the United States, the government of Myanmar, 
formerly Burma, will be represented at ASEAN talks for the first time, as the 
guest of Thailand. ASEAN countries rejected participation in a U.S.-led boycott 
of Myanmar -- over rampant human rights violations -- opting instead for 
"constructive engagement," which does not involve interfering in neighbors' 
affairs.

15,000 PEACEKEEPERS NEEDED IN HAITI, BOUTROS-GHALI SAYS; CARIBBEAN: THE U.N. 
LEADER URGES THAT THE JOB BE GIVEN TO THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES. HE 
SIDESTEPS ISSUE OF INVASION.

<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday that a peacekeeping 
force of more than 15,000 troops will be needed to restore order in Haiti and 
recommended that the job be given to the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said the world body is not 
up to the task of putting together such a large force and proposed that the 
council authorize a group of countries to undertake the task. He did not 
explicitly appoint the United States to lead the mission, but diplomats at the 
United Nations said that was clearly his implication. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali sidestepped the issue of whether the force would invade Haiti or 
wait for the leaders of the military regime to leave peaceably. But his 
proposal could make it easier for the Clinton Administration to invade Haiti, 
because it would give the United States a broad mandate for action from the 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically the Desert Storm model," a Clinton Administration official 
said, referring to the U.N. approval of U.S. leadership in the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War. "The U.N. says go ahead and solve the problem and leaves it to us to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration did not offer any official response to Boutros-Ghali's 
recommendation, circulated privately at the United Nations and in Washington on 
Friday in advance of its public release today. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general's proposal that the United States and other countries 
run the peacekeeping operation solves at least two diplomatic problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * It lets U.S. troops make up more than 30% of the peacekeeping force; in a 
U.N.-led operation, a single country is normally limited to no more than 30%. 
But that guideline would have limited U.S. participation to 4,500 troops and 
required the United Nations to recruit 10,500 troops from other countries -- a 
task Boutros-Ghali said is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 * It lets the United States exercise direct command of the force, without 
going through the United Nations' sometimes balky chain of command -- a 
provision the Administration had requested. At the same time, Boutros-Ghali 
took pains to warn the United States -- and any other country that cares to 
join -- that the mission will not be easy. He said the force would need to 
operate in "a disturbed and violent environment . . . for a period of 
unforeseeable duration." 
</P>
<P>
 "His message is: Don't think you can just get in, knock (Lt. Gen. Raoul) 
Cedras out of power and then turn it over to the U.N.," an Administration 
official said. "You've got to be around until we've got democracy on track." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 13-page report, Boutros-Ghali said: "The situation in Haiti has 
deteriorated to an intolerable extent. The senior leadership of the (Haitian 
armed forces) continues to defy the will of the international community and to 
inflict murder, rape and torture on the unfortunate people of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a large peacekeeping force is needed "after the departure of the 
senior Haitian military leadership and before the restoration in full of the 
legitimate government's authority." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the operation would require a total of 15,610 personnel: 5,000 combat 
troops, including infantry, helicopters and special operations units; 6,500 
support troops, including military police, intelligence and communications 
units; 3,500 more combat troops in offshore reserve; 550 civilian police, and 
60 military trainers to retrain Haiti's army and police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the peacekeeping force restores order, he said, the main body of troops 
could gradually withdraw, leaving the reserve troops and trainers behind. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said this week that 15 countries have offered to take part in a 
peacekeeping force. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher acknowledged 
Friday that the offers were made under the assumption that Haiti's military 
leaders would step down peaceably. They were not necessarily promises to join 
in a U.S. invasion, Christopher said.

LEPROSY NEARLY ERADICATED, AFRICA CLINIC TO TURN TO TB; MEDICINE: ETHIOPIAN 
HOSPITAL ADJACENT TO LEPER COLONY WILL TARGET TUBERCULOSIS, CLOSELY LINKED TO 
AIDS. 
</P>

<P>
 Awol Ahemed never noticed the patch of discolored skin on his arm, and only 
after his left hand had grown so numb that he could pick up a chunk of burning 
charcoal without feeling pain did he accept the awful truth: God had cursed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually his hand became frozen in a claw-like position. Without pain as a 
protector, his fingers were constantly burned, cut and bruised and started to 
slowly wear away. Ulcers formed. And like everyone else with leprosy, Awol 
became an outcast, destined to forage for food and live alone in his Wollo 
province village. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Awol made his way to Addis Ababa, where he heard there was a 
hospital that would not turn him away. At the least, he had heard, he would be 
given soap, Vaseline, food. And near the hospital, people said, there was a 
huge leper colony where he would have to endure neither the stares nor the 
stigma of a disease scorned since biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital he came to was the All-African Leprosy and Rehabilitation 
Training Center (ALERT), on 600 acres of lush grounds outside the Ethiopian 
capital. In operation since 1965, it is the only pan-African treatment facility 
for leprosy and is adjacent to the world's largest leper colony, a ghastly 
village where 25,000 Africans -- all lepers and their dependents -- live 
without electricity, toilets or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even my wife and children did not want to be close to me," Awol said. "No one 
in my family ever had this disease, so it is clear God cursed me for some 
reason. Why, I do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 For Awol, who is healing now after an operation to remove part of his hand, it 
is small consolation that the disease that has afflicted and deformed many 
millions of people, particularly in Africa and on the Asian subcontinent, is 
about to be defeated by modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leprosy is dying as a disease," said Neil Alldred, ALERT's executive 
director. "It's been knocked on its head -- finished as a threat -- by two 
drugs. By the year 2000, the World Health Organization says, leprosy should be 
eliminated as a public health problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Dapsone, discovered in 1940, was effective in controlling the symptoms of 
leprosy but required lifelong use. The real breakthrough came in 1982, when two 
new drugs taken in pill form, Clofazimine and Rifampicin, were proved capable 
of stopping leprosy, even in advanced cases. 
</P>
<P>
 ALERT recently abandoned a 20-year survey of patients who suffered relapses 
after using the drug because the relapse rate is virtually nil. "There just 
wasn't anything to study," Alldred said. Since the drugs came into widespread 
use, ALERT's caseload of patients with active leprosy has dropped from 23,000 
to 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite popular beliefs, leprosy is not hereditary and is not passed by 
touching an open sore. It is a germ that destroys the nerves, usually in the 
hands or feet, and is spread when a leper coughs or sneezes or otherwise 
spreads the bacteria. A healthy body exposed to the germ will reject it with no 
ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the world's 2.5 million lepers, almost all are in India and Africa. The 
vast majority live in unsanitary conditions and have inadequate diets and weak 
immune systems -- characteristics that have made leprosy a disease of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that leprosy is about to be eliminated as a health threat does not 
mean ALERT will soon close its 200-bed hospital or its training and 
rehabilitation center. The presence of the leper shantytown alone, Alldred 
said, is a daily reminder of medical failure -- and of all that needs to be 
done to remove the stigma from the disease, treat the deformed and train the 
cured for some useful role in society. 
</P>
<P>
 ALERT will, however, change its emphasis and will deal primarily with 
tuberculosis, a disease closely associated with AIDS. First priority will be 
given to lepers with TB because the center would be inundated if it opened its 
doors to everyone who suffers from tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months ago the government estimated that 300,000 Ethiopians were 
HIV-positive. Last month it revised its estimate to 588,000. One reason for the 
higher figure: The end of a decade-long civil war has enabled more Ethiopians 
to reach clinics, which in turn report cases that previously went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, medical care remains so primitive that 55% of Ethiopians must walk for 
at least one day to reach the nearest clinic. The government's new budget 
allocates only $2.10 per Ethiopian for health care -- and 72% of that goes for 
salaries of medical personnel.

HALF A MILLION RWANDANS CROSS ZAIRE BORDER IN 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no room but still they came Friday, a barely moving mass of humanity 
abandoned by the government army and terrified of the rebel forces advancing 
across western Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 With crossing gates into Zaire thrown open, it was impossible to count how 
many Hutu refugees had arrived in two days. But it likely was well over 
500,000, making it one of the largest flights in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's arrivals found most space already taken. Relief officials have 
already seen signs of disease in the refugee camps, where food, water and 
shelter are rare commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arrived we found nothing to eat, nowhere to stay," one man said. 
"Everything is crowded. Every square meter is occupied by refugees who arrived 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman in one of the camps said her group arrived with only the clothes on 
their backs, along with their goats and cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's even worse than our worst-case scenario," said Panos Moumtzis, a 
spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Goma. 
"It's the largest exodus in a short period of time. The needs right now are 
extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross set up two feeding centers north of Goma, and the line quickly 
grew miles long. Officials said the sites were chosen to keep the refugees 
moving out of the city to avoid trouble with local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Hutu interim government fled Gisenyi, their stronghold across 
the border from Goma, as Tutsi-dominated rebels closed in on the city, pursuing 
what remained of the government army in full retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Busloads of Rwandan soldiers scurried into Zaire. About 350 were housed at one 
military barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Washington, the Clinton Administration severed diplomatic 
relations with the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government, expelled Rwandan 
diplomats from the United States and closed the embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States cannot allow representatives of a regime that supports 
genocidal massacre to remain on our soil," President Clinton said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the U.S. action ended relations 
with the Hutu-led government, possibly clearing the way for recognition of a 
government formed by the Tutsi-dominated rebel front. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to de-recognize the Rwandan diplomatic Establishment here," 
Christopher told a White House news conference. "That leaves us in a situation 
where we have recognized no new government." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Administration would "work with the new government, hopefully 
to help assist in the creation of a coalition government there." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, the columns of Hutu civilians waiting to pass through the three 
border crossings into Zaire stretched for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus fear the rebels want to avenge widespread massacres of minority 
Tutsis by extremist supporters of Rwanda's Hutu-dominated government. The Hutu 
militias have been blamed for most of the estimated 200,000 to 500,000 deaths 
in the past three months in the small, central African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence of reprisals has surfaced. A spokeswoman for Doctors Without 
Borders in Goma, Samantha N. Bolton, said the arriving refugees were mostly 
uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Faustin Twagiramungu, a moderate Hutu picked by the rebels as prime minister 
of the new government, blamed the refugee crisis on hate propaganda from the 
crumbling Hutu government, broadcast over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not fleeing from the RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front), they are 
fleeing from the monsters that the Gisenyi government has created," he said 
Friday in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military spokesman in Goma, Jean-Claude Perruchot, confirmed that most 
interim government leaders had fled to Cyangugu, a city within the safe zone 
set up in southwestern Rwanda by French troops for an estimated 1 million 
displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council held closed consultations in New York without taking any 
action, and no further meetings were scheduled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had vowed not to stop fighting until its new multiethnic government 
was formed under Twagiramungu and the people responsible for the massacres were 
apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. envoy Shaharyar Khan said the rebels indicated Friday they are ready 
to stop fighting.

KENNEDY EXPRESSES HIS REGRETS FOR CHAPPAQUIDDICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
Friday issued a statement expressing regret about the incident in which a woman 
drowned in a car he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bear full responsibility for the tragedy, and I always will," the veteran 
Massachusetts Democrat said in the statement issued from his office in 
Washington regarding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have expressed my remorse to my family, the Kopechne family, and the people 
of Massachusetts. I only wish I had the power to do more to ease the continuing 
pain I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo's loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 62, was a young senator when he drove off a bridge at Chappaquiddick 
on the island of Martha's Vineyard after a party July 18, 1969. Kopechne 
drowned in the accident but Kennedy left the scene without reporting it.

SECRECY SURROUNDS SUIT FILED BY CIA SPY; LAW: FEMALE AGENT ALLEGES THAT THE 
AGENCY TREATED HER UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF HER GENDER. SPECIFIC CHARGES ARE HEAVILY 
CENSORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a legal case that is enveloped in secrecy, one of the CIA's senior female 
spies has gone to federal court to protest alleged injustices based on her 
gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected by a pseudonym, "Jane Doe Thompson" claims that her troubles began 
after she filed a complaint against her deputy four years ago "for beating his 
wife to the point of strangulation." Thompson was then the CIA station chief in 
a Caribbean area country. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily censored lawsuit charges that she "thereafter became the target of 
an inspector general investigation initiated by the male deputy" and several 
other people she had disciplined for other reasons. The overseas post she 
headed "was known to and admitted by the CIA to be a problem office," the court 
papers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although offered a higher position in the CIA in the spring of 1991, her 
promotion was withdrawn after another male employee "stated he would not work 
for a woman," according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint comes at a time when the spy agency is negotiating an 
administrative settlement in another case -- a class-action sex discrimination 
complaint brought in 1991 by women employed in the CIA's operations 
directorate, the division that handles foreign espionage and covert actions, in 
which "Thompson" also works. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint in that case claims there has been a systematic denial of 
promotion opportunities for women and that, when female employees complain 
about it, they are instructed to have a psychological evaluation. Members of 
Congress who sit on committees overseeing the agency said the clandestine 
service is still largely a male bastion, although it has recently worked to 
promote women. 
</P>
<P>
 Director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey, named as principal 
defendant in the "Thompson" suit, acknowledged after taking office last year 
that sex discrimination had been a problem. He promised to try to remedy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, women today hold about 12% of the CIA's senior operations, analysis 
and administrative posts, which is up from only 6% five years ago, according to 
the agency's figures.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Woolsey said he could not comment on the merits of either the 
"Thompson" case or the class-action complaint because they are in the hands of 
agency lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Thompson" complaint, filed under seal in federal court after her 
administrative reviews were exhausted, provides a number of detailed 
allegations that remain classified because CIA lawyers have persuaded the court 
that their disclosure would compromise people and places involved in agency 
operations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several legal motions that were unsealed in Alexandria, Va., district 
court have parted the curtain on some charges. The plaintiff alleges, for 
example, that the offending male deputy "admitted . . . his history of 
physically abusing his wife." Nonetheless, he "was never investigated by the 
agency and was later promoted," the motions claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thompson" said she believed this conduct over a period of years constituted a 
federal offense because it occurred "on United States government leased 
property while posted abroad and under diplomatic cover," according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thompson" charged that the CIA also failed to investigate her reports of 
other "specific instances of misconduct" by male employees in her office, 
including repeated drunkenness, sexual misconduct and one employee's threat to 
kill a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Toensing, a Washington lawyer representing "Thompson," has also 
complained about the conduct of CIA lawyers responsible for responding to 
claims in the lawsuit. In correspondence and legal briefs unsealed by the 
court, Toensing charges that the agency's office of general counsel has abused 
its authority under a secrecy agreement that the CIA requires from attorneys 
representing agency employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the CIA has authority to censor any agency-related 
lawsuit before it is made public. The purpose is to protect classified 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, Toensing contends that CIA officials have had nearly a month 
to approve a censored version but have not done so -- keeping the complaint 
itself from public view. She said CIA lawyers originally told her it would take 
no more than two days for them to delete any classified material from the 
complaint.

SENATE OKS FOREIGN AID BILL; HELP FOR RUSSIA CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate approved a $13.7-billion foreign aid bill Friday that sharply 
reduces U.S. assistance to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet 
Union and readjusts other spending priorities to reflect some of the 
disappointments of the new world order. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed 84 to 9 after several days of contentious debate over the Clinton 
Administration policy toward Haiti, the pared spending bill for the next fiscal 
year must now be reconciled with similar legislation already approved by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills would give President Clinton about $400 million less than he had 
requested for foreign aid in fiscal year 1995 and represent a decline of about 
$700 million in the overall foreign assistance budget. 
</P>
<P>
 As in years past, the lion's share of the ever-shrinking foreign aid budget 
has gone to Israel and Egypt, which together would receive nearly $5.2 billion 
in economic and military assistance. African nations of the sub-Sahara also 
would fare better this year, receiving $802 million in development aid -- a 
slight increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But reflecting what senators said was their disappointment with the 
Administration's handling of aid programs for the former Soviet Union, Russia 
and the other ex-Soviet states would receive $839 million in fiscal 1995 -- $61 
million less than Clinton requested and a significant drop from last year's 
$2.5-billion aid program. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, would get most of what he requested, although his allies in 
the Senate had to fight hard to beat back two Republican-led attempts to 
challenge his Haiti policy. Both efforts were defeated, but not until a long 
debate made it plain that most senators still oppose use of U.S. military force 
to depose Haiti's rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected challenges to Clinton's handling of the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and North Korea were postponed or failed to materialize. GOP strategists 
decided not to engage in a fight over Bosnia after narrowly losing a bid 
earlier this month to force Clinton to lift the Bosnian arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Administration's North Korea policy, however, won approval of 
an amendment that would bar Clinton from offering the Pyongyang regime any 
future aid unless he can certify that the North Koreans possess no nuclear 
weapons, have halted any nuclear weapons program and are not exporting 
weapons-grade plutonium to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely academic, because the United States provides no assistance to 
North Korea, the provision could limit the incentives the Administration will 
have when negotiations aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear 
program resume in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators also inserted a number of other restrictions on the way Clinton 
could disburse foreign aid next year by earmarking specific sums for individual 
recipients -- a practice that the House bill largely avoided this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of $839 million appropriated for the former Soviet states, for instance, $250 
million was earmarked for Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, while $30 million was 
set aside to help the FBI and Russian police combat a rising wave of 
international crime.

RUSSIA OUTRAGED BY U.S. SENATE CONDITION ON AID; EUROPE: OFFICIALS, LAWMAKERS 
DENOUNCE MEASURE TYING ECONOMIC HELP TO TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM ESTONIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Russian diplomats and lawmakers reacted with outrage Friday to a U.S. Senate 
vote linking aid to Russia to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia by 
Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Russian diplomat Vitaly S. Churkin denounced the U.S. attempt to 
pressure Russia into removing remnants of the occupying Red Army from its 
Baltic neighbor as "counterproductive and wrong," while the lower house of 
Parliament condemned it as unwarranted meddling in Russia's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said Russia "categorically rejects any 
linkage" of troop withdrawals to economic aid. Kozyrev said a delegation of 
Russian lawmakers that left for Washington on Friday would be asked to "talk to 
the American senators before this thing goes too far." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, during his European visit last week, tried to broker 
smoother relations between Russia and the Baltic states by calling for Russian 
troop withdrawals and ethnic tolerance from Baltic citizens. But the past week 
has brought new unpleasantness between Russia and Estonia, Sweden, Latvia and 
now the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has about 2,000 troops still stationed on Estonian soil. At a joint 
news conference with Clinton last week, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
suddenly announced he would not withdraw the troops by Aug. 31, as Russia had 
promised, because of "gross violations" of the human rights of Estonia's large 
Russian-speaking minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have all clashed with Russia over citizenship 
rights for hundreds of thousands of migrants who settled in the Baltics after 
the Soviet Union annexed the three nations in the wake of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltic nations claim that "occupants" who do not speak their language are 
not entitled to automatic citizenship, while Russia asserts that people who 
have lived in Estonia and Latvia for decades are being hounded out in what 
amounts to "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden, which has been monitoring the citizenship 
issue, said Yeltsin's claim of gross human rights violations in Estonia is 
"erroneous and false." The Russian Foreign Ministry promptly retorted, calling 
Bildt's statement "tactless and irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of Moscow's ire has been directed at the United States since the 
Senate voted, 89-9, on Wednesday to approve a GOP amendment that would suspend 
most aid to Russia unless it has withdrawn all of its troops from the Baltic 
states by the August deadline or strikes an agreement for withdrawal. Exempt 
from the cutoff would be food and other humanitarian aid, student exchange 
programs and assistance to resettle Russian soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, could ignore the provision under a waiver that would allow 
him to continue the aid if he determines it to be in the national security 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the waiver makes the amendment largely symbolic, it struck a 
sensitive nationalist nerve -- even among Russian liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never tell us what we have to do, especially when it concerns our interests," 
said Boris G. Fyodorov, the former finance minister who is considered a 
die-hard pro-Western reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Russians are endangered in any of these countries, we shall do (what) 
Americans do all over the world," he said, brandishing an index finger. "We 
shall be learning from the American democratic tradition how to send troops to 
some places. If you do it, why can't we do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 A great power must defend its threatened citizens and its interests, whether 
in Grenada or Haiti or Tallinn, the Estonian capital, Fyodorov and other 
lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent seven years in Soviet prisons, and there were Estonians among my 
cellmates," said former dissident and lawmaker Mikhail M. Molostovov. "We 
fought together for freedom and democracy. . . . And now, it is such a 
shocking, unpleasant surprise" to see the Estonians adopt "unjust" anti-Russian 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia welcomed the Senate vote. At a news conference in Moscow on Friday, 
Vello Saatpalu, chairman of the Estonian Parliament's foreign affairs 
committee, said that, besides the 2,000 Russian troops, Estonia has 12,000 to 
13,000 retired Russian officers living on its soil -- a potentially 
destabilizing force in a nation of 1.5 million.

 About 40,000 people have been naturalized as Estonian citizens, 30,000 have 
applied for Russian citizenship, and about 80,000 non-Estonians have left the 
country in the past four years, Saatpalu said. More than half a million 
non-Estonians were living in Estonia at the time of independence in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpening tensions further this week were reports in Russian media that 
Estonian President Lennart Meri and former Prime Minister Mart Laar had sent 
greetings to a reunion of Estonian veterans of the Nazi SS division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian foreign minister called the congratulatory message "blasphemy" and 
said the Estonian SS division had been responsible for the mass extermination 
of civilians.  
</P>
<P>
 Saatpalu said the Estonian SS division had been hastily formed as Hitler's 
army collapsed to defend against the invading Red Army. He said the allegations 
of massacres were "lies, brazen lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these frictions, Russian and Estonian sources said that planning is 
continuing for a meeting between Meri and Yeltsin that Clinton had requested in 
hopes of resolving the conflict. But Russia is dissatisfied with a citizenship 
bill proposed by Latvia, and a scheduled visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
S. Chernomyrdin to Riga may be canceled, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Russian troops are expected to leave Latvia on schedule by Aug. 31. 
Russia withdrew the last troops from Lithuania last August.

EU PICKS CHIEF; CRITICS CALL LOW-PROFILE CHOICE A BLOW TO INTEGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leaders of the 12-member European Union ended an embarrassing impasse Friday 
by selecting an uninspiring minor political figure as the next president of the 
union's powerful executive commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Their choice of Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer, 57, who has made 
almost no impact during his decade as leader of the EU's smallest member 
country, was greeted with a mixture of dismay and disbelief by advocates of 
stronger European integration. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed as expected next week by the European Parliament in Strasbourg, 
France, Santer will succeed Jacques Delors, whose second five-year term expires 
at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some feared that Santer's appointment would only encourage a challenge to 
commission power that has become increasingly visible from member states during 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the confirmation of our worst fears that Bonn, Paris and London want to 
cut back the power of the commission," said Stanley Crossick, chairman of the 
Brussels-based Belmont European Policy Center. "That's what's most disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernand Hermann, a Belgian member of the European Parliament from Santer's own 
Christian Democratic Party, added, "He's not the candidate of our dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction, which came earlier in the week as Santer's name first surfaced in 
speculative press reports, was so negative that those involved in the decision 
coupled the nomination with a plea to reserve judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he'll be given a fair chance of showing what he's capable of doing," 
said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who introduced Santer at a news conference 
here following the summit meeting. "We need someone who can bring reasonable 
compromise. Jacques Santer is the right man at the right moment." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same news conference, Santer echoed Kohl's plea, saying: "You have to 
judge me once I actually do something, not before. I'm fully committed to 
building the future of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Santer was a participant in several key events in recent years, including the 
1985 summit that committed the 12 nations to the single market and the historic 
1991 meeting in the Dutch city of Maastricht, where the leaders pledged 
themselves to the goal of full economic and political union. But he appears to 
have contributed little that anyone can recall to these occasions, nor does he 
seem to have made a mark in any other field beyond the borders of his tiny 
Grand Duchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction to Santer's appointment is in many ways a reflection of Delors' 
own stature and the high expectations he has created for the job. During his 
tenure, Delors breathed new life into the flagging EU, launching such 
revolutionary ideas as a European monetary union and transforming the member 
nations into a border-free, single, unified market for goods and services -- a 
task largely completed at the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, he built the office of EU commission president into one of the 
most powerful in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But it apparently was too powerful for the union's 12 national leaders, most 
of whom seemed more intent on taming the commission's challenge to their own 
power than in furthering the cause of European integration. Indeed, Santer's 
main qualification for the job seemed to be that he is unlikely either to pose 
a threat to those who chose him or to add significantly to the executive 
commission's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, his was the classic choice by "a smoke-filled room." The result is 
expected to further fuel the controversy about the lack of democratic 
involvement in filling the job some have come to call "president of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Germany now holds the rotating six-month EU presidency, the choice of 
Santer effectively was made by Kohl, who quickly sounded out the other 11 heads 
of government before Friday's emergency summit. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting came exactly three weeks after the 12 failed to agree on a 
candidate at a routine summit on the Greek island of Corfu. There, British 
Prime Minister John Major vetoed Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who 
was heavily promoted by France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, potentially more powerful, candidates -- including Dutch Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the EU's energetic 
trade commissioner, Leon Brittan -- also proved unacceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 Santer's appointment is especially significant because his five-year tenure 
spans a crucial period for the union. It faces a de facto constitutional 
convention in 1996 when the Maastricht Treaty on political and economic union 
comes under review. New initiatives to resolve Western Europe's severe 
unemployment problem and the task of integrating the former Communist 
democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the union are also considered 
vital for the region's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission wields considerable power, largely because it enjoys a monopoly 
in proposing EU-level legislation and directives -- a function it carries out 
with the aid of 15,000 civil servants.

IN PUZZLING MOVE, N. KOREA POSTPONES KIM FUNERAL; SURPRISE: SOUTH IS 
ASTONISHED. NORTH SAYS RITES DELAYED TWO DAYS TO COPE WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
MOURNERS. 
</P>

 In a move that astonished and puzzled South Korean leaders, North Korea today 
abruptly postponed a state funeral for President Kim Il Sung from Sunday to 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Pyongyang, monitored here, said the decision was made to cope with an 
increasing number of North Korean mourners who wish to pay their respects to 
the only leader the Stalinist nation ever knew in its 46-year history. Kim, 82, 
died of a heart attack July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's body, encased in a crystal casket surrounded by flowers, has been lying 
in state in the presidential palace in Pyongyang since Monday night, when his 
son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, 52, led top officials to pay the first 
round of respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Hong Koo, South Korea's minister of unification, said North Korea may have 
postponed the funeral "to maximize the feelings of (the North Korean people who 
want to) cherish the memory of their late leader to smooth the succession of 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "We have no intelligence reports that the transfer of power to 
Kim Jong Il is in trouble." He spoke after South Korean Cabinet ministers met 
to discuss North Korea.  
</P>
<P>
 The North Korean Central News Agency said the move reflected the "ardent 
feelings and demand of the people" to pay respects. "The number of mourners is 
ever increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourners will be allowed to pay respects through Monday, Radio Pyongyang said. 
The news agency said the funeral organizing committee, headed by Kim Jong Il, 
decided to stage a large memorial rally the day after the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement only a day before the funeral promised to cause major 
logistic trouble in Pyongyang. No details have been announced about plans for 
the funeral, but the Communist nation always held extravaganza-proportion 
celebrations of Kim's birthdays in which tens of thousands of North Koreans 
staged performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came a day after the Japanese government, in a white paper on 
defense, for the first time called the development of North Korean weaponry a 
grave threat to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Cabinet approved the long-planned annual defense policy paper eight 
days before Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama is to visit Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said North Korea is believed to have acquired chemical and 
biological weapons and is suspected of developing nuclear bombs to go along 
with a proven missile capacity. "The situation on the Korean peninsula has 
become a grave destabilizing factor for the security of East Asia, including 
Japan," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It noted that in May, 1993, North Korea successfully test-fired a missile with 
a range of 620 miles, meaning the device would be capable of striking Osaka, 
Japan. Pyongyang also is believed to be working on a longer-range version that 
could reach Tokyo and most of the rest of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the development of nuclear weapons is matched by the development of 
missiles, this could pose a more dangerous situation," the white paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirotsugu Ota, counselor at the Defense Agency in Tokyo, said Japan "would 
have to consider measures in the future if North Korea went ahead with its 
missile development." He did not elaborate, but his statement apparently 
referred to the development of an anti-missile system. The United States has 
offered to work with Japan to produce weapons capable of shooting down incoming 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Japanese government declared that Tokyo would not seek 
a nuclear arsenal of its own even if North Korea developed nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang, meanwhile, resumed propaganda attacks on South Korea by condemning 
Seoul for ordering a military alert immediately after the announcement last 
Saturday of Kim's death and for banning its citizens from offering condolences. 
It compared the alert order with "rashly igniting a fire at a funeral home." 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from sharing sorrow at the unexpected misfortune on the threshold of 
North-South summit talks, the South Korean authorities abused (Kim's death) 
politically and provoked their fellow countrymen (in the North) who have lost 
the leader of the nation," the North Korean Central News Agency commented. It 
said that South Korean President Kim Young Sam, who had been scheduled to meet 
the North Korean dictator July 25-27 in Pyongyang, "cannot be called a human 
being, still less a politician."

JAPAN CALLS NORTH KOREAN WEAPONRY DEVELOPMENT A THREAT

 The Japanese government, in a defense white paper approved Friday, for the 
first time called North Korean weaponry development a grave threat to Japan. 
North Korea, meantime, resumed its propaganda attacks on South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of charges interrupted a mourning period leading up to the funeral 
of North Korean President Kim Il Sung and underscored the continuing tensions 
in northeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral, initially scheduled for Sunday, was postponed until Tuesday, 
according to an announcement today by official North Korean media. The 
statement said the delay would allow more people to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Cabinet approved the long-planned annual defense policy paper a week 
after Kim died of a heart attack and eight days before Socialist Prime Minister

<P>
 On Monday, North Korea notified the South that a first-ever North-South summit 
would have to be "postponed." Its condemnation of Kim Young Sam was the first 
since the death of Kim Il Sung, who is expected to be succeeded by his 
52-year-old son, Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kim Young Sam and President Clinton agreed in a 20-minute telephone 
conversation to continue tripartite U.S.-Korea-Japan consultations to deal with 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and any changes in 
circumstances on the Korean peninsula.

NAMING OF NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTOR REVITALIZES COLOSIO SLAYING INQUIRY; MEXICO: 
THE MOVE, COUPLED WITH THE PROMISE OF PEACE TALKS WITH INDIAN REBELS, GENERATES 
AN ATMOSPHERE OF OPTIMISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost four months after the assassination of ruling party presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, the seemingly stalled investigation into his 
murder has been revitalized with a new special prosecutor who will have an 
additional support team of distinguished legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican politicians and other leaders were nearly universal Friday in praising 
the nomination of well-known prosecutor Olga Islas to replace Supreme Court 
Justice Miguel Montes Garcia in leading the investigation. Islas' appointment 
virtually assures that the probe will not be completed before the Aug. 21 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the atmosphere in the capital was hopeful Friday, contrasting sharply 
with the outrage that had greeted Montes' conclusion Tuesday that there had 
been no conspiracy to murder Colosio. Besides the assurance that the 
investigation would continue, Mexicans also received encouraging news about 
their nation's other major problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian rebels who rose up against the government Jan. 1 in Chiapas state 
and who last month rejected a peace proposal, late Thursday agreed to accept a 
new peace negotiator and to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary discussions with representatives of the rebels to establish a 
format for talks were to begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With that step, the government seemed to be moving toward solutions for two 
national concerns that had appeared to be mired in election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Islas' appointment signaled new life for the Colosio investigation on several 
fronts: It healed a rift between the special prosecutor and the attorney 
general's office; it created a mechanism to review Montes' investigation and 
suggest new lines of inquiry, and it coincided with the long-anticipated 
delivery of a subpoena to the father of alleged assassin Mario Aburto Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto was arrested immediately after Colosio was fatally shot during a 
campaign rally March 23 in a working-class Tijuana neighborhood. A second man 
was accused of helping him as investigators developed a conspiracy theory that 
would eventually include seven plotters. Three of those accused of aiding 
Aburto are still jailed, although Montes later said he found no evidence of a 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as soon as the investigation was taken away from the attorney general's 
office with Montes' appointment March 28, federal police and their bosses began 
criticizing his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The sniping diminished when then-Atty. Gen. Diego Valades was replaced by 
Humberto Benitez. But the resentment remained evident. The change, according to 
an editorial in the independent newspaper La Jornada, "is a measure that puts 
the investigation of this tragic episode back where it belongs -- with the 
federal attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Islas was Benitez's chief of staff when he was city attorney for the capital. 
She will be assisted by a commission charged with reviewing Montes' 
investigation and suggesting new lines of inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members include a former attorney general, a law professor who was 
once a police investigator, a well-known criminal defense lawyer and the chief 
justice of the Sonora State Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth panel member, Agustin Santa Marina, a corporate lawyer, was the only 
attorney named to the citizens panel, which had earlier been asked to oversee 
Montes' investigation and resigned when he refused to provide them with access 
to documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications suggest that the new lines of inquiry will include a fresh look at 
the possibility of a plot to kill Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto, father of the 23-year-old factory worker accused of killing 
Colosio, received a subpoena Thursday at his San Pedro home to testify in the 
case, said his attorney, Peter Schey. Ruben Aburto has told reporters that his 
son had spoken of attending political meetings with men now being held as 
co-conspirators. "That certainly brings into question the theory that Mario 
acted alone," Schey said. "It seems strange, to say the least, that after 
months of offering testimony he is finally called." 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoena was issued Wednesday -- before Montes resigned but after he had 
released his conclusion that Mario Aburto acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto plans to testify before a U.S. federal prosecutor, as permitted 
by a U.S.-Mexico treaty, Schey said. He plans to insist that the hearing be 
public. The U.S. attorney general's office refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The family remains concerned about Mario Aburto's treatment, but his father 
does not intend to condition his court appearance on the family's request that 
the imprisoned Aburto be allowed to see them, as well as private attorneys and 
doctors, Schey said. "He is not going to avoid a subpoena," the lawyer said. 
"The father is prepared to testify and he would like to do so."

MARXIST GUERRILLAS KILL 24 COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS

 Marxist guerrillas killed at least 24 Colombian soldiers in an ambush early 
Friday, and 18 rebels died in what officials call the worst attack against the 
army in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia attacked soldiers guarding oil 
facilities in Orito, near the Ecuador border. The rebels died in an ensuing 
battle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Army and police with helicopter support searched the jungle in the province of 
Putumayo for the estimated 400 guerrillas who took part in the attack, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, authorities seized a cache of explosives belonging to the guerrilla 
group, and Friday's attack may have been in reprisal.

NATIVE AMERICAN ACTIVISTS FINISH CROSS-COUNTRY 'WALK FOR JUSTICE'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Native American activist Dennis Banks and 27 others celebrated the end of a 
five-month "Walk for Justice" across the country at the Lincoln Memorial on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of 21 tribal nations demanded that President Clinton free Leonard 
Peltier, a former member of the American Indian Movement who they contend is 
innocent of killing two FBI agents in 1975 at Wounded Knee, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 activists who joined the 3,800-mile walk along the way participated 
in a series of traditional sage-burning and pipe ceremonies near the memorial 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight completed the entire walk. It began Feb. 11 at Alcatraz Island in 
California in an effort to draw attention to issues ranging from treaty rights 
and grave desecration to nuclear waste dumping and sports team mascots. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand people participated in part of this year's spiritual trek, 
including walkers from Japan, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France and Britain.

 "We knew from the beginning that we would have a hard time and that the many 
nations of people would help us along the way," said Banks, co-founder of the 
American Indian Movement. "What we were not prepared for was the great amount 
of support shown to us. Overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Several tribal elders wore red T-shirts reading "Free Peltier." Others donned 
colorful, traditional clothing, beating drums and singing Friday as 
temperatures rose into the 90s. Large black, red and yellow banners read, 
"Respect Mother Earth" and "The Black Hills Are Not For Sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders said they would present a 26-page document to Congress on Monday 
addressing topics from religious issues and land-use disputes to fishing rights 
and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with a "demand" for executive clemency for Peltier. He has been in 
prison since April, 1977, when a federal jury in Fargo, N.D., convicted him of 
the shootings of the two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 
southwestern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has twice denied his petitions for a rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh issued a statement opposing clemency, saying, 
"Peltier's guilt has been firmly established."

LAWMAKER CHARGES FISKE IS AIDING GOP ON WHITEWATER; CONGRESS: HOUSE BANKING 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HENRY GONZALEZ ASSAILS COUNSEL FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY AT 
HEARINGS. PROBE CHIEF DENIES ALLEGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) assailed Special 
Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. on Friday for refusing to testify at Whitewater 
hearings scheduled for later this month and accused him of secretly providing 
information to Republican committee members for partisan attacks on President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious over what he called a "premeditated Republican plan to do in the 
President," Gonzalez said he will proceed "full-speed ahead" with the hearings 
as scheduled on July 26, "despite the fact Fiske has breached his commitment to 
cooperate with the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's allegations, coupled with statements by Republican committee 
members that they will try to expand the scope of the inquiry, seem certain to 
turn the hearings into an acrimonious confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, now in his 33rd year in the House, charged that "the Republicans' 
main interest is in getting the President and his wife no matter what." He said 
he would "rein in" any Republicans who try to go beyond the scope of the 
investigation outlined in a House resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was present for the assassination of one President, and I won't be a party 
to the attempted assassination of another," said the Texas congressman, who was 
in Dallas when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. "The 
Republicans might as well have gotten a hit man; they've already attempted to 
assassinate Clinton's character." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), the committee's ranking minority member and GOP point 
man on the Whitewater matter, denied Republicans were making partisan attacks 
on Clinton. "My position," he said, "is that no individual is above the law and 
there ought to be fair and responsible accountability. We are just interested 
in full disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 As to Fiske, Gonzalez has repeatedly asked the special counsel to testify, 
which would help the committee in confining its hearings to subjects the 
counsel has finished investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, arguing that it would be inappropriate for him to testify, insisted 
Friday that he has already outlined the status of his investigation in a series 
of letters to Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 And the special counsel adamantly denied having given information secretly to 
Republican members. He acknowledged, however, that he met twice with Rep. 
William F. Clinger Jr. (R-Pa.) and agreed to let him see a U.S. Park Police 
report on White House aide Vincent Foster's suicide "as long as he agreed not 
to make it public." Fiske said he acted to avoid a lawsuit seeking disclosure 
of the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said that in curbing the Republicans during the Whitewater hearings, 
he would follow the same standards he said he had applied to a 1989 Banking 
Committee inquiry into the involvement of then-President George Bush's son, 
Neil, with a Colorado savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's improper questioning, I'll rein it in. I reined in the Democrats when 
they tried to be prosecutorial in questioning Neil Bush -- and his father, the 
President thanked me not once but three times for conducting a fair and 
impartial hearing," Gonzalez said, referring to the committee's probe of 
Silverado Savings & Loan. "Now the Republicans are trying to make it political 
and prosecutorial." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Clinton Administration official said the White House agrees with 
Gonzalez that "Republicans are out to get the President no matter what," but 
that it disagrees with his characterization of Fiske, a Republican who was 
appointed to the counsel post by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find Fiske to be very thorough, comprehensive and serious," said the 
official, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Republicans are faced with "a dicey political risk of trying to 
strike a delicate balance between being seen as doing their constitutional duty 
of seeing that there are no improprieties in White House operations and looking 
like they are making a petty, vindictive political attack that is resulting in 
gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy interview with The Times, Gonzalez also expressed irritation that 
Fiske now says his report on the handling of Foster's papers after the aide's 
death last July 20 will not be ready until some time in late August. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Fiske had indicated that this phase of his investigation would be 
completed in time for the Banking Committee to begin looking into the 
records-handling issue in its hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, who met with Fiske for 90 minutes on Friday, said he also had tried to 
persuade the special counsel to be the lead-off witness for the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minority as well as the majority wanted him to appear," Leach said in an 
interview. "But the majority wanted him to outline the parameters of his 
investigation so the committee would know what it couldn't ask. We'd like him 
to appear to defend his report" affirming that Foster's death was a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fiske refused to budge from his position against appearing, Leach said 
he told Gonzalez he had grave doubts about subpoenaing the counsel and 
compelling him to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who earlier had indicated he might subpoena Fiske, said that after 
talking with Leach, "I'm not going to subpoena him and make this a side-issue 
if Leach doesn't feel strongly enough to compel him as a witness to testify and 
make this bipartisan." 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 7 letter to Gonzalez, released by the congressman to The Times on 
Friday, Fiske asked that the committee not seek the testimony of a number of 
witnesses whose testimony he said is pertinent to his ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 They include government officials, Resolution Trust Corp. officials, and a 
confidential witness identified only as "C.W.," the person who first discovered 
Foster's body in a park overlooking the Potomac River.

MOTHER HANDS 7-YEAR-OLD SON TO RESCUER BEFORE SHE DROWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught in currents after accidentally driving into a rain-swollen lake, 
Victoria Hoffman struggled to keep her head above water while clutching her 
7-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 In a driving rain and growing darkness Thursday night, Hoffman screamed for 
help. Minutes later, she shoved her son toward a rescuer before she was pulled 
under the water to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hollered, 'Can you swim?' and she said, 'Yes,' but that she couldn't 
because she was holding onto the boy," said Mike Minyon, who helped grab the 
child, Gregory, and drag him ashore. "That was the last I saw her." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman's body was found about three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 With the thunderstorm apparently hampering her vision, Hoffman drove past a 
"No Outlet" sign about a mile from her Audubon home in suburban Philadelphia 
and into Crystal Lake, which was an estimated 15 feet deep, said Haddon 
Township police Detective Joseph Kite. The lake usually is no deeper than four 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing to stop her," Kite said. "The lake had overrun its banks 
and the curb was covered. She went right over the curb and then the current 
swept them in." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 6 1/2 inches of rain fell in the area in the two hours before Hoffman 
drowned, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, 32, and Gregory were able to get out of the car, but struggled to 
keep their heads above water while fighting the currents. A neighbor's shouts 
alerted Minyon, who lives along the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran down to the lake and I saw two heads bobbing in the water," Minyon 
said. "The mother was screaming for help. They were getting swept away, so I 
ran with them, telling her to keep hollering so we knew exactly where they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Minyon dove in and grabbed a huge branch that was floating in the water. He 
shoved it toward Hoffman, who then pushed the boy toward the branch and Minyon 
before slipping under. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rescuer, Ralph Angelotti, dove in when he saw Minyon and Gregory and 
helped pull the boy ashore using the branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory was treated for shock at a local hospital and released Friday, police 
said.

BREYER IS PRAISED, ASSAILED AS HIS SENATE HEARING ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court nominee Stephen G. Breyer was praised by the American Bar Assn. 
but called an insensitive extremist by consumer activist Ralph Nader as his 
confirmation hearing ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one witnesses testified for or against Breyer's nomination during a day 
in which most of the Senate Judiciary Committee's 18 members spent little time 
in the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee vote to approve Breyer seemed certain after he completed three 
days of testimony Thursday, and nothing transpired Friday to alter that 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in good shape," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said the committee will vote on the 
nomination as early as Tuesday and no later than Thursday. If the committee 
vote is Tuesday, Biden said, the full Senate could vote on Breyer by late next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABA gave Breyer its highest rating of "well qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington lawyer Robert Watkins said the association's 15-member committee on 
the federal judiciary unanimously accorded to Breyer the rating "reserved for 
the top of the legal profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, for the last 14 years a federal appellate judge in Boston, was 
referred to by Stanford University law professor Kathleen Sullivan as "a man of 
great even-handedness as well as open-mindedness." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader disagreed, calling the judge "extraordinarily one-sided" in favor of big 
business in cases involving competition and health-and-safety regulation.

CLINTON TARGETS MIDDLE CLASS IN BID TO SELL HEALTH REFORM; POLITICS: HE TAKES 
THE BATTLE FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ON THE ROAD. AT A RALLY, HE MAKES POPULIST 
APPEAL TO THOSE 'WHO HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, President Clinton is reaching back to the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 As his push to guarantee universal health insurance nears its critical final 
tests in Congress, he is returning to the message of middle-class populism that 
powered his presidential campaign but has been obscured by other controversies 
since he took office.  
</P>
<P>
 At a rally here Friday, Clinton evoked a campaign mantra and framed his 
struggle for universal health insurance as a battle to guarantee fairness for 
average families who "have played by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 "The politicians have it. The wealthy have it. The poor have it. If you go to 
jail you can get it. Only the middle class can lose it," he told an 
enthusiastic crowd pressed into a sweltering mass outside the county courthouse 
under a heavy blue and gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's rhetoric -- with its subtle stoking of middle-class resentments 
against Washington, the poor and the rich -- represents a kind of political 
jujitsu. It is a calculated effort to co-opt the anti-Washington, anti-tax 
sentiments that opponents have stoked to weaken public support for Clinton's 
vision of health care reform. It suggests that the health care end game largely 
will be a battle of dueling resentments -- with opponents attempting to inflame 
suspicion of government and proponents of universal coverage attempting to 
convince the middle class that anything less will leave them the losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the guise of saying we're making progress on health care," Clinton 
declared, "I don't want to see us pass a bill that will one more time give more 
help to the poor, raise middle-class insurance rates and leave more 
(middle-class) people . . . without insurance."  
</P>
<P>
 After making his pitch to the middle class, Clinton flew to Philadelphia as 
the headliner at two high-dollar fund-raisers for the state Democratic Party 
and Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford, who is facing a difficult reelection fight. 
At one event, 60 supporters paid $10,000 a head to mingle with the President. 
At the second, 250 paid $2,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's earlier appearance in Greensburg seemed almost a flashback to his 
campaign, in atmospherics as much as in rhetoric. In a scene reminiscent of his 
celebrated bus tours two summers ago, the narrow road leading from the airport 
in nearby Latrobe was lined with families waving flags and signs of 
encouragement. The crowd at the rally, many of them union members from nearby 
communities, was bombarded before and after Clinton's speech with blasting rock 
music from Fleetwood Mac and INXS. 
</P>
<P>
 At the speech, there were testimonials from average Americans: dairy farmer 
Louise Mastowski and Lynn Hicks, a mother of five, who both lost their health 
insurance and faced financial and emotional strains as a result. And there was 
Clinton himself, seemingly invigorated by the campaign atmosphere as he 
stripped off his coat and served up unvarnished attacks on his critics -- 
including some in the audience who held up signs criticizing his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we try to cover all the middle-class working people in the country 
. . . the same crowd got up with the same arguments and said this is socialism, 
this is rationing, this is government taking over the health care system," he 
said, leaning across the podium and stabbing the air with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who contend that health reform would impose rationing of medical 
care, Clinton said, the experience of the two women without insurance showed 
that the United States already engages in rationing by denying access to 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me how you can justify in the United States of America rationing 
health care to a (woman) like Louise . . . how you can justify rationing health 
care to a fine woman and her husband and their five children," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's words were aimed precisely at people like Janice Stanko, an 
accountant for a retail firm who drove 25 miles from Connellsville with her two 
sisters to hear the speech. All three women now have health insurance. But all 
worry that it could be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 To Stanko, the prospect seemed like a vicious circle: She said she worries 
that an illness serious enough to prevent her from working also could cause her 
to lose her job and insurance, leaving her vulnerable to huge medical costs. 
"You can't afford to pay for the coverage you need if you can't work because 
you're sick," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What she wants, she said, is guaranteed insurance that would cover her until 
she is old enough to be eligible for Medicare. But, like her sisters, she is 
unsure how to pay for such a guarantee and whether it makes sense to require 
employers to buy insurance for their employees. In their earnest confusion, 
they seemed to embody the ambivalence and hesitancy that Clinton is trying to 
slice through by presenting the choice facing Congress as one of fundamental 
fairness to the middle class.  
</P>
<P>
 For all Stanko's uncertainty, on one point she was firm: She wants Congress to 
do something this year to ease her fears. "I wish I had the answers," she said. 
"But that's why we pay those guys -- to come up with the answers."

RESIDENTS RETURN HOME AS GEORGIA FLOODING RECEDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Floodwaters receded Friday in all areas of Georgia, leaving behind short-range 
difficulties in finding clean water and long-term environmental problems 
involving spilled gasoline and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in small Georgia towns along the rain-swollen Flint River prepared 
to return to their homes after the National Weather Service reported that the 
river had crested at Bainbridge, the last town before the river empties into 
Lake Seminole along the border of Georgia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the flood drove more than 30,000 people from their homes. About 
3,800 residents of Bainbridge still waited for the floodwaters to recede from 
portions of the town in the southwest corner of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides concerns about flooded homes and businesses, other problems persisted 
throughout the state. In Macon, officials said their plans to restore municipal 
water supplies by Monday had been delayed by worse-than-expected flood damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Holcomb, executive director of the Macon Water Authority, said the city 
hopes to have water restored by the end of next week, but it could be 
mid-August before the water is safe enough to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Gov. Zell Miller has called the flooding the worst single natural 
disaster ever to strike the state. It began with four days of rain from 
Tropical Storm Alberto. 
</P>
<P>
 The state now faces a major problem with the congressional and gubernatorial 
primary scheduled for Tuesday. Floodwaters are still expected to be covering 
some polling places. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials said Friday that temporary polling places will be set up in 
tents to replace locations wrecked by the flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials also expressed concern for the potential 
environmental problems caused by the flood. Hazardous materials were stored at 
more than 1,300 flooded locations, said Bert Langley, emergency response 
coordinator for Georgia's Environmental Protection Division. "We're talking 
about 7,000 different chemicals," Langley said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of those sites are service stations storing gasoline. Langley said 
many of the gasoline storage tanks have broken loose from their moorings and 
are now floating downstream, spilling their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the toxic material has been diluted by the floodwaters, Langley noted. 
"A lot of the stuff that has spilled last week already is in the Gulf of 
Mexico," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the water itself poses an environmental risk. Officials of the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection said Friday that the huge glut of 
floodwater flowing through the state's Panhandle could threaten shellfish beds 
in Apalachicola Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists said the huge amount of fresh water could dilute the salt water 
necessary for the survival of oysters, crabs and other marine creatures.

WILDER TELLS GORE HE WON'T QUIT SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder has rejected an appeal from Vice 
President Al Gore to drop out of the state's U.S. Senate race, his spokesman 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Davidson said Wilder met with Gore on Thursday at the White House but 
declined to accept a proposal to step aside and unite the Democratic vote 
behind incumbent Sen. Charles S. Robb in an effort to defeat Republican 
challenger Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia race is shaping up as one of the most controversial of the 
November midterm elections. The seat is also being contested by former 
Republican state Atty. Gen. J. Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore issued a statement after his meeting with Wilder, saying: "My purpose in 
inviting my friend Doug Wilder to come for a visit was to tell him in person 
that I hope he will end up supporting the candidacy of Sen. Robb for 
reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilder said: "I told the vice president I was committed to running. That 
is final, complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder, the grandchild of slaves, was the first black to be elected a state 
governor. He has a longrunning and bitter personal rivalry with Robb.

ASTRONAUTS UNABLE TO REPAIR LAB INSTRUMENT DISABLED BY BUBBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Columbia's astronauts struggled Friday to fix a prime laboratory instrument 
that has been crippled by air bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the seven members of the shuttle crew spent most of their seventh day 
in orbit working on the trunk-sized electrical chamber, which is designed to 
separate components of cells, including worm DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit's cooling pump would not work because of bubbles in a water line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bubbles are very tenacious in space," NASA mission scientist Robert Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts tried three times to remove the bubbles by squirting water from 
syringes through the line. Ground controllers debated what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the guppylike Japanese Medaka fish, jellyfish, goldfish, newts and 
other creatures aboard the shuttle apparently did not rate very high with 11 
children who asked questions of three of the crew for a cable TV educational 
show. The youngsters were more interested in scary space stories, space 
sickness, space baths, space sleeping and space entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of giving descriptions, crew members demonstrated what they do for 
fun. Astronaut Richard Hieb squeezed liquid through a straw to form a big, 
floating bubble and then gulped it down. Commander Robert Cabana tossed M&Ms 
into the air, and then he, Hieb and pilot James Halsell Jr. dove after the 
candies.

WILSON ADMINISTRATION TO APPEAL COURT'S INVALIDATION OF WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Department of Social Services Director Eloise Anderson announced 
Friday that the Wilson Administration will seek reconsideration by the full 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco of a decision by a 
three-member court panel striking down millions of dollars in welfare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision this week, the panel ruled that the George Bush 
Administration had illegally approved welfare cuts enacted in 1992 by the 
California Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson.The court said 
that in approving the cuts, federal officials had failed to consider the 
hardship they would impose on poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, maximum cash benefits have been cut from $694 a 
month to $593 for an average family of three. Anderson said it is too soon to 
know the impact of the ruling if it is upheld, but estimated that the state 
could lose $175 million a year if it has to restore benefits to higher levels. 
Cash benefits are paid to the needy through Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children, a federal and state program commonly called welfare.

CUT IN FEDERAL AID FOR GARAGE COULD AFFECT DISNEY EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A federal transit agency will contribute only $17.5 million toward building a 
$223-million parking garage next to Disneyland because the seven-story 
structure would mostly serve the amusement park and its proposed expansion, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the garage has long been considered key to the Walt Disney 
Co.'s planned $3-billion park expansion, tying in to a countywide intermodal 
transportation center for cars, buses and light-rail trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County transportation officials had expected the federal government to 
pay $131 million of the cost of the 12,000-space garage, with Disney kicking in 
about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter sent last month to the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
federal officials objected that the garage appears intended "primarily for 
Disneyland," and they noted only 1,000 spaces will be available to public 
transit users, mostly park-and-ride commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency's position raises new questions about Disney's Westcot 
expansion and the Orange County transit agency's ability to fund the 
controversial garage project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mills, the agency's chief deputy, said Friday she remains optimistic that 
the local transportation authority eventually will get all the federal money it 
hoped for and called the proposed parking facility "a model." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that we will only receive $17.5 million," Mills said. Mills 
denied that the facility is intended for Disneyland's benefit.

U.S. GIVES CAL STATE $15 MILLION FOR CONVERSION OF FT. ORD INTO CAMPUS 
</P>

<TEXT>

 Commerce Secretary Ron Brown gave a $15 million check to California State 
University on Friday to convert the Army's Ft. Ord into the school system's 
21st campus."This campus will represent the first, I repeat, the first 
post-Cold War conversion of a military base to a university," Brown said at a 
news conference. The check will finance the conversion of 1,300 acres of the 
Monterey Bay area land and the renovation of 15 buildings, including soldiers' 
barracks, into dormitories and classrooms, Brown said. The base, valued at up 
to $1 billion, has resources including a medical clinic and an 8,000-seat 
stadium. Brown also announced a $2.9-million grant to review the environmental 
impact of base closures on California's coastal lands. Renovation of Ft. Ord is 
expected to start this summer. The base formally closes in October, but most of 
the 20,000 soldiers are gone.

UC TRIMS FALL TERM FEE INCREASE TO $345; EDUCATION: STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY 
PAID WILL NOT GET REFUNDS YET. REBATES ARE PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR -- UNLESS 
STATE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AFFECT THE UNIVERSITY BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Making good on their word to state lawmakers, the UC Board of Regents on 
Friday voted to limit undergraduate fee increases to $345 for the coming 
academic year, instead of the $620 it had approved earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote came too late for most UC students, who have already paid their 
fall bills based on the higher fees. University officials said they will hold 
on to the extra money and give rebates or discounts next year to make up the 
difference, but they warned that they may not if the state's finances take a 
nose dive by November. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the university's budgetary two-step rests with the 
$40.9-billion state budget, signed into law earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, before the spending plan was hammered out, the regents looked at 
budgetary projections and approved the $620 fee increase for undergraduates, an 
18% hike that brought the basic UC bill to $4,347 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, however, Gov. Pete Wilson and lawmakers asked university 
officials to limit the undergraduate increase to 10%, or a yearly bill of 
$4,100, in exchange for a slightly higher appropriation to the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that good turn, university officials say that the state could face new 
financial problems in November and that the overpayment by students could not 
prudently be refunded now. After November, if the UC budget is out of danger, 
university officials said they will lower undergraduate fees to $1,311 for each 
of the winter and spring quarters, effectively charging students a 10% increase 
for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who graduate or leave UC after the fall term will be sent a $92 
rebate, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC President Jack W. Peltason said the university could not give students an 
immediate refund because "the bills have gone out" and financial aid packages 
have already been figured according to the higher fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial aid will be a mess," said Dennis Galligani, assistant vice 
president for student academic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason's plan would also hold off giving university employees a 3% 
cost-of-living increase, totaling more than $40 million, until November. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the change in undergraduate fees, the regents did not go along with 
legislative suggestions to drop a $2,000 fee that new graduate students 
enrolling in five professional schools will be forced to pay this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the regents gave final approval to restructuring of the UCLA 
professional schools. The graduate schools of library and information sciences, 
social welfare and architecture and urban planning will be dismantled and a new 
school of public policy and social research created. No academic programs or 
degrees will be lost, but administrative overhead will be trimmed $7 million a 
year, UCLA officials say.

EX-LAWYER TOLD TO RETURN CLIENT'S BEQUEST; COURT: JAMES GUNDERSON HAD RECEIVED 
$3.5 MILLION IN THE WILL OF A 98-YEAR-OLD ORANGE COUNTY MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that attorneys described as without precedent in California, an 
Orange County Superior Court judge Friday ordered former probate lawyer James 
D. Gunderson to return $3.5 million he received from the estate of a 
98-year-old Leisure World man. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief written decision, Judge Byron K. McMillan said Gunderson should 
repay the money, plus $500,000 in interest, to heirs of Merrill A. Miller, who 
died in February, 1992, leaving an $18-million estate. Two days after Miller's 
death, Gunderson paid himself his one-fifth share of the estate, after selling 
Miller's substantial holdings of Abbott Laboratories stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's inheritances from the Miller estate, and from those of several of 
his other elderly clients, were brought to light in a series of articles 
published by The Times in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The articles prompted the state Legislature to pass a 1993 law that 
invalidated bequests to attorneys who prepare wills and trusts naming 
themselves as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Westover, a Phoenix lawyer representing eight heirs who contested 
the bequest to Gunderson, said he was delighted by the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will serve as a warning to all those lawyers, fiduciaries and people in 
positions (of confidence) that if they abuse their trust, they will pay for 
it," Westover said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a substantial number of published cases about attorneys who have, 
while acting as an attorney for a client, prepared a will in which the attorney 
was named as a beneficiary," he said in court papers filed last week. "In this 
particular instance, the ingenuity of James Gunderson, in devising other means 
by which he could profit from his clients' estates, has no precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Miller's estate, Gunderson arranged for a former law partner to 
serve as the attorney of record, when the final version of Miller's last will 
and some trust documents were presented to the blind and bedridden man only six 
weeks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, 69, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be reached for comment Friday, but during the civil trial he 
testified that Miller was his best friend and fishing buddy. Miller, he said, 
wanted his lawyer to have the lion's share of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, however, found in favor of eight other heirs whose attorneys 
claimed that Miller's "gift" to Gunderson followed a disquieting pattern in 
which the probate lawyer received lucrative inheritances from several other 
estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict against Gunderson is the latest in a series of actions triggered 
by the November, 1992, Times articles detailing how Gunderson inherited 
millions of dollars in cash, stock and real estate from clients whose wills and 
trusts had been prepared either by him or other members of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances appeared to conflict with a longstanding California Supreme 
Court ruling that anything more than a "modest" gift to an attorney preparing a 
will raised questions of impropriety. The justices in that landmark case 
decided that a $20,000 bequest was excessive and ordered that inheritance 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the Times articles appeared, the State Bar of California 
announced that it would conduct an investigation into Gunderson's legal 
practice. Gunderson surrendered his license to practice law in California in 
January of this year, after State Bar prosecutors announced that they were 
prepared to file conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his 
disbarment. Gunderson said he resigned because of his failing health.

KCBS APOLOGIZES FOR ERRONEOUS STORY ON SIMPSON PROSECUTOR; MEDIA: STATION 
RETRACTS SUGGESTION THAT CLARK WENT TO ESTATE BEFORE SEARCH WARRANT WAS SERVED. 
ETHICAL ISSUES BEYOND ACCURACY ARE RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KCBS-TV Channel 2 aired an extraordinary public apology Friday, admitting it 
had erred in broadcasting a splashy and hotly disputed story criticizing the 
conduct of prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's investigative reporter, Harvey Levin, appeared at the beginning 
of the noon broadcast to retract his story, which had aired Wednesday evening. 
In that report, Levin had suggested that Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark had 
arrived at Simpson's estate before the service of a search warrant for that 
property on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The station based its report on a time-stamp that indicated the tape had been 
filed at 10:28 on the day of the search. The search warrant for Simpson's home 
was signed by a judge at 10:45 a.m., and Levin announced that Clark's early 
appearance on the scene could have significant implications for the prosecution 
-- a premise that most legal experts disputed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, station officials said the tape actually was filed at 10:28 p.m. -- 
not 10:28 a.m., as Levin had maintained in his original story. Levin admitted, 
in a second explanation aired during Friday's 5 p.m. newscast, that the station 
could not pinpoint when the tape was made. 
</P>
<P>
 The story -- one of a series of erroneous or disputed reports that have 
surfaced since the media frenzy over the Simpson case erupted -- has ethical 
implications beyond the questions of accuracy: The technician who logged in the 
tape alerted news director Bob Jordan about the discrepancy Thursday evening, 
but the station aired the footage on its 11 p.m. broadcast and promoted the 
exclusive in commercials Friday morning touting its Simpson coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin's initial story was widely reported in newspapers and on radio and 
television programs, including CBS News morning newscasts Thursday and Friday. 
The network took the unusual step Friday of reporting the error on its "CBS 
Evening News," which had declined to pick up the original KCBS story. "We did 
not think it was relevant or reliable," said a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The KCBS retraction prompted industrywide speculation about possible corporate 
action against news management and reporters at the Los Angeles station, while 
media experts said the mistake reflected the pitfalls of the intensity of 
coverage surrounding the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This search for the competitive edge and the insatiable hunger for any scrap 
of information in this case has really hurt the media," said Maureen Rubin, an 
attorney and a professor of journalism law at Cal State Northridge. She added 
that the KCBS story, as well as other erroneous reports about evidence in the 
case by other news organizations, might result in public mistrust of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's heavy promotion of its Simpson coverage added to the 
embarrassment factor Friday. Anchor Michael Tuck had characterized Levin's 
initial story as "a bombshell" during the 5 p.m. newscast Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin himself, in a Thursday appearance on the "Michael Jackson Show" on 
KABC-AM, took credit for acting as one of the media's "constitutional police 
officers" safeguarding against sloppy work by police and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what happened," Levin told Jackson. "Sometimes, it's always a 
good idea to go back over videotape shot at the beginning of a story. . . . 
It's like a good movie, you see things the second time around." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I have a feeling that this tape is going to be subpoenaed today. It's 
going to end up being perhaps an important element in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after, the story began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office issued a blunt denial Thursday. According to 
several people who were at the scene, Clark did not arrive at the Simpson 
estate until after noon on the day of the search. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, KCBS stood by its story. But after Thursday's 6 p.m. newscast, 
station news director Jordan said, he was told of the discrepancy by a night 
shift technician who had filed the tape as part of the day's raw footage, and 
who told Jordan that the tape could not have been filed during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the footage of Clark at the scene aired during the station's 11 p.m. 
newscast Thursday as part of a report on the district attorney's rebuttal. 
Also, a commercial aired Friday morning during "CBS This Morning" listed the 
story among other "exclusives" KCBS had gotten in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Friday noon newscast, Levin told viewers, "We want to apologize. We 
now have reason to believe that we made a mistake in one of our reports." 
Explaining how the mistake could have occurred, and displaying the "10:28" 
label on the tape case, Levin said: "We no longer have any evidence to support 
our original story. Channel 2 and I would like particularly to apologize to 
Marcia Clark, the district attorney's office and to our viewers for this 
error." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said during an interview Friday that he did not become convinced that 
the time on the tape might be wrong until Friday morning. He said he ordered 
the commercial pulled at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an honest mistake, we regret it, and we apologized," Jordan said. "I'm 
not convinced that the time was in error, but I'm not confident that it's fact, 
so we had an obligation to retract the story."  
</P>
<P>
 The issue brought further attention to Levin, whose competitive style has 
rankled some colleagues, rivals and targets of his reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't apologize for being an aggressive reporter," Levin said Friday. "I 
stand on my record and the stories that I've broken. We have quality control at 
this station. We made a mistake, we know how it was made, we've corrected it, 
and it is something that will not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over the tape is just the latest in a series of disputed or erroneous 
reports about evidence in the Simpson case. Most notable have been an article 
stating that police had recovered a sharpened trenching tool that they believed 
was the murder weapon and a television report that a bloody ski mask had been 
recovered at the scene of the crime. Both were incorrect but were widely 
broadcast and discussed in the early days of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 (The Times did not publish either of those disputed reports, nor did it carry 
the KCBS-TV story.) 
</P>
<P>
 The station's actions Friday prompted a brief statement from the district 
attorney's office, saying that it appreciated KCBS' "taking responsible action 
in retracting its story." 
</P>
<P>
 Some media experts said the incident is a prime example of the pitfalls of 
pack reporting, particularly in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no other story would there have been an inquiry into what time the 
prosecutor arrived at the scene," said Bryce Nelson, chairman of graduate 
journalism studies at USC. "The coverage has gotten real excessive when there's 
nothing new to report. It leads to stories that can be harmful or dubious."

BOY CHARGED WITH MURDER IN GIRL'S DEATH; SLAYING: THE YOUTH, 17, ALLEGEDLY SHOT 
HIS FRIEND AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. HE WILL BE TRIED AS A JUVENILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy who allegedly killed his girlfriend while 
brandishing a handgun was charged with murder Friday by prosecutors who said he 
should have known the potentially fatal consequences of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an unusual move, prosecutors will not seek to have the youth tried as 
an adult, citing his lack of criminal history and their belief that he did not 
intend to kill the girl, Jacqueline Reay, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no juvenile record, and it's clearly not a first-degree murder," 
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said. "I think it's 
appropriate that it remain in the Juvenile Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn, a veteran prosecutor of murder cases, acknowledged that the district 
attorney's office has sought to try most juvenile murder defendants as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've done that in a while," he said of the decision 
to keep the case in Juvenile Court. "It was my suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim died Wednesday after the boy shot her in the eye with a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at point-blank range, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said the boy had been brandishing the gun and loading it and unloading 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with one count of murder and two counts of brandishing a 
firearm. Glynn said prosecutors, who will seek a conviction on second-degree 
murder charges, expect to file additional counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone would agree that pointing a gun at people and playing with 
it is a dangerous act," the prosecutor said. "He did it a number of times, and 
finally what happened is what you would expect to happen. Somebody got shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also disclosed that the boy's father -- the owner of the handgun 
used in the shooting -- is a former police officer in Los Angeles County. The 
father, whose name was not released, was unaware that his son had the weapon, 
Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information I'm given is he obtained the gun without his father's 
permission," Husband said. A woman who answered the phone at the boy's home 
declined to comment. She said the father did not live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said the charge against the boy is based on the concept of implied 
malice. Under that principle, prosecutors do not have to prove that the youth 
intended to murder Reay, Glynn said. Instead, they need only show that he 
committed an act likely to result in death. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Juvenile Court.

CITYSCAPES / JOHN JOHNSON: 'I DON'T BLAME THE INDUSTRY FOR MISTREATING HER. IF 
ANYTHING, THEY SPOILED HER ROTTEN.'; PORN STAR PUTS AN END TO HER LIFE IN THE 
FAST LANE

 After crashing her white Corvette and injuring her much-glorified face on the 
way home from another night of hard partying earlier this week, Shannon Wilsey 
sent a friend out to walk her Rottweiler, Daisy, and put a bullet in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 23-year-old sex video superstar known as Savannah, it was the most 
outrageous act in a short but outrage-filled public life. It was also the third 
major suicide in Los Angeles' adult video industry, whose most valuable and 
pampered commodity is beautiful but often troubled young women. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Shauna Grant put a .22-caliber rifle bullet in her head. Then 
Megan Leigh shot herself in the mouth after buying her mother a $500,000 dream 
house. Now Wilsey, the "adult industry's most celebrated star," according to 
the monthly magazine Adult Video News, has snuffed out her life apparently to 
end romantic and financial problems that only seemed to escalate as her fame 
and her income bracket expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a trend here? 
</P>
<P>
 Her family thinks so. They gave strict orders to limit the number of Wilsey's 
porn industry colleagues at the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether his daughter's problems were worsened by her involvement in the 
sex industry, Mike Wilsey replied: "Of course. People ask me if pornography is 
wrong. I say you can judge a tree by its fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rated industry has begun to respond to the implications of the violent 
deaths of its top stars. Plans are under way to establish a phone help line 
that performers experiencing personal crises can call 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the need for this, so it's going to happen in the name of 
Savannah and Shauna and the others," said William Margold, a member of the 
board of directors of the Free Speech Coalition, an industry umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether pornography helped destroy Wilsey, who reveled in her outlaw 
lifestyle, the people who had known her best since she burst on the scene five 
years ago as a cool, Elke Sommer look-alike, talk about a young woman who was 
seriously troubled before she ever shot her first X-rated video. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of her life, she was depressed and in debt and slept with a gun 
under her pillow for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sex industry contributed to Wilsey's demise, they say, it was by 
turning her into a pampered, highly paid star whose whims were indulged and 
tantrums endured. In an industry that shoots on a shoestring, she was known for 
pulling Hollywood-style stunts such as walking out in the middle of a 
production when a paramour rock star came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hollywood lifestyle is a fantasy, the sex video business is even more 
unreal because it gives its female stars celebrity and wealth but, unlike 
Hollywood, it can never give them respect and approval in the larger society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the industry for mistreating her," said another X-rated star 
known as Danyel Cheeks, 26. "If anything, they spoiled her rotten. They put us 
on such a high pedestal. The limos are sent out. Anything I want is pretty much 
done for me. Sometimes it makes the real world hard to deal with." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Like others in her world, Shannon Wilsey hoped to make the transition from sex 
star to legitimate actress. Like others in her world, she did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, many of Wilsey's wounds were self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents divorced in 1972 when she was 2. She grew up in Texas with her 
mother and then, after a brief stay with her father in Oxnard, lived with her 
grandparents in Mission Viejo, where she became a high school cheerleader. 
Wilsey told her manager, Nancy Pera, that her childhood was unhappy and that 
she had been molested. That is not uncommon for women who work in the sex 
industry, studies show. Many were abused as children. Mike Wilsey said his 
daughter never told him about any molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wilsey said she began dating rock star Gregg Allman while in high school, 
eventually going on the road with him for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to California and deciding to go to Hollywood, Wilsey drifted 
into adult entertainment, where she rose to fame in the world of screen sex as 
fast as anyone. Her symmetrical good looks, enhanced by two breast 
enlargements, and her curtains of blonde hair brought her to the attention of 
Vivid Video. The company signed her to a contract and starred her in a 
four-part "On Trial" series that revolved around a porn star's obscenity trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Her growing celebrity and wealth enabled her to indulge her instinct for 
excess. Her fascination with rock stars endured, according to Adult Video News. 
"I love sex and I love sex with rockers more than anything else," she said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of that was probably propaganda for the consumption of naive 
fans who think, or hope, that porn actresses have insatiable sexual appetites, 
her exploits eventually filtered out of the insular world of pornography. 
People magazine columnist Mitchell Fink reported two years ago that she and one 
rock star engaged in what Fink called "full hit whoopie" in a crowded New York 
bar, after which she jumped into a waiting limousine. It was then that the 
whispers began: Here was a woman headed for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Wilsey was named the industry's "best new starlet." At the awards 
show, she became an anti-Sally Field, reportedly saying in her acceptance 
speech: "I know a lot of you don't like me, but that's tough. I got my award." 
</P>
<P>
 She also developed a reputation for hard drinking and drug use. Her father 
said she used heroin for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pera said this hard, wild veneer was constructed to cover a very 
vulnerable and lonely young woman who never felt pretty. Wilsey believed she 
had no friends and had trouble trusting anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was very discriminated against because she was so big," Pera said. "She 
made big money. She knew her value." Her lavish tastes outstripped even her 
six-figure annual income. She bought designer clothes and decorated her leased 
house in the hills above Studio City with thousands of dollars worth of art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case in so many suicides, there was no single precipitating event. 
Some said her career had started sliding, but it appears more likely that she 
was growing frustrated over her inability to break away from the videos, as she 
told Pera she would do, or break into legitimate acting roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera, 46, who considered herself as much a second mother as a manager, said 
Wilsey had been depressed for months over her breakup with rock guitarist 
Slash. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Geffen Records denied that Slash had a romantic relationship 
with Wilsey. "If she was (carrying a torch) it was completely one-sided," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Wilsey's problems were escalating. "Maybe I should kill myself," 
friends said she told them on more than one occasion. Police said she owed 
money to the Internal Revenue Service and her savings account was so depleted 
that she had arranged to send Pera money to cover checks already written from 
Nyack, N.Y., where she was booked for a nude dancing engagement at a club 
called Lace. 
</P>
<P>
 Although videos launch careers in the adult entertainment business, dancing is 
where real money can be made. Wilsey earned as much as $5,000 a night as a 
featured performer. 
</P>
<P>
 The engagement had been scheduled to start Monday, but Pera said Wilsey was 
out late Sunday night partying and riding around in a limo with a young man who 
was housesitting for the band House of Pain. Pera said Wilsey had been dating 
one of the band's members. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilsey drove up the winding road to her house just after 2 a.m. so erratically 
that her passenger complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," she replied. Then she crashed her Corvette into a picket fence, 
taking out part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera said she was awakened a short time later by Wilsey's hysterical call. 
"I've just had a horrible car accident," the woman wailed. "I broke my nose. 
It's bleeding really bad and I've hit my head. You have to take me to the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Pera dressed and drove to Wilsey's house, not too hurriedly because she was 
used to late-night calls from Wilsey. When she arrived, she found Wilsey's body 
lying in the garage in a pool of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera saw the exit wound from the bullet. "It looked like she had a big flower 
on the side of her head," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pera said Wilsey got the gun from a friend for protection against prowlers. 
She slept with it under her pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Police ruled the death a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many in the business, Paul Fishbein, publisher of Adult Video News, 
resents any implication that pornography could have played a role in Wilsey's 
death.  
</P>
<P>
 "Porn didn't do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing on industry coalition leader Margold's mind these days are not the 
deaths that have occurred, but the ones waiting to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 "Six weeks ago at 3 a.m. I got a call from an actress who said the business 
has no soul. She said four years ago somebody told her that and then that woman 
killed herself." 
</P>

WORLD CUP USA 1994; REFUND OFFER ONLY ANGERS MERCHANTS; BUSINESS: PASADENA 
OFFICIALS AGREE TO MAKE PARTIAL PAYMENTS TO VENDORS CLAIMING LOSSES AT THE 
SPARSELY ATTENDED SOCCER CARNAVAL. FAILURE OF THE FESTIVAL IS THE LATEST IN A 
SERIES OF CIVIC DISAPPOINTMENTS INVOLVING THE WORLD CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging that a city-sponsored soccer festival has drawn dismally small 
crowds, Pasadena officials Friday offered partial refunds to about 20 vendors 
who paid thousands of dollars to rent booths. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer left the merchants enraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically they have decided we should sue them," said Brian Mercer, a toy and 
hobbies vendor. "We were told this would be a world-class event when we bought 
into it. But the truth is, business has been so bad the only people buying most 
days were other vendors." 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Mercer stood in Brookside Park, the site near the Rose Bowl where 
the festival called Soccer Carnaval was to be a monthlong celebration of the 
World Cup games, complete with big-name entertainment, soccer events, ethnic 
foods and children's carnival rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the booths were empty, covered by plastic. An occasional visitor would 
wander through and stop at Mercer's booth for an explanation of why the place 
seemed closed on the day before the big weekend of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The city joined with local promoter Pasadena Productions to launch the 
festival after the World Cup placed its official soccer celebration, 
Soccerfest, in Los Angeles. With corporate sponsorships, admission fees and 
booth rentals, organizers predicted that the festival would bring in more than 
$600,000 for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the festival opened June 23, it had no corporate sponsors, the 
idea of an admission fee had been dropped, and the World Cup had used the clout 
in its contract to forbid the city to open the event on game days, when the 
crowds come to town. After the first, virtually empty Sunday, the carnival ride 
operator packed up and left the city scrambling for a replacement -- who also 
left a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors said that when they signed contracts with the city, they were told 
that the carnival would be open on game days. The merchants paid from $2,000 to 
$7,000 to rent booths, but said they are owed far more because of the money 
they invested in stock and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most vendors are demanding $20,000 to $80,000 apiece. "I am out $14,000 to 
$15,000. I expected to make $60,000," said Mercer, whose family has owned 
Natick Stamps and Hobbies in Monrovia since 1887. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials told vendors Friday that the refund would be based on how many 
days they opened their booths at the festival. The officials also said the city 
may help the vendors gain access to other events in the city, such as UCLA 
football games, said Melvin Kum, co-owner of Tokyo Grill, who met with city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We signed our contract believing this would be open on game days," said his 
brother and co-owner, Gary Kum. They had paid $7,000 in rent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they probably will not pay more than $5,000 to any 
merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel we are liable for anything, but we feel we should help these 
people out," said Bob Hays, city liability coordinator, who met with vendors 
after the City Council directed its staff Monday to reach a settlement with the 
unhappy merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Philip Hawkey and Pasadena Productions President Richard Lukens 
say the contract never said the event would be open on game days. Lukens said 
his group of promoters is out more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is a risky venture and in this case it did not work out," Hawkey 
said. "World Cup has not flooded Pasadena with visitors as expected." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of visitors has been the latest in a string of the city's 
disappointments with World Cup '94. The soccer event's organizers earlier had 
forbidden the city to raise money for economic development by having the 
Chamber of Commerce sell game tickets at a profit. The city felt slighted when 
World Cup put Soccerfest in Los Angeles, and then felt downright insulted when 
a huge sign went up in front of the Rose Bowl that said Los Angeles instead of 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Most vendors paid for their spaces after the city announced June 13 that 
Soccer Carnaval would be open on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city backed down two days later after the soccer organization 
threatened to sue and to use its control of area security to block access. A 
1992 agreement signed by the city cedes control of the area to World Cup on 
game days. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Assistant Vice President Brad Rothenberg has said that for security 
reasons, his organization did not want people flooding the area on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and Pasadena Productions also have alleged that World Cup told 
their major corporate sponsors to steer clear of the event -- an accusation 
that Rothenberg denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city manager signed away the city without thinking about the community 
and small businessman," said Joseph Gonzales, among vendors calling themselves 
the Soccer Carnaval Vendor's Assn., who took their fight for compensation to 
the council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they found support from Councilman Isaac Richard: "It should be soccer 
Con-a-val. I am embarrassed and I am ashamed to go down there. You (the 
vendors) were hustled, and there is a word for that and it is called fraud."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; HE SAYS ITALIA, SHE SAYS BRASIL; IN THEIR MARRIAGE, SOCCER 
RIVALRY RAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's Italian, she's Brazilian, and they are both rabidly patriotic soccerfans. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough to drive a marriage counselor to tears -- what with those 
two countries facing each other in the emotional World Cup final Sunday -- 
there's more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo and Mercedes Pellegrini married in 1970, a few months before their 
beloved teams last met for the most coveted sports trophy on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil delivered an ugly 4-1 beating to Italy, and for the next 12 years, 
Mercedes had bragging rights. Then in 1982, Brazil was eliminated in early 
rounds and Italy went on to take the Cup. Ronaldo uncorked some 
Mediterranean-sized gloating. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mercedes figures it's almost her turn again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge," she said Friday, rolling the word out with a Portuguese accent, 
savoring its sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The man of the house is a bit nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I'm going to have to eat humble pie," Ronaldo admitted. "I don't 
think the (Italian) coach brought up enough forwards." 
</P>
<P>
 In their house on a hill in Calabasas, the Pellegrinis' international love 
match plays itself out with a passion that only a true soccer fan could 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 The colors of Italy and the colors of Brazil hang from the mantle, held in 
place by a host of soccer trophies won by two of the three Pellegrini girls. 
The children's television has also been put to use, installed at the family's 
Italian restaurant, Vittorio in Pacific Palisades, so they can follow the games 
-- and insult each other's teams -- while they work. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the interest of familial harmony, the menu for Sunday's game-time 
shindig at home has been planned with delicate diplomacy: Italian sausage and 
pizza for dinner, Brazilian briggadero and beijinho for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For both parties in the Pellegrini soccer feud, love of the game goes back 
decades, and team loyalties preceded marital vows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo, born in Chicago to Italian immigrants, acquired his voracious 
appetite for soccer during travels for the import-export business he still 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes is a native of Sao Paulo, and although girls in Brazil seldom play 
the game, she said, she followed the local team as closely as any boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Brazil you're born with soccer. Every empty field, it's a soccer field," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have followed the World Cup since they were married, but with full 
television coverage available for the first time here this year, dozens of 
friends -- Brazilian and Italian -- have occupied the house for nearly a month, 
and the rooting has been especially heated. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is Brazilian through and through -- the hugging, the screaming," 
Ronaldo said, evidently under the impression that Italian soccer fans are known 
for their emotional restraint and cool detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo has been forced on the defensive this year. Not only are the 
Brazilians playing better soccer than the Italians, he said mournfully, but he 
is outnumbered by Brazilian fans, 6 to 1, in his own home. In addition to his 
wife, their three daughters (even Sabrina, 15, who was wearing an "Italia" 
shirt Friday), one granddaughter and the housekeeper are all rooting for the 
green and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 17-year-old daughter Vanessa: "I mean, Dad, I love you and everything, 
but it's Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 But he isn't surrendering early. "Italians are lucky," he said, and could 
still pull off a win come Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes agreed that Italians are lucky, just not lucky enough in her opinion 
to beat her Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although bets as high as $100 have changed hands from one Pellegrini to 
another on previous games, nothing is wagered on the Sunday finale -- nothing 
except bragging rights at least until the next World Cup, in their 28th year of 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so little in common," Mercedes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opposites attract," Ronaldo replied.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; AN EYESORE IS TRANSFORMED INTO NET ASSET; SPORTS: PRIVATE 
DONATIONS -- NONE FROM WORLD CUP -- TURN TRASHY LOT INTO SOCCER FIELD. 
ACTIVISTS SAY MONEY FROM INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT HAS NOT REACHED THEIR AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For years, the debris-strewn lot along 3rd Street just west of Downtown has 
been the haunt of drug dealers and prostitutes, a sinister place avoided by 
wary neighborhood parents strolling with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dump," said Gustavo Salazar, a resident of nearby Pico-Union, the 
densely populated and park-starved heart of Los Angeles' huge Central American 
immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half the area's population is younger than 18. Green space is rare and 
graffiti-splashed walls are prevalent. The rate of poverty is almost double the 
citywide average. Kids play soccer -- the principal sport in this Latino 
immigrant enclave -- on streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, the 3rd Street lot was the site of a dramatic 
transformation: Hundreds of youths kicked soccer balls on a manicured, newly 
seeded soccer field where homeless people's shanties once stood. Guiding them 
were veteran community coaches like Fernando Bautista, still stunned that a 
longtime eyesore would now be available for his teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a pleasure," said Bautista, who has dedicated much of his life 
to shuttling area kids throughout the city, looking for often-elusive fields to 
play soccer on. Inevitably, baseball, softball and U.S. football take 
precedence on limited park space. "We need two or three more of these fields," 
Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
 Private donations from more than 50 organizations, including the Los Angeles 
Times, financed the new site, dubbed the "Field of Dreams." Administering 
activities is the Stuart M. Ketchum Downtown YMCA, whose officials negotiated a 
long-term lease with the landowner, Cathay City Development, part of a Hong 
Kong concern. The park is temporary, pending development of the site -- 
something that is not expected for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By then, said Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents the district and 
pushed for the new park, the hope is that comparable soccer fields will have 
been created nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The field's inauguration was timed to coincide with the World Cup, though no 
World Cup money was used in the project. With the monthlong soccer celebrations 
about to conclude, many community activists are bemoaning what they call the 
lack of Cup proceeds directed to seeding fields and related efforts citywide -- 
particularly in urban zones with swelling populations of soccer-crazed new 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a huge, huge lost opportunity," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, who 
heads the Tourism Industry Development Council, a nonprofit group that seeks to 
link tourism to inner-city economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 With considerable fanfare, World Cup organizers had vowed to leave a legacy in 
Los Angeles and other host cities. Now, as Sunday's final game concludes World 
Cup '94, Janis-Aparicio and other critics say they've seen little concrete 
evidence of benefits from the marketing extravaganza accruing to the soccer 
enclaves of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever legacy they're talking about hasn't touched the Latino 
neighborhoods," said Oscar Andrade, executive director of El Rescate, which 
works with Central American refugees in the area. "They haven't touched this 
part of town." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, World Cup officials say their promised bequest is well in place. 
Organizers cite refurbishments of five fields areawide and installation of four 
planned artificial-turf practice sites, one already in place at the Nickerson 
Gardens housing project, along with donations of 500 soccer balls, 97 uniforms, 
500 T-shirts and 12 sets of goals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup also donated more than $250,000 to the newly created Los Angeles 
Soccer Foundation, which, officials said, plans to finance field improvements, 
sponsor clinics and provide equipment, among other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've exceeded expectations," said Brad Rothenberg, assistant vice president 
of World Cup USA. "I think the impression everyone has is that the World Cup 
has extremely deep pockets. But we can't satisfy everybody. . . . Anything we 
do is gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the legacy has not yet been evident to Jess Kimbrell, one of the 
harried city parks officials who struggle daily to match some of the thousands 
of club teams in the area with limited numbers of available fields. This 
spring, authorities made city fields available to World Cup organizers, who 
conducted soccer clinics and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were telling us they would leave a legacy, but we didn't see it," said 
Kimbrell, senior director of municipal sports for the city of Los Angeles. "We 
haven't gotten anything from them. We haven't even seen T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of fields -- not a paucity of interest -- is often considered the most 
pressing hurdle facing the development of soccer in Los Angeles. At Belmont 
High School, a perennial city soccer power that draws from a large Central 
American and Mexican-born student base, players often practice on concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see a little bit of the profit of the World Cup go towards making 
more fields," said Nancy Carr-Swaim, a Belmont physical education teacher who 
coaches the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Mayor Richard J. Riordan complimented the effort of World Cup 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the World Cup has been very good," the mayor said during the 
inauguration of the 3rd Street park. "The glass was half-empty, now it's 
half-full, and I think they had a lot to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many area residents came out Friday to view firsthand the transformation of 
the 3rd Street site, which is virtually in the shadow of the glittering 
high-rises of Los Angeles' financial district. Though plans to build the field 
have been in the works for 18 months, a volunteer corps only completed cleanup 
last weekend, hauling away remaining refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will be staffed six days a week through grants from the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, which was set up with profits from the 1984 
Olympics. At the site, instructors will offer soccer clinics and youth leagues, 
along with ongoing education, arts and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Barrientos, a 26-year-old mother of three and avid soccer fan from 
Guatemala, examined the shiny new grass and set eyes on hundreds of youngsters 
cavorting on what was long a dumping ground. "This," she concluded, "will give 
the kids something besides gangs and graffiti."

 The mall isn't a traditional first stop for sailors when they hit port in a 
strange land. 
</P>
<P>
 But topping the must-see list for 120 Japanese sailors who arrived in Ventura 
County Friday was a trip to The Oaks, the county's largest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The sailors from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force will attend 
barbecues and beach parties during their weekend here, and they will spend 
hours reviewing the missile tests that they performed near Point Mugu during 
the past two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 But all that would have to wait until they got their shopping out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to buy clothes and gifts for our families," said Shinpei Sugimoto 
through an interpreter. "We're glad we've had the chance to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 The sailors, who were mildly hindered by their inability to communicate with 
merchants at the giant Thousand Oaks shopping plaza, said they hoped to find 
bargains with as little confusion as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can tell, most of them are looking for deals," said Andrew Hill, 
a 21-year-old Simi Valley resident who acted as the sailors' interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them they could get tennis shoes and they asked, 'Are they cheap?' I 
told them about the Disney Store and they asked, 'Is it cheap?' I told them 
everything's cheaper than it is in Japan, and they said 'Ahhhh!' " Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the greatest obstacle for the crewmen from three guided missile 
destroyers was a group of teen-agers at Robinsons-May, who tried with little 
success to persuade the visitors to sign up for store credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they'll ever understand what that was all about," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese sailors spent three hours wandering through the mall, buying 
everything from T-shirts to electronic items. 
</P>
<P>
 Many made trips to a nearby bank and exchanged from $600 to $1,000 worth of 
currency to spend during their visit. Given the dollar's recent plunge in 
currency markets, the Japanese got a favorable rate, bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials said it was an honor -- and a pleasure -- to welcome the 
sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course this is going to be good for business," said Diane Brandes, 
director of marketing for The Oaks. "We are always excited when groups like 
this decide to visit us." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandes said she expected items such as blue jeans, perfume, tennis shoes and 
merchandise from the Disney and Warner Bros. stores to be the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect them to look for things that are uniquely American," Brandes 
said. "And of course they are looking for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to discounts and promotions the sailors received, the mall gave 
them a place to store their packages and offered them cookies and sodas if they 
wanted to take a break during their three-hour spree. 
</P>
<P>
 As they roamed through The Oaks, several of the sailors marveled at the mall's 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here is on a different scale," said Masanobu Uchino through an 
interpreter. "It's much wider -- much more space." 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Navy officials said the Japanese changed their plans several times as 
the sailors' arrival date drew near, but shopping at the mall was always on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the No. 1 thing on their list," said Teri Reid, a U. S. Navy 
representative. "Most of them are young and this is the first time they've been 
here, so I guess they wanted to do some shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their visit to the mall, the sailors played golf, attended a 
barbecue in Oxnard, and went to the beach. The commander of the group, Rear 
Adm. Michio Yamada, visited Port Hueneme City Hall to exchange flags with city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they came ashore, 700 sailors from the three ships were part of a group 
of nine Japanese vessels conducting missile tests on the U. S. Navy's sea test 
range, which covers 25,000 square miles between Point Mugu and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting for us to get a visit like this," Reid said. "I hope we 
showed them a good time."

FILLMORE PATIENT FIGHTS 'FLESH-EATING' BACTERIA; MEDICINE: THE 63-YEAR-OLD 
WOMAN IS TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL IN THOUSAND OAKS FOR EMERGENCY THERAPY TO FEND 
OFF THE INFECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fillmore woman suffering from the so-called "flesh-eating bacteria" was 
rushed into emergency therapy Friday to stop the spread of the dangerous strep 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Polido, 63, entered Santa Paula Memorial Hospital a week ago with 
fever, nausea and a pimple on her left thigh, family members said. By Friday, 
the pimple had grown into an open sore stretching from her groin to her knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Polido was transported to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks 
and placed immediately in a pressurized chamber, where she was given doses of 
pure oxygen to fortify the surrounding flesh and tissue so it will fend off the 
spread of bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing here is not only treating the patient, but we are preserving 
the tissue, so that she won't have to undergo amputation," said J.B. Wilmeth, 
the internal medicine physician supervising her treatment at Los Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth said he did not know how Polido encountered the dangerous mixture of 
streptococcus bacteria and other germs. But he said the woman's age and the 
fact that she suffers from diabetes makes her particularly susceptible to 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, a 35-year-old triathlete from Santa Barbara lost most of 
the flesh on his left leg, and could have lost his life, from a strain of the 
dangerous bacteria. The episode, he said Friday, also began with a pimple. 
</P>
<P>
 Polido's case is the first that Ventura County health officials have heard of 
this year, but they noted that physicians are not required to report instances 
of the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth said that Los Robles treats about five to eight cases a year, 
including patients from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. He said he recalls 
three cases so far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder has gained notoriety in recent weeks after a spate of deaths in 
England and a flurry of media attention to cases throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the bacteria has turned up in Ventura County should not be cause 
for alarm, health officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to be paranoid about it," Ventura County Public Health 
Officer Gary Feldman said. "The germs are ubiquitous. Every surface on the 
planet is covered with microorganisms." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem develops when there is a breakdown, a cut in the flesh or a lapse 
in the immune system, that allows infection to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Polido began feeling sick about two weeks ago, said her daughter, Lupe Medina 
of Fillmore. After a week of vomiting and fever, Polido was admitted to the 
Santa Paula hospital Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors were puzzled by the sore on her leg that would not heal, Wilmeth said. 
They performed surgery Thursday night and realized that they were dealing with 
the bacterial phenomenal known as necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of hours, the sore spread down to Polido's knee and across her 
leg, he said. Shortly after noon Friday, Polido arrived by ambulance at Los 
Robles for treatment in a special hyperbaric chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The cylindrical chamber is also used for divers suffering "the bends," 
decompression sickness that occurs when the body changes pressure too quickly. 
In this case, it was used to deliver a 1 1/2-hour dose of pure oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth twisted the dials, adjusting the atmosphere to the pressure of 
seawater 50 to 60 feet deep. A technician inside the chamber slipped a mask 
over Polido's face and she began breathing 100% oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 The oxygen kills certain bacteria and makes the antibiotics work more 
efficiently, Wilmeth said. It also makes the unaffected tissue around the wound 
healthier and more resistant to the spread of infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The sore, he said, spread from her left thigh down to her knee and extends 
deep into the muscle lining and muscle. It has also begun to affect her torso 
and may have moved into her bloodstream, according to preliminary tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth classified Polido's condition as critical, but said she appeared 
healthier after the first treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very scared," Medina said of her mother. "She didn't know until this 
morning how serious it was." Also, she said the spreading sore is causing her 
mother pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina said she was frightened by the diagnosis. "I didn't even understand 
what it was," she said. She was vaguely aware of the recent media attention to 
the disorder. "Sometimes you don't pay attention to it. It's never going to 
happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa Palmer at the Fillmore Flower Shop was surprised to hear of Polido's 
diagnosis. She delivered a spring bouquet to the woman on Thursday at the Santa 
Paula hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have left them in the front had I known that," Palmer said. 
"I'm not going to worry about it, but I'm going to check myself more." 
</P>
<P>
 The flesh-eating bacteria is not contagious, but it does exist in most 
environments, doctors say. Anyone with a stubborn sore that will not heal 
should seek medical attention, Wilmeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the public, he added, should not panic. "We've been dealing with 
the disorder for many years," he said. "There's no question the infection has 
been around." 
</P>
<P>
 The first cases were noted in the 1920s, before antibiotics were available to 
treat it. Doctors trace the disorder to a variety of bacteria. Santa Barbara 
triathlete Bernard Donner is suffering from a Group A streptococcus infection, 
while Polido shows signs of Group B strep and other bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 With the discovery of penicillin, doctors successfully treated many such 
cases. But even today, some episodes go beyond what antibiotics can handle and 
require the hyperbaric treatment Polido is receiving or more drastic solutions 
such as amputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth said he is hopeful that the treatment can stop the infection and save 
Polido's leg. She could still require extensive skin grafts to replace the skin 
destroyed by the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner received grafts to cover his sore, which spread to 2 feet long, 6 
inches wide and 4 inches deep. His physician at Sherman Oaks Hospital and Burn 
Center, Dr. A. Richard Grossman, said about 85% of the skin grafts have taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner will have at least one more skin graft early next week and could be 
released by next weekend, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference Friday, Donner said his infection started as a pimple 
that resembled an ingrown hair. He began feeling lethargic, but did not connect 
it to the bump on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never bigger than a quarter," he told reporters. "There was never any 
outrageous growth or flesh deterioration. It was a little bump. It never 
occurred to me that within 24 hours, I could have been dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Miguel Bustillo and Timothy Williams contributed to this 
story. A Virulent Disorder 
</P>
<P>
 Popularly called "flesh-eating bacteria," the disorder necrotizing fasciitis 
is caused by a virulent strain of streptococcus and other germs. Despite recent 
media attention, the problem is not new or even more widely reported, health 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition develops when the body succumbs to any of a series of dangerous 
bacterial infections. The bacteria exists in most environments. It attacks the 
body when there is a breakdown, either a cut in the skin or a lapse in the 
immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning signs include a sore that will not heal or that changes 
dramatically. Some victims suffer fever, nausea, lethargy and other flu-like 
symptoms. Anyone dealing with a persistent sore should contact a physician.

UNIDENTIFIED BODIES TEST CORONERS; INVESTIGATION: OFFICE CRACKS ONE OF ITS 
TOUGHEST CASES, THAT OF A 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN KILLED SEVEN YEARS AGO ON THE 
VENTURA FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least eight times a year, Ventura County coroners are faced with what can 
become the most challenging cases of their profession: a dead person whose name 
is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bodies are identified within a few days, their fingerprints matched with 
prints stored in a vast computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few take longer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the coroner's toughest cases was cracked this week, when Deputy Coroner 
Jim Wingate identified a young woman known for seven years only as Jane Doe No. 
871-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a set of fingerprints faxed to his office from the Las Vegas Police 
Department, Wingate on Thursday identified the woman as East Coast native 
Jaqueline Cohen.  
</P>
<P>
 Cohen was a 19-year-old resident of a little town called Dobbs Ferry, located 
20 miles north of New York City, when she disappeared from a mental institution 
in New York City on May 18, 1987, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was killed in Ventura County 17 days later, when she walked straight into 
the southbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway near Wagon Wheel Road and was 
struck by a motorist, Wingate said. Cohen died instantly of traumatic head and 
abdominal injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she carried no identification, she became a Jane Doe, an anonymous 
designation given to any female whose name is unknown. Unidentified males are 
called John Does. 
</P>
<P>
 As her remains lay unclaimed in Ventura County, Cohen's parents on the East 
Coast spent seven years searching in vain for her.  
</P>
<P>
 For them, finally learning the details of her death was shocking, despite the 
passage of the years. Her father, Stan Cohen, had called the Dobbs Ferry Police 
Department on the anniversary of her disappearance each year to check on the 
progress of the case, said Dobbs Ferry Police Sgt. Bill Gelardi. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he called on her birthday too, Gelardi said. Jaqueline Cohen's 27th 
birthday would have been Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I relieved?" asked Stan Cohen on Friday, when asked about the discovery. 
"No, I am not relieved," said the resident of Rye Brook, N.Y. "I'm sorry, but I 
can't talk right now." 
</P>
<P>
 While it is always difficult to inform family members about the death of a 
loved one, solving Doe cases invariably brings a sense of closure in the 
coroner's office that is satisfying, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always happy when parents find out what happened to their kids," he 
said. "Even when it turns out like this, it can stop the anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's case is far from the oldest Doe case in Ventura County, Wingate said. 
He said some files on unknown people date back to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Doe cases are never officially closed until an identification is made, he 
said. But getting a chance to work on them, while juggling their normal duties 
as deputy coroners, sometimes makes it difficult to solve them, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's deputies work like sleuths to find the identity of an unidentified 
body. If possible, they take fingerprints from the body and run them through 
the county sheriff's office. If that doesn't yield answers, the fingerprints 
are sent to a statewide fingerprint network, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's deputies also check with law enforcement agencies for 
missing-person reports and note any unusual features of the deceased: a tattoo, 
for example, or dental work. They ask the media to help publicize the case. 
</P>
<P>
 If those efforts fail, a report is sent to the California Department of 
Justice, Wingate said. Any leads that turn up are followed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, there have been about 80 Doe cases investigated by the 
county coroner's office; of those, 17 remain unsolved, Wingate said. Many of 
the unsolved cases involve only partial remains of a body that have been 
discovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The big break in identifying Cohen came Wednesday, when New York's state 
criminal justice division sent the Ventura County coroner's office a Teletype, 
Wingate said. The Teletype said that information recently entered in a national 
crime computer network indicated that a missing person from the New York area 
might match a Jane Doe reported by Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wingate said he called the Dobbs Ferry Police Department to find out more 
about the case and learned that Jane Doe 871-87 indeed shared several 
similarities with their missing person. Dobbs Ferry Police Sgt. Gelardi told 
Wingate he would send a set of fingerprints via fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the facsimile was of poor quality, so Wingate requested a set of 
fingerprints from the Las Vegas Police Department. Cohen apparently had been 
arrested in Las Vegas on a misdemeanor charge shortly before her death. 
</P>
<P>
 That high-resolution facsimile arrived Thursday and Wingate made the 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's cremated remains have been stored at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park all these 
years. They will remain there until the family decides what to do, Wingate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jane Doe Case. No. 871-87 is officially closed.

RESTAURANT OPERATOR FOR PIER PICKED; BUSINESS: ERIC WACHTER PLANS TO MAKE MOVE 
NEXT SUMMER. COUNCIL WILL VOTE ON EXTENDING LEASE TO 20 YEARS OR LONGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, Eric Wachter gazed out at California's longest wooden pier and 
fancied he could see his own business, Eric Ericsson's Fish Co., perched at the 
base of it.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the city of Ventura picked a restaurant operator for the platform 
on the Ventura Pier, and Wachter's wish came true.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've coveted that location for years," said Wachter, who plans to move his 
Seaward Avenue restaurant to the pier sometime next summer. "It's the natural 
place for a fish restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's selection caps months of anxious searching by the City Council and 
city staff members for the most sophisticated seafood restaurant available at 
the least cost to Ventura. Ventura planners originally mailed out more than 80 
requests for proposals, alerting restaurateurs around the region that the city 
wanted a "new, upscale premier restaurant facility" for the only free-standing 
beachfront property available in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, four developers responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wachter, with his visions of waterfront dining, decided not to apply. He 
said he just couldn't afford the city's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura wanted the restaurateur to pay for the construction of the restaurant 
shell and all the interior decor and kitchen facilities. The eatery owner would 
then rent the creation from the city for 10 years, at which point the lease 
would be up for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, council members selected Seattle businessman Hal Griffith's 
restaurant, The Fisherman's Galley, as their choice and began negotiating with 
the restaurateur. Since the 10-year lease clause is in the city's charter, 
Griffith demanded that Ventura be flexible on other issues. Specifically, he 
wanted Ventura to enter into a partnership with him on the restaurant, assuming 
half the financial responsibility if the venture failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Griffith fell through last month, leading Ventura officials 
to rethink their approach. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the council will vote on amending the city charter to extend a 
waterfront lease to 20 years or even longer. If the council approves the 
charter amendment, the issue will go to a citywide vote in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, city staff members say Ventura will cough up the money for the 
restaurant shell. If a ballot initiative fails and the lease is not renewed 
after 10 years, Ventura will buy out the unlucky restaurateur, city staff 
members now say. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachter said he thinks he got a great deal. This will be his second restaurant 
contract with Ventura -- he will also own a third of the Pineapples restaurant 
planned for the nearby Ventura Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited," he said. "I'm confident the charter will change. And now, 
what we've got is more a landlord-tenant type of relationship" than the 
previous proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in town also think Wachter has a good bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's somebody local," said Sandy Smith, a planning commissioner and 
owner of The Rosarito Beach Cafe, who also applied for the spot in this latest 
round of competition. "But it seems now that Eric's gotten (the Pineapples 
restaurant) and the pier, I hope at some point the city could consider some 
other people for projects." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Smith, who submitted his proposal with Ed Warren, owner of 
Smokey's Saloon & Dining Hall, Wachter also beat out the 1940s retro chain 
Ruby's, and a partnership of Mike Wagner, owner of Andria's Seafood restaurant 
at the Ventura Harbor Village, and John Zaruka, the owner of the Wedgewood 
Banquet Center at the Buenaventura Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm disappointed, but I hope (Wachter) does a great job," Zaruka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the restaurant selection committee -- council members Gary Tuttle 
and Greg Carson, Planning Commissioner Ted Temple, and Shawn Atkisson, the 
manager of the Holiday Inn -- said Wachter presented them with the most 
complete proposal and the one which was most economical for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Ventura will probably put up about $700,000 of the cost of the 
restaurant, with Wachter contributing $300,000 or more toward its construction, 
said Bill Byerts, the city administrator in charge of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachter said he plans to build a two-story restaurant, with family-style 
dining downstairs and a more casual, bistro-and-bar combination upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have more varied fare, and a little less expensive menu than we 
have now," he said. "We want it to be a place people feel comfortable coming to 
frequently."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLEDGE TO HELP FUND LIBRARIES WITHHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura has decided to withhold any monetary pledges toward its 
local libraries until officials know exactly what the county intends to do with 
library funding, which is threatened with the budget ax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has made the hard decision to make hard cuts for a certain quality 
of life," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said, referring to the cuts in the fire 
and police departments Ventura made last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that county supervisors have so far declared such departments 
off-limits to cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we want the county to make hard decisions," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials have asked the city of Ventura for more than $200,000 
in supplemental funding next year to extend the operating hours of Wright and 
E.P. Foster libraries. Without the additional money, the county may consider 
consolidating services to one location, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Steve Bennett said if the city promises funds now, the county 
may relax and decide libraries are an area where they can definitely cut some 
fat. The supervisors' final budget hearings begin July 25.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let people know this is a crisis, and hopefully, they will 
mobilize and put some pressure on the county," he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Tour de North Hollywood: A passerby spotted an unattended bicycle on Ventura 
Boulevard and rode off with it, apparently unaware that it belonged to a Los

 The cop gave chase on foot but, after two blocks, he was losing the race. Then 
a motorist pulled up, opened the passenger door and shouted at him to "get in," 
police said later.

 The car quickly caught up with the bicycle thief, who jumped off and fled on 
foot. The suspect was quickly apprehended by the officer, who had remounted his 
bicycle. You never forget how to ride one of those things.

 Lie-in movies: Long Beach Community Hospital, which celebrated its 70th

 "We had a great view of the Circle Drive-In theater from the east wing when it 
opened in 1959," recalled spokesman Mark Scott. "Patients were always looking 
down there at the screen. So our General Services Department made arrangements 
with the drive-in to run a wire up there so they could hear the sound. That 
went on for three or four years before we started putting TVs in every room. 
The drive-in is gone now. The movies were tamer back then. If patients were 
watching today, we'd probably have to worry about their EKGs."

 The poetry of Woody Woodpecker: A while back, radio station KLSX-FM hosted a 
"Poetry of Rock" exhibit of autographed lyrics, prompting this column to wonder 
whether it would pay tribute to such classics as "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got 
love in my tummy" (Ohio Express).

 OK, so we were in a sarcastic mood. Now, the Good Music Record Co. of Ridgely, 
Md., has put out a new album -- " 'Mairzy Doats' Plus 43 More Wacky Hits from 
the Fun '40s" -- that proves songwriters were assaulting the English language 
long before rock. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mairzy Doats," by the Merry Macs ("Mairzy doats and dozee doats and little 
lambsy-dyvy, a-kiddlee-divy-too, wouldn't you." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Three Little Fishies," by Kay Kyser ("In an itty-bitty brook. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
 * "Civilization," by Danny Kaye and the Andrews Sisters ("Bongo, bongo, bongo, 
I don't want to leave the Congo.") 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'm a Lonely Little Petunia (in an Onion Patch)," by Two-Ton Baker & His 
Music Makers. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Woody Woodpecker," by the Sportsmen & Mel Blanc ("Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh, 
eh-eh-eh-eh-eh"). 
</P>
<P>
 When "Woody" was released as a single, by the way, the flip side was "When 
Veronica Plays Her Harmonica on the Pier at Santa Monica," which was omitted 
from this album, we're sad to say. 
</P>
<P>

 The goatee will be extra: Seth Greenberg of Santa Monica noticed an ad listing 
Supercuts as one of the sponsors of an L.A. soccer camp featuring U.S. star 
Alexi Lalas. "Perhaps it's time for Mr. Lalas to pay a visit to Supercuts," 
Greenberg added. miscelLAny:

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; EPA ASKS 
SHELL TO PROBE BLACK OOZE AT WASTE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the discovery of an oozing substance at a toxic waste site near 
Torrance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued an order 
requesting that Shell Oil Co. investigate the problem and take steps to prevent 
it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA issued the administrative order Friday, three days after a black, tar-like 
material was found oozing from waste pits once used by a former synthetic 
rubber factory.The so-called Del Amo Pits, between Normandie and Vermont 
avenues in Los Angeles, are at the southern end of 280 acres that are a 
proposed federal Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, which is among the former operators of the factory, is cooperating with 
the EPA in studying the problem, said company spokeswoman Tomi Van de Brooke. 
She said Shell began continuous air monitoring at the pits Tuesday evening that 
has revealed "no unusual emissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have covered the black ooze with 18 inches of topsoil and the EPA is 
awaiting test results to identify the material. In its order, the agency asks 
Shell to thoroughly inspect the waste pit area.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JURY SYSTEM JUSTLY REWARDED IN CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Carol Goehausen, the responsibility of serving on a jury is a bit 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little scary," said the 39-year-old Ojai resident, "because you're 
playing God." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her nervousness, Goehausen -- who served last week on a Ventura County 
Superior Court jury hearing a civil lawsuit -- said she agreed with speakers 
who lauded the nation's jury system at a ceremony Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, held at the County Government Center in Ventura as part of national 
Jury Appreciation Week, featured speeches by judges, attorneys and politicians 
about juries' vital role in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura attorney Howard Cho quoted Thomas Jefferson's statement that the right 
to a jury trial is more important than the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries, Cho said, preserve the rights of people against potential government 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We the people in our own neighborhoods and communities get the opportunity to 
resolve our disputes among ourselves and to engage in democracy," said Cho, 
president of the local chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates, the 
ceremony's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, each week the courts summon about 4,800 residents, whose 
names are randomly selected from voter registration and driver's license 
records. About one-quarter of them are either disqualified from jury service or 
excused. Prospective jurors are called no more than once every 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 People are disqualified when they fail to meet minimum requirements, including 
being an adult and able to speak English, court officials said. The most common 
reason people give for being excused is that taking time off work would hurt 
them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury trials have an important function besides being a right, said Ventura 
County Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda Johnson: They help citizens 
appreciate the inner workings of the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors at the Government Center agreed that jury service is educational. 
</P>
<P>
 But listening to long legal arguments can be tedious, Goehausen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes lawyers go on and go over the same points again." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; TURNER, SHARKEY JOIN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce and a music production 
manager have announced that they will run for City Council in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Turner, 52, and Jon Sharkey, 45, said they will run for two of the 
three council seats on the fall ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a dentist and chamber president for about six years, said he is 
entering the race to help improve the city's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a need for a new partnership between our city and local business," 
Turner said. "Particularly between the harbor and the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was once an Oxnard Harbor District commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey, a former keyboard player, is now a self-employed production manager. 
He contracts with entertainment companies and works in arranging lighting and 
staging for concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a city government which is very remote from the citizens," said 
Sharkey, who has lived in Port Hueneme since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is time we have a new direction for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate has previously run for a city office. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of three council members expire this year. They are James Daniels, 
who has been on the council since 1988; Ken Hess, a councilman since 1982, and 
Dorill Wright, a council member since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three has said whether he will seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 The official filing period opens Monday and closes Aug. 11. Candidates can 
file at City Hall. CHRISTINA LIMA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; 6-DAY DISNEY 
YOUTH SOCCER CUP KICKS OFF ON MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as World Cup '94 ends, 6,000 athletes from around the world will arrive 
in Pasadena to play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney International Youth Soccer Cup will draw the amateur players, ages 
10 to 19, for a six-day event beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, Brazil, the United States and 13 other countries are sending 6,000 
athletes, or 395 teams, to the cup July 18-24. Each team is divided by age and 
gender, and will have the chance to play at least five games in area fields, 
with the final games to held at Pasadena's Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes, who started arriving last week, will stay with local families or in 
nearby hotels, said Disney spokesman Rich Bertolucci. "They've already set up 
side games to practice and get used to our climate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is hosted by the American Youth Soccer Organization, with Disney and 
other sponsors coordinating the registration and recreational activities. 
Opening ceremonies, which are free to the public, will be held in Old Pasadena 
on Monday, with a 7 p.m. parade along Holly Street.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COUNTY LIBRARY CHIEF TO SEEK NEW TAX DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the county's 87-branch library system said Friday she will fight 
to create a tax district that would provide a permanent funding source for the 
cash-strapped agency. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, Sandra Reuben said, she hopes the county will have a Community 
Facilities District.In such zones, similar to fire protection districts, 
residents are required to pay an annual fee, depending on the estimated benefit 
of the service to a property owner. Now, the library system gets nearly all its 
funding from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries were first hit with budget cuts when the state "borrowed" from 
the county coffer in 1992 to cover its deficit. During the 1993 state budgeting 
process, the state took about $600 million in property taxes. The county cuts 
forced Reuben to lay off about 300 employees, close 10 libraries and reduce 
hours at libraries still open by 60%. More than half of all libraries are open 
only two days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries operate on a $37-million annual budget, down more than $23 
million from the 1992-93 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The library system won a temporary reprieve from another round of cuts 
Thursday when the Board of Supervisors allocated $2.5 million to help the 
system until September. The board also allocated $500,000 to buy new books and 
magazines.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
GIVES GOOD REPORT ON RIOT FIGURE WATSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Watson, who is serving three years' probation for his role in 
riot-related activities at Florence and Normandie avenues on April 29, 1992, is 
doing "very well," a judge said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk put Watson, who was in court Friday for a 
hearing on his progress, on probation until Jan. 7, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouderkirk, a former policeman, said he is pleased with Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Watson has a very favorable report," said Ouderkirk, who presided over 
the trial of Watson and co-defendant Damian Monroe Williams. "The defendant is 
trying to get employment and he's agreed to pay (restitution) once he gets a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouderkirk had ordered Watson to make restitution to his victims and to perform 
320 hours of community service, all of it on a Caltrans work crew. Watson's 
probation officer also indicated that Watson has "expressed remorse for the 
events and is in general doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was convicted of a misdemeanor and pleaded guilty to one felony count 
last year for taking part in beatings as rioting broke out after the not guilty 
verdicts in the trial of four LAPD officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is serving a 10-year state prison term for his attack on truck driver 
Reginald O. Denny, who was beaten as the nation watched on live television.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MOBILE HOME LEASE BAN IS OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruling on a Santa Paula case, a state appeals court has decided that mobile 
home parks can prohibit residents from subleasing their coaches only if it is a 
condition of the original lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision overturns a ruling by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Barbara 
A. Lane involving the Rancho Santa Paula Mobile Home Park.Lane ruled that the 
park could forbid mobile home owners from leasing their coaches and that the 
rule could be retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home park had sought in the trial court to stop coach owner Barbara 
J. Evans from leasing her trailer to Dolores Erb. The park imposed the no-lease 
rule in July, 1992, one month after Evans began leasing to Erb. 
</P>
<P>
 In reversing Lane's ruling, the Ventura-based 2nd District Court of Appeal, on 
a 2-1 vote this week, found that imposing a no-lease law on coach owners 
already leasing space in the park is "unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the home's immobility, an owner who finds living in the park no 
longer desirable, practical, or possible, would be forced to either sell his 
home or leave it vacant," the appeals court ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Kenneth R. Yegan, however, in a minority opinion, wrote that although 
the state's Mobile Home Residency Law does not address subleasing, it was 
written to give "park management some control over long-term residents of the 
mobile home park." 
</P>
<P>
 "Subletting, without the consent of management, may result in a deterioration 
in the quality of the rented mobile home and the mobile home common areas," 
Yegan wrote. JULIE FIELDS

 A 19-year-old Ventura man was shot in the arm during an altercation with four 
other teen-agers, Ventura police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 James D. Bolden was treated for the wound at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Don Arth said a group of youths walking on the sidewalk in the 1600 block 
of Ocean Avenue approached Bolden and a friend, who were standing on a porch 
about 10:24 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently there was some conversation," Arth said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the youths pulled out a pistol and shot several rounds at Bolden and 
his friend, striking Bolden in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled in a silver Toyota and have not been apprehended. But Arth 
said police found a stolen vehicle matching the description of their car at

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DISTRICT PENALIZED FOR OVERCROWDED CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a penalty for putting more elementary school students in classes than 
California law allows, the Ventura Unified School District has lost nearly 
$200,000 in state funding for the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials expect to get all of the money back in February after 
they petition state officials to waive the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district board will hold a public hearing at 7:45 p.m. Tuesday to 
formally consider applying for the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education reduced its June payment to the Ventura 
district by $197,291, or nearly 20%, as a penalty for the district's exceeding 
the state maximum of 32 students per elementary school class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura has a policy of limiting classes at its 13 elementary schools 
to 30 students per teacher, a round of budget-cutting over the past four years 
has left the district so tightly staffed that it sometimes has too few teachers 
for the number of students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district began last school year with all of its elementary school classes 
having 30 or fewer children. But mid-year changes in enrollment caused classes 
at some schools to exceed even the legal limit of 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rogers School had one primary grade class of 33 students, a situation 
that school officials said was unavoidable. The overcrowded class was for 
bilingual education and all of the students had limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Poinsettia School also had one class of 33 students. There, officials said it 
was impossible to transfer children out of the crowded class because all 
classes at that particular grade level were at the maximum size. 
</P>
<P>
 The state discovered that overcrowded classes when Ventura sent the Department 
of Education its annual report on enrollment in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura was penalized once before about two years ago for exceeding the 
state's class size limit, Assistant Supt. Gerald Dannenberg said. That penalty 
was waived. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials said Friday that they will probably also waive the 
district's penalty this year if they agree with Ventura's contention that the 
overcrowding was temporary and unavoidable.  
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 64 school districts were penalized last school year for exceeding 
the maximum allowed class size. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : NEWBURY PARK; LACK OF INTEREST KILLS IDEA FOR 
COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Committees fold fast when no one wants to serve on them. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the lesson Mayor Alex Fiore learned Wednesday when he proposed forming 
a council committee to draft an acceptable development plan for Albert Cohen's 
much-debated 36-acre parcel in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he suggested establishing the committee, Fiore declined to serve on 
it. Council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo promptly disqualified 
themselves as well, since they had earlier served on another committee trying 
to work with Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 And the remaining two council members, Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski, 
rejected the whole idea, arguing that developers should be forced to present 
their plans to the whole council, instead of cutting deals with smaller 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has left Cohen bitter and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to reach a compromise with a committee, he will now have to 
defend his property against a city proposal to downzone it, a move that would 
cramp the potential for development. A public hearing on the rezoning is set 
Aug. 2. 
</P>

could come down and the Russians could abolish communism, I think we could get 
a project," Cohen told the council at 1 a.m. Wednesday, after sitting through a 
nine-hour meeting to plead for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to negotiate again," he said, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's latest proposal envisions a mix of single-family houses, townhouses 
and 10 acres of commercial space on the parcel at Reino Road and Kimber Drive. 
But residents have objected to any intense development on a site they view as a 
wetland and natural wilderness. STEPHANIE SIMON

 To restock Manna, the local food bank, the Conejo Valley Board of Realtors 
will hold a "Super Saturday" grocery collection outside seven local 
supermarkets today. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will stand outside the markets urging shoppers to purchase a few 
extra items to donate to Manna.The food bank will accept canned goods, diapers, 
paper supplies and groceries. Last year, a similar event collected $7,000 worth 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "People give a lot around Christmas, but in the summer Manna doesn't have much 
food, so we're trying to stock their shelves," organizer Steve Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 To further bolster Manna, the real estate agents will hold a charity fashion 
show at Charley Brown's restaurant on Moorpark Road later this month. Tickets 
to the show, scheduled for July 28th at 6 p.m., cost $15. For more information, 
call Perry at 529-0836. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocery stores participating in today's food drive are: Vons markets on 
Avenida de los Arboles, Agoura Road and Kanan Road; Ralphs market on Moorpark 
Road; Lucky market on Newbury Road, Pavilions in North Ranch; and Hughes Market 
on Ventu Park Road. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY; COUNCILS PROTEST MIXED-USE ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley's four Neighborhood Councils are opposing a zoning change that 
would allow more apartments in the city's business districts. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners have long advocated mixed-use zoning as a way to combat the 
city's shortage of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, planners designed a proposal to rezone parts of Los Angeles Avenue and 
Tapo Street to allow residences and businesses to share the same buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Neighborhood Council members throughout the city are protesting such 
construction, saying it would urbanize a suburban community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have all voiced concerns about mixing housing with certain types of 
businesses," said Randi Joseph, Neighborhood Council coordinator for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The councils are particularly concerned about mixing housing with businesses 
that sell alcohol or keep long hours, Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council approves the rezoning despite their opposition, three of 
the Neighborhood Councils have suggested modifications to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the changes is a proposal to prohibit liquor stores, movie 
theaters, dry-cleaning facilities and day-care centers. The councils also asked 
that business hours be limited from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is tentatively scheduled to consider the ordinance at 
its Aug. 17 meeting. It will then go to the City Council for final 
consideration. SARA CATANIA

DWP BILL FOR CATERING DENOUNCED; UTILITIES: CITY CONTROLLER SAYS AGENCY'S 
EX-CHIEF, NOT PUBLIC, SHOULD PAY $60,000 TAB FOR 'OUTRAGEOUS FOOD FEST' HELD 
AFTER STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and not the 
utility's ratepayers, should be forced to pay a catering bill run up by 
employees after last year's strike, city Controller Rick Tuttle said in a 
letter Friday to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle urged the council to reject the $60,000 payment approved by the city 
utility last week, saying it would be "the largest example of what I would 
consider a gift of public funds" that he has encountered since taking office in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the payment to the caterer, Marriott Corp., should be made by 
former DWP General Manager Dan Waters, who retired this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute dates to September, when Marriott delivered food for thousands of 
employees on Sept. 10, a day after the end of a nine-day strike by DWP workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's management said the food was for a peacemaking gathering of 
workers and managers to heal the hard feelings from the work stoppage. But 
Tuttle called the food giveaway an "outrageous food fest." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday he wrote that Waters "should be liable . . . for his poor judgment 
and abuse of authority." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my position that managers must learn to treat the public's money as if 
it were their own," Tuttle wrote. "I can think of no better way to do this than 
to ask for a general manager to pay out of his or her own pocket for 
irresponsible actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters could not be reached for comment, but DWP spokesman Mike Moore said it 
was unfair to single out Waters out for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Waters was not the only one who was involved in the decision," Moore 
said. "It was with all the managers, who were charged with bringing this 
organization back together after a very difficult night." 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP commission, which approved the Marriott payment July 7, cited advice 
from the city attorney's office that the bill had to be paid because the city 
had ordered and accepted the food. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that "the food provided on Sept. 10, 1993, to employees 
at no charge served the public purpose of commencing and expediting the healing 
process after the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 The action came despite Tuttle's previous opposition and a recommendation by 
the City Council not to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The last council action was not binding. To assert jurisdiction now, 
two-thirds of the 15 city lawmakers would have to vote to do so. The deadline 
for overturning the DWP action is Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-strike catering was only the last in nearly $800,000 in food expenses 
run up by the utility that were linked to the strike, according to Tuttle's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that money was spent to feed department managers who kept the water 
and electric system operating during the nine-day work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest flap is not the first one to hit Waters since his retirement. 
Several months ago, city officials complained bitterly when they learned that 
Waters remained on the DWP payroll even after retiring to collect hundreds of 
hours of compensatory time he had accrued over the years.

DOWNEY BLOCKS PLAN FOR MOLESTER; CRIME: COMMUNITY FOUGHT PAROLEE'S PLACEMENT IN 
A MOTEL NEAR SCHOOLS. CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS WILL SEEK A MORE SUITABLE SITE IN 
COUNTY FOR REPEAT OFFENDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outraged Downey police and school officials successfully blocked the placement 
of a 74-year-old repeat sex offender in their city, where he was scheduled to 
move into a motel within walking distance of two preschools and a junior high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Caro Jr. -- whose record of sex crimes against children dates to 1952 -- 
was en route Friday from a Central California prison to Chino, where he must 
undergo a final psychiatric evaluation before his release today. A new location 
will be selected after the evaluation, said Mike Badstubner, regional 
administrator of the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Caro has served four prison terms for sex crimes against children, and just 
completed half of an eight-year sentence for child molestation, law enforcement 
officials said. Caro was granted early release after participating in a work 
incentive program in which he earned a day off his sentence for each day he 
worked.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials declined to elaborate on Caro's crimes, except to say they involved 
sex acts with children between 7 and 9 years old. The Texas native also spent 
time at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, a state mental facility, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of shocked residents flooded the Downey Police Department and the 
Department of Corrections with phone calls after news of Caro's release was 
reported in the city's local newspaper Friday morning, said Capt. John Finch.  
</P>
<P>
 By midday Friday -- after additional pleas from politicians and the police 
chief -- parole officials agreed to find another location for Caro, Finch said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a very sound case about the dangers of sending a convicted child 
molester to that location," Finch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Downey Police Chief Gregory C. Caldwell said he was told Thursday afternoon by 
corrections officials that Caro would arrive in Downey today. Caldwell said the 
placement was puzzling because Caro did not appear to have any connection with 
the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell, he never lived here, did not commit his crimes here 
and was not arrested here," Caldwell said. "We don't want him here." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials offered no explanation for why Downey was selected, 
saying only that they are required to release parolees to the county where 
their crimes were committed.  
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell wrote a letter to the corrections department stating his concerns and 
urging officials to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within 200 yards (of the motel) are two preschools, a church, a liquor store 
and an adjacent large apartment complex in which several children reside," he 
wrote. "The entire surrounding area is densely populated and frequented by 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials said they were unaware of the motel's proximity to the 
preschools until they received Caldwell's letter, and said Friday that they 
would find an alternative site for Caro, either in Downey or another city in 
Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there are schools nearby, (the Downey motel) obviously is not the most 
appropriate place for him," said Art Lucero, deputy regional administrator for 
the California Department of Corrections.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lucero said, the parole department is obligated to place Caro. "We 
recognize that he has a long and nasty history as a child molester," Lucero 
said. "But even so, he has to go somewhere when he gets out."

ACCUSED OF MISSPENDING, JOB AGENCY CHIEF QUITS AND PREDECESSOR IS SUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Little more than a year after firing its director for allegedly misusing 
federal money, an El Monte job-training agency Friday accepted the resignation 
of his successor, who is under investigation for similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-San Gabriel Valley Consortium also filed suit this week against the 
previous director, Doug Shaw, who allegedly used $650,000 in federal 
job-training funds for personal expenses and to pay salaries and benefits to 
people who were not entitled to the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's five-member board held a special meeting Friday to accept the 
resignation of Shaw's successor, Dan Garcia, as executive director. Ron 
Crossley, 49, the agency's treasurer, was appointed interim executive director 
until a permanent replacement can be hired. Garcia declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has headed the agency since May, 1993, when Shaw, 51, was suspended. 
Shaw, who directed the nonprofit agency for 16 years, was fired in October and 
is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, the consortium learned that Garcia, previously a witness in the 
investigation, had become a target, said consortium attorney Michael 
Colantuono. Garcia then voluntarily resigned without giving a reason, 
Colantuono said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can only speculate that Dan felt that he needed to devote his energy to 
his family and to his personal situation," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's lawsuit against Shaw contends, among other things, that he headed 
outside businesses that competed against the agency for government contracts 
and that Garcia, then his assistant, raised the bid on one agency contract so a 
company run by Shaw could get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations of misspending were detailed in an audit last year which 
revealed that Shaw allegedly used federal money for hotel stays in Las Vegas 
and purchases at toy stores and lingerie shops, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Arthur Lindars, who represented Shaw when he was fired, said he 
doubted that the amount of money allegedly misspent by Shaw totals the sums 
detailed in the lawsuit. He also disputed the accusation of misuse entirely, 
calling it "an unfounded allegation." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks, under federal 
anti-racketeering laws, triple damages of nearly $2 million from Shaw, two 
private companies he ran and an accounting firm, among others.  
</P>
<P>
 It also seeks an injunction to end one contract with the city of Los Angeles 
now held by Timely Concepts. That contract to renew dog licenses could total 
$300,000. The consortium maintains that after being fired by the agency, Shaw, 
a consultant for Timely Concepts, used insider information to help the company 
win the contract in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Timely Concepts have said in the past that Shaw's experience 
does not qualify as specialized insider information or trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the lawsuit is the Los Angeles auditing firm of Rubin & 
Ozurovich, which provided financial audits to the consortium from 1988 to 1991, 
for failing to discover any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Those named in the lawsuit either did not return phone calls Friday or 
declined to comment because they had not yet seen a copy of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Shaw: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spent $39,622 for personal items using consortium credit cards and cash 
advances from January, 1989, to December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paid $452,579 in salaries to workers at the El Monte City Employees' Credit 
Union, the city of Bradbury and the city of El Monte, beginning in October, 
1983, and continuing until May, 1993, even though those employees were not 
eligible to receive federal job-training funds. Lindars said the payments to 
Bradbury employees had been approved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 * Made $40,534 worth of personal phone calls on a consortium cellular 
telephone from October, 1987, to May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bought $69,718 worth of gasoline for personal use with a J.E. Dewitt gas 
station card from July, 1991, to March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowed $44,459 to be spent on unauthorized pay raises, air fare and 
vacation pay for consortium employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Persuaded his assistant, Garcia, in 1988 to raise the rate the consortium 
charged the Santa Ana Police Department for collecting dog license fees so 
Shaw's own company, Civic Collections, could successfully take over the 
consortium's contract by offering Santa Ana a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, previously known as the Mid-Valley Manpower Consortium, has an 
annual budget of about $3 million in federal funds that are routed through Los 
Angeles County. The consortium provides job training and placement yearly to 
1,000 adults and young people in Baldwin Park, Bradbury, El Monte, South El 
Monte and surrounding unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the allegations of misspending surfaced, the agency has agreed to 
reimburse the county about $120,000. But the county could ask for more money in 
the future, which is one reason why the lawsuit was filed, said consortium 
board Chairman Raul Martinez.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY; MAN GETS 20 YEARS FOR CHILD SEX ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Friday sentenced a Simi Valley man to 20 years in state 
prison for repeatedly molesting a young girl over a six-year span. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Antonio Quezada lowered his head in apparent dejection as Judge Charles 
W. Campbell Jr. chastised him as selfish during the sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell denied a defense request to place Quezada, 32, on probation so that 
he could help support the family of the victim, now 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could make more money than Michael Jackson, and he wouldn't be able to 
compensate them," Campbell said. "Some cases you go to prison for what you do, 
no matter how sorry you are. And this is clearly one of those cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada pleaded guilty in May to 23 counts of child molestation during a 
preliminary hearing after his victim broke down in tears while testifying 
against him. Campbell said he might have sentenced the man to a longer prison 
term if he had not spared the girl from testifying further with his guilty 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada was charged in April with 49 molestation counts in connection with the 
assaults on the girl over a six-year period ending in May, 1992, authorities 
said. The incidents included fondling, masturbation and oral copulation, 
starting when the girl was in the third grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how he got to be who he is, but he basically cares only about 
himself," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several family members of the victim implored Campbell to impose a long 
sentence on Quezada, saying the girl's healing process could not begin until 
the defendant goes to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here with hate in my heart," one uncle said. "I just want justice 
served." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Joseph O'Neill said alcohol was partially to blame for 
Quezada's behavior. He asked for a one-year jail term for the defendant, who 
would then serve five years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if he has one drink, he puts himself in prison," O'Neill said. "If he has 
contact with the victim, he puts himself in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona gave the judge a graphic account of the 
attacks on the girl and asked that Quezada be sentenced to 69 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told her he would beat the hell out of her if she didn't cooperate," 
Corona said. Once, she said, Quezada "hit her 40 times with his karate belt" 
for not cooperating with a sex act. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; CITY SUPPORTS CHILD CARE, SEEKS 
PROVIDERS

<P>
 Flush with $139,500 in federal grant money, Thousand Oaks officials plan to 
subsidize child-care services for low-income residents in the city's oldest 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, they need to identify day-care providers -- from family-based 
centers to school district programs to the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 To launch the project, City Council members this week agreed to solicit 
proposals from qualified providers interested in setting up day-care services 
in central Thousand Oaks. City officials are especially interested in programs 
that would care for preschoolers and mildly ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 Once proposals are in, a citizens committee will work with city staff to 
evaluate them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's $139,500 child-care fund can be used only for capital projects, 
such as building a new center. But management assistant Dan Severn said council 
members could also choose to subsidize services by dipping into the social 
service endowment or other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 To submit proposals or join the advisory committee, call Severn at 496-8601.

PROSECUTORS CHARGE YOUTH WITH MURDER IN SHOOTING OF GIRLFRIEND; COURTS: THEY 
SAY TEEN-AGER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE POTENTIAL DEADLY CONSEQUENCES OF 
BRANDISHING A GUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy who allegedly killed his girlfriend while 
brandishing a handgun was charged with murder Friday by prosecutors, who said 
the defendant should have known the potentially fatal consequences of his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an unusual move, prosecutors will not seek to have the youth tried as 
an adult, citing his lack of criminal history and their belief that he did not 
plan to kill the girl, Jacqueline Reay, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no juvenile record, and it's clearly not a first-degree murder," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said. "I think it's appropriate that it 
remain in the Juvenile Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn, a veteran prosecutor of murder cases, acknowledged that the district 
attorney's office has generally sought to try juvenile murder defendants as 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've done that in a while," he said of the decision 
to keep the case in Juvenile Court. "It was my suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim died Wednesday after the boy shot her in the eye with a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at point-blank range, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting shocked the Las Casitas neighborhood where it occurred and left 
mutual friends of the victim and the defendant with torn emotions. Some want 
authorities to seek a tough prosecution against the youth, while others believe 
that would accomplish little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder or involuntary manslaughter, it doesn't really matter," said Jamie 
Doney, who lives in the condo unit where the shooting occurred. "He had the 
gun. He knew better. He's gonna serve time either way." 
</P>
<P>
 But his sister, 15-year-old Deanna, said she thought murder was too harsh of a 
charge to seek in the death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair," Deanna declared. "It was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said the boy had been displaying the gun and loading it and unloading 
it. Neighbors said he had been playing with the gun the day before, when it was 
unloaded, and pulled the trigger while holding it to a man's head. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth is charged with one count of murder and two counts of brandishing a 
firearm. Glynn said prosecutors, who will seek a conviction of second-degree 
murder, expect to file additional counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone would agree that pointing a gun at people and playing with 
it is a dangerous act," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did it a number of times, and finally what happened is what you would 
expect to happen. Somebody got shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also revealed Friday that the handgun used in the shooting 
belonged to the boy's father, a former police officer in Los Angeles County. 
The father, whose name was not released, was unaware that his son had 
possession of the weapon, Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information I'm given is he obtained the gun without his father's 
permission," the lieutenant said. A woman who answered the phone at the boy's 
home declined to comment on the case. She said the boy's father did not live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said the charge against the youth is based on the concept of implied 
malice. Under that principle, prosecutors do not have to prove the youth 
intended to murder Jacqueline Reay, Glynn said -- just that the natural 
consequences of his actions were dangerous to human life. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's arraignment, which will be open to the public, is scheduled in 
Juvenile Court Monday at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the defendant have said the shooting was accidental. But some 
friends of the victim's agreed with prosecutors Friday that the defendant 
appeared to be asking for trouble by brandishing the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered in a listless group outside the Las Casitas condominium, 
Jacqueline's friends simply shrugged when told of the charges filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever (time in custody) they give him is good," Michael Roman said, 
leaning against the condo bare-chested, his hair tied back in a black bandanna. 
"I hope he learns his lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Several teen-agers said they hoped for a light sentence and a chance at early 
release for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Krista Lambert predicted he would have a difficult time 
being locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shouldn't have to stay in there for years," she said, smoking a cigarette 
and twirling a long ribbon knotted in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the suspect stands accused of murdering her best friend, Krista 
said she was eager to talk with him. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been friends with the boy for years and wants to "ask him why he even 
brought the gun in the house," she said.

THE ART OF DYING; TIBETAN SPIRITUAL CLASSIC DEALS WITH THE 'NEXT STEP' AS A 
COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Death, in Western culture, comes in an instant and signals the end of things: 
cessation of pain; swift release from disease; a slip into oblivion; a flat 
line on the oscilloscope. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Buddhists of Tibet, for whom dying is an art, a science and the 
ultimate test of an individual's courage and compassion, death is a much more 
complicated process. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that Westerners have much to learn from this ancient art and science 
of dying, Robert Thurman, an eminent Buddhist scholar at Columbia University, 
has translated a new version of the spiritual classic known in the West as the 
Tibetan Book of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to produce a new version that would be simple and useful, easy for 
bereaved relatives to read and easy for lost souls to hear in the room where 
they anxiously hover above their corpses and wonder what has just happened to 
them," Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A burly, plain-spoken scholar who is passionately devoted to Buddhism and 
Tibetan culture, Thurman approaches his subject with a dramatic flair that 
makes the most abstruse concepts come alive, even to those unfamiliar with the 
principles of Buddhism. (A flair for drama apparently runs in the family: His 
daughter is film actress Uma Thurman.) 
</P>
<P>
 "No intelligent tourist would depart for a foreign land without a good 
guidebook giving instructions on basic preparation, equipment, dangers and 
obstacles," Thurman said. "No intelligent Tibetan would depart the known 
territory of this life without a good guidebook for the in-between." 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, the Book of the Dead is a devotional handbook for spiritual 
adepts well-schooled in meditation and yoga; on another, it is a practical 
guide for the ordinary person. It is a rich allegorical description of the 
physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions of the maelstrom of death, 
full of demons and furies and the fierce and benevolent forces encountered 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Its great lessons are that death can be lucidly perceived, from beginning to 
end; that dying is a communal experience for the departed and the bereaved, and 
that it need not be fraught with terror or psychic pain. Its great instruction 
to the dying, simply put, is to seek the light and merge with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman's translation of this 1,000-year-old text, newly published by Bantam 
Books, taps into a growing curiosity about the physics and metaphysics of the 
"big sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Current best-sellers such as Betty J. Eadie's "Embraced by the Light" and 
Richard Seltzer's "Raising the Dead" are firsthand accounts of the authors' 
near-death experiences. Physician Sherwin Nuland's "How We Die" reduces the 
death experience to a catalogue of grisly clinical details. Euthanasia advocate 
Derek Humphry's gloomy "Final Exit" has become a mainstay for those who seek 
pharmacologic deliverance from the specter of a lingering, pain-ridden death. 
</P>
<P>
 Sogyal Rimpoche, a flamboyant Tibetan lama in San Francisco who produced his 
own translation of the Book of the Dead, has attracted a following of aging 
baby boomers newly aware of their own mortality and that of their parents and 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Levine, a Bay Area meditation teacher, conducts seminars around the 
country in "conscious dying" that draw heavily from Tibetan tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 A scholar rather than a guru with a following, Thurman is arguably the most 
credible of a growing number of experts applying the teachings of the Tibetan 
Book of the Dead to contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffused with humor and a sunny optimism, his narrative reflects the central 
Buddhist principle that wisdom and compassion will overcome every obstacle. In 
fact, his notes, designed to appeal to people of all faiths including 
secularists, are more illuminating than the Tibetan text. 
</P>
<P>
 More properly translated as "The Great Book of Natural Liberation Through 
Understanding the In-Between," the Book of the Dead was written in the late 9th 
or 10th Century by the spiritual master Padma Sambava, whom Tibetans believe to 
be a Buddha in human form, returned to earth to help the less enlightened on 
their way to spiritual perfection. It is a guide through what Tibetans call 
"the bardos" -- roughly translated, the in-between -- the interval between this 
life and the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Practical information about what happens at the moment of death is, in 
Thurman's view, a great gift that the lamas and yogis of Tibet have given human 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the West has spent its energies on exploring the material world, from 
the conquest of new continents to astronauts' exploration of outer space, 
Tibet's holy men and women -- Thurman calls them "psychonauts" -- probed inner 
reality, using yoga and meditation to explore the subtle realms of human 
consciousness, experienced as inner light, ecstasy, trance, dreams, death and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 These explorations of inner reality shed light on what for many is the darkest 
corner of human experience. Consider Thurman's explanation of the moment of 
death, and its resonance with contemporary accounts of near-death experiences: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sensations cease, one feels enveloped in smoke, then cold. . . . One feels 
surrounded by fireflies or a burst of sparks," he writes. "When consciousness 
stops and energy withdraws into the central nervous system, the will fades, 
body sense is lost. . . . One feels enveloped in a candle-flame in its last 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Though at this point a Western physician would pronounce a person clinically 
dead, in Buddhist terms the process of dying has only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As consciousness stops, Thurman says, the mind finds itself in a vast sky full 
of white moonlight; then orange sunlight; then pure darkness, before passing 
into the realm of "clear light translucency." 
</P>
<P>
 This clear state, Thurman says, is the real moment of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the subtlest state possible for a being. Anything said about it cannot 
do it justice," he writes. "It is a state so transparent that one unprepared 
for it will not even notice it, yet it is a being's deepest home." 
</P>
<P>
 It is common for people to spend a number of days in this luminous state, 
Thurman says. But confusion about what has happened to them or terror at being 
cut loose from the certainties of earthly existence can prevent the newly dead 
from making the most of this state. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the point at which the traditions of the Book of the Dead are of 
greatest impact, in Thurman's view, because it is here, in the clear light at 
the "in-between," that the human soul will either go on to its next incarnation 
or break free of the cycle of death and rebirth into the ultimate enlightenment 
of nirvana, or Buddhahood. 
</P>
<P>
 An individual knowledgeable about the practice of yoga and meditation can slow 
down the transitions in the death process and remain lucidly aware of the 
changes as they occur. The less spiritually evolved can depend on their loved 
ones to keep a vigil and help them through the experience. It is a state in 
which the deceased is most fragile, and for that reason many Buddhists want to 
avoid frightening places such as hospital emergency rooms or histrionic 
expressions of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Above all, we should try not to become morbid when we consider or encounter 
death," Thurman advises. "If our loved one dies, we should channel grief into 
helpful activity, remaining joyous and cheerful. It is important not to indulge 
in weeping and wailing to convince others -- including the departed -- that we 
care, to assuage our own sense of guilt at surviving or to avoid facing our new 
aloneness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will only frighten and annoy the soul of the departed and distract her 
from navigating the in-between. She is the most important guest at a death and 
a funeral. She is in the most momentous transition point in her life cycle. 
Positive or negative influences will affect her for years or lives to come."

 Is Judaism on trial? 
</P>
<P>
 Controversial British author and playwright Hyam Maccoby thinks so. "There is 
a common, centuries-long view that Christianity is a more advanced form of 
Judaism, that it has superceded Judaism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for a relatively few people engaged in Jewish-Christian dialogue," 
said Maccoby, the grandson of famous rabbis, "it is taken for granted by most 
Westerners, including secularists and humanists, that Judaism has no real right 
to exist as an independent faith with its own validity." 
</P>
<P>
 Maccoby's courtroom drama, "The Disputation," will put that idea on trial in a 
Los Angeles theater starting this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a historical event and adapted from Maccoby's writing for a British 
television program and his 1982 book, "Judaism on Trial," the action takes 
place in Barcelona in the year 1263. The leading rabbinical scholar of the age, 
Moses Ben Nachman, is pitted against Pablo Christiani, a Dominican friar who 
had converted from Judaism, in a debate organized by the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Maccoby explores the minds, motives and emotions of both the Jewish and 
Christian participants as they debate such thorny issues as the coming of the 
Messiah and original sin. 
</P>
<P>
 Maccoby's latest book is "Judas Iscariot and the Myth of Jewish Evil." A 
lecturer at Leo Baeck College in London, he has promoted pluralism and 
interreligious dialogue in talks at Harvard Divinity School and Westminster 
Cathedral, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Disputation," directed by Asaad Kelada and produced by Richard Franklin 
in association with Hale/Arnold Productions, will have its world premiere at 
the Tiffany Theater on July 28. Preview performances begin July 21; the play 
closes Aug. 28. Tickets are available at the theater, 8532 Sunset Blvd., Los 
Angeles, or by phoning (310) 289-2999. Special group rates are available.

GOOD EXHIBIT BY THE SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in the thick of a brutal 
short-term fiscal crisis, has acted with commendable long-term prudence to 
stabilize funding for both the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Art. 
By a 3-2 vote, the supervisors have guaranteed $9.1 million per year for the 
Natural History Museum and slightly more for the Art Museum for the next 25 
years. This is nearly 25% below pre-recession highs, but the long-term 
guarantee restores the predictability without which these institutions would 
inevitably have spiraled downward into decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the five supervisors, Edmund D. Edelman and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke 
favored the stabilization, while Deane Dana and Michael Antonovich opposed it. 
That left Gloria Molina as the swing vote. Molina entered the debate proposing 
that the Natural History Museum sell or give to universities the warehoused 
portions of its priceless collection, the second-largest in the nation. In the 
end, however, she chose not to hold the stabilization question hostage to the 
storage question. The museum will report back to the supervisors on possible 
storage economies, but stabilization is now secured. 
</P>
<P>
 What a serious museum exhibits is not just beautiful or curious things but 
knowledge, and knowledge rests on the close examination of many more objects 
than can ever be put on simultaneous display. The public does not see the 
warehoused research collections, but experts do, and the result -- for the 
children who troop past the exhibits -- is an answer to such questions as "What 
do these bones teach us?" and "Who carved this ancient statue and why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even the richest universities have been handing their collections over to 
museums in recent years. Handing them back would amount to little more than 
transferring the storage bill from one account to another. It takes money, 
obviously, to maintain a great collection for lay and professional users. The 
county provides only half the funding for its museums; the rest comes from 
private donors. Happily, with a modest but stable funding platform back in 
place, private donors may begin again to rally around a pair of institutions 
that will have much to do with making the Los Angeles that is to come one of 
the world's cultural capitals.

NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH; CELEBRITY CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Brentwood used to note, happily, that their quiet, leafy 
neighborhood was rarely the source of much excitement or aggravation. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, a constant 
cacophony of hovering news helicopters, traffic tie-ups and a seemingly endless 
wave of morbid curiosity seekers who come at all hours have turned parts of the 
neighborhood upside down. Grave Line Tours (yes, that's the name), which visits 
infamous crime spots around Los Angeles, may make the homes a fixture on its 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Brentwood problem is obviously not the same thing, to say the 
least, as gang struggles in the streets and firearms going off throughout the 
night, it's hard not to sympathize with the sentiments of frustrated neighbors 
posting signs that read "Get a life" and "Go home." Residents, understandably, 
have asked for police barricades, no-parking signs and even tenting the 
condominium where the murders took place. Tow-away signs and some minor parking 
restrictions are helping already. But even stronger restrictions and tougher 
parking enforcement could help more. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the murder site, on Bundy Drive, a major north-south thoroughfare on 
the Westside, can't be closed off as tightly as the Simpson home, on Rockingham 
Avenue. But the Los Angeles Police Department has been responding. The essence 
of community policing is police responsiveness to valid community concerns. And 
right now the people of Brentwood have a valid concern.

A TRUE MEETING OF MINDS?; WASHINGTON ARRANGES HUSSEIN-RABIN SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace in the Middle East is invariably, and somewhat euphemistically, 
described as a process. This is meant to suggest that everything needs to be 
looked at over the sands of time; that nothing ever happens quickly, unless, 
like the outbreak of war, it is for the worse. But now something indeed appears 
to be happening relatively quickly, and that is the progress of the Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the President of the United States, with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher at his side, was obviously proud to announce that agreement had 
been secured between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin and Jordan's King 
Hussein for the two to meet in Washington in an attempt to begin to normalize 
relations between the two nations, still technically in a state of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement wasn't entirely unexpected, of course, but it was entirely 
welcome. The Jordanian monarch had said in Washington last month, after 
meetings with Clinton and Christopher, that he was prepared to plunge ahead 
with Israel no matter what the difficult President Hafez Assad of Syria did. 
Referring to Syria, Hussein said that Jordan's position "is not linked to 
anything that may or may not happen on any other track," and he emphasized that 
Damascus' foot-dragging would not interfere with Jordan's pursuit of its vital 
national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 What's clear now is that the Palestinians are not the only ones who see that 
pursuing peace is what's in their interests. Of course the great Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat realized that in 1979, when he signed the Camp David 
treaty between Egypt and Israel. But few leaders, before or afterward, could 
hold a candle to his visionary statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the active involvement of the United States has always been 
crucial. Washington is both the available broker and ultimate guarantor, 
officially or not, of whatever shape peace is to take. And over the years 
America has seen its secretaries of state -- from Henry Kissinger to Cyrus 
Vance to George Shultz to James Baker to Warren Christopher -- take an active 
role, behind the scenes or not. 
</P>
<P>
 For Christopher, Friday's announcement must have been an enjoyable, if 
temporary, respite from the din of media criticism that his stewardship has 
been getting. In truth, primary responsibility for American foreign policy lies 
with the President, as commander in chief. Whatever the policy flaws, all can 
hardly be laid at the feet of the secretary. Neither can the Administration's 
successes. But Christopher, like his predecessors, now deserves a moment of 
appreciation. Even his worst critics would agree that he is a gifted, dogged 
negotiator. There was obviously a lot of very hard work behind the 
Rabin-Hussein agreement to meet in Washington. And it looks to be paying off.

MOORPARK BOY HIT BY SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 6-year-old Moorpark boy was slightly injured Friday night when he was hit by 
a car driven by a suspected drunk driver, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Lopez suffered minor injuries after he stepped onto 2nd Street 
near Moorpark Avenue about 7:15 p.m. and was hit by a car traveling westbound 
on 2nd, according to Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was taken to Simi Valley Hospital, where he was treated for a bump on 
his head and minor cuts and bruises, authorities said. A hospital official said 
he would probably be released late Friday. 
</P>

CONEJO BOARD APPROVES SCHOOL QUAKE REPAIRS; EDUCATION: DESPITE QUESTIONS ON 
COSTS, TRUSTEES AGREE TO SEEK STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO FIX BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite questions by one trustee about the need for costly earthquake repairs, 
Conejo Valley school board members have decided to seek $8 million in state and 
federal money on hundreds of small repair jobs at 31 school district locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District board voted late Thursday to hire 
three employees to oversee the repairs, which include the patching of cracked 
walls and replacement of damaged ceiling tiles and light fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the emergency agencies have approved $1.1 million in repairs in the 
district. School officials say they expect approval of the full $8 million to 
cover all damage. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, school district inspectors initially found that 
school facilities had suffered only minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials now say that federal and state inspectors have concluded 
that an estimated $8-million worth of earthquake-related repairs will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But trustee Mildred Lynch is skeptical of the estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a scam?" Lynch bluntly asked Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart during 
Thursday night's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said she has received several phone calls from citizens questioning the 
need for costly repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart said even minimal damage at 31 school sites can add up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have five hairline cracks that are patched and painted it costs the 
same as five inch-wide cracks that are patched and painted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynch said Friday that she was still not comfortable with the enormous 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem is the figures just don't add up that high to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other board members said the $8-million estimate seemed probable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after the earthquake I went to about 10 different schools where we 
did not think the damage was that great, but it adds up," Trustee Dorothy 
Beaubien said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can question (the estimate), but I think Sarah has given us enough 
information that it makes sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio said replacing broken ceiling panels and 
lighting fixtures with more earthquake-safe materials is an investment against 
future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run it should be less expensive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the $8-million estimate includes funding for administration. Salaries 
for a project manager, construction supervisor and a secretary will be paid 
through federal and state disaster relief funds, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved hiring three people for those positions. But Lynch 
questioned the need to hire additional personnel, even if it is not at the 
district's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's several things about this that bother me," she said during the 
meeting. "How many project managers do we have already?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said the district's planning and building manager is too busy with 
construction plans for two new cafeterias at Cypress and Aspen elementary 
schools to handle the numerous earthquake-repair projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The district currently has a temporary consultant serving as a project 
manager, whose salary is being reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Hart said. But after 90 days, FEMA cannot pay for the position because 
it would violate federal employment regulations, Hart said.

THE INSTANT FORMULA FOR POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When asked about television's most famous unwed mom, the fictional Murphy 
Brown, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala gave an answer not 
typically expected from a liberal: "I don't think anyone in public life today 
ought to condone children born out of wedlock . . . even if the family is 
financially able."  
</P>
<P>
 Shades of Dan Quayle! She's right, and so was Dan Quayle on this issue -- as 
long as they both remember that no child should have to suffer because of 
parents' missteps. The answer about Murphy Brown got the spotlight, but it is 
Shalala's comments about real-life teen-age unwed mothers that merit serious 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Approximately 80% of the children born to teen parents who dropped out of 
high school and did not marry are poor," Shalala testified this week before 
Congress. "In contrast, only 8% of the children born to married high school 
graduates aged 20 or older are poor." 
</P>
<P>
 But marriage is not the choice of increasing numbers of Americans. Now-Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) identified growing illegitimacy among black 
families in 1965. Back then he was pilloried, but the trend he noted turned 
into an epidemic and crossed racial lines. Today 30% of all American children 
are born to unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce welfare dependency, the current Administration and previous ones 
granted federal waivers to encourage states to experiment. The vigorous 
experimentation has often proven good for the states and the nation, which 
share welfare costs. But these efforts may be jeopardized because of a recent 
federal appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 It held that California welfare cuts in 1992 were invalid because federal 
authorities did not consider the hardship the reductions in welfare checks 
could impose on 2.7 million parents and children who receive Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children. This newspaper opposed the repeated reductions in 
welfare payments for some of the same reasons but strongly supported other 
steps that also require federal waivers, such as the increase in income and 
savings allowed welfare recipients. The good must not be lost with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala must now consider how to get more families off of welfare and keep 
them off. Her prescription of marriage for teen-age mothers, though not 
realistic for all, is clearly part of the solution.

TAIWAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was so glad to read your editorial "Giving Taiwanese an Even Break" (July 
10).Finally, someone is bringing justice to an island of hard-working people! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, when Taiwan was abandoned by its biggest ally, Uncle Sam, in 1979, people 
there were scared. However, the Taiwanese stood on their own feet, worked hard, 
and eventually became a major economic force. As a Chinese American born in 
Taiwan, I am extremely proud of Taiwan's accomplishments. However, they have 
been a voiceless group. Politically and culturally, they have been isolated 
from the rest of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Give Taiwan something back. Help Taiwan reach the next level of excellence!

PRESIDENT CLINTON'S POLICY ON HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's Haiti policy has been a disaster from the beginning 
because it has never been grounded in a coherent and consistent definition of 
America's vital interests. Candidate Clinton's initial Haitian strategy had as 
its primary goal the vilification of President Bush's policy. Its shallow roots 
were exposed when Clinton reversed himself almost immediately after taking 
office and adopted his predecessor's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Clinton seems to have forgotten one of the essential lessons that we 
learned painfully in Vietnam, Lebanon, and, more recently, in Somalia and 
Bosnia -- that the U.S. should not try to impose political solutions on other 
countries, regardless of how well-intentioned our motives. 
</P>
<P>
 America has a legitimate interest in supporting democracy in Haiti. The real 
question, however, is whether the restoration of President Aristide is of 
sufficient national interest to invest the most precious capital that the U.S. 
has to offer -- the lives of the men and women who wear the uniform of this 
country. The answer is no.  
</P>

 * Why is it, I wonder, that most of ex-President Reagan's and Bush's 
appointees are so quick to point out all the constitutional ramifications of 
Clinton's actions and plans while they were so very, very silent during their 
own terms? 
</P>
<P>
 I refer to Doug Bandow's Column Right (July 7). He asks, referring to Haiti, 
"Should young Americans die to 'restore' democracy in a nation with no 
democratic tradition?" Has he forgotten Grenada, Lebanon, Nicaragua (CIA), 
Kuwait, Panama and Somalia? Only in Kuwait, as he admits, did the President 
stoop to ask Congress for authorization to sacrifice American lives for the 
same reasons he seems to damn Clinton for.  
</P>
<P>
 As a Vietnam veteran, I surely do not agree with the necessity of ever 
endangering our military's lives for any reason not completely founded on our 
national security. It's just that I do so wish the political diseases of 
hypocrisy and short-term memory loss could be cured in all parties.

 * Robert E. White (Commentary, July 6) argues with the "purists" who worry 
about potential U.S. invasion of Haiti, even though we decry the cruel usurpers 
on that tragic island. Our worries are legitimate. They are based on U.S. 
occupation of Haiti, which ended 60 years ago but left an unending legacy of 
rule by the few rich and well-connected, and misery for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Our worries are based on our recent history of virtually unilateral war 
against Iraq, which may have been initiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, but 
was and is pursued mercilessly by the Clinton Administration. I would like to 
entrust Haiti's rescue and President Aristide's reinstatement to a broad 
international coalition of which the U.S. is only an obedient part. But I 
can't.

 * Haiti has long been recognized as one of the poorest countries in the 
Western Hemisphere. The boat people dilemma, however, is a relatively recent 
development. As inconvenient and burdensome as that is for its powerful 
neighbor, this issue must not be dismissed merely as a case of the poor in 
search of greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution seems rather simple: Rescue the victims, or remove the predators, 
or perhaps a combination of the two. The world community would applaud.

PHILIP MORRIS ADS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it necessary to prove that secondhand smoke causes cancer? It's already 
obvious that the odor and discomforts caused by tobacco smoke are extremely 
offensive. The majority do not smoke, yet we have had smokers' habits inflicted 
on us everywhere. Even without asthma, allergies, emphysema or cancer, we 
suffer burning eyes, nose and throat, and sore lungs when we're exposed to the 
disgusting pollution of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems obvious that the air we breathe should be protected. Laws restrict 
offensive language, sexual harassment, and the pollution of public spitting and 
pet droppings. If surveyed, the nonsmoking majority would likely respond that 
secondhand smoke is a far greater problem than these other offensive acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris U.S.A. has prepared the full-page, four-part series appearing in 
The Times (June 28-July 1, reprised July 3), to refute the scientific evidence 
which proves secondhand smoke is harmful to our health. It also distributed 
misleading petitions in the attempt to qualify an initiative to undo laws which 
restrict smoking. The publicity and politics of the tobacco industry are 
well-funded, but the industry is doomed. Public opinion will demand laws to 
restrict exposure to secondhand smoke.

 As a passive victim of secondhand smoke I would like to reply to the full page 
in which cigarette maker Philip Morris presents its case against the EPA's 
conclusion and the science behind its case against secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never been a smoker, but some years ago I went for a physical checkup 
which included X-rays of my chest which caused the doctor to ask, "Were you 
ever a smoker?" When I told him I wasn't he replied, "Well, you have a scar on 
your lungs which indicates that at one time you might have been." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained to him that my ex-wife and I had been married for over 20 years 
and that every time we got into the car the first thing she did when I started 
the motor was to "light up." During the cold winter months when we were living 
back in New York, the car's windows were closed and I suffered bouts of nausea.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THAT DRAWBRIDGE MENTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the attention that dysfunctional families have been getting of late, 
a half-way house for abused children that has a proven, celebrated track record 
ought to be welcomed in a suburban neighborhood as nothing less than an heroic 
institution.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so in Anaheim Hills, where neighbors trying to block the arrival of the 
Eli House have disregarded all the evidence to the contrary and raised their 
"Not in My Back Yard" flag, saying that the abusers of these new and needy 
neighbors will fill up their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission heard out this rhetoric in a five-hour hearing in 
March and properly voted to approve the request for the house to move to 
Anaheim Hills from Orange. The group, which has been cited by former President 
George Bush as a "point of light" and by President Clinton as a recipient of a 
Presidential Citation, should be allowed to move. The City Council, which will 
consider the matter at a public hearing next month, likewise should approve the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood setting is needed for the shelter to do its work, and good 
work it is. The facility now helps more than 1,000 clients a year, most of them 
young people who have suffered emotional, physical or sexual abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though many of the residents of the expensive Anaheim Hills area have 
moved from more urban areas in an effort to leave some problems behind, they 
should know too that domestic abuse knows no socioeconomic or geographical 
boundaries. What happens in the cities also can happen in the tony suburbs; 
exclusivity does not provide a wall of separation from reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are going to do the rehab work on the building, and those manning 
the drawbridge should ponder the possibility that this effort actually will 
upgrade the neighborhood. The building is dilapidated and has been declared 
"unsafe to occupy" by city authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no place to go but onward and upward with this worthy project, to 
improve on a neighborhood eyesore and to help eradicate what often is a less 
readily visible blemish, the scourge of child abuse.

NATIONAL PRIDE CHURNS IN FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dark, dusty El Michoacano bar in Oxnard, Calif., is usually empty at noon 
during the harvest season. Unless it's raining, the bar's patrons are out in 
the fields clearing weeds and picking strawberries for $1.75 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good day, Jesus Ambriz, 26, stood to earn maybe $50 if he worked fast 
enough -- a small fortune in his Mexican village of Michoacan. But with his 
beloved Mexico playing a World Cup soccer match against Bulgaria, Ambriz gave 
up a day's pay earlier this month to join dozens of harvest workers in the 
teeming El Michoacana to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people across the United States share Ambriz's devotion to the 
World Cup. What makes them so loyal, so fanatical, so intensely emotional is 
not the sight of 22 men chasing a ball, they say. It's the immigrant's comfort 
at seeing familiar faces thousands of miles away from the homeland. It's the 
excitement of learning a universal language that opens doors in every corner of 
the world. It's the emotion of a small country battling a mighty foe on the 
world stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fresero from the fields," said Ambriz, proudly raising his rugged 
hands, stained purple from picking strawberries. "But I also love soccer and 
today I'm proud to be a Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of immigrants, soccer was among the hardest things to leave 
behind in coming to the United States. That's why German Luna of Queens, N.Y., 
strutted into Foxboro (Mass.) Stadium two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is Bolivian, it always will be," said Luna, his barrel chest puffed 
with pride, minutes before Bolivia faced South Korea. "This is an incredible 
emotion. Bolivia has never qualified for a World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Luna immigrated to the United States in 1970 and became a U.S. citizen 10 
years later. He loves it here, but he subscribes to El Diario, a Bolivian 
newspaper, so he can stay in touch with soccer back home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna's story is not unlike that of millions of immigrants who have realized 
the American dream. He started as a dishwasher and now owns a prosperous 
clothing store. He celebrates Bolivian religious holidays but also 
Thanksgiving, which does not exist in his homeland. On Columbus Day, Luna and 
his family parade down the streets of New York wearing folk costumes 
tailor-made in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Luna followed Bolivia throughout the World Cup, he made room 
in his heart for the team representing his adopted country. "I love the 
American team," he said excitedly. "Did you see (U.S. defenseman Marcelo) 
Balboa's bicycle kick? Did you see how they shut the Colombians' mouth?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Team USA were to play Bolivia, Luna said, he would be heartsick. "It's a 
very tough choice," he said quietly. "Bolivia is the country of my heart, but I 
like it here. What can I say? I'm American now." 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of temporary immigrants such as Riyad Makki, 19, of Mecca, Saudi 
Arabia, the World Cup is much-needed relief from home sickness. An English 
student at American University for the last six months, Makki said he has been 
slow to adapt to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But his black eyes shined as he stood outside RFK Stadium dressed in his 
flag's green and white, before a Saudi Arabia game recently. "All of Saudi 
Arabia is very happy," he said, suddenly not feeling so alone. "Our Arab 
brothers are with us too. And Muslims from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Makki said, the Saudi Arabian soccer team had given his people 
the opportunity to show that Saudi Arabia is much more than the launching 
ground for the Persian Gulf war. "We have a great country, he said. "We proved 
it (with soccer victories) against Morocco and Belgium." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, where national pride is strong and international 
attention does not center around war, coups and natural disasters, soccer 
occupies a marginal place at best. But times change. Like so many immigrants, 
the World Cup eventually made its voyage to the United States. Not even Uncle 
Sam could ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think soccer embodies the American spirit because anybody can play the 
game. You don't have to be seven feet tall or weigh 250 pounds," said Uncle 
Sam, who was born Leroy Lincoln Rounsville of Quincy, Mass., but has changed 
his legal name. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Sam has attended several World Cup games already and plans to be in the 
Rose Bowl for Sunday's championship match between Italy and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a lot to displace baseball from the American hearts," said 
Sam, in his top hat and red-white-and-blue suit before the Spain-Italy game. 
"But I think soccer definitely has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 This World Cup has also seen a shifting in soccer powers. Perennial favorites 
Italy and Brazil are hardly surprising finalists. But after decades of 
communist oppression, this tournament has been a coming-out party of sorts for 
eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania and Bulgaria have done unexpectedly well only a few years after 
free-market reforms allowed their best players to earn huge sums in the world's 
most prestigious professional leagues. The Bulgarians lost to Italy in the 
semifinals, but received a hero's welcome on their return to Sofia this week. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Brazil beat Sweden Wednesday at the Rose Bowl, Sandra Medrado 
did the samba with fellow Brazilians over to a rocking bar on bustling Colorado 
Street in the nerve center of Pasadena. There, a few blocks were closed off by 
police as hundreds celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was dancing and screaming," said Medrado, a Rio de Janiero native who 
works for the Consulate of Brazilian Los Angeles. "We were all saying we were 
going to have some pasta and pizza on Sunday because we're going to eat the 
Italians." 
</P>
<P>
 Medrado said she hoped to buy tickets to Sunday's game without breaking her 
bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not," she said, "we're going to go to a bar and commemorate."

 Mike Keenan, who last month coached the New York Rangers to their first 
Stanley Cup in 54 years, shocked the team Friday by saying he was leaving 
because of a "breach of contractual obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to announce that I'm no longer the coach of the New York Rangers," 
said Keenan. "The obligations were not fulfilled" by the Rangers, he said. 
"There's quite a significant amount of money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers said Keenan's departure was news to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Square Garden Corp., which owns the team, said it was "stunned at the 
capricious actions of Mr. Keenan and his agent, (Robert) Campbell, and will 
take all necessary actions to preserve all of its rights." 
</P>
<P>
 MSG said it learned of Keenan's 1 p.m. news conference through the media. "As 
of noon today the management of Madison Square Garden was completely unaware of 
the plans of Mike Keenan to hold a press conference and announce he was no 
longer part of the Rangers organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old Keenan declined to elaborate on the contractual differences 
with the Rangers because of what he termed "legal implications." Track

MURRAY'S CUP FEVER TURNS OUT TO BE ONLY A BIG HEADACHE TO FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headline "The Game Has Tied Him Over" and the first paragraph of Jim 
Murray's column in Sunday's sports section were promising. It sounded like Jim 
had been caught up, like so many of us, in World Cup fever and in the game that 
excites fans worldwide. I did not have to read much further, however, to 
realize that the column was to be a sendup of the anomalies of the world's most 
popular sport as they would appear to any football, baseball, golf, boxing, 
fishing and Indy car-loving American sports fan.

 This kind of thinking reminds me of Ralph Kramden of "The Honeymooners" fame, 
when he continually told Alice, "I'm the king and you're nothing!" We must 
guard against the "Kramdenization" of sports, for as we know, Ralph always got

SOME PEOPLE ARE HAPPY ABOUT RAVELING DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is is true that upon learning that George Raveling might leave for Seton Hall, 
the other Pac-10 coaches quickly put together funds to keep overrated George 
from leaving USC? 
</P>

 After reading The Times' July 12 article that George Raveling cites love for 
L.A. in staying as USC's coach, I found nothing to get excited about. However, 
if USC basketball fans think that Raveling's decision to stay is great news, 
then jump for joy, and brace yourselves for another average season. I will be 
pulling for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>

 Raveling stated in his announcement to stay at USC that, "I've placed the best 
effort on integrity and academic commitment and put an emphasis on making the 
program a winning one. I think we've made progress here. Few would deny we've 
met these obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, George, I am one of the few to deny. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous eight seasons before Raveling's arrival, the Trojan basketball 
squads compiled a 123-104 record. In the eight years under Raveling, the record 
stands at 115-118. My USC education tells me that this is not progress in the 
winning department.

 Being around your kid is a noble reason for staying put, all right, but 
closeness in the family goes only so far. As the son of a USC coach or 
professor, George Raveling's son (and thus George) is exempt from having to pay 
USC's exorbitant tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 If Raveling had taken the Seton Hall job, even at $500,000 per year, having to 
fork over all that cash to put Mark through another year at USC would have 
wiped out the family finances. Instead, he has opted for the "I'll let those 
other students who actually have to pay tuition subsidize my son's education" 
strategy. I guess when you get a free education, though, you get what you pay 
for.

 George Raveling's decision to remain at USC was critical to the continued 
growth of this program. One would hope that Seton Hall's aggressive pursuit of 
Raveling would serve as a wake-up call to Athletic Director Mike Garrett and 
his alumni cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling came to USC with a reputation as a recruiter. But it is very 
difficult to sell the local kids on a school whose facilities date to the Bob 
Boyd era. 
</P>
<P>
 If Garrett wants a Pac-10 basketball champion, he has to realize the obvious. 
If you were a local blue-chipper and could chose among Pauley Pavilion, McKale 
Center in Tucson or the glamorous Sports Arena, where would you go? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walsh likes to refer to USC as "Yesterday U." The basketball facilities 
certainly live up to this nickname.

MIKE DOWNEY FAN CLUB NOW CALLED TO ORDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Downey, you expressed amazement in your July 8 column at individuals' 
demeanor during the O.J. Simpson hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 I am amazed at your reaction in a city where television and theater films are 
made regularly depicting a great amount of violence, where drive-by shootings 
have occurred routinely in South-Central and East L.A. and now happen in places 
like San Marino, where infants are found in dumpsters and others don't even 
make it that far, and were people run onto a freeway to cheer a fallen "hero" 
being pursued by the police.

yokels having an opinion that is not politically correct. Now I know that this

everything and stuff, but shucks! Mike, you've lived in Los Angeles too long.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; SPOTLIGHT; HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of British papers chose to use the inevitable Hollywood Western 
analogy for the World Cup final: 
</P>
<P>
 "So the home-town team (explained as Italy with its New York connection) has 
reached the final and now it is a shootout in the West between the two most 
feared gunslingers on the road," said The Times, under the headline, "Italy 
versus Brazil; Baggio versus Romario." 
</P>
<P>
 And The Guardian's David Lacey led his story this way: "So the final will be a 
spaghetti Western after all, and a remake at that.It is 24 years since the pass 
Pele laid into the path of Carlos Alberto for Brazil's fourth and last goal 
against Italy in the Azteca Stadium epitomized the sweet simplicity of the 
game. Now Pasadena waits to see if the same holds true in a modern context."

 TRW Inc. May Sell Competitors' Credit Histories to Consumers: The company said 
it is testing a program to sell not only its own reports on consumer credit 
histories but also those of its two major rivals. For $29, consumers 
participating in the test can find out how their credit standings are rated by 
TRW, Equifax Corp. and Trans Union Corp. Until now, consumers had to call each 
of the three to obtain copies of their credit records.TRW already offers 
customers a free credit report every year. Trans Union and Equifax charge about 
$15 for the service. The new TRW service is being test-marketed on the 700,000 
members of the company's Credentials credit-monitoring program. If the trial is 
successful, the combined credit reports will be offered to the public starting 
next year.

GREENSPAN WARNS ABOUT U.S. DEFICIT; ECONOMY: THE FED CHAIRMAN SAYS DEBT COULD 
ENDANGER FUTURE PROSPERITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that the United 
States is having "ideal" economic times, but he warned that future prosperity 
is jeopardized by the nation's deep budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. economy has recently been experiencing the ideal combination of 
rising activity, falling unemployment and slowing inflation," Greenspan told a 
bipartisan commission on government spending and tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But he made it clear that the nation must not let good economic times create 
an atmosphere in which policy-makers take the view that the deficit, despite 
some recent improvement, is no longer a critical problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot let this good behavior lull us into neglecting the underlying 
problems of our economy," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the impact of the deficit is pervasive and continues to keep long-term 
interest rates high, making it more expensive to finance the red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long-term interest rates are higher now because markets are anticipating 
rising deficits in the next century," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same, he said, he detects a dramatic shift in the public's attitude 
toward the deficit and a willingness to make the hard choices necessary to 
bring the economy into balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope and really do believe" progress will be made, Greenspan said, adding 
that improvement will show up in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States has no choice but to deal with the deficit, because 
the debt will eventually bring economic instability and very hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no alternative to scaling back growth in federal spending if we are 
to avoid growing deficits as we move into the next century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the deficit looming in the years ahead is mostly a creature of 
medical costs, which are expected to balloon.

EXPIRATION OF OPTIONS GIVES STOCKS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks moved higher Friday after getting a late boost from options 
expirations, and bond yields edged upward, forcing prices down in a bout of 
profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar slid against most major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day marked by little investor interest, the Dow Jones industrial average 
rose 14.56 points to 3,753.81, ending 44.67 higher for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 275.86 million shares changing hands, down from Thursday's 
322.33 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer problems caused the Nasdaq trading system to delay opening until 
shortly before noon, causing difficulties for index traders who were trying to 
square positions ahead of the options expiration. The Nasdaq index of mostly 
smaller companies fell 0.20 to 721.36. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq problems added to the normal volatility associated with options 
expirations. Both made it difficult for traders to discern whether the market 
can extend Thursday's gains, when the Dow rose 34 points following a sharp gain 
in bond prices and a recovery in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the rally's over, but it makes you question whether it's going 
to be broad-based," said Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow fell 8 points at the opening but then moved into positive territory 
along with bonds, which advanced in reaction to a report that business 
inventories rose a larger-than-expected 1.1% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts concluded that larger inventories could put a downward pressure on 
future manufacturing activity, which could slow the economy and head off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The week's rally in the Treasury market fizzled, with bond prices giving up 
early gains despite the signs of slower economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth day this week, the government released figures indicating the 
economy lost steam in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The accumulation of news helped spur further bond buying in early trading, 
leading to modest price gains after a 1 3/8-point rally Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But by day's end, the long bond's yield edged up 7.54% from 7.53% on Thursday. 
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, was down 3/32 point, or 94 
cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of shorter-term maturities ended mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar drifted lower against the Japanese yen but was little 
changed against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar slipped to 97.85 Japanese yen, down from 98.60 on 
Thursday. The dollar also slipped to 1.554 German marks from 1.555. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas Instruments tumbled 6 1/8 to 80 1/4 after saying it expected 
semiconductor growth to moderate in the second half. The company reported 
second-quarter earnings of $1.93 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chip stocks slipped, with Intel down 2 to 59 1/2, Motorola off 1 3/8 to 
48 7/8 and LSI Logic off 1 3/8 to 27. IBM declined 1 3/8 to 56 7/8, Altera fell 
6 1/2 to 25 1/2 and Apple lost 3/8 to 28 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Altera said it expects revenue growth in the third quarter to be less than 
what analysts had predicted. Shares in the programmable logic devices company 
fell 6 1/2 to 25 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three-Five Systems, which makes LED and LCD display systems, jumped 6 1/4 to 
37 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bankers Trust New York dipped 1 1/4 to 65 3/8. Merrill Lynch downgraded its 
near-term rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eli Lilly slipped 1/8 to 50 1/2. The drug maker, which has agreed to buy 
McKesson's PCS prescription benefits company, said its second-quarter net 
earnings rose to $1.20 a share, including a $10-million charge, from $1.18 a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended up 37.99 points at 2,093.61, while 
London's Financial Times 100-share average closed at 3,074.8, up 24.4 points on 
the day for a rise of 112.4 from last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei ended 52.11 points higher at 20,770.15, and 
Mexico City's Bolsa index was down 1.55 points at 2,281.23.

'LOLLAPALOOZA': A FESTIVAL OF COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hilburn seems to think of the "Lollapalooza" festival as a competition 
instead of a cooperation (" 'Lollapalooza': A Smashing Start," July 9). The 
festival is not about who wins or loses.It is not a contest or a battle of the 
bands. No one is trying to "overshadow the headliners," and the bands are not, 
as Hilburn writes, "competing against seven other acts." They aren't competing 
at all! 
</P>
<P>
 When Perry Farrell put together "Lollapalooza," he said it should be a 
"cultural smorgasbord." It's not only about music; it's about ideas. Farrell 
said he hoped to create a one-day summer camp that would educate and stimulate 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times articles didn't even mention the "Mind Field" arena for political 
and social discourse. And "Lollapalooza" also affords the musicians an 
opportunity to interact with bands that they wouldn't usually share a stage 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilburn and Lorraine Ali did not mention the art displays; the Australian 
Outback food shack; the indie label record kiosk, and Teeth, the "Lollapalooza" 
newspaper featuring letters from the bands, profiles of poets and background on 
half a dozen organizations, including shelters for battered women and AIDS 
hospices that will receive an estimated $600,000 from the show.

DRAI'S RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Drai's Restaurant: Parlez-Vous le Show Biz?" (July 7): I appreciate the 
panache of Drai's.But the article left out an important ingredient in Drai's 
recipe for success: the presence of chef Claude Segal, whose culinary career 
spans Ma Maison, Bistango and Picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Segal has demonstrated mastery in the kitchen without a lot of bravado. It's 
simply "on the plate," and, if it wasn't, the powerbrokers or just plain people 
would simply not keep coming back, as they, and I, continue to do.

KAREN CARSON'S ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her review of an important new show by artist Karen Carson, Susan Kandel 
misreads irony and sarcasm in work that is baldly sincere, tremulously honest 
and blatantly spiritual ("Beautiful Photographs of a Beautiful World," June 
23). When she claims that Carson's past work has relied on "marked sarcasm," 
Kandel shows that she has no understanding of the history of an artist whose 
work has always been daringly earnest and pointedly direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson's stripped-to-the-bone graphic medium presents her simple message: "You 
are a soul." Carson's radical work is an obvious rebuttal to the political 
hectoring of recent art by Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer. It conveys a 
spiritual message in a graphic style that everyone can understand. That Kandel 
finds it "sarcastic" is completely wrongheaded and truly appalling. Kandel 
needs to take a closer look at Carson's startlingly spiritual banners and 
posters.

TV HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had the pleasure of reading Robert Koehler's review "TV Hall of Fame: It's 
the Presenters' Show" (June 25), and it certainly hit the mark re the 
deterioration of the Television Academy Hall of Fame. Having once served a term 
on the selection committee, I'm not surprised by the declining quality of the 
nomination process. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who started in television in 1947, I discovered that the current batch 
of committee members too often were simply unaware of great names of the past 
who have never been honored. 
</P>
<P>
 My experience was one of disappointment at the speed with which the nominees 
were whittled down to the six required and the general lack of thorough 
discussion about qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 I see no necessity to select new members every year -- the selection process 
should be far more thorough -- unless, of course, the idea is not to honor 
those who make major contributions as much as to get six names for a show.

LANDSCAPING; GRASS MENAGERIE; A MEADOW'S WORTH OF ORNAMENTALS INCLUDES SIZES, 
FORMS, TEXTURES AND COLORS TO FILL ANY GARDEN WITH BLADES OF GLORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Unique among garden plants, ornamental grasses are enjoying a burst of 
popularity. Used in the right places, they are a bold yet soft gesture. In the 
back of a flower border, or as a shrub to delineate the outlines of a garden, 
they show off the wind dramatically and keep their form all year. They bloom -- 
plume, rather -- and offer something every gardener delights in: both beauty 
and hardiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grasses have the personality, if you will, that adjusts to anything," says 
Jana Ruzicka, a landscape architect in Laguna Beach. "They're very beautiful, 
very graceful, very flexible. We can learn a lot from grasses, too, in our own 
aesthetic sense and also in the attitude we have toward nature; in our 
appreciation of simplicity. Grasses have a very unassuming nature, and we need 
more of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's palette of ornamental grasses includes myriad variations in size, 
form, texture and color, with grasses available to suit almost any purpose in 
the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason many people know so little about ornamental grasses is that they're 
usually associated with big gardens at the seashore; in open, prairie-like 
settings; near a large pool or garden pond, or when trying to create a dense, 
jungle atmosphere on open acreage. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: They're not all six feet high. As the demand for grasses has 
gone up, so has the supply, and many of the grasses in catalogues and at 
nurseries are softer and smaller in scale, more in keeping with the way most 
people plan to garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a staple of European and East Coast gardens, ornamental grasses are among 
the easiest to grow of all perennials. Although the majority prefer sunny 
sites, they are otherwise adaptable to a wide range of soil, temperature and 
moisture conditions and are relatively disease- and pest-free. They have 
fibrous root systems that are very efficient, making most grasses extremely 
drought tolerant. For the most part, maintenance consists of a once-yearly 
cutting back, plus the occasional dividing to renew growth vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 By gardening with ornamental grasses, Ruzicka says, your focus must naturally 
shift slightly away from color to such features as translucence, line, form, 
texture, scale, variegation and seasonal look. 
</P>
<P>
 A general rule of thumb is that grasses "should not be placed one here, one 
there," Ruzicka says. "Look in nature: Grasses grow together, often in between 
perennials. Usually think in terms of grouping rather than placing." 
</P>
<P>
 Grasses, by nature, roam and bend and adjust to their surroundings, so it's 
hard to make mistakes, though careful observation of nature, along with some 
professional advice, will help ensure you get the effect you want.  
</P>
<P>
 Grasses are particularly effective when back lit by the sun, when their 
translucent foliage and flowers shimmer and glow best. Although a few grasses 
are wide-leaved and bold (such as the large-scale giant reed Arundo donax ), 
most have strong-lined, narrow foliage that provides a stunning contrast to 
broad-leaved companion plants. In addition, grasses are at their best when 
intermingled with other types of perennials and with shrubs and trees, much 
like in native settings. The term "ornamental grasses" contains not only 
strictly the members of the gramineae , or grass, family, but the sedge 
(Cyperacae) and the rush (Juncacea) families, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The whole concept of how grass grows might seem redundant, but consider this: 
Most grasses in Southern California are mowed and not allowed to grow 
naturally. When left uncut, unmowed and untouched, grass has a remarkable 
character, very different from the staple cut lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mature grass size (usually grown in one to two seasons) can be 12 inches tall, 
as with large blue-hair grass (Koeleria glauca) , or 12 feet tall, as in the 
case of giant Chinese silver grass (Miscanthus giganteus) . Pampas grass 
(Cortaderia selloana) shoots up so fast that it's said you can hear the plant 
grow on a hot summer day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornamental grasses can also fit into almost any type of garden. Container 
gardens, rock gardens, water gardens (grasses unlock a whole new world of ideas 
for water plant enthusiasts -- many species thrive in or near water), wildlife 
gardens and even cook's gardens. Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) soup is a 
popular Thai dish, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think grasses are just something that happen naturally -- and 
that's true, to a point," Ruzicka says. "But you need a talent to observe 
nature carefully and see how the grasses grow best." 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to go about finding grasses you like is to purchase or check out 
a good book that lists, by category, the hundreds of different types of 
ornamental grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 There are close to 300 species of Juncus or rushes alone, including: Acorus 
(sweet flags); Carex (or sedges; Carex X 'The Beatles' is a mop-headed sedge 
named after the Fab Four); Cortaderia (24 species of pampas grass -- most all 
are gorgeous); Deschampsia (hair grass); Miscanthus (maiden and silver grass); 
Molina (moor grasses); Pennisetum (fountain grass); Stipa (feather grass and 
needle grass), and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a few questions in mind when choosing a particular grass: Is it right for 
your climate? Consider such things as wind, salt air, alkaline soil or drought 
cycles. What maintenance is required? Also, pick a grass that fits and 
complements your overall landscape plan; think movement and transition. Also 
consider the growth habit of the plant; grasses that self-sow will require more 
vigilant weeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some good nurseries that specialize in grasses are the Agrono Tec Seed Co. in 
Lake Elsinore and Larner Seeds in Bolinas in Northern California. Both 
companies have catalogues from which to buy and pick grasses. Ornamental grass 
expert John Greenlee has a Pomona nursery that specializes in many 
hard-to-locate grasses.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some particularly beautiful grasses with fountain-like effects are Miscanthus 
'Morning Light'; the dramatic, tall moor grass Melinia 'Karl Foerster'; the 
golden variegated pampas grass Cortaderia 'Gold Band'; the variegated manna 
grass Glyceria maima or 'Variegata'; the luxuriant porcupine grass Miscanthus 
'Strictus' and the variegated Hakone grass, Hakonechloa Macra 'Aureola.' The 
feathery plumes of Pennisetum villosum are the brightest white of all the 
fountain grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic and tall ornamental grass are numerous. The silvery plumes of ravenna 
grass, Erianthus ravennae , and Miscanthus 'Graziella' are both lovely. Grasses 
are often at their best when used as between perennials, as turf or between 
hard surfaces and perennials.  
</P>
<P>
 "Learn to place ornamental grasses in expected ways," Ruzicka suggests. "Very 
close to a wall or border, or growing under a house. That's how they grow in 
nature, and if you keep this idea in mind, your grasses will show off 
wonderfully." 
</P>
<P>
 There are six primary categories used to define the shape of ornamental 
grasses: tufted, mounded, upright, upright divergent, upright arching and 
arching. Running grasses, also called spreading or creeping grasses (think of 
prairie settings and backhoe removal) can sometimes be invasive; clumping 
grasses, which grow in tufts, are often bunched together and can be anything 
from little two-inch mounds of bearsking fescue (Festuca scoparia) to huge 
pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana) . The often-used Berkeley sedge (Carex 
tumuicola) is a clumping grass and appears like a sod or turf if planted close 
enough to grow together. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Ruzicka's favorite grasses are Sesleria autumnalis , or autumn moor 
grass, a tough but beautiful evergreen with bright yellow-green foliage and 
pretty flower spikes. Another moor grass is Sesleria caerulea, or blue moor 
grass. New Zealand grasses are beautiful and, in the gentle breeze, bring to 
mind prairie settings. Pampas grasses, such as Cortaderia selloana , are among 
the most imposing of the ornamental grasses and can take the place of small 
trees in the landscape. The Korean feather-reed grass Calamagrostis arundinacea 
and a huge specimen of silver feather grass, Miscanthus 'Silberfeder,' are nice 
tall grass choices. 'Pumila,' or dwarf pampas grass, can be used as a hedge or 
breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many choices to pick from with grasses," Ruzicka notes. "And 
they are all so beautiful. I find that here in Southern California people are 
hungry for the particular thing ornamental grasses bring -- beauty, delicacy, 
sturdiness and that sense of native being."

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; SCRUBBING, FRESH PAINT WILL RID TRIM OF BIRD 
STAINS

 Q: We painted the stucco and trim on our house two years ago, and now it's 
been stained by bird droppings. How do we prepare those areas to paint over 
them? 
</P>

<P>
 A: You'll just have to clean the areas the old-fashioned way, says Jim Grant 
of Dutch Boy Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. Take a good, stiff brush, 
some warm water mixed with TSP, and scrub the stains away. After it's been 
scrubbed, give it a good rinsing with the hose. If any of the TSP residue is 
left, your new coat of paint may not adhere very well. If the droppings don't 
come off the trim by brushing, try sanding the area with a light sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We don't have air conditioning, and friends have said we should get ceiling 
fans. I don't understand how blowing the hot air around your house would help 
cool your home. Is that how they work? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 A: Technically, you're right. The fans simply circulate the air in your home, 
says Bob Ownby of A-1 Fans in Anaheim. When you're warm and the circulating air 
hits you, it feels cool. If the air outside is cooler, such as on summer 
nights, and the windows are open, they are effective at drawing the cooler air 
into the house. If you get fans expecting that they'll be a cheap alternative 
to air conditioning, you're going to be disappointed. But they can help you 
feel cooler, and they won't use as much energy as an air conditioner. 
</P>

 Q: Our downstairs toilet is old, and we'd like to replace it. This bathroom is 
carpeted, and we'd like to know how we can remove and replace a toilet without 
staining or damaging the carpet.

 A: You'll need to pull up the carpet to do a good job, says Joel Gwartz of 
B.J. Discount Plumbing & Heating in Garden Grove. In most cases, the carpet is 
cut around the back to allow it to fit around the toilet. Pull it off the tack 
strips, and it should come off. To replace the carpet, you'll need a kicker 
that stretches it out to stick it back on the tack strip. Before getting your 
new toilet, check to make sure that the base is of a similar size or larger 
than the old toilet. If it's a smaller base, you may have a problem fitting the 
carpet around it when it's laid back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently painted some of the rooms in my house, and now I'm having a 
problem with squeaky interior doors. What will keep them lubed but won't ruin 
the finish of the paint on the hinges?

 A: Many spray lubricants are oil-based, which can affect the finish of a 
varnish or paint, says Gary Lillge of Crown Hardware in Corona del Mar. You may 
want to try a dry, silicone-based lubricant, such as Tri-Flow. It's excellent 
for spraying in areas where you don't want any dripping on carpets or walls. It 
also won't collect dust and dirt after it's been applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I'm wallpapering and I need to trim and cut away excess, should I cut 
while the paper's wet, or is it easier when it's dry?

 A: Always trim while the paper's still wet, says paperhanger Dean Gunderson of 
Santa Ana. It's more flexible, and if you wait till it's dry, you may find that 
some areas of the paper haven't adhered properly to the wall. One of the 
biggest mistakes homeowners make is that they don't use sharp razor blades. 
Change blades often and you'll find that trimming is a lot easier. 
</P>

<P>
 Helping Hand Note: After reading a recent question regarding how to get rid of 
odors from a kitchen cabinet, Art Grant of Santa Ana suggested applying a 
pigmented shellac to the inside of the cabinet. After it dries, he said, it 
provides a tough seal that prevents odors from coming through.

 Not content to let ordinary household objects go unadorned, Carlene Challis of 
Laguna Beach turns them into functioning art works. 
</P>
<P>
 Challis, who has been active in the art field for more than 30 years, began 
her Interior Art collection with a series of hand-painted gift cards in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has been embellishing garden gloves ($15), aprons ($29), 
wooden kitchen stools ($100), pillows (two sizes, ranging in price from $80 to 
$155) and other household items. She even paints folding screens and trompe 
l'oeil murals. 
</P>
<P>
 Challis, who works in watercolor and acrylics, was the art restorer for 
Challis Galleries Laguna Beach, where she specialized in hand-tinting antique 
lithographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her pieces can be purchased at Cynthia's of Laguna, 384 Forest Ave., Laguna 
Beach. For more information, call (714) 497-3155. Cuff Links 
</P>
<P>
 Even though jewelry designer Robert Lee Morris doesn't use precious stones in 
his works, his new flatware pattern for Swid Powell/Reed & Barton is quite a 
gem. 
</P>
<P>
 Translating the free-form swirls of his signature cuff bracelet, Morris 
creates tableware that is simple yet dramatic, an ideal complement to any table 
dressing -- formal or casual. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who has a penchant for crosses, hearts and sinuous shapes, 
distinguished himself with his collections for Donna Karan. He learned his 
trade by reading the book "Step by Step Jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' high-quality flatware is sold separately or in five-piece place 
settings ($50 each) in Orange County at Bullock's and Neiman Marcus. A 
five-piece hostess set (butter serving knife, cold meat fork, sugar spoon, 
tablespoon and pierced tablespoon) is $75. 
</P>
<P>
 For a free brochure or more information, call (800) 343-1383. One Person's 
Junk... 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it treasure, some call it clutter, but to many, it's just plain 
junk. That is the topic of a beautifully illustrated book by Mary Randolph 
Carter, "American Junk" (Viking Penguin, $30). 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who also took the photographs, takes readers on a journey through the 
country, sorting and classifying junk in such groups as "solid gold," 
"something fishy," "animal house" and "shell shocked," which features, among 
other things, a shell frame housing a postcard of a "Rubenesque beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also gives tips on what and where to buy items and how to let your 
collectibles stand out in a room.

GARDENING; PHOTOS FOCUS ON ITALIAN VILLA LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhibition and a book open up vistas of stately hedge walks, classical 
stonework and elegantly soaring cypress trees in Italian gardens, photographed 
in 1892 by an American landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles A. Platt (1861-1933), who went on to become a leading designer of 
country houses and gardens, toured Italian Renaissance villa gardens that year 
-- camera in hand.His book, "Italian Gardens," illustrated with his 
photographs, was published in 1894 and had a considerable influence on the 
development of American garden styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York exhibition, "The Italian Garden Photographs of Charles A. Platt," 
displays eight of the original bichromate large-format prints, alongside 70 new 
silver prints made from the recently rediscovered glass plate negatives. Many 
of these photographs were not used in the book and had not previously been 
published. There are also on view a few photos of gardens Platt went on to 
design in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The original book, long out of print, has been reprinted as a catalogue for 
the exhibition (Sagapress Inc. with Timber Press, $34.95). It includes 20 
previously unpublished photos and an essay by exhibition curator Keith Morgan 
on Platt's place in American landscape history. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is on view at the PaineWebber Art Gallery in New York through 
April 1. Exhibitions are being planned at the Museum of Garden History, London, 
and in Chicago.

ELECTRONICS; INTERACTIVE TV GENERATES INTEREST FROM PLUGGED-IN VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is much talk of interactive television becoming the wave of the future, 
but the concept seems to be rapidly sneaking into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Many media companies are working hard to develop their communication 
technologies to offer exciting new services incorporating television, cable and 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 One rudimentary type of interactive service already in operation is 
pay-per-view, where viewers can choose to have their television sets pick up 
movies or sporting events that are offered at specific times by cable 
programmers. With this system, viewers usually have to wait at least 15 minutes 
for a movie to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that audiences seek instant gratification, Bell Atlantic is now 
testing a service where a selected movie can be transmitted via phone lines in 
well under five minutes. Users simply call a number with a touch-tone phone 
hooked up to their TV sets, enter an ID number for the desired program and wait 
for it to start. Even in a household where there is only one phone line, the 
process does not interfere with normal phone use. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery Communications is making further advances in interactive television. 
Its latest project is Your Choice TV, which allows viewers to select and watch 
any previously aired show without having to depend on the networks to broadcast 
it as a rerun. 
</P>
<P>
 This video-on-demand service, which is being tested, will increase viewing 
options and replace the need to set VCRs to tape favorite programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are also developing services that allow viewers to truly interact 
with on-screen activity. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, those who enjoy yelling out answers while watching game shows 
will soon be able to participate, using a system such as the Interactive 
Network control unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interactive Network is already active in parts of California and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete for prizes against other contestants in shows such as "Jeopardy!" 
and "Wheel of Fortune," players can hook up their units to their telephone 
lines and then call an I.N. central computer, which later reports the results 
of the competition via the players' TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast of the game show uses lockouts so viewers cannot cheat by 
waiting for the answers to be announced on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 For $299, people receive the control unit and six months of game playing. 
Normal service is $15 a month; competing for prizes costs $10 extra a month. 
Zing Systems offers a similar service for $125 a year.

EQUIPMENT; HOUSE PAINTING? IT PAYS TO SPRAY -- AND TO PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many professional house painters now use spray equipment more often than 
brushes and rollers to apply paint. Homeowners can, too, with sprayers 
specially designed and priced for amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray-painting is fast and produces an even coating without leaving brush 
marks. A few minutes of spraying often is enough to cover difficult surfaces 
such as shutters and fences that might take hours to paint with conventional 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most professional spray equipment uses compressed air and is expensive and 
complicated. Sprayers for amateurs are airless; they merely pump liquid paint 
through a nozzle somewhat like that of a garden hose. Airless sprayers are 
affordable and easy to use after only a little practice. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all spray-painting equipment, safety and adequate preparation are 
crucial. Airless sprayers can deliver paint at speeds up to 200 m.p.h. and at 
pressures of up to 3,000 pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is sufficient to force paint through skin and into a person's body, so it 
is vital that the tool be used carefully. Never point a sprayer at yourself or 
any person. Keep children and pets well away when spray-painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Unplug the sprayer before unclogging the nozzle or performing any other 
maintenance, and never leave a sprayer -- plugged in or not -- lying about 
unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear safety goggles and a face mask or respirator when spraying. Be sure the 
mask or respirator is labeled effective against the type of paint being used. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing to spray-paint, remove or cover all surfaces that should not 
receive paint, just as for any painting project. But because sprayed paint can 
drift onto more surfaces than drips or slop-overs from clumsy brush or roller 
work, the job must be done on a grander scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, cover window panes with newspaper or plastic wrap held on with tape. 
As with brush or roller painting, cover floors and ceiling fixtures, remove 
hardware, and mask molding. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoors, protect windows, shrubbery and your car before spraying siding. 
Before spraying fences and other items that do not have solid surfaces, place a 
shield such as a large piece of cardboard behind the item, braced against a 
ladder. Spread plastic on the ground to protect the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Start a painting project by setting up the sprayer according to the 
manufacturer's directions. If you have never used a sprayer, first load it with 
water and spray against an outside wall or a scrap of plywood for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The correct technique is to hold the sprayer upright, 10 to 12 inches from the 
surface to be painted, and move it back and forth in horizontal strokes about 
three feet in length, overlapping each stroke by about a third of its width. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the nozzle parallel to the surface being sprayed by stepping from side to 
side. A common mistake is to swing the sprayer in an arc instead, which 
produces thin spots at the edges and deposits too much paint in the middle. 
Spray slightly beyond the edges of the area on each pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Before filling a sprayer with paint, strain out any lumps by pouring the paint 
through several layers of cheesecloth. Lumps can clog the nozzle. You may have 
to thin the paint by about 10% with water or paint thinner, depending on the 
type of paint. Check the manufacturer's directions for specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiment with the pressure control by using different nozzles to obtain the 
smoothest spray. Thin, even coats produce the best results. When finished 
painting, clean the sprayer thoroughly.

CHINA; PLAYING MATCH GAME WITH PATTERNS OF PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL VOGRIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a shelf of thousands, James Allen Murphey picks up a Civil War-era 
covered dish and recites its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was made by Tresmanher & Vogt in France in 1864," the 79-year-old Murphey 
says as he gently turns it over, noting the gold flowers hand-painted atop a 
delicate design embossed into the white china. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time it was made, there were over 60 factories in that area of 
France," Murphey says. "This pattern was probably made until the 1920s. It's 
dated because the manufacturers in those days guaranteed their china against 
impurities for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, it was a casserole dish. But it could have been a plate, a cup, 
a saucer. Murphey's business has become a passion after 50 years searching the 
world for dinner-table furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Old china has produced a new industry, businesses specializing in discontinued 
dinnerware patterns. One store that has been around for decades is Murphey's 
shop, Patterns of the Past in Princeton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need a dish, Murphey's probably got it in his basement, upstairs, even 
a barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is unbelievable," says Pat Wishop of Rockton, Ill., as she and 
Karen Swanson pick through hundreds of dishes in the basement catacombs of 
Murphey's shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teachers had driven to Princeton, like hundreds of other china 
pilgrims each year, in a quest for an obscure, long-ago discontinued pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought a dish that I'm trying to match," Wishop says. "It's from a set 
that my husband's grandmother owned. They weren't even sold in stores. Some of 
the dishes are chipped so I'm hoping to replace them." 
</P>
<P>
 She's in luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphey has her pattern, one of a mind-boggling array of china and crystal in 
all colors, shapes, sizes and styles. They sit floor-to-ceiling on sagging 
shelves that snake, maze-like, through his modest shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers bring plates, pictures of dishes, scrap-paper drawings -- or they 
utter vague descriptions of a pattern in hopes Murphey will recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He catalogues in his mind the 12,000 china patterns stored in seemingly wild 
disarray. Only mental maps exist for most of his stockrooms and barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father has been here, living this business since the 1940s, and now he 
gives speeches and teaches classes on it," says Murphey's daughter, Jyl 
Lorenzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphey says he fell into the business when he was stuck with unsold china 
inventory after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he fell in love with this business," says Winnie Murphey, his wife and 
co-worker of 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Murphey doesn't have a particular pattern, the real hunt begins. 
</P>
<P>
 He will check with some of the 300 importers on both coasts who supply him 
with china. He may contact china salesmen, dealers or even the factories 
overseas -- many of which he has visited over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Auction houses, flea markets and antique dealers are sources for china, as are 
other china-matching shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Assn. of Dinnerware Matchers has about 60 members, said IADM 
President Iris Freeman in Irving, Tex. But several hundred shops nationwide 
sell discontinued china patterns. Most are small and carry only certain brands 
of china or crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly new industry," Freeman says. "A lot of people still don't 
realize there are businesses that specialize in discontinued patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterns of the Past, about average size among the businesses, has six 
employees, a client list of 10,000 and average annual sales between $100,000 
and $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Old china is a lucrative business that has exploded in the past five years, 
says Bob Page, founder of the industry Goliath: Replacements Ltd., in 
Greensboro, N.C. Its sales jumped from $52,000 in 1981 to $21.5 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge demand," says Page, who employs 240 people, has a computerized 
inventory exceeding 1.6 million, massive warehouses and even a restoration 
division complete with kilns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sentimentality involved when a bride picks out a china pattern and 
still thinks it's the best ever made 25 years later," Page says. "It's very 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Page, Murphey's approach is stubbornly low-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers compete for a single phone line to reach Murphey. Handwritten logs, 
not computers, track inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lorenzana is just getting a facsimile machine installed. 
</P>
<P>
 One concession to progress came in 1960 when Murphey entered the mail-order 
business. Today, it's a pillar of the business, bringing in about 300 letters a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't interested in making a million dollars," Lorenzana says. "We're 
interested in personal service -- letting customers roam through the basement, 
get that hands-on experience of finding their patterns. This is exactly what we 
want, and we're happy."

SUICIDE OF YOUNG SUPERSTAR WEIGHS ON PORN INDUSTRY; TRAGEDY: PAMPERED, WILD 
SHANNON WILSEY, KNOWN AS SAVANNAH, WAS THE THIRD ACTRESS TO TAKE HER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After crashing her white Corvette and injuring her much-glorified face on the 
way home from another night of hard partying, Shannon Wilsey sent a friend out 
to walk her Rottweiler, Daisy, and then shot herself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 23-year-old sex video superstar known as Savannah, it was the most 
outrageous act in a short but outrage-filled public life. It was also the third 
major suicide in the adult video industry, whose most valuable and pampered 
commodity is beautiful but often troubled young women. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Shauna Grant shot herself with a .22-caliber rifle. Then Megan 
Leigh shot herself in the mouth after buying her mother a $500,000 dream house. 
Now Wilsey, the "adult industry's most celebrated star," according to the 
monthly Adult Video News, has snuffed out her life apparently to end romantic 
and financial problems that only seemed to escalate as her fame and income 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a trend here? 
</P>
<P>
 Her family thinks so. They gave strict orders to limit the number of Wilsey's 
porn-industry colleagues attending the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether his daughter's problems were worsened by her involvement in the 
sex industry, Mike Wilsey replied: "Of course. People ask me if pornography is 
wrong. I say you can judge a tree by its fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rated industry has begun to respond to the implications of the violent 
deaths of some of its top stars. Plans are under way to establish a phone help 
line that performers confronting personal crises can access 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the need for this, so it's going to happen in the name of 
Savannah and Shauna and the others," said William Margold, a member of the 
board of directors of the Free Speech Coalition, an industry umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether pornography helped destroy Wilsey, the people who knew her best 
since she burst on the scene five years ago as a cool Elke Sommer look-alike, 
talk about a young woman who reveled in her outlaw lifestyle, bragged of dating 
rock stars and was seriously troubled before she shot her first X-rated video. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of her life, she was depressed, in debt and slept with a gun under 
her pillow for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sex industry contributed to Wilsey's demise, they say, it was by 
turning her into a pampered, highly paid star whose whims were indulged and 
tantrums endured. In an industry that shoots on a shoestring, she was known for 
pulling Hollywood-style stunts such as walking out in the middle of a 
production when a rock star paramour came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hollywood lifestyle is a fantasy, the sex-video business is even more 
unreal because it gives its female stars celebrity and wealth but, unlike 
Hollywood, it can never give them approval in the larger society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the industry for mistreating her," said a 26-year-old X-rated 
star known as Danyel Cheeks. "If anything, they spoiled her rotten. They put us 
on such a high pedestal. The limos are sent out. Anything I want is pretty much 
done for me. Sometimes it makes the real world hard to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially true because the audience for sex videos is more fickle and 
has a far shorter attention span than the mainstream film audience. Most 
careers are over in a couple of years. Then the re-entry into the ordinary 
world can be bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in her world, Wilsey hoped to make the transition from sex star to 
legitimate actress. Like others in her world, she did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, many of Wilsey's wounds were self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Wilsey's parents divorced in 1972 when she was just 2. She grew up in 
Texas with her mother and then, after a brief stay with her father in Oxnard, 
lived with her grandparents in Mission Viejo, where she became a high school 
cheerleader. Wilsey told her manager, Nancy Pera, that her childhood was 
unhappy and that she had been molested. That is not uncommon for women who work 
in the sex industry, studies show. Many were abused as children. But Mike 
Wilsey said his daughter never told him about any such abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wilsey said she began dating rock star Gregg Allman while still in high 
school, eventually going on the road with him for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to California and deciding on a career in Hollywood, Wilsey 
drifted into adult entertainment. She rose to fame in the world of screen sex 
as fast as anyone had. Her symmetrical good looks, enhanced by two breast 
enlargements, and her curtains of blond hair brought her to the attention of 
Vivid Video in Van Nuys. The company signed her to a contract and starred her 
in a four-part "On Trial" series that revolved around a porn star's obscenity 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Her growing celebrity and wealth enabled her to indulge her instinct for 
excess. Her fascination with rock stars endured, according to Adult Video News. 
"I love sex and I love sex with rockers more than anything else," she said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of that was probably propaganda for the consumption of naive fans 
who think, or hope, that porn actresses have insatiable sexual appetites, her 
exploits eventually filtered beyond the insular world of pornography. People 
magazine columnist Mitchell Fink reported two years ago that she and one rock 
star engaged in what Fink called "full hit whoopie" in a crowded New York bar, 
after which she jumped into a waiting limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the whispers began: Here was a woman headed for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilsey had the temerity to diss Axl Rose as a lousy sex partner in a 
supermarket tabloid. Bryn Bridenthal, a spokeswoman for Geffen Records, said 
Rose may not even have known Wilsey. 
</P>
<P>
 While mocking conventional mores, she also began isolating herself from the 
people who could have been her natural allies: other porn actors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Wilsey was named the industry's Best New Starlet. At the awards show, 
she became an anti-Sally Field, reportedly saying in her acceptance speech: "I 
know a lot of you don't like me, but that's tough. I got my award." 
</P>
<P>
 She also developed a reputation for hard drinking and drug use. Her father 
said she used heroin for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pera said this hard, wild veneer was constructed to cover a very 
vulnerable and lonely young woman who never felt pretty.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilsey believed she had no friends and had trouble trusting anyone. "She was 
very discriminated against because she was so big and didn't take any shit from 
anyone," Pera said. "She made big money. She knew her value." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her lavish tastes outstripped even her six-figure income. She bought 
designer clothes and decorated her leased hillside home overlooking Universal 
City with thousands of dollars worth of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Her spending on friends was just as mercurial. She spent $3,000 on a birthday 
present. Pera said her idea of economizing was buying a pair of designer shorts 
on sale for $173. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no apparent single event that precipitated the suicide, although 
some said her career had started to slide. More likely, she had been frustrated 
with her inability to break away from the work, as she told Pera she would, or 
break into legitimate acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Wilsey dated Hollywood celebrities, she could never be a part of 
that world. Wilsey's famous pals routinely trashed the sex industry to her, 
"but the whole reason they were with her was because she was a porn star," said 
Jeanna Fine, a former sex star and friend of Wilsey's. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera, 46, who considered herself as much a second mother as a manager, said 
Wilsey had been depressed for months over her breakup with rock guitarist 
Slash, like Rose of the band Guns 'N Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridenthal of Geffen Records denied that Slash had a romantic relationship 
with Wilsey. "If she was (carrying a torch), it was completely one-sided," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Wilsey's problems had been intensifying. "Maybe I should kill 
myself," she told friends on more than one occasion. Police said she owed money 
to the Internal Revenue Service and her savings account was so depleted that 
she had arranged to send Pera money to cover checks from Nyack, N.Y., where she 
was booked for a nude dancing engagement at a club called Lace. 
</P>
<P>
 While videos launch careers in the adult entertainment business, dancing is 
where real money can be made. As a featured performer, Wilsey would earn as 
much as $5,000 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The engagement was due to start Monday of this week, but Pera said Wilsey was 
out late Sunday night partying and riding around in a limo with a young man who 
was house-sitting for the band House of Pain. Pera said Wilsey had been dating 
one of the band members. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilsey drove up the winding road to her home just after 2 a.m. so erratically 
that her passenger complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," she replied. Then she crashed her Corvette into a picket fence, 
taking out part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera was awakened a short time later by Wilsey's hysterical call. "I've just 
had a horrible car accident," the woman wailed. "I broke my nose. It's bleeding 
really bad and I've hit my head. You have to take me to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Pera dressed and drove to Wilsey's house, not too hurriedly because she was 
used to late-night calls from the sex star. When she arrived, she found 
Wilsey's body lying in a pool of blood in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pera saw the exit wound from the bullet. "It looked like she had a big flower 
on the side of her head," she said. When emergency personnel carried Wilsey 
out, Pera grabbed her foot and screamed: "Savannah, stay with us!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pera said Wilsey got the gun from a friend for protection against prowlers, 
and slept with it under her pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Police ruled the death a suicide. "She was not happy with her life as a whole, 
everything in her life," said Los Angeles Police Detective Mike Coffey. "I 
think her whole life caused her suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Pera speculated that the injury to her face from the car wreck could have 
seemed like the last straw, because it would have prevented her from making the 
nude dancing engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the need for counseling in the industry, Pera said Wilsey was in 
great conflict over her lifestyle, despite her public bravado. She bragged 
about doing crazy things, yet she told Pera she wished her mother had tried to 
stop her from performing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt bad because her mother didn't say anything about her being in the 
business," Pera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wilsey had tried to mend fences with his daughter recently. After her 
death, he found an unmailed letter she had written to him. "Where was I when 
she was dating Gregg Allman when he was 25 years older than she was? Where was 
I when she was on heroin? Where was I when she started doing porno movies?" was 
how Mike Wilsey paraphrased it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would have been there had she only asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many in the business, Paul Fishbein, the publisher of Adult Video News, 
resents any implication that the sex industry could have played a role in 
Wilsey's death. "Porn didn't do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fishbein said he recognizes that it is time for the industry to face 
the problems young actresses bring with them. He said the help line is "still 
in the formative stages," but insisted "it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing on Margold's mind these days are not the deaths that have already 
occurred, but those waiting to happen. "Six weeks ago at 3 a.m. I got a call 
from an actress who said the business has no soul. She said four years ago, 
somebody told her that and then that woman killed herself."

 TOUGH CALL: Dave Wynalda has mixed feelings about Sunday's World Cup final. On 
the one hand, Wynalda, who owns Soccer Kick, a soccer specialty store in 
Westlake Village, would like to see Brazil win. His son, Eric, played for the 
U.S. team that lost to Brazil. But then again, business is business. . . . 
"Italian fans support their team big-time with purchases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAGGING RIGHTS: The Pellegrinis of Calabasas, however, are divided in an 
entirely different way. Ronaldo will root for his native Italy, while his wife, 
Mercedes, will cheer for her beloved Brazil (B1). . . . Still, the Pellegrinis 
can't take their rivalry too seriously. "We're too financially entwined; we 
couldn't afford it," Ronaldo said. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER YOUNT: His kid brother, Robin, will make it to the Hall of Fame, but 
ex-Taft High star Larry Yount (above) never made it to first base -- or home 
plate. He got into one game in the majors, but had elbow trouble during 
warm-ups, and that was that. Game, set, career (C16). . . . Today, he's 
president of a triple-A team in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRISTIAN CONCERT: It won't rival Barbra Streisand or the Three Tenors as the 
summer's other major musical event, but, as far as Christian music goes, it's a 
pretty big deal. It's Summer Praise '94, Aug. 11-14 at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center in Burbank (B13). . . . In all, more than 50 artists and 
musical groups will perform, including Carman, who was twice named Contemporary 
Christian Artist of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 ALREADY GONE: Jupiter may go through big changes tonight, but things on Earth 
stay the same. According to Louise Luman, a secretary at CSUN's physics and 
astronomy department, an irate women called to complain about the fact that 
people will have to wait in line to use the school's telescope to see the 
effects of the comet crash, which will last all week. "But what if I miss it?" 
the caller asked. Michael Arkush

STUDY SAYS NASA CHARGED IMPROPERLY BY MCDONNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The investigative arm of Congress concluded in a study released Friday that 
McDonnell Douglas Aerospace -- a major contractor for the beleaguered space 
station -- improperly charged the government for more than $300,000 in 
lobbying, advertising, consulting services and other costs, some of them in 
violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted by the General Accounting Office and requested by Rep. 
John Conyers (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Committee on Government 
Operations, reviewed $3.6 million in 1989-92 overhead costs submitted by 
McDonnell Douglas' Space Station Division in Huntington Beach and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the first in a series of investigations requested by the 
committee in light of a "protracted history" of contract mismanagement at the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Space Station Division was selected for review because nearly all of its 
sales were to NASA. The space station is one of NASA's biggest and costliest 
endeavors, an orbiting laboratory that has itself been beset by delays in 
construction and a mounting number of critics who dismiss it as frivolous 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) illustrates the waste permitted by lax contract management and 
oversight," Conyers said of the GAO report. He called for stronger oversight, 
noting that roughly 9% of the 1989-92 overhead costs billed by McDonnell 
Douglas -- then the space station's prime contractor -- were "unallowable or 
inadequately supported." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA spokesman Mark Hess said officials there had not yet seen the report and 
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas officials said they never intended to improperly bill the 
government and would correct any error brought to their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to work with NASA in correcting any problems we had in the accounting 
process," said spokeswoman Anne Toulouse. "It certainly was not our intent to 
mischarge items on the space station." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the $328,000 in inappropriate or unsubstantiated costs cited by the GAO 
were: 
</P>
<P>
 * $129,000 for lobbying Congress and executive branch officials, even though 
federal statutes and codes prohibit billing for such activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * $42,000 in a duplicate payment for advertising services. 
</P>
<P>
 * $69,000 for consulting services involving programs other than the space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 * $77,000 in charges for consulting services that were not adequately 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
 "And although barred by statue and regulation, McDonnell Douglas even charged 
NASA about $7,000 in first-class air fare and more than $4,000 in registration 
fees at social and public relations events," Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report said that although other billing practices did not appear to 
violate federal regulations, they raised "serious questions" nevertheless, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 * $53,000 to offset income taxes and social security taxes for employees who 
had received $1,000 incentive bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * $348,000 for reassignment payments offered by McDonnell Douglas as 
inducements for employees to accept transfers to other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * $1.9 million in employee educational expenses, which, although allowable, 
were considered excessive since they represented more than half of the $3.6 
million in overhead that was charged. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of NASA's $14-billion budget deals with contracts and acquisitions, 
Conyers said, suggesting that if so much waste was found by examining just $3.6 
million, the window of vulnerability for more waste could be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings will likely be held to review the GAO findings, officials said. Even 
if proved true, however, no penalty is likely to result. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it works is, they just give the money back," one congressional aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are yet another black mark against a space station that was 
unveiled with great fanfare by then-President Ronald Reagan as pioneering space 
exploration, but has been forced to go begging to Congress for money almost 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 With federal dollars scarce, lawmakers have slashed the budget year after 
year, causing construction delays and resulting in the loss of 1,500 jobs at 
the Huntington Beach facility -- virtually half of the space station team 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects improved last month, however, when the House -- which nearly killed 
the space station entirely last year -- voted in June to fund $2.1 billion to 
keep the project alive.

LAWYER CHOSEN TO AID O.C. POOR IS ON BAR PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the attorneys selected this week by a panel of Santa Ana judges to 
share the county's largest contract for defending poor clients is on probation 
for legal misconduct, State Bar of California records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana attorney Patrick D. McNeal was placed on three years' probation in 
May after he failed to provide status reports or file appropriate documents for 
a client in a divorce case, records show. It was the bar's second disciplinary 
action against McNeal in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Central Municipal Court Judge Gregory H. Lewis, who proposed that 
McNeal share the $1-million-a-year contract with two other firms, said he was 
unaware of the disciplinary actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, I'm taken aback by this," Lewis said Friday. "Frankly, I'm not aware of 
any of this. Now, we can do some investigation, but that's as much as I should 
say right now." 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal did not return repeated telephone calls to his office Thursday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract currently is held by Santa Ana attorney William W. Stewart, who 
has been criticized for his hands-off handling of the caseload. Stewart has 
business interests in Bogota, Colombia, and Las Vegas and sometimes 
communicates with court officials by telephone or fax from South America. There 
also have been complaints that Stewart has not provided enough attorneys to 
cover the Santa Ana cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Lewis and other Central Court judges on Wednesday proposed 
rotating the contract between Stewart, McNeal and a law third firm. McNeal's 
firm currently works as a backup to Stewart on the contract to defend people 
who can't afford their own attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 But under terms of that contract, Lewis confirmed Friday, any State Bar 
disciplinary action could be grounds for McNeal's disqualification from future 
county business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that it would automatically disqualify him," Lewis said, but 
he added that State Bar disciplinary action "is grounds for termination from 
the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has said that the contract reorganization proposed by the judges 
requires Stewart's approval because more than a year remains on Stewart's 
existing Central Court agreement, which he has held almost exclusively for the 
past 15 years. Friday, the judges were still awaiting Stewart's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disclosures involving McNeal may alter the panel's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 According to State Bar records, McNeal, 45, was placed on probation two months 
ago in connection with his handling of a divorce case involving client Joyce 
Allard.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1990, Allard paid McNeal an advance of $1,151 to take her case, 
the records show. A month later, Allard's divorce petition was filed in Orange 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Allard complained that from January, 1991, to January, 1993, McNeal failed to 
respond to her repeated attempts to obtain a status report on the case, bar 
records state. At one point, one of McNeal's office staffers "falsely informed 
Allard that her divorce had been finalized," according to bar officials. 
</P>
<P>
 State Bar officials said McNeal's actions were violations of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct, resulting in the probation. The rules provide a guide for 
lawyers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal's probationary term, during which he can continue to practice law,is 
scheduled to end in May, 1997, a bar spokeswoman in San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, however, the attorney must make quarterly reports to the 
State Bar's probation monitor and pass the California Professional 
Responsibility Exam. Failure to abide by those terms could result in a 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, McNeal was previously issued a private reproval or 
censure by the State Bar in connection with a 1989 case. Details of that 
incident were unavailable, but bar records show that it involved allegations 
that McNeal failed to communicate with a client and did not return "unearned 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 incident was characterized as an "aggravating circumstance" during 
the bar's consideration of the most recent disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McNeal's probation does not restrict his practice, as long as he 
abides by the rules of probation, Lewis said terms of his contract with the 
county state that disciplinary proceedings initiated by the State Bar or 
failure to observe the Rules of Professional Conduct are grounds for contract 
revocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The third firm named to share the defense contract -- the partnership of 
Creighton B. Laz and Edward W. Hall -- has a clean record with the State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart also has not been the subject of bar discipline. Court records show, 
however, that bankruptcy proceedings are pending against Stewart's real estate 
firm, which owns the building housing his Santa Ana law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the county contract list bankruptcy actions against contract 
attorneys as grounds for termination. But Lewis said Central Court judges found 
that the Stewart bankruptcy concerned the attorney's real estate partnership 
only and did not directly affect his law practice or contract performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally provides legal services to people who 
can't afford their own attorneys, but it must defer to private firms under 
contract to the county when conflicts arise in cases where there are multiple 
defendants. In Santa Ana, Stewart's firm has the contract for referrals. McNeal 
and Laz & Hall handle only those cases in which Stewart's firm has declared a 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's findings against McNeal clearly surprised Lewis, who described 
McNeal as having "a good reputation with me." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been around an awfully long time," Lewis said. "I've had no previous 
knowledge of this."

U.S. BALKS AT COSTS OF GARAGE NEAR DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A federal transit agency will contribute only $17.5 million toward building a 
giant $223-million parking garage next to Disneyland because the seven-story 
structure would mostly serve the amusement park and its proposed expansion, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the garage has long been considered key to the Walt Disney 
Co.'s planned $3-billion park expansion, tying into a countywide intermodal 
transportation center for cars, buses and light-rail trains. 
</P>
<P>
 County transportation officials had expected the federal government to pay 
$131 million of the 12,000-space garage cost, with Disney kicking in about $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter sent last month to the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
federal officials objected that the garage appears to be intended "primarily 
for Disneyland," and they noted that only 1,000 spaces will be available to 
public transit users, mostly park-and-riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have previously stated," Gordon J. Linton, administrator of the Federal 
Transit Administration, wrote on June 13, the agency "will not participate in 
the . . . costs beyond the share that would be used for mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, federal officials told the local transit agency that if it still 
wants the $17.5 million in federal funds, it must file a second environmental 
assessment report that should also address alternative sites for the garage. 
The garage is to be built on Clementine Street, between Freedman Way and 
Katella Avenue. Mills said construction is scheduled to begin in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency's position raises new questions about Disney's Westcot 
expansion andOCTA's ability to fund the controversial garage project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mills, chief deputy at OCTA, said Friday that she remains optimistic that 
the local transportation authority will eventually get all the federal money it 
hoped for and called the proposed parking facility "a model." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that we will only receive $17.5 million," Mills said. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena's "policy for transportation projects is 
that they provide sustaining revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills denied that the facility is intended for Disneyland's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, this will be a public facility owned by OCTA," said Mills. 
"Anyone can use this facility. Yes, a lot of the parking will be for 
Disneyland, but anyone can use it. The revenues will come to OCTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said the project will not die even if the federal contribution comes up 
short. If that happens, "we'll just have to look at other funding options." She 
estimated that the structure will generate up to $9 million in parking fees 
annually, which will be used for local transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. transit authorities also suggested that local officials consider 
alternative sites for the parking garage. And with the federal government's 
"limited participation in the project," Linton expressed "significant concerns 
regarding (OCTA's) ability to finance the facility and expanded bus 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Local transit officials have long acknowledged that it would be difficult to 
complete the project without federal funding. Earlier this year, they approved 
$32 million in local funds for construction, contingent on the federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities still have to approve an environmental impact report for the 
garage and will not release any funding until they sign off on the document. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, transit administration spokesman Brian Cudahy in Washington 
confirmed that the federal agency intends to fund only the 1,000 spaces for 
transit use. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton's letter was not the first time that federal authorities had expressed 
concern about the cost-effectiveness of the garage and its benefit to Disney, 
according to documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Jan. 24 letter to OCTA chief executive officer Stan Oftelie, FTA Regional 
Administrator Stewart F. Taylor complained that Disney appeared to be getting 
the better end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $219-million total construction costs of the (garage), with Disney's 
contribution at $20 million, on the surface appears to be very disproportionate 
with the identified transit benefits," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney pledged $20 million to the project, but Mills said the local 
transportation authority has not received any money from the entertainment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the January letter, Taylor said that since federal officials were only 
willing to pay for 1,000 spaces, the local transportation agency's request for 
$127 million for construction of the garage amounted to a cost of $127,000 per 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) is far in excess of FTA's previous investment in parking structures," 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 FTA spokesman Cudahy added Friday that the agency "will only fund that element 
of the project that is mass transit in nature, and that totals to $17.5 
million. . . . We are not going to fund a parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that if federal officials determine that the parking structure 
is designed solely to accommodate the Disney planned Westcot expansion, "then 
we're pulling out entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton's June 13 letter also said that federal authorities will release the 
$17.5 million for the garage only after local transportation officials conduct 
"an examination of alternative sites" and convince the federal transit agency 
"that the Disney location is the preferred site." 
</P>
<P>
 In letters dated Jan. 24 and April 12 to Oftelie, federal transit officials 
suggested that the Anaheim Metrolink Station be considered as an alternative 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This location serves both buses and commuter and intercity rail," said one 
letter, while the other noted that "with 24 passenger trains a day operating 
over the Los Angeles/San Diego rail line and stopping at Anaheim, an evaluation 
of this kind should be considered." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mills said the Metrolink Station is unsuitable for the transportation 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Metrolink site doesn't work as well for us. The location we have near 
Disneyland works better," Mills said. "We have over 500 buses going through 
that (Disneyland-Anaheim Convention Center) area on a daily basis that would 
feed into the center. It is also centrally located for shuttling people between 
the Fullerton and Anaheim Metrolink stations."

ATTORNEY MUST RETURN MILLIONS FROM ESTATE; COURTS: JUDGE TELLS FORMER PROBATE 
LAWYER TO REPAY $3.5 MILLION PLUS INTEREST TO HEIRS OF LEISURE WORLD MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a case that attorneys described as without precedent in California, an 
Orange County Superior Court judge on Friday ordered former probate lawyer 
James D. Gunderson to return $3.5 million he received from the estate of a 
98-year-old Leisure World man. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief written decision, Judge Byron K. McMillan said Gunderson should 
repay the money, plus $500,000 in interest, to heirs of Merrill A. Miller, who 
died in February, 1992, leaving an $18-million estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Miller's death, Gunderson began paying himself his one-fifth 
share of the estate, as he began selling Miller's substantial holdings of 
Abbott Laboratories stock. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday evening, Gunderson's lawyer, Stuart Lesansky, said he was 
disappointed with the court's ruling. He said he plans to request a statement 
of decision -- a written explanation of the judge's ruling -- before deciding 
his next action. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's inheritances from the Miller estate, and from those of several of 
his other elderly clients, were brought to light in a series of articles 
published by The Times in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The articles prompted the state Legislature in 1993 to pass a new law, pushed 
by Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), that 
invalidated most bequests to attorneys who prepare wills and trusts naming 
themselves as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Westover, a Phoenix lawyer representing eight heirs who contested 
the bequest to Gunderson, said he was delighted by the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will serve as a warning to all those lawyers, fiduciaries and people in 
positions (of confidence) that if they abuse their trust, they will pay for 
it," Westover said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a substantial number of published cases about attorneys who have, 
while acting as an attorney for a client, prepared a will in which the attorney 
was named as a beneficiary," Westover also said in court papers filed last 
week. "In this particular instance, the ingenuity of James Gunderson, in 
devising other means by which he could profit from his clients' estates, has no 
precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 In his handling of Miller's estate, Gunderson arranged for a former law 
partner to serve as the attorney of record when the final version of Miller's 
will and some trust documents were presented to the blind and bedridden 
98-year-old man only six weeks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, 69, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the civil trial, Gunderson testified that Miller was his best friend 
and fishing buddy. Miller, he said, wanted him to have the lion's share of his 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his Friday ruling, the judge sided with the heirs whose attorneys claimed 
that Miller's gift to Gunderson followed a disquieting pattern in which the 
probate lawyer received inheritances from the estates of several other clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances appeared to conflict with a long-standing California Supreme 
Court ruling that anything more than a "modest" gift to an attorney preparing a 
will raised questions of impropriety. The justices in that landmark case 
decided that a $20,000 bequest was excessive, and ordered that inheritance 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict against Gunderson is the latest in a series of actions triggered 
by the November, 1992, Times articles detailing how Gunderson inherited 
millions of dollars in cash, stock, and real estate from clients whose wills 
and trusts had been prepared either by him or other members of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the Times articles appeared, the State Bar of California 
announced that it would conduct an investigation into Gunderson's legal 
practice. Gunderson surrendered his license to practice law in California in 
January, after State Bar prosecutors announced that they were prepared to file 
conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his possible disbarment. 
Gunderson said he resigned because of his failing health. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances described in the Times story are still being investigated by 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which monitored the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times articles also disclosed that Gunderson had secured title to a square 
mile of land in San Bernardino County and a 316-acre Fresno ranch from the 
estates of two other clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another case, Gunderson inherited nearly $250,000 in AT&T stock from a 
Canadian woman who had been declared senile five months before Gunderson 
prepared her last will and testament, making himself the estate's major 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Other heirs in that case sued Gunderson and later agreed to drop the suit in 
exchange for a $60,000 out-of-court settlement to be paid by Gunderson. 
Gunderson said he settled to save himself the litigation costs, and an attorney 
for the Canadian woman's heirs said they accepted less than the full $250,000 
because of the high costs of going to court in another country. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial involving Miller's estate, the judge permitted the heirs' 
attorneys to introduce evidence about Gunderson's other inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from raising questions about the inheritances mentioned in The Times' 
articles, the attorneys said they found several other cases in which Gunderson 
was a named beneficiary of clients' estates. 
</P>
<P>
 In one previously unreported case, Gunderson awarded himself the remainder of 
the estate of Mary Hall after her death. He testified that the woman wanted him 
to inherit all her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the heirs' attorneys accused Gunderson in court papers of a 
"surreptitious theft" involving a painting by Charles Russell, a noted painter 
of Native Americans and their landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys claimed that Gunderson paid the estate $16,000 for the painting, 
then gave it to his secretary's husband who resold it at a $71,000 profit, 
which both men shared. Gunderson denied the allegation, saying his secretary's 
husband alone reaped the profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machinations uncovered by these proceedings, of which the foregoing . . . 
are only a fraction, suggests strongly we have learned only the tip of the 
iceberg," the heirs' attorneys contended in court papers. They noted that 
Gunderson had handled the estates of an estimated 8,000 clients, and "the 
opportunities would have presented themselves on multiple occasions were he 
willing to breach his fiduciary responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesansky, Gunderson's lawyer, disputed such claims. He said in court papers 
filed this week that there were only "a handful of instances where Mr. 
Gunderson was remembered by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Gunderson served his clients in an extraordinary (and yet simple) 
fashion, much like the country doctor, making house calls, passing time with 
his clients, giving a reassuring pat on the back, a kind word, and most of all, 
lending a compassionate ear." 
</P>
<P>
 The heirs' attorneys will most likely have to wage another legal battle to 
recover the $4 million. Gunderson testified during trial that he had 
transferred a portion of the inheritance to a trust controlled by his children, 
and converted the remainder to into cash for himself. The judge said Linda 
Gunderson, his daughter and former law partner, was liable for $743,888 of the 
$4-million judgment, accepting the heirs' argument that her father transferred 
some Abbott stock from Miller's estate into her account. 
</P>
<P>
 Westover -- who with his father, John H. Westover of Phoenix, and his cousin, 
Harry Westover of Corona del Mar, represented the heirs -- said he was 
delighted that the judge had vindicated the heirs' decision to challenge 
Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In papers filed last week, the Westovers made an impassioned plea for the 
judge to "send a message to the public that the profession and the system (do) 
not condone the greedy, selfish conduct of attorneys who misuse the . . . trust 
vested in them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now know that by abusing the secrecy which the system has afforded to his 
clients, Mr. Gunderson and his family have profited by untold sums at the 
expense of estates of those whom he purported to protect," the Westovers said. 
"His conduct is also at the expense of those members of the profession who do 
not want to be known as greedy, conniving shysters."

 BEYOND RAP: It's Broadway tunes at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
this afternoon, by two dozen young people who put the show together themselves. 
The free shows, 4 and 6 p.m., are the finale of a two-week summer workshop for 
high school youth considered high risk for not making it to graduation. Tom 
Tomlinson, the center's executive director, says of the program, in its third 
year: "Ninety percent have gone on to graduate from school, and some have even 
gone on to study music in college."

 NAKED FACE: Here's a sure sign that November is approaching: Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) has shaved off his beard. The congressman, seeking a 
ninth term this fall, makes a habit of shedding his red whiskers for the 
campaign trail, leaving them intact only once, in 1986. (He won anyway.) His 
wife, Sallie, says she's fond of his beard: "It gives him a nice Viking look."

 NO WHITNEY: The Pond of Anaheim is having bad luck with its star-studded

for the same reason. Houston, who recently suffered a miscarriage, had to 
cancel in Phoenix Thursday night because of a sore throat. But her staff had 
told the Pond she had hoped to keep tonight's date. The concert was rescheduled

 JUDICIAL LUAU: Appellate Court Justice Edward J. Wallin may look somber in his

$40 each -- coming to their Orange Park Acres back yard today for the second 
annual Rumple's Surfin' Safari party. . . . The music is by "Attractive 
Nuisance," a band of lawyers, with Municipal Judge Ronald P. Kreber on 
tambourine. Sponsored by the Orange County Barristers, it's all for a cause -- 
to benefit the Orangewood Children's Foundation.

THE EMERGING WIRELESS INDUSTRY; PACBELL WANTS BACK INTO GAME 
</P>

<P>
 Four months after spinning off its cellular phone unit, Pacific Telesis Group 
said Friday that it will return to the mobile communications arena and compete 
with its former subsidiary, now known as AirTouch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis, through its newly formed Pacific Bell Mobile Services unit, 
said it will bid aggressively for licenses enabling it to offer so-called 
personal communications services, a new type of wireless technology that could 
pose a major challenge to existing cellular networks. The Federal 
Communications Commission plans to auction the licenses for so-called wide-band 
PCS this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Pacific Bell Mobile Services intends to act as a reseller of 
conventional cellular services. That would enable the company to get into the 
wireless communications business much more quickly, because PCS services are 
not expected to be fully operational until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission expected Pacific Telesis' action 
and said it was pleased to see further competition in the fast-growing wireless 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commissioners are unhappy with the duopoly structure," Douglas Dade, 
supervisor of the PUC's Telecommunications Branch, said in reference to rules 
that now allow just two cellular carriers in each market. "They are looking for 
PCS to provide additional competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyn Daniels, president of Pacific Bell Mobile, said in an interview that his 
unit plans to "spend hundreds of millions of dollars" over the next three years 
to create a PCS network. And he indicated that he will bring a hefty checkbook 
to the PCS auctions, which are expected to raise as much as $10 billion for the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyn said the company will bid on the big Southwestern PCS license covering 
Southern California and Las Vegas, the license covering the Bay area and a few 
other licenses covering smaller areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important to our overall position in California," Daniels said. "We 
have the highest value to bring to the market, so we are in a position to pay 
the highest prices."  
</P>
<P>
 Established cellular carriers are barred from bidding for PCS licenses in 
major markets, so Pacific Telesis would not be able to go ahead had it not spun 
off AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
 The wireless market in California is growing at a rate of 45% a year, and 
analysts say there is room for dozens of new wireless services. With a denser 
urban antenna network to relay signals, PCS will feature transceivers smaller 
and cheaper than cellular phones. Proponents say PCS technology will eventually 
enable users to make and receive calls anywhere, including inside office 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pacific Bell Mobile faces an uphill battle in becoming a serious player in 
the market. Its lawyers are still fighting government regulators for the right 
to bid on a key Southern California PCS license, which had initially been 
granted to one of the PCS technology "pioneers." Some skeptics doubt PCS will 
ever compete head to head with full-fledged cellular phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anyone becoming a major wireless provider in competition with 
cellular using PCS licenses," said Herschel Shostek, whose research company 
focuses on cellular services. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiver reported from Washington and Helm from San Francisco.

THE EMERGING WIRELESS INDUSTRY; AT&T'S BID FOR MCCAW WINS KEY APPROVAL; 
COMMUNICATIONS: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OKS THE MERGER, SUBJECT TO SOME 
RESTRICTIONS. FURTHER APPROVALS ARE NECESSARY.

 AT&T Corp., which for weeks has been running TV ads depicting a futuristic era 
of go-anywhere communications, moved a step closer to that goal Friday as the 
Justice Department cleared the way for the company's $12.6-billion acquisition 
of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest long-distance telephone company and its biggest cellular 
telephone carrier signed a pact with the department that would permit the 
combination, subject to two key conditions: McCaw must provide competing 
long-distance carriers with equal access to its cellular network, and AT&T must 
adopt safeguards that ensure its cellular equipment customers -- who often 
compete head-to-head with McCaw -- will not be disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal has already been approved by nine state utility commissions, but it 
faces review by the Federal Communications Commission and U.S. District Judge 
Harold H. Greene, who oversees a 1984 consent decree governing the breakup of 
the old AT&T telephone monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we take a major step toward bringing the benefits of competition to 
millions of consumers of cellular telephone service, one of the fastest-growing 
segments of the telecommunications industry," Anne K. Bingaman, assistant 
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equal access will help lower cellular telephone bills, just as it has helped 
lower long-distance rates for regular telephone service," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials have been encouraging alliances and industry 
consolidation, which they believe will help investment in the communications 
infrastructure. But they have been worried that Bingaman, who brought several 
high-profile class-action lawsuits against big companies as a lawyer in private 
practice, might be hostile to big business in her role as government antitrust 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that the Justice Department found no anti-competitive behavior 
(and that) this deal will create benefits for consumers, we support them," said 
Larry Irving, assistant secretary for communications and information at the 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This deal is indicative of a larger trend whereby carriers will be offering a 
growing number of advanced services by forging mergers and other alliances," 
said Blake Bath, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Bath added that he thinks the AT&T deal, as well as MCI Communications' 
recently approved alliance with British Telecom, will revive phone company 
interest in cable television acquisitions and other deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the next decade will herald two to five major telecommunications 
alliances per month," Bath said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for at least the next decade, AT&T and McCaw will have to find synergy 
without the aid of some business arrangements normally adopted for efficiency's 
sake, according to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw must maintain separate financial books, boards of officers and marketing 
and development functions to guard against any anti-competitive conduct. And it 
cannot transfer title to its cellular licenses to AT&T or use the name AT&T in 
its corporate name or in its marketing campaigns until 60% of the McCaw 
Cellular systems comply with the equal-access provisions of the settlement 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that those provisions are met, the agreement requires that each 
McCaw Cellular system offer its customers equal access to any long-distance 
carrier within the next 21 months. And AT&T and McCaw can't give discounts to 
McCaw customers as inducement to choose AT&T as their long-distance carrier.  
</P>
<P>
 The public has 60 days to comment on the settlement.

BIG JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS RAISES EYEBROWS; COMMERCE: UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH 15% GAIN 
IN JUNE BEGS QUESTION: WHY ARE EXPORTS STILL RISING DESPITE STRONG YEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong exports to the United States and Asia helped boost Japan's global trade 
surplus to $11.35 billion in June -- an unexpectedly high 15% increase that 
raises questions as to why the rise in the yen is not slowing Japanese exports. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Finance Ministry statistics released Friday, the surplus with the 
United States rose by an even higher 43%, to $4.73 billion from $3.30 billion a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the export growth and the continued climb of the Japanese 
currency cast doubts about when the politically sensitive surplus will begin to 
decline. The doubts could spark further yen appreciation and more political 
pressure from the United States on Japan to do more to open its markets to 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could rebound on the yen, which would in turn worsen the J-curve effect 
(of yen appreciation) and spark a vicious circle," Nikko Research Center 
economist Tetsuro Sawano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long term, a high yen should make Japanese products more expensive 
overseas, cutting into sales, while imports into Japan become more competitive. 
Until June, Japan's surplus measured in yen had been declining for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a stronger yen also tends to initially inflate the dollar value of Japan's 
surplus, before pushing it down as a result of increased imports and dwindled 
exports. This so-called "J-curve" effect occurs as the value of yen-based 
exports gets inflated in dollar terms when calculated with a lower dollar 
exchange rate. The change in value eventually causes exports to fall and 
imports to rise, thereby rounding the curve of the J. 
</P>
<P>
 What worries analysts is that the June rise in the surplus was not just the 
effect of the J-curve, but had even more to do with strong economic growth in 
the United States and Asia and lingering recession in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big surplus with the United States," said Tohru Itami, chief 
currency trader at Yasuda Trust & Banking. "That's no good for the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's report came as the dollar continues to weaken against the yen.  
</P>

 Analysts had expected that "there was going to be some jump back up in Japan's 
surplus, but not that much," said Ron Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch 
Japan. "Only part of this jump can be explained by the J-curve effect. It looks 
to me that whereas everyone had hoped that last month was the first true sign 
that the trade surplus was going to come down, in essence it was actually a 
blip." 
</P>
<P>
 A Foreign Ministry official attributed the June rise to the steadily 
recovering U.S. economy, which particularly boosted Japan's exports of 
microchips and auto parts. Exports of seafaring ships, especially to China, 
also grew significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts insist that a trend toward a declining Japanese surplus is under 
way despite the June turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political focus on the dollar value of Japan's trade surplus is 
completely misleading," said Geoffrey Barker, an analyst at Baring Securities 
Ltd.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dollar stability would quickly translate into a rapid decline in the surplus 
-- a fact which will become clearer as the year progresses," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomoko Fujii, an economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., said her firm is 
still predicting a downward trend for Japan's surplus as economic recovery 
picks up here. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujii also said the June trade figures will not necessarily mean an even 
stronger yen. "The currency markets did not react much to the trade figures, 
because their main concern is U.S. monetary policy at this time," she said.

BUS LINE REACHES FOR THE SKY; GREYHOUND REVAMPING SERVICE IN A BID FOR 
SHORT-HAUL FLIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Greyhound Lines wants more than ever for you to leave the driving to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The only nationwide bus service this week launched an effort to lure more 
people out of their cars and away from airports and train stations by lowering 
ticket prices and adding departures on short-haul routes in Southern California 
and other markets. The strategy aims particularly to gain passengers from rival 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines and Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take significant improvements in customer service to induce many 
more travelers to go Greyhound, analysts and passengers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The service would have to be much improved" to get him to travel Greyhound 
more often, South Gate truck driver Theatis Sutton said Friday, after waiting 
in line at the Greyhound terminal in downtown Los Angeles for 45 minutes even 
though he had a prepaid ticket. He said he usually flies and was taking the bus 
only because his employer required it. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound said its changes were prompted largely by its losing customers on 
trips of 500 to 750 miles -- such as Los Angeles to Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan announced Thursday, Greyhound will abandon some of those less 
profitable longer routes and focus instead on serving cities within 400 miles 
of each other, said Elizabeth Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company. 
Besides Southern California, Greyhound is also concentrating on the Northeast, 
South, Midwest and parts of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100- to 400-mile trip market, where one-way fares are typically between 
$20 and $40 and rides last between two and eight hours, includes routes such as 
Los Angeles to San Diego, San Francisco or Phoenix, Greyhound President Frank 
Schmeider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those short-haul fares are attractive compared to those for flying or driving, 
said Sarita Skidmore, a principal in the Menlo Consulting Group, which 
specializes in travel and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Ana, San Bernardino, Riverside, Barstow, 
Calexico and Indio are among the cities likely to benefit from lower fares, 
better and more frequent service or both, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound has tested the concept in key short-haul markets around the country. 
After it reduced one-way fares from Los Angeles to San Francisco to $29 from 
$36, ticket sales ballooned 61% and revenue on that route rose 21%, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound will also cut costs by shedding 100 to 200 of its 1,800 buses, 
eliminating free baggage service and closing terminals during late-night hours, 
Schmeider said. An unspecified number of jobs will be cut "at all levels," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound has lost money in three of its last five quarters, and Schmeider 
said Thursday that the company will post an operating loss of at least $27 
million for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound hopes to lure more middle-income travelers who would otherwise drive 
or take low-fare flights. The average annual income of a Greyhound passenger is 
$16,444. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed, Greyhound "will have to do something to provide really good 
service, the way (Amtrak's) Metroliner has changed the image of the train," 
consultant Skidmore said. "If Greyhound's service is good, they can compete." 
Planes, Trains and Buses 
</P>
<P>
 Under attack mainly from low-cost airlines, Greyhound plans to restructure its 
bus service in California and other markets. Here's how bus fares compare to 
train and airline fares from Los Angeles. 07,17,07,06,07,08,08,09 *2*Greyhound 
*2*Amtrak *2*Southwest Los Angeles to: O-W R-T O-W R-T O-W R-T San Diego $12 
$24 $24 $32 $49-69 $98-138 Santa Barbara 11.50 21 20 26 49-69 98-138 San 
Francisco 29 58 67 68-134 49-69 98-138 Phoenix 32 61 58-85 58-170 44-62 88-124 
All fares are unrestricted. Lower fares quoted by Amtrak and Southwest Airlines 
are for advance-purchase tickets. O-W = one-way; R-T = round-trip.

BONDS FIZZLE, STOCKS MIXED AS DOLLAR FALLS

<P>
 Stocks closed mixed Friday as Thursday's bond rally ran out of steam and as 
the dollar sank again. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks were hampered by computer problems within the Nasdaq trading 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrials were up 14.56 points to 3,753.81, but 
blue chips were buffeted by the expiration of some key stock options contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market indexes closed slightly higher or with minor losses. The NYSE 
composite index inched up 0.50 point to 251.06. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's breadth was still positive: Winners topped losers by 12 to 9 on 
the NYSE and by 14 to 12 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer problems caused the Nasdaq market to delay opening until just before 
noon Eastern time, causing difficulties for traders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq problems added to the normal volatility associated with options 
expirations. Both made it difficult for traders to discern whether the market's 
Thursday rally -- which saw the Dow rise 34 points -- was a fluke or the start 
of a significant rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the rally's over, but (Friday's action) makes you question 
whether it's going to be broad-based," said Ralph Acampora, analyst at 
Prudential Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks weren't helped by bonds: Thursday's big rally in the bond market 
fizzled Friday afternoon, and yields closed unchanged or slightly higher -- 
despite new evidence that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the 30-year Treasury bond yield was at 7.54%, up from 7.53% on 
Thursday. Still, the yield was down sharply from 7.69% a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar gave up some of Thursday's rebound. It closed 
at 97.85 Japanese yen in New York, down from 98.60 on Thursday. It also slipped 
to 1.553 German marks from 1.555. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials finished up 44.67 points for the week. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller stocks, which eased 0.20 point to 721.36 on 
Friday, closed up 13.9 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thursday's rally on Wall Street helped spark renewed buying overseas. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX index surged 37.99 points to 2,093.61, while London's 
FTSE-100 index added 24.4 points to 3,074.80 -- which left that index up 112.4 
points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index added 52.11 points to 20,770.15 on Friday, and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng index shot up 308.74 points to 9,117.02 as foreign money 
poured back in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Bovespa index jumped 1.6% for the day, to 40,799. 
The index has leaped 13.9% since July 1. Mexico City's Bolsa index, however, 
slipped 1.55 points to 2,281.23. 
</P>
<P>
 * In U.S. trading, semiconductor stocks slumped, led by Texas Instruments, 
which sank 6 1/8 to 80 1/4 after reporting strong second quarter earnings but 
at the same time warning that it expects its growth rate to slow in the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Another computer chip maker, Altera, also predicted slower growth. Its shares 
dove 6 1/2 to 25 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other chip stocks, Intel lost 2 to 59 1/2, Motorola fell 1 3/8 to 48 7/8 
and Micron Technology sank 1 7/8 to 36 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a bit of good news in the tech sector, Three-Five Systems, which makes 
liquid crystal display systems, rocketed 6 1/4 to 37 5/8 on its earnings 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial stocks continued to rebound despite a growing conviction 
that the economy is slowing. Alcoa rose 1 to 80 3/8, Deere added 1 to 71 1/2, 
Clark Equipment gained 1 1/8 to 65 1/2, DuPont was up 1 1/4 to 60 1/8 and 
Weyerhaueser jumped 1 3/8 to 42 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, cocoa prices jumped to four-year highs and coffee 
resumed its climb as commodity funds rushed in to take advantage of raging bull 
markets in those products. 
</P>
<P>
 September cocoa soared $124 to $1,522 per metric ton, the market's highest 
level since May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocoa has been riding the shirttails of the booming coffee market, though some 
of he same weather problems afflicting coffee growers have affected cocoa as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, lumber prices surged on renewed rumors of troubles in labor talks 
between Canadian timber workers and mill owners. 
</P>
<P>
 September lumber futures gained the $10 daily limit to $373 per 1,000 board 
feet.

REGULATORS CLOSE BANK OF SAN PEDRO; FINANCE: INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL CITED. HOME 
BANK OF SIGNAL HILL TO ACQUIRE ASSETS. 
</P>

<P>
 State banking regulators Friday closed Bank of San Pedro, which had six 
branches and $123.4 million in assets, after real estate loans and operating 
losses had reduced the financial institution's capital below acceptable levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank of Signal Hill will acquire $22.1 million of the failed bank's 
assets and assume $82.2 million in insured deposits. The two Bank of San Pedro 
branches in San Pedro will reopen as Home Bank offices. The bank's headquarters 
office and branches in Avalon, Gardena and Long Beach were closed by state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank will decide whether to hire back Bank of San Pedro employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bank of San Pedro was operating in an unsafe manner, which necessitated the 
closure as a protection to depositors and creditors," James E. Gilleran, the 
state's banking superintendent, said in a statement.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased that an acquisition was successfully negotiated, because it 
provides assurance to most depositors of Bank of San Pedro that their banking 
business will continue without interruption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $6.4 million in 210 Bank of San Pedro accounts exceeded the federal 
insurance limit of $100,000 and will not be assumed by Home Bank. Gilleran 
placed the bank under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of San Pedro had been considered a "problem bank" since 1987, regulators 
said. The bank has sustained more than $4 million in operating losses since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators determined that the bank was not viable after real estate and 
commercial loan losses had reduced its capital to $1.2 million. In addition, 
they said, the financial institution had been losing $200,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials had tried to raise capital in negotiations with private parties 
and also tried to sell additional stock, the regulators said. However, those 
efforts failed to draw sufficient investment to bring the bank to acceptable 
capital levels.

 Some FSG Financial Charges Settled: Two operators of defunct FSG Financial 
Services Inc. in Beverly Hills settled Securities and Exchange Commission civil 
charges that they sold $29 million in worthless municipal bonds through FSG and 
related companies to nearly 500 California investors.Without admitting or 
denying liability, John A. Genetti and Westley Scher agreed not to violate 
securities laws in the future. They were also ordered to disgorge $25 million 
allegedly made from the scam, but payment was waived because both are nearly 
broke. Similar charges against their associate, Louis F. Vargas, are pending. 
All three are serving prison sentences stemming from earlier criminal 
prosecutions in the case.

PORT OF L.A. DESIGNATED A FOREIGN TRADE ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite opposition from its rival in Long Beach, the Port of Los Angeles was 
awarded foreign trade zone status Friday in a move that local officials hope 
will boost the region's economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation by the federal government permits manufacturers, warehouses 
and other businesses located within the foreign trade zone to defer or avoid 
customs duties on imports and exports.That can lower operating costs and may 
encourage existing companies to expand or help attract new business to the 
area, said Karen Tozer, the foreign trade zone marketing manager at the Port of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new zone, one of more than 400 nationwide, includes nearly the entire Port 
of Los Angeles as well as sites at Los Angeles International Airport and a 
proposed trade and transportation center in Bakersfield. In addition, the port 
can expand its foreign trade zone to specific company sites anywhere in the 
greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Local companies can gain the same benefits from the Port of Long Beach's zone. 
However, "Long Beach has not promoted the foreign trade zone as actively as 
they could have," Tozer said. "That's why we wanted our own zone. We wanted to 
promote it and control its destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighboring Port of Long Beach opposed the creation of a rival zone 
because of the impact on its projects, said Gerry Haugan, the port's leasing 
manager. Long Beach's trade zone is scattered throughout the region and 
includes warehouse and manufacturing sites in Long Beach, Ontario and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make certain the success of the existing zone and (that) the 
money we have put into it would not have been put at jeopardy," Haugan said.

BOEING, MCDONNELL SHARE SUPERSONIC JET FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA awarded Boeing and McDonnell Douglas a $440-million contract Friday, part 
of a $1.5-billion program to develop technology for a jetliner that would 
travel at 2.4 times the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, Boeing will be the prime contractor and McDonnell the 
principal subcontractor, though the two will get about equal funds and 
responsibilities, said Louis J. Williams, the program's manager at the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the research program is intended to produce enough data to allow 
U.S. industry to begin industrial development of the supersonic jet by 2001, 
which would put the aircraft into service by the middle of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest aeronautics program NASA has ever had," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although industry and NASA officials estimate that the market for supersonic 
jetliners may eventually reach $200 billion and support about 140,000 jobs in 
the United States, the current research program is modest. McDonnell will have 
fewer than 100 engineers assigned to the effort, company spokesman Don Hanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing would conduct its work in Seattle and McDonnell at its unit in Long 
Beach. Lockheed, Rockwell International and Northrop also have small roles as 
subcontractors in the program, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 For jet-lagged international travelers, the plane promises to cut transoceanic 
flights in half. A flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo, for example, would take a 
little over four hours, compared to the current 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet would carry 300 passengers -- three times as many as the European-made 
Concorde -- fly twice as far, consume less fuel and emit just a fraction of the 
pollutants that could damage the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 But to achieve those tough objectives, the program is investing heavily in 
developing new materials, aerodynamic structures, jet engine controls and new 
cockpit electronic systems. Among the tasks will be finding materials for the 
airplane skin that can withstand the 350-degree heat generated by air friction 
at sustained supersonic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort, known as the high-speed civil transport program, would be the 
first joint effort for the two rival aircraft builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Building the jet would require a massive investment, estimated by some 
industry experts at $15 billion -- far more than either Boeing or McDonnell 
alone could afford. But supporters of the jet say passenger fares would not 
rise much because the plane could fly nearly as efficiently as airliners 
currently in use and could make two trips for every one made by subsonic jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said NASA intends for the plane to have as much U.S. content as 
possible.

 Terms of Jenny Craig Settlement Signed: Weight-loss center operator Jenny 
Craig Inc. has agreed to pay $10 million in cash and give away merchandise 
worth $36 million at retail to settle a 4-year-old lawsuit alleging misleading 
advertising and improper business practices.Although Jenny Craig is 
headquartered in Del Mar, Calif., the class-action suit, filed on behalf of 
360,000 of its weight-loss clients, was filed in Orange County Superior Court 
in Santa Ana in 1990. It claims the company's diets caused gall bladder 
disease. The settlement covers people who used Jenny Craig centers between 1987 
and 1990. In agreeing to the terms, the company did not admit wrongdoing.

GARTH BROOKS AT BOWL: IT SOUNDED GOOD ON PAPER; POP MUSIC REVIEW: IN THE END, 
THE NIGHT'S EXPERIMENTS PROVED THAT IT'S THE SONG, NOT THE PRESENTATION, THAT 
MATTERS IN COUNTRY MUSIC.

 "It's going to be a different night," Garth Brooks said good-naturedly at the 
start of his concert Thursday at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when things are going to fly . . . and times when things will 
pretty much suck." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there wasn't a whole lot of flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the capacity audience appeared to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Garthmania at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more cowboy hats than at a Texas rodeo and the endless shrieking of 
admiring fans rivaled the annual "1812 Overture" cannon blasts on the Bowl 
decibel meter. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this was the country megastar's only U.S. concert of 1994 -- a 
World Cup Week benefit that raised an estimated $1 million for One Voice, a 
Southland group that helps low-income families with physical, employment and 
educational needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the lure of the evening: Brooks, whose only tours this year are in 
Europe and Australia, is a performer with a strong sense of occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised lots of surprises and they seemed enticing on paper: the first 
chance to see Brooks in an acoustic setting . . . with an orchestra . . . 
singing around a campfire with some Nashville songwriting buddies . . . and 
doing a series of songs by his musical heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of them all, the acoustic setting loomed as the most noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has gained a lot of attention for his high-energy concert antics, 
including smashing guitars and swinging Tarzan-style across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But his real appeal grew out of coming up early in his recording career with 
uncommonly good songs. The best of them -- including "The Dance," "Unanswered 
Prayers" and "If Tomorrow Never Comes" -- reflected on relationships and dreams 
with an intimacy and conviction that forged a strong emotional bond with his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 By performing these songs alone with an acoustic guitar, Brooks could give us 
the music at its most intimate. Yet he was joined in the acoustic segment 
Thursday by his seven-piece band, with drumming as vigorous as any rock show. 
The result was not that different from his regular performances -- except for 
his own, more subdued manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The section with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra was no more involving. In fact, 
the pairing seemed comical in those moments when the musicians raced to keep up 
with some of his honky-tonk rev-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing the stage with songwriting buddies around an actual, blazing campfire 
was an interesting attempt at pop innocence, but the sequence proved 
self-conscious. You just can't create the same mood in front of almost 18,000 
people that you can back home on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, the salute to musical heroes turned out to be a shovelful of pop 
nostalgia, including Elton John and Bernie Taupin's "Candle in the Wind," James 
Taylor's "Sweet Baby James" and Don McLean's "American Pie." Brooks' renditions 
of the songs were so respectful that he brought no new sense of character or 
shading to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any lesson from the night of experiments, it was a reminder that 
the presentation isn't what matters in country music. The important thing is 
the song -- and that has been Brooks' weakness artistically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many of the ones he performed Thursday and on recent albums have been 
laborious and conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' most appealing songs would still sound good if he was joined on a 
stage by a polka band. His challenge is to find more good songs, not ways to 
present them. That's when he'll fly again. FOOTNOTE: There is no photograph 
accompanying this review because Brooks would not allow press photographers for 
the performance, though fans were able to bring in cameras. A spokeswoman for 
the singer said it was because he was too nervous about the special features of 
the show.

ALL DRESSED UP, WITH NO PLACE TO GO; THE RAPID AND SURE DISAPPEARANCE OF ETHNIC 
GARB IS THE MOTIVATION FOR WORLD TRAVELER GLORIA LEBARON, WHOSE PHOTOS ARE ON 
VIEW AT UCI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gloria LeBaron couldn't agree more with those sentimental TV and print ads for 
camera film that urge one and all to "capture those special moments forever." 
</P>
<P>
 As a world traveler who has watched people around the globe exchange their 
unique traditional garments for standard-issue Western denims and T-shirts, 
LeBaron has spent the past two decades photographing all manner of native garb 
before it vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is going to go -- you have to catch it at this moment," said 
LeBaron, whose exhibition of 50 black-and-white photographs, "Vestiges of 
Ethnic Dress," is on view at the UC Irvine Student Center's Center Hall Gallery 
through Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next century -- in a few years -- many of these women will have 
already abandoned these traditions and become homogenous," LeBaron said. 
"Tribes are being annihilated even as we speak. In some cases, it's one tribe 
pitted against another; in others it's by Westernization. Westernization comes 
in many forms, but they all do away with ethnic identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, for example, the Arts & Entertainment cable channel aired 
footage of cannibals in Irian Jaya, on the island of New Guinea. The tribesmen, 
whose first contact with Westerners came in the 1980s, were shown rowing their 
canoes -- and wearing T-shirts and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is everybody wearing Levi's? Maybe it's not all bad, but if the costumes 
are going, maybe we're also losing culinary techniques, the music and many 
other parts of these cultures," LeBaron said. "The reason I got started was 
seeing the Levi's all over Paris. I thought: 'Is the whole world going to be 
wearing Levi's?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, she decided, was yes, so in 1974 she began to take photographs. 
Her background is not in photography; she's a watercolorist with a master's 
degree in art history from Cal State Los Angeles. She uses a Yashica camera 
that she bought for $100. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron has taught history, art and English as a second language at schools 
around the world, has lived in half a dozen countries and visited 35 others. 
She now lives in Leisure World near Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The photos are grouped geographically: Highlights from Africa include a woman 
carrying logs in a remote area of Transkei in Southern Africa and a Masai 
mother and child near a mud-and-dung hut in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always asked how I got some of these shots," she said. "I got them 
because I'm old -- 72 -- and because I'm a woman. I'm no threat to anybody. My 
husband always stood back. He couldn't have gotten these shots, but the women 
always welcomed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebaron said that she's only been in danger when she neglected her own safety, 
lingering perhaps a tad too long while a herd of camels came thundering toward 
her. But there have been difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iran, she said, "(I) spent many an hour in the bazaar at Shiraz trying to 
photograph the women without them noticing me. The Qashqai are nomads. I'd wait 
hours knowing certain groups were coming, or I'd go out in the desert and wait 
by the road for a caravan. Then I had to get the proper light."  
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron mentioned the hot pinks, acid greens and vibrant blues of the Qashqai 
women's clothes, and the fabrics shot through with metallic threads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sparkle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, why shoot in black and white? 
</P>
<P>
 "Color fades," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall captions LeBaron wrote for the UCI exhibition are unabashedly 
subjective. One refers to the "drab" garb of Iranian women emerging from 
worship at a mosque, which raised the ire of some Muslim students at UCI. 
Rather than change her text, university administrators put up a disclaimer 
explaining that the opinions expressed are LeBaron's. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years of photographing women have honed LeBaron's concepts of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd find women with body scarification carrying logs . . . yet it hadn't 
taken from the real beauty and nobility of the woman. No tummy tucks, no 
implants, no face lifts -- only unpretentiousness. . . . They adorn themselves 
in all manner of dress, but it's their unpretentiousness that makes them 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother-and-child portraits figure significantly in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where women are not high on the monied scale, they're usually tending 
children," LeBaron said. "But not only tending children. Qashqai women set up 
the tent, cook the food, weave the rugs; other women trek all day with a kid on 
their shoulders, or sell at a little stall. If a man had to do what he (does) 
with a kid strapped on his back all the time. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to her own culture, LeBaron says she by no means believes that 
motherhood precludes work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I juggled it," she said. "I had a good occupation, and it can be done with a 
helpful husband. All of these women I'm taking pictures of, they're working. 
They're lugging crops, carrying logs, picking fruit, you name it. Women who 
stay home and don't do anything -- that's a Western idea. There's no reason 
women can't have children and careers." 
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron has two children and three grandchildren. Her daughter married a 
Norwegian, and she's now visiting them in their home outside Oslo. While there, 
she hopes to get pictures of the indigenous people of Lapland, the Sames. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be wonderful to finish my little job by the turn of the century," 
she said. "But I'll go until I drop dead." 
</P>

INDEPENDENT SPIRIT LIVES ON IN 'MAJAS'; THE SHOW AT THE OTIS ART GALLERY 
WOBBLES A BIT IN ACCOMPLISHMENT, BUT THE WORKS ARE REFRESHING IN THEIR REFUSAL 
TO FOLLOW OLD WAYS OF CONSIDERING MODERN MEXICAN ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By planting the visage of the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera smack in the 
middle of the forehead of a ceramic likeness of cartoon vamp Betty Boop, 
Consuelo Castaneda's 1993 color photograph "Betty/Kahlo" manages a hilarious, 
double-edged send-up of a famous self-portrait by Rivera's wife, painter Frida 
Kahlo. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahlo's current status as a larger-than-life cultural icon within the pantheon 
of modern Mexican artists is given a wry, feminist reading by Castaneda: A 
caricature of a perpetually imperiled but indefatigable damsel is imprinted 
with the face of a powerful male artist. Like Frida, Betty has Diego on her 
mind. But his likeness is strong and sturdy while hers is a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Betty Boop cartoon is American in origin further complicates 
the picture. Frida's cult was manufactured in the United States, in the wake of 
American feminism. Her liberation from the shadow of her husband has been 
important, but the ensuing cultishness has also fixed her image into something 
of a prison for younger Mexican female artists. Oppressiveness lingers, in a 
different form. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda's pungent photograph is one of 19 works in "Las Nuevas Majas," a 
show currently on view at the Otis Art Gallery. Its complex consideration of 
both Mexican and American traditions of modern and contemporary culture is 
instructive, as is its knowledge of the always slippery nature of stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the overall level of artistic accomplishment in the show is somewhat 
wobbly, it is nonetheless significant for its refusal to knuckle under to 
habitual ways of considering contemporary Mexican art. It's refreshing in its 
independent-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose Lorena Wolffer's one, big, unstretched, blood-soaked canvas could 
loosely be called a painting, but the show is otherwise limited to sculpture, 
photography, video and mixed-media work by 11 artists based in Mexico City. 
Because few of them have shown before in Los Angeles, and because each is 
represented by just one or two works, it's not possible to get a developed 
handle on any one of them. Still, "Las Nuevas Majas" is among the more cleverly 
effective exhibitions of contemporary art to have been mounted of late. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest curator Maria Guerra deftly busts up a variety of complacent 
expectations. One is simply her focus on artists who are women. For when it 
comes to sexism, the Mexican art world is certainly no more progressively 
enlightened than its counterparts in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these artists are concerned with specifically feminist issues, 
approaches or traditions. In addition to Castaneda, Ana Casas Broda uses 
photographs to record generational bonds and shifts among women, presumably 
within families, while Wolffer's cluster of dresses for little girls, each one 
soaked in blood, evokes the trauma of ritual passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia Gruner's three-panel folding screen, "The Expulsion From Paradise," 
creates a gridded modesty screen (the kind you might undress behind), carefully 
embroidered with a biblical narrative of the fall from grace at the inquisitive 
hands of Eve. Gabriela Lopez Portillo has crocheted a fragile dress from her 
own hair -- fetishistic clothing beautiful in its fragility, but finally 
nonfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, are not specifically feminist. Sofia Taboas' 20-foot-long 
garland made from artificial lemons and capsules of vitamin E strung together 
with cord is a funny talisman of modern medicinal faith. Nearby, Yolanda 
Gutierrez has laid out on the floor a ritual "garden" of ash and bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most compelling pieces is Melanie Smith's "Orange Lush," an 
8-foot-tall panel standing out from the wall and covered at random with a 
scavenged array of unrelated, mostly plastic flotsam: earrings, toy duck-bills, 
balloons, safety vests, inexplicable baubles and other stuff. The only thing 
that unites the diversity is the accident of their common color. Everything is 
bright orange. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, this works pretty well as a metaphor for the exhibition 
itself. These 11 artists are all women, but it would be a mistake to attempt to 
glean some particular, artistic sameness among them, simply because of that 
arbitrary distinction. No "woman's aesthetic" is being curatorially proposed, 
nor does one inadvertently emerge. The show is smartly designed to undermine 
such restrictive or programmatic characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar spirit, and perhaps even more pointedly, neither does "Las Nuevas 
Majas" offer any sort of nationalistic vision for a contemporary Mexican art. 
For much of the 19th and 20th Centuries the idea of developing a uniquely 
national aesthetic was important to many of the most prominent Mexican artists. 
Perhaps because of the identification of this nationalism with patriarchal 
culture, Guerra seems intent on letting that heroic stance slide happily into 
the mists of history. 
</P>
<P>
 This anti-nationalistic (or, at least, un-nationalistic) point of view is also 
reflected in the choice of specific artists. Four of the 11, who range in age 
from 23 to 36, were born in Cuba, Spain or England, the rest were born in 
Mexico. The visual language in which their art speaks is emphatically 
international. 
</P>
<P>
 Their art is inevitably informed by the social circumstances of the locale in 
which they currently live, and the artists don't necessarily avoid the great, 
variegated traditions of Mexican culture in their work. But Mexico City, a 
cosmopolis of staggering proportions, has long been internationalist in 
bearing. Like every modern city, it is a city of immigrants; the show reflects 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 As exhibitions go, "Las Nuevas Majas" is a smallish undertaking -- there is no 
catalogue -- while most of the work seems proficient, if only occasionally 
exceptional. It began life in 1992 as a show prepared for a once-lively, now 
rather moribund nonprofit space off Mexico City's Alameda Park; the new 
version, assembled specifically for Otis, is considerably stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's especially notable for another reason altogether: "Las Nuevas 
Majas" is an example of contemporary artistic exchange between Los Angeles and 
Mexico City. By this time one might expect that particular international 
dialogue to be a perfectly common, well-developed state of affairs. In fact, it 
almost never happens.

SANTA MONICA'S EXQUISITE DECEPTIONS; 'ALTERED EGOS' AND 'RETURN OF THE "CADAVRE 
EXQUIS" ' PRESENT WORKS WITH THEIR HEARTS IN SURREALIST-ERA PARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The essence of two spirited new exhibitions at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, 
"Altered Egos" and "The Return of the 'Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse),' " is 
pretty well encapsulated in an installation by L.A.-based artist Charles La 
Belle. Working under the pseudonym of Charles Bon, he calls the piece "Seven 
Paris Monuments -- Santa Monica Correspondent." 
</P>
<P>
 La Belle's project, which is part of "Altered Egos," signals exhibitions where 
appearances are decidedly deceptive. Both shows have their hearts in 
Surrealist-era Paris of the 1920s, when the favorite form of cultural sabotage 
was derailing the train of rational thought. 
</P>
<P>
 La Belle's piece consists in part of computer-generated photographs. They show 
such famous Parisian landmarks as the Arch of Triumph and the Eiffel Tower 
weirdly materialized on beaches, malls and boardwalks in Santa Monica. We 
recognize these assertions of colossal ego more readily than our own laid-back 
landscape, although they are equally artificial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altered Egos" involves nine artists, solo or in teams. All pretend to be 
other people. They play roles ranging from lesbian serial murderer to ambitious 
unknown artist. Hunter Reynolds, for example, has himself photographed 
portraying a woman named Patina DuPrey. Theresa Pendlebury uses numerous alter 
egos to create paintings based on literary descriptions of visual art. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Santa Monica Museum and beautifully framed by curator Karen 
Moss, the exhibition's ruling spirit is that of Marcel Duchamp in drag as his 
feminine mirror image Rrose Selavy. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-known Russian emigre team of Komar and Melamid fares beautifully in 
their visual biography of Nikolai Buchumov, a fictional, academic, Social 
Realist painter of the Revolutionary period. 
</P>
<P>
 Invented by the pair in 1973, Buchumov lost an eye and retired to his native 
province to paint the same landscape over and over for the rest of his life. A 
prominent promontory appears in the left corner of each of the small multiple 
canvases on view. Actually, it's the artist's nose. You see a lot of your nose 
when you only have one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Tucker presents a mini-exhibition complete with an audio guide. The 
installation documents the life of Richard Sharpe Shaver, an invented visionary 
who believed the center of the Earth is inhabited by sadistic mutants called 
"Dero." Their machinations cause all the trouble on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver came to prominence in the 1940s when he was discovered by Ray Palmer, 
editor of the pulp sci-fi magazine Amazing Stories. Palmer translated Shaver's 
theories into a series of yarns for the magazine. Tucker's re-creation is so 
deft that you leave thinking, "Maybe there are evil mutants down there; why 
not?" The piece is a charmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one artist on view masks his real identity completely. Annabel Livermore 
is actually a male sculptor from Texas. The rest all fess up to being 
Pendlebury, Kevin Sullivan, Jan Tumlir, Millie Wilson and Vernon Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 At bottom, they all make the same point. The persona we present to the world 
is but a carapace. Behind it, stored in the subconscious are aspects of 
ourselves that remain troubling monsters unless we come to terms with them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Parisian surrealists a favorite parlor game was "The Cadavre Exquis." A 
piece of paper was folded horizontally, once for each player. In turn everybody 
put a phrase or a fraction of a drawing in his space without looking at the 
rest. The point was to use randomness to create art. One felicitous coincidence 
produced the spontaneous poem, "The 
exquisite-corpse-shall-drink-the-young-wine." That's how the game got its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the museum hosts "The Return of the 'Cadavre Exquis,' " a traveling show 
of nearly 100 collaborative drawings organized by the Drawing Center, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of participants includes the likes of John Baldessari, Ellsworth 
Kelly, William Wegman, Mark Tansey and Roy Lichtenstein as well as a gaggle of 
emerging people. At three or four authors per sheet, it's a large cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is a pleasant curiosity. Evidence suggests that a lot of 
fudging goes on in the game. Many sheets are just too integrated to leave the 
idea of total randomness believable. It also proves that the odds on creating a 
masterpiece this way are about as long as those on a typewriting chimp pecking 
out a great novel. What we get mainly is a series of visual non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective confirms the universal suspicion that humans are preoccupied 
with sex. The exhibition frontispiece should probably be an image in which the 
head of Surrealist guru Andre Breton hovers above a large vagina that extrudes 
snakes with male heads and has the legs of an easel. This chimera was cobbled 
together by Steve Wolfe, Ashley Bickerton and Jan Hashey. 
</P>
<P>
 Slight shortcomings notwithstanding, the pair of shows would not be out of 
place at the Museum of Contemporary Art or the L.A. County Museum. Both come 
with good catalogues and make the little museum look smart and urbane. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AFTER A FEW SONGS, HIS SET GETS TANGLED UP IN BELEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A freight train plummeting through outer space? No, that's just the sound of 
Adrian Belew saying hello with his guitar at the Coach House on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has since Frank Zappa plucked him out of a Holiday Inn lounge band in 
the 1970s -- since gracing music by Talking Heads, King Crimson, Nine Inch 
Nails and oodles of others, not to mention his own prolific, if lonely, solo 
career -- Belew on Thursday took his guitar to sonic realms few others bother 
to essay. 
</P>
<P>
 Even back when he was equipped with the same effects most other guitarists 
were using, Belew had been able to draw a jaw-dropping range of tones from his 
guitar, including trumpeting elephants, sci-fi shrieks, and thickly layered 
Jovian atmospheres of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years he's also been making an incredibly nimble use of the 
Roland guitar synthesizer, and there's now seemingly no limit to the voices 
available to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an inventive player, avoiding the standard-riff boxes most guitarists 
fall into. Rather, his phrasing often seems to emulate animal speech, and his 
melodies don't want for exoticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even though Belew was backed by an trio of excellent players, his music 
became a bit wearying over the course of the 18-song set. That can be blamed, 
in part, on the fact that his was the last set of a four-act bill, which makes 
for a long weeknight. But there were other more central problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that Belew writes a good song from time to time, but as often as 
not he comes up with ones that just don't connect emotionally or melodically: 
If a listener can't feel a song, it would nice to at least be able to hum it.  
</P>
<P>
 The remaining problem is that for all the incredible range of tones Belew 
employs, those sounds are limited in depth. Whether employing the synthesizer 
or not, nearly everything he played was heavily processed through loads of 
electronic gear. There was naught to be seen of this gear onstage except two 
speakers and a pedal-board, but that board was linked to an offstage rack 
packed with gizmos. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessing romantic names like GZ700-3AB-ZZZOX, these gadgets represent 
rack-mount manna for techno-minded, progressive-rock tweak-heads, who would 
probably queue up for a three-hour film titled "Adrian's Rig." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even in the hands of Belew, who gets some of the most human applications 
out of all this gear of anyone extant, the equipment forces a trade-off: It may 
offer him an infinitely greater variety of sounds, but, at least at the present 
state of the art, those processed sounds lack the expressiveness of even the 
cheapest unaffected guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, his multi-timbral performance was a bit like being on a tour that 
whisked you through every country on the globe but never stopped to let you 
partake of the cultures in any depth. 
</P>
<P>
 A potential solution to the first problem -- the songs -- was close at hand 
Thursday. Backing Belew onstage, and preceding him with a set of their own, 
were his old band mates and writing partners from the Bears, his delightful 
group of the late '80s. They now perform under the name Psychodots. Guitarist 
Rob Fetters, bassist Bob Nyswonger and drummer Chris Arduser are all monster 
players, well able to keep pace with Belew's adventurous musical romps. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Belew should collaborate with them offstage again, as Nyswonger and 
Fetters also are fine writers, who clearly brought out the best in Belew in 
their Bears days. Their two albums on the defunct Primitive Man label were full 
of delightful songs that clearly used the invention and melodicism of the 
Beatles' "Revolver" album as a standard to which to aspire. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of Bears-era songs Belew used in Thursday's show, including 
"Superboy" and "Rabbit Manor," were among the high points, particularly the 
irresistible "Trust" that closed the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the material ranged from the romantic "Heartbeat" and other 
numbers from Belew's stint with King Crimson in the early '80s to selections 
from his current solo album, "Here." (Belew, incidentally, promised the 
audience that a re-formed Crimson would have a new album out by next spring, 
with a tour to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
 For several years he's been writing and recording solo, and like others doing 
the one-man-band route, the result has sometimes seemed sterile. Some of the 
songs gained an added life when performed live by a band. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular standout from the new album was "Burned by the Fire We Make," a 
passionate and catchy ecology song. 
</P>
<P>
 The Psychodots preceded him with a brief set, "The shortest we've played since 
we were in high school together," said Fetters. Though brief, it was rich in 
melody and harmony and was musically playful. Fetters even inflated a balloon 
while soloing and then used it to fret his strings with, to a surprisingly 
musical effect. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Coach House folks, it was a fluke that the show had three 
opening acts. Whatever the reason -- and even with other mini-disasters like a 
restroom flood -- the club did an exemplary job of keeping things moving, 
turning a potential debit into a bonus.  
</P>
<P>
 Huddled on one corner of the stage, the L.A. sextet Wild Colonials offered a 
fully acoustic version of their typically semi-acoustic set. With Scottish-born 
singer Angela McCluskey drawing from the same Sandy Denny-derived Celtic 
influence as Natalie Merchant, it's not entirely inaccurate to dub the band 
10,001 Maniacs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the set included only five songs, it showcased both the band's 
strengths and its weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The former includes McCluskey's rich voice and an adventurous musical spirit 
that incorporates cello, violin, talking drum and Australian didgeridoo without 
seeming gimmicky. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's shortcomings derive largely from a lack of self-editing. Songs that 
might have worked at three minutes started seeming light on lyrical depth and 
musical drama when stretched out long past that length with repeated verses and 
choruses. Still, this is a band with a healthy dollop of potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of opening act the Heads of State, which has improved greatly 
since a Coach House debut a year ago, and that show had been pretty good to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego/O.C.-roaming band has gone through a name change -- it was 
called Rod & the Pistons -- and local music fans might recall bassist John 
Frias' fine previous band the Wild Cards. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his sibling singer-guitarists Rod and Darryl Frias, along with drummer 
Dan Gonzales, play a muscular yet melodic brand of blues rock, bolstered by 
Rod's passionate vocals and guitar work that is fiery, if still slightly 
cluttered. The group appears tonight at Cafe Calypso in San Clemente.

DANCE REVIEW; DANCE THEATRE OF EAST L.A. AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Guevara continued to emerge as an independent Latino choreographer in 
the four new works introduced by his Dance Theatre of East L.A. on Thursday as 
part of the "Ecce Lesbo/Ecce Homo" festival at Highways Performance Space in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing equaled the new "Hombres" in terms of achieving meaning and expression 
through pure movement. Against drumming and chanting by Kodo, Guevara and the 
strikingly handsome Bogar Martinez squared off in machismo contests, suggesting 
the polarized, pent-up physicality and top-dog games among incarcerated males. 
</P>
<P>
 The two progressed from isolated, follow-the-leader rituals to tentative 
explorations and even mutual support. But the work ended inconclusively, 
prematurely, with a repeat of Martinez slung over Guevara's shoulder. How they 
had arrived at this point, what this point actually was and what it implied 
remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mojado," with a witty text by Luis Alfaro (music by Hector Armienta), showed 
Guevara stretched out on a bed of chain-link fencing, which became his blanket, 
cross to bear and immigration barrier, as a concrete block he pushed around 
became the reality of hard labor and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The young choreographer powerfully communicated grief and pain and pride in 
"Cuerpo Marcado," but the full implications of these and other emotions 
probably only could be appreciated by the Spanish speaker who understood the 
songs sung by Isabel Pantoja, Ana Gabriel and Flor Silvestre. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mama" (music by John Kander), the choreographer tried to solve the problem 
of structure by repeating the opening section, deepened by a new text. Martinez 
was a penitent youth in prayer to the Virgin (the Ave Maria and a text by 
Alfaro). Midway through, however, he had to interpret a catchy 
Broadway-show-like song between a mother and a gay son and also a fearful yet 
slick dance of temptation with the alluring Melissa Arambasich. The shifts in 
tone between sections were disconcerting and unclear in purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding the program were Guevara's solo "Cursum Perficio" and a reworking 
of his "Celosa" danced strongly by Arambasich. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Guevara's Dance Theatre of East L.A. will perform at 8:30 p.m. today 
and Sunday at Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. $10.

TV REVIEW; 'STEVEN BANKS SHOW': NO ACCOUNTING FOR PBS' TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the Inner Child within us has been found, released and sanctified in 
the public discourse and across the TV talk-show spectrum, will Steven Banks be 
its icon? What else could explain PBS' decision to unveil its "first scripted 
original comedy" that features a thirtysomething character stuck in 
pre-adolescence? 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Steven Banks Show," Banks, a sandy-haired figure as slender as a pipe 
cleaner, acts like a kid who's been kept late at school and left alone to play 
with his toys and indulge his moony obsessions.Even his apartment looks like an 
elementary-school playroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He plays with tiny figurines of the Beatles. He mimics rock stars who peaked 
30 years ago. The eerie clowns Sid and Ernie drift through his dreams. When his 
landlady shows up to ask for the rent, you realize she's asking the wrong 
person; she should be putting the arm on Banks' mom. This is a character who 
needs adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Banks' infantile cuteness is on the level, and it's an irritant 
that no amount of laughter on the soundtrack can assuage. Nor is there charm in 
the show's amateur-level writing and direction. This show is so empty it makes 
"Seinfeld" look like Voltaire and his salonistes.  
</P>
<P>
 How did the producers manage to sucker the Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
into funding this turkey? Maybe it's because Brandon Tartikoff is an executive 
producer (along with Susan Dietz, who produced the stage version of this show 
at the Pasadena Playhouse). When he was entertainment president at NBC-TV, 
Tartikoff once bragged of producing "little books with big print." With "The 
Steven Banks Show," he's done it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Steven Banks Show" premieres at 10 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV Channel 28. 
It also airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on KPBS-TV Channel 15.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MEEK SHOW FROM THE AUTEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Auteurs place themselves in the main channel of great English pop-rock 
song -- Townshend and Davies to Bowie to Morrissey, among others. But after two 
albums, it's still too early to tell whether they'll sink or swim. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based band's leader, Luke Haines, writes cryptic commentaries whose 
fragmented images suggest manipulations, intrigues and obsession. An air of 
faint decadence pervades biting character sketches that are played out against 
shifting backdrops of the English class system and American fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 All this could use a more dramatic, restless, aggressive delivery than it got 
at the Whisky, where the Auteurs headlined Thursday. Haines kept his wit and 
bite confined to the lyrics, typifying the quintet's friendly but meek stage 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 His singing is expressive and effective but somewhat narrow -- a sort of 
enlarged, raspy whisper that sometimes touches a Van Morrison nerve. A cello 
stabbed counterpoint against churning, chopping guitars, but it all came off as 
dogged and colorless where the songs want to be soaring and sparkling. RICHARD

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TROUBADOUR PRESENTS A MIXED BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thursday night's bill at the Troubadour offered a pair of contrasting 
approaches to the art of the heavy groove. Chicago's Stabbing Westward relied 
on a mix of pounding percussion and keyboard-generated techno-rhythms to power 
its material, while Palm Desert's Kyuss produced a more fluid, bottom-heavy, 
guitar-driven onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 With psychedelic lava lights bubbling away behind them, the four members of 
Kyuss launched into a crowd-pleasing run of monstrous bass lines and opiated 
guitar licks. Several songs opened up into heady jam sessions, with guitarist 
Josh Homme and bassist Scott Reeder playing craftily enough to avoid 
self-indulgence. John Garcia's full-throated vocals gave the roiling sound a 
point of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's ability to drift into chaos and then snap back into sync created 
some very compelling musical moments. In a trio of encore tunes, the band was 
at its best, leaping suddenly from gentle lilts to thundering sonic mudslides. 
Kyuss' heavy grooves are a weighty pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabbing Westward showed more promise than mastery during its set. The 
quintet's music combines the earnest bombast of the Cult with some of the noisy 
textures of Nine Inch Nails, but at times the band seemed unable to present the 
music sharply enough to be effective. But when the players locked together on 
the looser groove of a song like "ACF," the results were powerful and 
impressive. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

FLESH GERM PATIENT GAINS; MEDICINE: THE ATHLETE, TREATED FOR TISSUE-EATING 
BACTERIA, MAY BE RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL IN A WEEK. VENTURA COUNTY WOMAN HAS A 
SIMILAR INFECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Bernard Donner, the whole thing began with an innocent-looking pimple on 
his thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed, however, was a bout with a deadly tissue-eating bacteria that 
spread up to his waist and down to his ankle, almost killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday at the Sherman Oaks Hospital and Burn Center where 
Donner has been hospitalized, the 35-year-old Santa Barbara triathlete said 
that even as the disease began dissolving much of the flesh of his left leg, he 
had no idea what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never bigger than a quarter," he said, describing what the wound 
looked like from the outside in its early stages. "There was never any 
outrageous growth or flesh deterioration. It was a little bump. It never 
occurred to me that within 24 hours, I could have been dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Grossman, Donner's physician, told the news conference that about 
85% of the skin grafts Donner has been given have taken hold, and there will be 
at least one more skin graft surgery early next week. Donner could be released 
by next weekend, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Donner continued to recover, however, a similar infection struck a 
Ventura County woman on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Polido, 63, entered Santa Paula Memorial Hospital Sunday complaining 
of a fever, nausea and a pimple on her left thigh, family members said. By 
Friday, the pimple had grown into an open sore stretching from her groin to her 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was identified as Group B streptococcus, a relative of the Group A 
streptococcus that infected Donner. They are fast-acting, potentially deadly 
strains of a common germ that ordinarily causes little worse than a sore 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Polido was taken Friday to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks 
and placed in a pressurized oxygen chamber -- as Donner was earlier in Sherman 
Oaks -- because oxygen combats the bacteria. She was in critical condition 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing here (with the oxygen chamber) is not only treating the 
patient, but we are preserving the tissue, so that she won't have to undergo 
amputation," said Dr. J.B. Wilmeth, the internal medicine specialist 
supervising her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Donner's case -- blamed on germs that entered his body through a 
shaving cut -- attracted widespread news media attention, public health 
officials say it is extremely difficult to get the infection, and urge the 
public not to worry about catching it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to be paranoid about it," said Ventura County Public Health 
Officer Gary Feldman. "Germs are ubiquitous. Every surface on the planet is 
covered with microorganisms." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say that most Group A streptococcus infections cause nothing more 
serious than strep throat, which afflicts many thousands of people, especially 
school children, each year. But for the past five years, scientists have noted 
the reappearance of the dangerous Group A strain, which was commoner in the 
early part of the century but almost disappeared in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection that Donner and Polido suffered is called "necrotizing 
fasciitis," because it kills -- necrotizes -- the fascia, the tissue that binds 
skin to muscle. It received widespread press attention when at least seven 
people became infected with it in Gloucestershire, England, this spring. 
Eventually, 12 deaths were blamed on the disease throughout Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
estimates that in 1990, the last year in which it has figures, there were 
10,000 to 15,000 severe cases of Group A strep, resulting in 2,000 to 3,000 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 500 to 1,500 included necrotizing fasciitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical authorities say that 30% to 50% of stricken patients die, in part 
because the disease moves so swiftly that symptoms can be difficult to detect 
in time to get the antibiotic and oxygen treatment needed to halt it before it 
reaches a vital organ. 
</P>
<P>
 For Donner, who became ill July 3, it was only after his mother -- a nurse -- 
guessed there might be a connection between her son's lethargy and the small 
lesion on his leg that Donner was taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so lethargic, so weak," his mother, Marianne Donner, said at the news 
conference, which was also attended by Bernard Donner's wife and father. "I 
knew it must have been something more than flu, that it must have been some 
deep-seated infection. I could tell it was something more than you could see on 
the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 First at a hospital in Santa Barbara, then at the Sherman Oaks hospital, 
doctors cut away dead tissue from his leg in an area that eventually grew to a 
cavity roughly 24 inches long, six inches wide and four inches deep, Grossman 
said. The cavity begins near Donner's groin area, wraps around his knee, and 
ends at his ankle, said Grossman, who is medical director of the hospital's 
burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Donner, who was propped up on a gurney with a blanket wrapped 
around his legs, said the infection first appeared as a pimple that resembled 
an ingrown hair. He said besides a touch of nausea, the infection then caused 
little pain. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed he acquired the infection during a bicycle ride, when the 
bacteria entered his body through a cut caused by shaving his legs, a common 
practice for competitive cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner, a self-described fitness fanatic, vowed to resume exercising as soon 
as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is, 'I've been two weeks off my bike . . . how out of shape am I?' 
" he said. "I can lift my leg, and if I can lift my leg, you can rest assured 
that I will be back out in the water, and out on the bike very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said Donner might be capable of a light jog in two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital gave Donner a $500 check to help defray medical expenses not 
covered by insurance. The family has set up a trust fund in Donner's name at 
Santa Barbara Bank & Trust.

TRAINS TO BE ADDED IN STRIKE; TRANSPORTATION: METROLINK ROUTES WOULD INCREASE, 
KEY VALLEY BUS SERVICE WOULD BE LIMITED IF DRIVERS WALK OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If Los Angeles bus drivers strike on Monday, the Metrolink commuter rail 
system will add six trains to its Ventura County line across the San Fernando 
Valley, including three that would run in the reverse of the normal commuting 
direction for the first time, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority also announced that seven of the 
Valley's busiest bus lines would have limited service if drivers walk out, 
which they have threatened to do as early as 12:01 a.m. Monday if contract 
talks fail. About 75 buses would serve the Valley, the majority of them school 
buses to be leased by the MTA, spokeswoman Andrea Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike service on those lines would be half as frequent as is currently 
offered. Buses would run weekdays only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials would boost the number of Chatsworth-to-Downtown Los 
Angeles morning trains from six to eight if a strike materializes. One 
additional afternoon train from Union Station to Chatsworth would be available, 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra trains would stop at stations in the Valley only and not in Ventura 
County, which would not be affected by an MTA bus drivers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Metrolink would also run trains opposite the main flow of 
traffic along its Ventura County line. Two of its periwinkle-and-white trains 
are planned to shuttle passengers from Union Station to Chatsworth in the 
morning, and Valley riders can hop onto an inbound train in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this in anticipation of more ridership. All this is in preparation for 
a strike," Hidalgo said, adding that the MTA is funding the extra trains. 
Metrolink officials estimate that the cost would be about $1,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Service on the Santa Clarita line, which already boasts 23 trains a day, 
including three reverse-commute rides, would remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said many inbound Santa Clarita riders who work in the west San 
Fernando Valley ordinarily alight at the Sylmar-San Fernando stop and take 
express buses to their offices. If a strike cripples those bus routes, he said, 
morning passengers can take the Santa Clarita line to the Burbank station, then 
transfer to one of the new Chatsworth-bound trains on the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's contingency plan for skeletal bus service includes routes throughout 
the Valley, mostly along major thoroughfares such as Van Nuys Boulevard and 
Sherman Way. The seven lines have a combined ridership of 90,000 a day, Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares would not be collected for at least a week on the privately run yellow 
school buses until fare boxes can be installed, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Valley has 38 bus lines, with a total of 167,000 boardings 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus drivers union set the Monday strike deadline two weeks ago, 
threatening job action if no agreement is reached or progress made during talks 
for a new contract. Drivers, mechanics and clerks -- about 6,500 MTA employees 
in all -- have been without a contract since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would be the Los Angeles transit system's first in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, the chairman of the MTA board of 
directors, said Friday that the labor negotiations have produced "some give and 
take. (But) it's not enough. We have a long way to go." Valley Emergency Bus 
Routes The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has planned emergency service 
on seven of the San Fernando Valley's busiest bus routes in the event of a 
threatened strike by bus drivers,w hich could come as early as 12:01 a.m. 
Monday. The Metrolink Commuter rail will also increase the number of trains on 
its Ventura County line to accommodate more riders. Scheduling Information For

 When the Northridge earthquake struck six months ago, it was not the wrecked 
apartment that 9-year-old Alex Magana regretted leaving the most. It was the 
garden his family tended in the front yard of his old Van Nuys apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planted orange trees, lemon trees, carrots and apples," Alex said 
Friday. "They all died."

 While his family has relocated to a house since the temblor, it is only 
recently that the boy could eagerly grab a water pail and tend to plants again 
-- this time as part of an event marking the six-month anniversary of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The gardening project in which Alex participated began in April and is 
designed to help students deal with the stress of living on shaky soil. It is 
staffed by VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) volunteers and funded in 
part by $2.8 million authorized by President Clinton through the Corp. for 
National Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it may shake you up, I've always wanted to show that there are a lot of 
good things the ground can do too," said Chris White, one of the volunteers who 
organized Friday's garden project at Bassett Elementary School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, White, 29, and fellow VISTA volunteer Tim Ittner have been 
working with the students since April to create the garden -- a sanctuary of 
seedlings and stalks on an asphalt schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 To help, Alex and fellow fourth- and fifth-graders have built garden beds and 
a compost bin made from earthquake rubble, including concrete blocks and wooden 
planks. The handful of students volunteer in the garden about an hour or more 
during school three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's activities included fun kid stuff -- planting chilies, tomatoes and 
purple-hued flowers in a box labeled "annuals" -- then dumping in 2,000 squishy 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
 To 10-year-old Blenda Lee, whose family fled to Acapulco for a few days after 
the Jan. 17 temblor, it is easier to appreciate the earth with a handful of 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to put them in the soil . . . and it's going to be good 
fertilizer," said Blenda, who lives in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 For Alex, whose family has not bought the seeds to replant the trees and 
vegetables at his new house, it was like going home again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like plants and watering," said the boy, his eyes sparkling as he doused 
water on a black-eyed Susan. "It's fun." JEFF SCHNAUFER

<P>
 Beneath the glow of paper lanterns, men and women of the Japanese-American 
community, garbed in traditional kimonos and hapi coats, dance to traditional 
folk music to observe Obon, a Buddhist holiday that honors the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, lanterns are used to lure the spirits of the ancestors back for 
a few days for elaborate festivities, involving folk dances, music, offerings 
of fruits and vegetables and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Obon observance begins Sunday at the San Fernando Valley Hongwanji 
Buddhist Temple at 9450 Remick Ave. in Pacoima, with a ceremony performed by 
the Rev. Kakuyei Tada. But the festival, known as the Bon Odori, or Festival of 
Lanterns, will be celebrated at the temple July 30 and 31.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights will be a book-signing and reading of "Thanksgiving at 
Obaachan's" by Japanese-American author Janet Mitsui Brown. A display of bonsai 
trees, flower arrangements and dolls also will be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will take place 5 to 11 p.m. July 30 and 5 to 10 p.m. July 31.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; DROP-IN POLICE CENTER TO OPEN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drop-in police center will open at the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Dixie 
Canyon Avenue at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard C. Goldman, the Neighborhood Watch member who has led efforts to 
establish the center, said the facility will not have all the trappings of an 
official Los Angeles Police Department substation, but will be similar. 
</P>
<P>
 The center -- one office in the King Realty offices at 13369 Ventura Blvd. -- 
can be used by police officers to eat meals, interview suspects and witnesses 
and coordinate local crime fighting programs, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 If police can be encouraged to spend more time in Sherman Oaks, Goldman 
believes, public safety will improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a perception that we don't have a crime problem, and I'd like to 
dispel that myth," said Goldman, a retired probation officer. "This area has 
been hit pretty hard in terms of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The community activist said that armed robbers have held up store owners near 
the planned drop-in center, and that his own mother had her purse snatched in 
broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Neighborhood Watch group also will carry out its programs from the 
center, whose furnishings at the moment include a desk, a chair and a phone. 
King Realty has donated the office space, and the community security group will 
pay for the phone from proceeds of a fund-raiser it held in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said he'd like to provide police officers with a fax, computer, file 
cabinets, television and mini-refrigerator, if he can find someone willing to 
donate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a substation, the drop-in center will not have a holding facility for 
suspects, be staffed regularly by LAPD officers or be funded by the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is hopeful, however, that one day the drop-in center will be upgraded 
to a substation. He said that happened in Northridge several years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the center's opening, the local Neighborhood Watch will throw a 
party from noon to 3 p.m. on Saturday, July 30. The public is invited to the 
free reception, which will feature picnic food, a professional bird act and a 
country-Western band.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said the center lets the police know that the community cares about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By offering this type of thing we're showing them the respect that they 
deserve," he said. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; GUIDE DOG TRAINERS TO GET DONATED VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They may help the blind get around, but a group in Sylmar which trains guide 
dogs has found they need some help getting around themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Guide Dogs of America, which raises and trains Labrador 
retrievers, golden retrievers, and German shepherds, will be given a new GMC 
Van, donated by the National Charity League.The donation will be presented as 
part of the graduation ceremonies for six blind students who have just 
completed 28 days of training with their new guide dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guide Dogs of America breeds and trains the dogs on its 7 1/2 acres of 
property on Glenoaks Boulevard in Sylmar, but often takes the dogs around Los 
Angeles to train them to deal with all kinds of streets and traffic, said 
Debbie Sands, a spokeswoman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that driving can take a toll on the group's four vans, which all have 
more than 120,000 miles on them and need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a direct mail plea go out because we needed to replace our fleet of 
vans," Sands said. The National Charity League responded by sending the group a 
check to buy a new van. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guide Dogs of America was founded in 1948, and provides the dogs at no 
charge to qualified people who are visually impaired. Average training for a 
dog is about five months. ED BOND

<P>
 For those who like to do their holiday shopping early, there is the upcoming 
"Christmas in July" gift fair sponsored by the Independent Living Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five local crafts people will tout their wares -- from handmade dolls 
to lamps -- at the center July 30 and 31 to raise funds for a pre-employment 
program for people with severe disabilities, according to community education 
coordinator Sherman Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-employment program provides training in office, homemaking and 
horticultural skills for people with physical, developmental and sensory 
disabilities, as well as for survivors of traumatic brain injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the program's participants joined with the Urban Greening Program of 
the U.S. Forestry Service to plant greenery in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl said he hopes the crafts fair will raise about $5,000 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas in July will take place at 14151 Haynes St., Van Nuys. It will begin 
at 10 a.m. both days. For more information, call (818) 785-6934. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; CITY OFFERS LESSONS IN LAWN COMPOSTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wonder what to do with those garbage bags of grass cuttings, leaves and 
brush clippings? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of chucking them, the folks at the recycling and waste reduction 
division of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation would like to teach you how to 
compost your yard trimmings so they can be used to fertilize your lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. at the Orcutt Ranch Horticultural Center in West 
Hills, the sanitation bureau and the Department of Recreation and Parks is 
sponsoring one in a series of free back yard composting workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a mandate from the city of Los Angeles to reduce the amount of 
material that goes into the landfills by 50% by the year 2000," said David 
Mays, a division spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the sanitation department will pick up one 60-gallon container of 
yard trimmings per household each year. That also is made into compost. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people produce more than that and composting is a more convenient 
and less expensive way of disposing of them," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will offer instructions for composting, discounted bins and free 
samples of compost that the city creates with the trimmings it collects.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 2 OCEAN FISHING TRIPS PLANNED FOR YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ELMENDORF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 40 Burbank youths between the ages of 10 and 17 will head to the 
ocean Monday to see if they can catch a fish or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The expedition, sponsored by the Parks and Recreation Department, is the only 
one of its kind in the country, said parks board member Terre Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch helped found the program four years ago. Since then, the department has 
conducted two fishing trips to the ocean each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trips is open to anyone. "People always ask me if the program is 
just for underprivileged kids," said Hirsch, "and I always tell them that 
anyone who has never been deep-sea fishing is underprivileged, no matter what 
their economic position." 
</P>
<P>
 The other trip is geared toward gang members and youths who are trying to make 
a transition out of gang life. This year one, of the 10 chaperons is a former 
gang member who has been on the trip before.  
</P>
<P>
 Other volunteer chaperons include a judge, three police officers, a barber and 
an aerobics instructor. "They just do it because they want to help the kids," 
said Hirsch. "They don't get anything out of it except a soda pop and a hot 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip costs $5,, although the fee is waived if a child's family cannot 
afford it. The reason for the fee, said Hirsch, "is to give the parents some 
incentive to get their kids down there at 6 in the morning."  
</P>
<P>
 The first year there was no fee and 10 kids did not show up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes are given to the children for various things, such as one for the youth 
who throws the most fish back. But, according to Hirsch, "most kids are so 
thrilled to be out there, if they catch a fish, they want to keep it."  
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch said this time of year there is expected to be especially good fishing, 
and he went so far as to guarantee that the young anglers would catch 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trip is planned for August. JAMES ELMENDORF

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; PAROLEES OFFER SAFETY TIPS TO NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since he was released from prison for burglarizing homes, 
Ron Dene spent Wednesday breaking into a one-room apartment in North Hollywood, 
lifting the sliding glass door and slipping inside in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it was different. The home was his own. And a few hours later, 
the ex-convict used the experience to educate a group of North Hills neighbors 
in how to avoid break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow, what I'll be doing is to get a little latch with a lock on it for 
the door and attach one to the ceiling and one to the ground," said Dene, who 
had locked himself out of his apartment at a halfway house for parolees. "It 
will make it harder to lift the door and open it." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime-fighting tip was one of dozens offered by Dene and a handful of 
other parolees who addressed about 25 homeowners at the Sepulveda Unitarian 
Universalist Church in North Hills. Dene and his fellow parolees live at the 
Ryan Center in North Hollywood, where clients offer crime prevention 
demonstrations as part of their rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past four years, Dene has been in and out of prison for 
burglarizing homes and stealing cars to support his drug habit. The 
presentation offered the 27 year old a chance to redeem himself, if only for a 
few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on his experience, he suggested the best defenses against home 
burglary are a large dog with access to both front and back yards, motion 
sensor lights and even a gun -- if you know how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent car theft, Dene suggested parking in a locked garage at night and 
using a movement blocking device that fits around the steering wheel, not the 
one that goes from the brake to the wheel. The best defense is the Lojack 
stolen car tracking device, which can help police find a vehicle within 20 
minutes of it being reported stolen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most cars are stripped down within 24 hours of being stolen," said Dene, who 
now works at a motion picture studio. 
</P>
<P>
 During a question-and-answer session on carjacking, Officer Les Lovatt from 
the Devonshire police station said it is not illegal to drive home and report a 
"fender-bender" if it occurs in a suspicious neighborhood or under suspicious 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 And one parolee said the key to preventing crime is providing a nurturing home 
that does not allow children to become criminals in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced out of his Whittier home by his parents at age 13, Joe Adams said he 
turned to gangs to find a new family. He spent 11 years in the gangs because 
"they were there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all gang members are bad people," said the 23-year-old. "They are just 
looking for attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams also vouched for the effectiveness of Neighborhood Watch efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I got in trouble," said Adams, who served three years in prison 
for burglary. "A neighbor saw me taking a bike out of a garage and they called 
the police. The police identified me by my tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
 The event also gave homeowners a chance to see ex-convicts in a different 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my guys sit in the audience before we start," said Claudia Ryan, the 
center's director. "It helps make them aware that the person sitting right next 
to you may be the person to look out for, but it also helps people realize that 
these are people who may have just made one mistake and are trying to give back 
to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 That message was not lost on 75-year-old Betty Vasin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to give a big hand to the courageous people who came to do 
this," said Vasin, a semi-retired book dealer from Van Nuys. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; ORDER TO RESTRAIN ROCK STAR DENIED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court commissioner Friday denied a Burbank woman's request for a 
restraining order against rock singer David Lee Roth, stating "The court finds 
there are no grounds" for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Ruth Davidsohn, 34, of Burbank, filed a lawsuit earlier this year 
asking that Roth be blocked from telephoning her and from releasing songs, such 
as "Yankee Rose," which she contended contains lyrics about her. 
</P>
<P>
 She claimed to have had a seven-year relationship with the rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was the second time Davidsohn has been denied a restraining order 
against the former lead singer of the band Van Halen. She tried to obtain one 
in 1989, soon after Roth successfully got a three-year restraining order 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court files, the rocker said he was being harassed by an 
obsessive fan he has never met and had been charged for thousands of dollars in 
merchandise she ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the singer said he's on tour and was unreachable for comment.

 Nine-year-old Robert Perez and his dad, Carlos Ramon, were one of the luckiest 
father-son teams in the San Fernando Valley on Friday -- Robert was awarded a 
pair of tickets to the World Cup final between Brazil and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrvet Corp. of Des Moines, Iowa, donated the tickets to Catholic 
Charities located in Canoga Park, an organization that provides emergency 
assistance and works with the elderly, refugees, immigrants and at-risk 
youths.Catholic Charities, in turn, presented the tickets -- worth $180 each -- 
to Robert, a Van Nuys soccer fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities of Los Angeles is awarding three pairs of World Cup tickets 
to youngsters who otherwise would not be able to afford to go, said Greg 
Stuart, the agency's youth services director. Ticket recipients are asked to 
take a member of their family to the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called me and said, 'You're going to the World Cup final,' " Robert 
said, but he didn't believe he had actually won at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he was convinced he had won, Robert's mother, Marian Ramon, said her son 
was ecstatic. "He was jumping up and down." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited," Robert said. "Brazil is my favorite team." MAKI BECKER

 "You know when there are bullets flying, one will most likely hit you rather 
than miss you," said Artour Ovtchian, who will be 22 on Wednesday and now walks 
with a cane. "I am going back out of necessity. It is much more than 
patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian, who was partially paralyzed by a rifle shot to the head, faces many 
more weeks of intensive physical therapy but is resolved to return to combat in 
his war-torn land -- even though doctors say he has suffered permanent 
coordination impairment and may never be able to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against the medical field," Ovtchian said through an interpreter at 
his farewell party in a hospital garden. "But my recovery depends on me. . . . 
They don't know me well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, hospital staff and representatives from the large Armenian American 
community who adopted him celebrated his release with cake and ice cream as 
they sang "Happy Birthday" and gave him two tickets to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attention showered on Ovtchian still makes him uneasy, as evidenced by 
the uncomfortable smile on his face throughout the celebration. "I can't get 
used to it," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Ovtchian was hit in the head by a single Azerbaijani rifle bullet, 
which caused a permanent damage to his coordination and strength on the left 
side of his body, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a big desire to go back and be a freedom fighter," said his physician, 
Dr. Aaron Selzer, who added that Ovtchian has a hole in his skull larger than a 
golf ball. "But obviously, going back to fight is not healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time fighting a bloody civil war almost killed Ovtchian. 
Two years ago, he was wounded in the jaw and shrapnel punctured his lungs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen many other soldiers in the same situation as me," Ovtchian said. 
"But I believe the brain has the capability to recover itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian, a soldier since the age of 16, took part in the latest conflict in a 
century of wars fought by the Armenians. The battles have claimed 15,000 lives 
since the mostly Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, formerly part of the 
Soviet Union, asserted its independence from Azerbaijan six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was brought to the Glendale hospital by the Armenian National Committee and 
the Armenian Culture Foundation. The groups paid for his trip to Southern 
California and the hospital is footing the $40,000 bill for Ovtchian's 
four-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian is being put up at a local hotel by the Armenian Culture Foundation, 
and will continue treatment as an outpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides two Armenian American nurses, only members of the Armenian community 
have been able to speak to Ovtchian about the troubles in his homeland in his 
native tongue. A few letters of encouragement from his family lifted his 
spirits, Selzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he yearns for the day he can return to his country, when his "fighting 
friends" will pick him up from the airport and a series of welcome-home parties 
will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to the conflict being over and if I can't continue, I hope 
others continue what we have started," Ovtchian said.

PERMIT EXTENSION STILL CONSIDERED FOR LANDFILL; LOPEZ CANYON: NEIGHBORS SAY THE 
CITY PROMISED TO CLOSE DUMP IN '96. BOARD SAYS IT WILL GET BIDS ON ALTERNATIVE 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sanitation officials will continue studying a proposal to extend the life of 
the Lopez Canyon Landfill near Lake View Terrace, a Los Angeles city panel 
decided Friday, despite criticism from neighbors that the city is breaking a 
promise to close the dump in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, however, the Los Angeles Board of Public Works also 
promised to get estimates from trash disposal firms on alternatives to keeping 
the dump open, such as hauling trash by rail to a remote landfill in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 But a request for bids was not sent out Friday -- as was expected -- due to 
last-minute changes in the request documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once trash firms return the bids for alternative waste disposal plans, 
probably in late September, the fate of the controversial dump will be 
considered by the board, the city's Planning Commission and, ultimately, the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill opponents, including Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose northeast 
Valley district includes the landfill, said the city should study all viable 
alternatives before taking action to delay the dump's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon added that residents of the northeast Valley were promised in a 1991 
operating permit for the dump that no further extensions would be sought after 
1996 -- a promise, he said, he expects the board to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "What have the people of the northeast Valley done to you to get stabbed in 
the back?" a visibly angry Alarcon asked the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said through a spokesman that he was 
equally upset about the proposal to delay the closing date of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I have said in the past, the board and the bureau (of sanitation) must 
seriously examine alternative landfill proposals before pursuing any permits to 
keep Lopez Canyon open," he said in a statement read to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy over the Lopez Canyon Landfill was sparked in March 
when sanitation officials recommended extending the life of the landfill until 
2000, based on a study that says keeping the dump open would save the city $72 
million over the cost of hauling trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon questioned the accuracy of the study. The cost of hauling trash by 
rail to Utah, he argued, was overestimated by about 25%. He noted that a waste 
disposal company that offered to haul away trash after the Northridge 
earthquake submitted bids far lower than the estimates in the city's study. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are being blindsided here," he told the panel. "It is false and you 
cannot base your decisions on these falsities." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Fortune, an engineer for the sanitation bureau, said his department will 
re-examine the cost figures in that study but, he added, "we feel they are 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez Canyon is the last city-owned dump and takes in 80% of the city's trash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the board meeting, a small group of landfill opponents held a rally 
on the steps of City Hall to protest any delay in the closure of the dump. They 
hung placards around their necks and strung a sign up on City Hall that read: 
"Dump the Dump." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to close this landfill," said Roger Klemm, a six-year resident of 
Lake View Terrace. "They promised us that they would close the landfill in 1996 
and what they are doing is going back on their word." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, board President Charles Dickerson III announced earlier in the 
board meeting that Lopez Canyon Landfill had won the "1994 Systems Excellence 
Award" from the Solid Waste Assn. of America for excellence in landfill 
operations.

DRIVER RESCUED AFTER CAR FALLS INTO CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman lost control of her car on Entrada Drive near Topanga Canyon Boulevard 
early Friday morning and plunged 300 feet down a canyon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was trapped in the auto on a canyon slope for two hours as 20 
members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and County Fire 
Department, including an urban search and rescue team, extricated her with 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
 She was airlifted to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where she was listed 
in stable condition with a back injury, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in pain but conscious," said Jim Goodwin, one of the first county 
firefighters at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors of her car were stuck and all the windows were smashed in, he said. 
"We brought her out through the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers were called about 6 a.m. when residents of the area were alerted to 
the crash because the woman's car alarm went off several times, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it is a common occurrence for drivers to lose control and go 
over the canyon," Goodwin said.

2 ROBBERY SUSPECTS ARRESTED AFTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men who allegedly robbed a Westwood jewelry store Friday were arrested 
after ditching their getaway van, carjacking a Mercedes-Benz and leading police 
on a chase to Glendale, where they crashed the stolen car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In custody late Friday were Dean Paulino and Dennis Plunkett, both 
18-year-olds from South Los Angeles, police said. Both were booked on suspicion 
of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the robbery or the subsequent crash on the northbound 
Golden State Freeway near Olive Avenue, Los Angeles Police Lt. Frank Spangler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began shortly before noon, when two gunmen burst into Beatrice 
Jewelers in the 14OO block of Westwood Boulevard, held the owner at gunpoint 
and handcuffed him, then began smashing display cases full of watches. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stole a lot of watches, everything from Rolexes to Timexes," Spangler 
said. In all, the thieves stole $40,000 in merchandise, but all of it was 
recovered, he said. The shop owner's wife and young daughter also were in the 
store during the robbery, but were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were alerted by a passerby who heard the sound of smashing glass and 
saw the commotion. The robbers fled in a gray Ford van. They abandoned the van 
near the corner of Purdue Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard and began looking 
for another getaway vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first car they tried to steal, they encountered a lady, grabbed her, 
shook her and threatened her, but they couldn't get her (car) started," 
Spangler said. "They bailed out, ran to another young woman getting into a 
Mercedes, grabbed her by the hair, threatened to kill her, took the car and 
left the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, police did not know which car to chase, because 911 calls identified 
all three vehicles in which the suspects were seen, Spangler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers then saw the men heading east on the Santa Monica Freeway at 
La Cienega Boulevard, "and the chase was on," Spangler said. After passing 
through Downtown, the suspects sideswiped a car and spun into an embankment, 
nearly destroying the stolen Mercedes, Spangler said.

PLAZA TRIES TO STEM FLOW OF CRUISERS; CRIME: MANAGER OF THE LA RINDA SHOPPING 
CENTER IN SYLMAR AGREES TO UPGRADE SECURITY AND WORK WITH POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to stem the flow into Sylmar of teen-age cruisers who bring with 
them drugs, guns, alcohol and crime, the manager of the La Rinda Plaza shopping 
center agreed Friday to upgrade security and work with police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the community and police support, it will happen all over again," 
warned Stephen S. Chan, managing director for Sun West Property Management, 
which manages the center. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Friday before a city zoning administrator, police, residents, 
business people and Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon said that each 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday night the plaza attracts numerous teen-age cruisers 
to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They blamed the plaza, on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in San Fernando, for the 
cruising, saying Chan turns a deaf ear to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "By their lack of action, they are contributing to the problem," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan countered that he has been limited in what he could do without enough 
police backup. Even the armed security guards who were hired in January cannot 
confront the hundreds of cruisers alone, he said. The guards are afraid to work 
past 11 p.m. after the center's stores have closed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruising has been a problem in this residential neighborhood for about four or 
five years, said Lenor Ramirez, who lives in nearby Mission Hills. But it has 
gotten worse in the past two years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With cars blocking streets and driveways and teen-agers fighting and 
littering, residents have felt like prisoners in their own homes, Ramirez and 
her neighbors said. Several said they have moved their sleeping quarters to the 
rear of their homes to avoid stray bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't have friends visit me on Sunday nights, because I'm afraid for their 
safety," said Ramirez's sister, Hilda. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilda Ramirez said that a few months ago, cruisers frightened her by banging 
beer bottles on her car as she was trying to pull into her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the complaint I have gotten the most from the community," said LAPD 
Foothill Division police Capt. Bob Gale. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that for the past three weeks, using overtime funds, he has brought 
extra officers into the neighborhood. Last weekend, he said, officers issued 
hundreds of tickets and impounded about 80 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza parking lot holds the key to solving the cruising problem, Gale 
said. The lot draws cruisers, from as far away as Venice, Simi Valley, Whittier 
and even Bakersfield, because hundreds of cars can meet on the lot and scatter 
through any number of exits when the police show up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Chan agreed to close all but two of the lot exits with chain or 
removable posts after business hours. That will mean police will easily be able 
to stop and check all the cars in the lot and cruisers will know they can be 
trapped there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take long for the word to get out that it's not conducive to 
cruising and they will go elsewhere," Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This problem has overwhelmed us for some time," said Chan, whose company 
manages the shopping center for the La Rinda Center Partnership, a group of 16 
investors who jointly own the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan also offered to provide space, at no charge, for a police substation at 
the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal decision by Associate Zoning Administrator William E. Lillenberg, who 
conducted the hearing, will not come for two or three weeks. Lillenberg can 
impose several conditions on the center's operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando officials, including Mayor Ray Ojeda, pledged to work with Los 
Angeles to solve the problem.

2 MEN FACE HAZARDOUS WASTE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were charged Friday with abandoning hazardous waste in Sun Valley, the 
Los Angeles city attorney's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Jafar Rassouli, 45, of Canoga Park and Hamid Nadjafi, 35, of Reseda are 
accused of abandoning six 55-gallon drums of highly flammable waste paint at 
their former business, Best Auto Body, on Sherman Way, the city attorney's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were each charged with one count of illegally disposing of hazardous 
waste and six counts of violating state regulations regarding the handling of 
hazardous materials, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drums were discovered last year when a new owner moved in, according to 
Deputy City Atty. Brooke White.  
</P>
<P>
 The men are scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 11 in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
If convicted, they could be sentenced to two years in jail and fined more than 
$100,000.

MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING AT WOMAN AND POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcyclist was arrested and booked Friday for firing a gun at a woman and 
then firing shots at a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter that was 
tracking him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Paul Ouellet, 30, was taken into custody without incident and booked on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, police said."He 
didn't hit anyone," said one officer, "but he tried his best." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incidents, which started at about 11 p.m. Thursday. 
Witnesses told police they saw a man on a motorcycle fire a shot from a handgun 
at a woman on Sepulveda Boulevard near Plummer Avenue, and then take off on his 
bike. The woman called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 When the A-Star police helicopter followed Ouellet's motorcycle, he drove into 
a residential neighborhood, got off the bike and fled, said Officer George 
Gonzalez, an Air Support Division officer who was on board the helicopter at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw him pull out a handgun from his waistband and fire two shots at us as 
he fled," said Gonzalez. Police in the helicopter saw Ouellet try to hide next 
to a house, and directed several squad cars to the location. He said Ouellet 
then fired at one of the officers on the ground and fled back toward his 
motorcycle. He tried to get on and start it, but the bike fell on him, Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouellet then tossed a .45 caliber Glock handgun into the street, walked 15 
feet to a sidewalk and laid down so police could arrest him, Gonzalez said. "He 
saw that he was surrounded and threw his gun down and gave up," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 MEN ARRESTED IN 22-POUND COCAINE SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men are in custody after police officials found about 22 pounds of 
cocaine, with a street value of about $1 million, in a van they were driving on 
the Golden State Freeway near Six Flags Magic Mountain, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnulfo Romero, 35, and Ramiro De La Mora, 30, both of Salinas, Calif., were 
arrested at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Officer Michelle Fink of the 
California Highway Patrol.They were being held in lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression Program had 
followed a Chevrolet van driven by Romero northbound on the Golden State and 
requested the help of Newhall CHP officers in stopping it, said Lt. Bob Sayne 
of the Orange County unit. He would not say where the unit began following the 
van, but said officers suspected the men were believed to be part of a drug 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers spotted the van traveling at about 75 m.p.h. at Lyons Avenue and 
pulled it over a few miles later near Magic Mountain Parkway. Officers arrested 
the men after finding a small amount of cocaine inside the van, Fink said. A 
more extensive search, using a police dog, uncovered about 22 pounds of cocaine 
hidden inside the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayne said the seizure was relatively small when compared to others made by 
the task force in large metropolitan areas. But a Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station narcotics detective said the seizure was a considerable one 
for the suburban community.

COURT UPHOLDS NUDE DANCING BAN AT CLUB; CASTAIC: COUNTY PLANNERS ALSO NOTIFY 
THE NIGHTSPOT THAT IT IS VIOLATING ZONING REQUIREMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A court order banning nude dancing at the Santa Clarita Valley's only exotic 
dance club was upheld Friday, but the establishment's landlord said it hopes to 
eliminate the dancers altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the club's operator has found himself deep in red tape because 
Los Angeles County has declared the club violates local zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club offered all-nude dancing at its 
alcohol-free club when it opened June 30 at the intersection of the Golden 
State Freeway and California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Land & Farming Co., which owns the property, got a temporary 
restraining order barring nude dancing the next day, stating the club's lease 
prohibits lewd or offensive entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraining order -- and the bikinis on the dancers -- will remain in 
place until the matter can be heard in court, said Marlee Lauffer, a Newhall 
Land spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 She said Newhall Land is also pursuing other unspecified legal action to force 
the club to abandon all forms of exotic dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 No court dates on the matter have been set, Lauffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want this to be a restaurant where a family could go to eat, that does not 
offer adult-oriented entertainment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Club employees said they had hoped to offer all-nude entertainment in a 
non-alcoholic setting. But to survive financially, they said, the court's 
ruling will force them to serve alcohol until the trial occurs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed because I feel it infringes on my right and everybody's 
right to see the kind of entertainment that is protected by the Constitution 
and the First Amendment," said the club's manager, who would identify himself 
only as "Richard." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Junction faces a more immediate challenge from the county Department 
of Regional Planning, which informed the club by letter Tuesday that it was 
violating zoning requirements by providing live entertainment without obtaining 
proper approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter by John Calas, a zoning enforcement supervisor, states a complaint 
about the club led to an investigation by a zoning official. The club has 10 
days after it receives the letter to obtain approval from the county, or 
criminal charges could be sought through the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Cadwell, the club's operator, said he has not received the county's 
letter, but has already applied for the necessary permits. The last business to 
occupy the building was the Blue Moon restaurant, which offered live music and 
other entertainment.

 RABBI'S BOOK: The recently published sixth book of Rabbi Eli Schochet of West 
Hills' Shomrei Torah Synagogue provides a historical perspective on the Hasidic 
Jewish movement, recently in the spotlight with the passing of its rebbe , 
Menachem Schneerson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hasidic Movement and the Gaon of Vilna" (Jason Aronson & Co.) also 
focuses on Rabbi Elijah, called the Gaon, the exalted one. Schochet said he was 
the outstanding rabbinic scholar of the 18th-Century stronghold of Jewish 
thought, Lithuania. His book analyzes the opposition to Hasidism in the 
latter's formative period. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebbe in the Hasidic movements "plays a qualitatively different role than 
the rabbi does in mainstream Judaism," Schochet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we see played out today is not just the drama of a beloved teacher's 
death but the death of a man who was seen as having a special relationship to 
God," said Schochet, a rabbi in the Conservative wing of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea put forth in classic Hasidism was that the Hasidic rebbe has the 
remarkable gift of devekut , literally, attachment to God. If people couldn't 
cleave to God themselves, by directly cleaving to rebbe the Hasidic followers 
became nearer to God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 EDITOR'S NOVEL: Gabriel Meyer, associate editor of The National Catholic 
Register, a weekly newspaper edited in Encino, will read from his recently 
published novel, "In the Shade of the Terebinth" (Forest of Peace Books), at 7 
p.m. today at the Parnas Gallery, 1547 10th St., Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery novel's narrative weaves together ancient and modern Jerusalem, 
Arabic and Jewish culture, biblical narrative and the plight of Palestinian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's 13 woodcuts and cover art, by artist Michael Schrauzer, will be on 
display in the gallery. For information, call (310) 458-6335. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE BENEFIT: Five performances of "Fiddler on the Roof" will be staged by 
St. Peter Armenian Apostolic Church in Van Nuys, beginning 8 p.m. Friday, to 
help raise funds to rebuild the church's sanctuary, which was severely damaged 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other performances, also at 8 p.m., will be on July 23, 24, 29 and 30 in 
Karagozian Hall on the church grounds, 17231 Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday's performance will be preceded by a black tie champagne 
reception at 6 p.m. The requested donation for that evening is $35 by 
reservation only. Prices for other nights are $17.50 in advance and $20 at the 
door.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL IS ACT OF FAITH FOR NOVICE 
PROMOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Christian music festival next month in Burbank has a ballooning $600,000 
budget and an unusual pair of novice promoters -- a young Baptist of 
Chinese-American heritage and the owner of a computer business, who is not a 
believer but interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Summer Praise '94, set for Aug. 11-14 at the Los Angeles Equestrian 
Center, is a likely flop. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 50 Christian artists and musical groups booked, including 
headliner Carman and the rock group Petra, the event is being promoted heavily 
among evangelicals, who have turned out in respectable numbers for contemporary 
Christian music concerts and a recent series of crusade rallies in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 But as one of the few religious festivals on this scale ever tried in the Los 
Angeles area, the four-day event is still risky. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been fatally jinxed had the promoters followed original plans to 
book singer Michael English, whose Christian music career collapsed in May 
because of a sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, co-promoters Carey Wong, 31, a financier and ex-banker in 
Glendale, and George Jerome, 50, owner of Computer Solutions in Chatsworth, had 
a tentative agreement with English as the featured singer. They were really 
seeking Carman, a proven draw on the Christian circuit, instead of English. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day in late March, I said, 'If we don't get Carman by 2:30 p.m., then 
let's move forward with Michael English,' " said Wong, whose job was to acquire 
talent. "Carman's agent called a minute or two before our deadline and said 
Carman would be available." 
</P>
<P>
 English had been named best male vocalist of the year at the Gospel Music 
Assn. Dove Awards on April 28 in Nashville. But within a week, English returned 
all of his awards, admitting that he had an affair with a married woman, 
another gospel singer. His record company dropped him and most Christian stores 
stopped selling English's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have had to change all our advertising," Wong said. "We definitely 
would have scaled down the event." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, with the commitment by Carman, a five-time Dove Award winner, "a 
lot of Christian musicians who were saying they were unavailable, all of sudden 
became available," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong says divine providence was at work. "I believe in God's grace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, while not condoning English's admitted adultery, Wong said in an 
interview, "I wish Michael English and his family could be here, not just to 
sing but also to be here as a part of a restorative, reconciling process among 
Christians." 
</P>
<P>
 George Jerome, interviewed with Wong in the shade of the Equidome at the 
equestrian center, added, "English is persona non grata in Nashville where most 
of the Christian music companies are, but a lot more is possible in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, where else could a non-Christian run an event that depends on the 
acceptance of evangelical Christians? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome said he has been skeptical of religion but two near-mishaps in his 
private plane and his friendship with Wong, a member of the First Chinese 
Baptist Church in Chinatown, have caused him to question his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen how people who are religious seem so peaceful," Jerome said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome also said that if Summer Praise '94 makes any profit, part of the 
proceeds would launch a pet project of his to house, train and employ homeless 
street people as food cart vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-time promoters said they will have invested nearly $300,000 of their 
own money by the time of the festival, despite much more modest plans at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "This took on a life of its own," Jerome said. "We're now controlled by the 
festival rather than controlling it -- a poor way to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong estimated the turnout will fall between 25,000 and 40,000. But Jerome is 
hoping for more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures provided by the Nashville-based Gospel Music Assn. show that the five 
largest annual Christian music festivals in the country attract between 30,000 
and 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively low ticket prices for Summer Praise '94 may help. For all four 
days, the price is $29.95 before July 30, or $35 at the gate. The Jesus 
Northwest music festival at Vancouver, Wash., which drew 29,000 in three days 
last year, is charging $40 in advance for a three-day pass and $52 at the gate 
for the festival that begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The local festival's headliner, Carman, twice named by Billboard magazine as 
Contemporary Christian Artist of the Year, once drew 26,000 to a concert at the 
Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park, according to the Gospel Music Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 At Six Flags Magic Mountain, Carman has sung in concert annually since 1990. 
Attendance figures are not released by the park, but "the fact that we have had 
him back each year shows that he brings people in," said Bonnie Rabjohn, the 
park's public relations manager. Rabjohn said that Magic Mountain now holds 
four Christian-oriented music nights each year because of their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest single-night crowd at the June 1-5 San Fernando Valley Crusade 
featuring evangelist Luis Palau was 11,200 for the Saturday youth-oriented 
night, featuring contemporary Christian music -- not the opening and closing 
days of the crusade, which normally get the biggest crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent Harvest Crusade, backed by nearly three times as many churches 
as supported the Valley crusade, evangelist Greg Laurie preached to 128,000 at 
Anaheim Stadium over three nights, including 52,000 on Sunday. Country music 
star Ricky Skaggs and pop singer Deniece Williams were among the many artists 
who performed. 
</P>
<P>
 What Summer Praise '94 doesn't have is a track record with big-name 
evangelical backers, although the World Vision relief agency has lent its name 
as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it have a lot of comfortable stadium seating. The Equidome seats 
4,000 and another 8,000 will have to stand on the dirt infield for the featured 
performances. Three other stages will be set up in open-air areas where 
attendees will be encouraged to bring blankets or folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the festival does have an array of names from Christian music, including 
Crystal Lewis and groups such as 4 Him, Newsboys, Guardian and Dakoda Motor 
Company. Black Christian artists include Larnelle Harris, Helen Baylor and Ron 
Kenoly. Latino Christian performers include Patty Cabrera and Chuckie Perez. A 
dozen artists in the "country Christian" genre will also perform. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lineup of speakers reflecting a conservative evangelical perspective 
includes the Rev. E. V. Hill, a nationally known Baptist pastor from South 
Central Los Angeles, and William J. Murray, the Christian convert son of 
atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Carman is expected to promote his 
petition campaign calling for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelism is a low-key aspect of the festival, although the Summer Praise '94 
literature says that among its goals are that those who attend "will have a 
life-changing experience that will affirm their faith in Christ" and that "the 
unsaved . . . would come to know our Savior." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, smiling at his co-promoter during the interview, added: "Maybe even 
George Jerome will see it that way."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CAR THEFT CHASES END IN 5 ARRESTS; CRIME: ONE 
CASE INVOLVES A 54-MILE PURSUIT OF TWO MEN AND A GIRL. IN THE OTHER CASE, 
VICTIM'S HUSBAND AIDS IN CAPTURE.

 In unrelated incidents, suspected car thieves led police on pursuits -- one of 
them on foot -- through the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys Thursday night 
and early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In one pursuit, a suspect escaped by running into a storm drain, only to be 
arrested later by an off-duty officer who heard about the chase. In the second 
pursuit, two men and a teen-age girl led officers on a 54-mile chase that began 
in Los Angeles and ended with their arrest in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The first incident began at 3:30 p.m. Thursday in Palmdale, when Jennifer Winn 
of Lancaster told sheriff's deputies that her 1985 Honda Accord had been stolen 
from her workplace on Palmdale Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 She also called her husband, Henry, who spotted the stolen car a short time 
later on the Antelope Valley Freeway while he was driving toward his wife's 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband followed the stolen car and, using his cellular phone, told the 
California Highway Patrol where it was located, said CHP Officer Michelle Fink. 
</P>
<P>
 A CHP officer soon moved in behind the stolen car, prompting the driver of the 
Accord to pull onto the shoulder, just north of the Sand Canyon Road exit in 
Santa Clarita, Fink said. Both men left the car and ran down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Freddie Pinuelas, 39, of Palmdale was quickly arrested by a CHP 
officer, but his companion ran into a storm channel, then into a circular 
drain, Fink said.  
</P>
<P>
 Three CHP officers and a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy tracked him into 
the drain through footprints and disturbed spider webs, but they abandoned the 
hunt after concluding that the man had escaped by crawling into one of the 
smaller tributary tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 p.m., however, Albert Gavin, an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department 
sergeant who was walking with his wife near Marilyn and Meadow drives, spotted 
and detained the missing suspect. Fink said Gavin knew about the pursuit and 
had heard a description of the suspect, identified as Henry Zepeda, 39, of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the stolen car, officers found marijuana and burglary tools, Fink said. 
Zepeda and Pinuelas were jailed on suspicion of auto theft, drug offenses and 
possession of burglary tools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second chase, at 11:21 p.m. Thursday, LAPD officers asked the CHP to 
take over the pursuit of a stolen Toyota Celica on the northbound Antelope 
Valley Freeway near Placerita Canyon Road. Officers chased the Celica, which 
was moving at 70 to 75 m.p.h., to Palmdale, said CHP Officer Mike Wible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celica left the freeway at Palmdale Boulevard but continued to move at 
high speeds. The driver failed to stop for red lights and stop signs, Wible 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car went as far as 107th Street East, then looped back toward Palmdale. 
When it slowed near 90th Street East and Palmdale Boulevard, officers 
sideswiped the rear, causing the car to spin out of control and stop, the CHP 
spokesman said. The chase lasted 48 minutes and covered just over 54 miles, 
Wible said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arrested the driver, Bobby Clinkscales, 19, of Littlerock and his two 
passengers, Charles Benjamin, 25, of Los Angeles and a 16-year-old girl whose 
named was withheld.  
</P>
<P>
 The two men were jailed at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station on suspicion 
of auto theft. The teen-age female suspect was taken to Juvenile Hall in 
Sylmar.

MITSUBISHI UNIT LOSES PATENT SUIT; ELECTRONICS: WANG LABORATORIES WINS A SECOND 
CLAIM AGAINST AN O.C. ARM OF A JAPANESE GIANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mitsubishi Electronics America Corp. has become the second Orange County arm 
of a Japanese electronics giant to lose a patent infringement suit to Wang 
Laboratories Inc., the onetime pacesetter in the domestic computer industry.  
</P>
<P>
 A federal court jury in Los Angeles ruled this week that the Cypress-based 
Mitsubishi unit had infringed on Wang Lab's patents for computer memory modules 
for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba Electronics, whose U.S. headquarters is in Irvine, and NEC Corp., with 
U.S. headquarters in New York, lost similar infringement suits in 1991 and were 
required to pay Wang about $5 million in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the Mitsubishi case, however, ruled that there was an implied 
licensing agreement between Wang and Mitsubishi and rejected Wang's claim to 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang officials at company headquarters in Lowell, Mass., said Friday they 
intend to appeal that part of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have is a jury verdict. You do not have a judgment," said Wang 
spokesman Ed Pignone. "We feel the jury's findings are unsupported by the 
evidence. We intend to ask the judge to set aside the finding of the implied 
license." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew A. Joseph, assistant general counsel for Mitsubishi Electronics 
America, said the company would oppose Wang.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the jury decision" that Mitsubishi had an implied license from Wang 
to manufacture the memory modules "was the correct one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Judge John Davies agrees to set aside the licensing verdict, the trial 
would enter a second phase to determine monetary damages. Davies is expected to 
issue a ruling within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang sued the U.S. subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. in June, 1992, 
alleging that the company had been manufacturing, using and selling memory 
modules that are protected by two Wang patents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang applied for the patents in late 1983 but kept them secret until 1989. 
Most companies since have licensed the technology from Wang, which fell into 
financial ruin before filing for bankruptcy protection in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The company emerged from bankruptcy last fall. It has shed most of its 
identity as a computer maker and focuses instead on software and services. It 
retained a large patent portfolio, however, and has been aggressive about 
protecting it.

JENNY CRAIG INC. AGREES TO CLASS-ACTION SUIT SETTLEMENT; COURTS: FIRM WILL PAY 
$10 MILLION AND GIVE AWAY $36 MILLION IN MERCHANDISE. LITIGANTS HAD ALLEGED 
THAT THE COMPANY'S DIETS COULD CAUSE GALLBLADDER DISEASE. 
</P>

<P>
 Weight-loss center operator Jenny Craig Inc. has agreed to pay $10 million in 
cash and give away merchandise worth $36 million at retail prices to settle a 
4-year-old lawsuit alleging misleading advertising and improper business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Jenny Craig is based in Del Mar, the class action suit on behalf of 
360,000 of its clients was filed in Orange County Superior Court in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It alleged that the company's diets could cause gallbladder disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement signed Thursday applies to people who used Jenny Craig centers 
between 1987 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to settle the case, Jenny Craig did not admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company on Friday acknowledged the final settlement, which had been 
announced in April, but a spokesman said there would be no other comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of its competitors, Jenny Craig has been hit hard by the recession 
and by a shift in dieters' approaches to weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement should not be a significant financial blow to the company, said 
Ronald Rotter, an industry analyst with Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers sound sizable, he said, but Jenny Craig's insurer is paying $6 
million of the $10-million cash payment, which is to be divided among 22,000 
former clients who filed claims against the company as a result of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 And very few of the 360,000 former Jenny Craig clients eligible for the $100 
merchandise certificates are expected to claim and cash them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if everyone cashed in the coupons, Rotter said, there is a "sizable" 
markup -- 50% or more -- on the prepared dietary food products that the company 
sells through its network of weight-loss centers. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the actual cost to the company of settling the suit is likely to be 
far less than half of the stated amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have $40 million cash and no long-term debt, so it shouldn't hurt too 
much," Rotter said. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible complication remains, however. Jenny Craig has filed a lawsuit 
against one of its insurance carriers that the company said was supposed to pay 
$2 million of the $6 million being covered by insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court Thursday, alleges that First 
State Insurance Co. of Boston has reneged on the agreement worked out in April 
and is now refusing to pay its share unless new conditions are met. 
</P>
<P>
 The company took a charge for the cash settlement in its third fiscal quarter, 
resulting in an $8.7-million loss for the three months ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of its fiscal year, the company posted a profit of 
just over $200,000 -- down from $27 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig, one of the nation's largest weight-loss chains, has more than 800 
centers in the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials and industry analysts have said that weight-loss centers 
like the Jenny Craig chain that rely on sales of their own diet food products 
are being hurt by the recession, increased competition from supermarket sales 
of frozen diet meals and a shift in dieting goals away from weight loss for the 
sake of appearance and toward weight control for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig gets about 90% of its total revenue from the sale of its 
prepackaged meals, which cost participants from $50 to $75 a week. Clients also 
pay a $7 weekly fee to attend a weight clinic meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "As absurd as it sounds," Rotter said, "this settlement might -- and I stress 
' might ' -- help add to their business. If people do use the coupons and like 
the food and the programs the company now is offering, they could decide to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
 "The coupons could become a loss leader" to bring in new business. 
</P>

TRW TESTS SALE OF COMPETITORS' REPORTS; CREDIT: PROGRAM WOULD ENABLE CONSUMERS 
TO PURCHASE RATINGS DATA FROM ALL 3 MAJOR MONITORING AGENCIES. 
</P>

 TRW Inc. said Friday it is testing a program to sell consumers not only its 
own reports on their credit histories but also those of its two major 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 For $29, consumers participating in the test can find out how their credit is 
rated by TRW, Equifax Corp. and Trans Union Corp. Until now, consumers had to 
call each of the three separately to obtain copies of their credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW already offers all consumers a free credit report every year. Trans Union 
and Equifax charge about $15 for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The new TRW service is being test-marketed to the 700,000 members of the 
company's Credentials credit monitoring program. Credentials, for which 
consumers pay between $29 and $44 a year, informs them when credit inquiries 
are made about them, updates them on their credit rating and gives them 
unlimited free access to their own TRW credit information. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test is successful, the combined credit reports will be offered to the 
public starting next year. "We anticipate rolling it out in January," said 
Gerry Keehan, marketing director for TRW's credit bureau in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The major benefit of the combination report, Keehan said, is "if someone is 
making a major purchase where a credit grantor is likely to look at all three 
bureaus, like a car or a house." Reviewing the data beforehand would give them 
a chance to clear up any errors before applying for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage bankers and major loan companies often review a consumer's credit 
reports from all three major agencies before lending money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wheeler, TRW's vice president for consumer information services, said the 
combination reports, first offered in June, have been even more popular than 
the company had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of acceptance is high," he said, and complaints are "virtually 
nil." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Atlanta-based Equifax and Chicago-based Trans Union said that 
they have no plans to offer similar combined credit reports to consumers.

AFTER 'L.A. LAW,' LIFE GOES ON, ONSTAGE; THEATER: ALAN ROSENBERG RECONNECTS 
WITH THE THEATER -- AND WITH HIS DEPARTED BROTHER -- IN THE ACCLAIMED 'OLD 
BUSINESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His endearing performance as the sensitive, soulful attorney Eli Levinson on 
ABC's "Civil Wars" and later on NBC's "L.A. Law" made Alan Rosenberg a hot TV 
star and a "thinking woman's" sex symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg and co-star Debi Mazur, who played Eli's secretary Denise, proved so 
popular with audiences that after "Civil Wars" was canceled in the spring of 
1993, they joined the cast of "L.A. Law" last fall. They also created TV 
history: They became the first actors from a prime-time series to join another 
series on a different network as the same characters. 
</P>
<P>
 But when "L.A. Law" closed up shop in May, Rosenberg didn't rush into another 
series or seek out a TV movie or feature. Instead, he opted to return to his 
theatrical roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, 42, stars with Harold Gould in Joe Cacaci's critically acclaimed 
drama "Old Business," which finished a sold-out engagement at the Court Theatre 
earlier this month and reopened for a six-week run Thursday at the Coast 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg was hoping to direct his Emmy Award-winning wife, Marg Helgenberger 
("China Beach"), in a play this summer when "Old Business" came his way. "I 
love doing theater," said the fast-talking Rosenberg, as he relaxed on a bench 
in the Court Theatre's courtyard after a recent performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I did 'Lost in Yonkers' on Broadway three years ago, I hadn't done a 
play in eight years. I want to make sure I don't stay away from it for that 
long (again). You get so sidetracked -- you want to do something that will 
further your career and make you some money. What I originally fell in love 
with about this profession was coming into contact with people. It's truly 
gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the actors never share the stage together, "Old Business" focuses on 
the emotionally charged relationship between Abe (Gould), a 76-year-old 
real-estate tycoon being forced into retirement for health reasons, and his 
eldest son David (Rosenberg), to whom Abe reluctantly hands over the business. 
</P>
<P>
 David must struggle to gain his father's respect, act as guardian to his 
younger, alcoholic brother Edward and keep control of his father's business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg said that his involvement in "Old Business" was pure happenstance. 
He was doing a play reading at the Westwood Playhouse earlier this year when he 
caught the eye of Cacaci, who, along with "Old Business" producer Dan Lauria, 
operates readings at the Playhouse every Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me to do a reading (of "Old Business") at the Westwood Playhouse," 
he recalled. "Joe Cacaci had written it for a friend of his in New York, but he 
saw something in me that said to him that I could do it. I was flattered he 
thought I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosenberg thought it would be good to be seen in a play "where I was on 
stage for a length of time. It just all came together. Then we got all roped 
into producing it together," he said, laughing. "I wasn't necessarily looking 
for something to throw my own money into, now that I am out of work. But it's 
worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cacaci, who also is the director, said Rosenberg has the ability to 
effortlessly juggle both the comedic and tragic aspects of the piece. "He does 
that just so seamlessly," Cacaci explained. "That's really the key to the play, 
to be able to do that. Those are layers and details that are very difficult to 
do and he had them the first day of the reading. He understands that part in 
his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In the character of David, Rosenberg sees a lot of his late brother, film 
producer Mark Rosenberg ("The Killing Fields"). Mark Rosenberg died of a heart 
attack in November, 1992, at age 44.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was crying (at the play)," Rosenberg said softly. "I sort of played 
Edward to my brother's David all of our lives. He was not as frazzled as my 
character in this, but he did take care of me. I was sort of getting into 
trouble and always knew that my brother would be there backing me up, which is 
disconcerting now since he's not here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rosenberg added, "I know the difference between fact and fiction. I'm 
able to use whatever is bothering me in my work. It's not daunting. It's 
cathartic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Passaic, N.J., native earned a bachelor's degree in political science and 
theater from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University. He applied to only 
one graduate drama school, the Yale School of Drama. His drama professor didn't 
think he was ready to audition for such a prestigious school, but, Rosenberg 
said proudly, "I got in." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg paused. "It's funny," he reflected. "The older I get, the more I 
look back at my life. I kind of find we all get on a path. No matter what you 
do to sabotage it, no matter what other people do, you keep going on that path. 
I had no idea I was going to be an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping out of Yale during his second year, Rosenberg went to New York. "As 
soon as I went there I did plays for no money but I was driving a cab, a limo, 
all kinds of odd jobs. It took me three years before I became somewhat known." 
</P>
<P>
 And he became "somewhat known" in 1976, winning rave reviews for his role as a 
vulnerable drug addict accused of murder in Thomas Babe's "A Prayer for My 
Daughter" at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, Rosenberg said, "I worked constantly in the theater. It was 
fine. But I wanted to do other things." So he came out to Hollywood a decade 
ago. "I thought I would test the waters out here as far as acting is 
concerned." Until he landed the role of Eli in 1990, Rosenberg primarily did 
guest spots on episodic TV. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Rosenberg just wants to "keep on working. It's been a great 
job for me on 'L.A. Law' and 'Civil Wars.' Actors are not supposed to be 
employed for more than three years, so I wasn't devastated (both series were 
canceled). But I did enjoy it. I had a ball playing this character who seems to 
be so lovable. People who come to see this play love Eli . . . so I am going to 
look for something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Old Business" runs Thursdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. through 
Aug. 21 at the Coast Playhouse, 8325 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 466-1767. 
Tickets $22-$25.

 'True' Box Office?: 20th Century Fox was not reporting box-office figures on 
Friday for Thursday night's preview showings of Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest 
action movie, "True Lies," but industry sources said the film grossed about $2 
million on 1,300 screens. "That's a strong, but not blockbuster" performance, 
said one. But the same source said the number may not be indicative of the 
film's potential, since many fans had likely planned to see the movie on its 
official opening day, Friday. Fox officials did not return calls by Calendar's 
deadline. TELEVISION

 McLaughlin Exhibition Postponed: The Laguna Art Museum announced Friday that a 
retrospective featuring the work of Southern California modernist painter John 
McLaughlin has been rescheduled from this October and will not open until the 
summer of 1996. A pet project of the museum's former director, Charles 
Desmarais, the show was postponed once before (it initially was scheduled for 
the museum's 75th anniversary celebration last year). Desmarais, who began 
working on the ambitious project four years ago, maintains the show as he 
conceived it is ready for presentation this fall. After Desmarais was fired by 
the board last spring, the exhibition became a bone of contention. In place of 
the McLaughlin show, the museum will substitute "Lit From Within," an 
exhibition of Amish quilts from the collection of Doug Tompkins, former owner 
of Esprit de Corp. in San Francisco.

PARIS OPERA HOUSE CLOSES FOR TWO-YEAR RESTORATION; MUSIC: PLANS ARE UNDER WAY 
FOR A $50-MILLION PROJECT TO CLEAN, REPAIR AND MODERNIZE THE 119-YEAR-OLD 
BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the world's most sumptuous and storied auditoriums, the 119-year-old 
Paris Opera House, ended its season this week and prepared to shut down for a 
two-year, $50-million restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, the most extensive in the Opera House's history, will focus on 
the vast stage, one of the world's largest, and the horseshoe-shaped 
auditorium. It will include cleaning, repairs and the addition of more modern 
backstage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Opera House is old, you know, and we have to modernize," said Evelyn 
Paris, a spokeswoman for the National Opera of Paris. "But we won't be changing 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The last performers on the opera's stage were dancers from the San Francisco 
Ballet, which concluded its engagement Sunday under the direction of Helgi 
Tomasson. 
</P>
<P>
 French critics heaped praise on the San Francisco company's interpretations of 
classical works. But they reserved their kindest words for "Rodeo," a 1942 
ballet choreographed by Agnes de Mille to music by Aaron Copland. The French, 
sitting in the gilded auditorium, just loved those cowboy hats and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration work will soon begin on the grand auditorium, from the padded 
wooden seats to the rows of gilded boxes to the six-ton chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time," Paris said. "We've never gone so long without a restoration." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Paris Opera Ballet will take its next two seasons to the 
Bastille Opera, the state-of-the-art but much less personal venue across town. 
In the four years since the Bastille Opera opened, the National Opera of Paris 
has performed there, rather than at its original home. The Opera House has 
featured mostly dance and music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Opera House face-lift, though, the opera and ballet companies will 
split their time between the two venues, using the Opera House for more 
intimate programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Paris Opera auditorium is relatively small, seating only 2,200, 
its stage can accommodate 450 players and the complex is among the world's 
largest theaters, occupying nearly 120,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, which opened in 1875, is often referred to as the Opera Garnier, 
after its architect, Charles Garnier, who was chosen from 171 contestants to 
design the Opera House. Although today it is considered one of Paris' more 
attractive monuments, the Opera House wasn't welcomed by Empress Eugenie, widow 
of Napoleon III, when it opened. Reportedly angered that her architect friend, 
Eugene Viollet-Le-Duc, had been passed over for the project, she is said to 
have remarked: "What is this style? It isn't style. It's not Greek, not Louis 
XV, not Louis XVI," to which Garnier replied: "No. This is the style of the 
times. It is the style of Napoleon III and you are complaining about yourself!" 
</P>
<P>
 Historians, in the end, agreed with Eugenie. Garnier showed insufficient 
originality to create a new school of architecture, but his masterpiece remains 
an important monument of the Second Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The facade of the domed building, which resembles the Monte Carlo Casino, 
another Garnier creation, has a majestic balcony overlooking the Place de 
l'Opera. Steps take arriving ticket-holders into the marbled arcade, past a 
Paul Belmondo copy of the sculpture "Dance." Urban pollution forced the French 
to move the original, by Carpeaux, into the Louvre some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500,000 people visit the Opera House every year, making it one of 
the more popular tourist sites in Paris. As the refurbishing progresses, the 
Opera House will be periodically closed to visitors, though no schedule has yet 
been decided. Officials say it will reopen in time for the summer 1996 season.

TATTOO ART TO MAKE ITS MARK AT LAGUNA 
</P>

 Laguna Art Museum, which scored a big hit last year with its popular "Kustom 
Kulture" show about hot rods and comics, has booked for 1995 a traveling 
exhibit exploring another facet of popular culture: tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eye Tattooed America," curated by tattoo artist and historian Don Edhardy, 
formerly of Corona del Mar, contains contemporary and historical tattoo imagery 
by tattoo artists as well as contemporary art by painter Ed Paschke and other 
artists influenced by the flesh-branding phenomenon that is undergoing going a 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-piece, 20-artist touring show, which originated last summer at 
Chicago's Ann Nathan Gallery, is on view at the Museum of Art at the University 
of Iowa. It will travel to non-commercial arts institutions in Milwaukee, 
Indiana and Virginia before running at the Laguna museum, which has tentatively 
scheduled its opening for late July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to improve and expand upon the exhibit," Susan M. Anderson, the 
Laguna museum's acting director, said this week. A more in-depth "historical 
context," plus works by Southern California artists, may be added, Anderson 
said. The show most likely will be displayed in the museum's main site and its 
South Coast Plaza annex, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a museum of California art," Anderson said, "which, since its 
beginnings, has been very much influenced by popular culture. And, from what we 
can tell about this exhibit, contemporary tattooing has really come out of 
California."

IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS; THEATER: OCC STUDENTS WILL STAGE FIVE 
LITTLE-PRODUCED ONE-ACTS THAT SHED LIGHT ON THE WRITER'S POINT OF VIEW AND 
STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most theater-goers are familiar with such Tennessee Williams' masterworks as 
"The Glass Menagerie" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." But titles such as 
"Moony's Kid Don't Cry" and "Hello From Bertha" may leave even some Williams 
fans puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably because they're one-acts, drama's equivalent of the short 
story. Williams wrote dozens during his long career, but few have been staged 
regularly, especially in the years following the playwright's death in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast College's student-run Repertory Theatre Company breaks with 
convention today and Sunday by offering a quintet of Williams' playlets. 
</P>
<P>
 All five will be presented in each of four performances, giving audiences the 
chance to see the range in Williams' small-form style. Two ("Talk to Me Like 
the Rain and Let Me Listen" and "This Property Is Condemned") are fairly well 
known, but the others ("The Case of the Crushed Petunia," "Moony's Kid Don't 
Cry" and "Hello From Bertha") occupy the obscure section of the Williams 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the obscurity that gives the shows a special flavor, said Rick Golson, 
the OCC theater-arts instructor who oversees the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were certainly obscure to me until we got involved with this," Golson 
said. "I hadn't had that much experience with his one-acts until now, and I 
found them illuminating. The students really wanted to do them, and I thought 
it would be a good idea, a good way (for them to become acquainted) with one of 
our greatest playwrights (and) a good way to introduce the public to some of 
his lesser-known works." 
</P>
<P>
 Golson said that the playlets were chosen for what they reveal about his point 
of view and writing style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most are about people living on the fringe, trying to find some dignity in 
their lives, which is a (common) theme of his," Golson said. "These plays 
should add a dimension to anybody's grasp of Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 They also provide challenges for the cast of 14. Golson said they were 
naturally drawn to Williams because of his romanticism and the intense emotions 
of the roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being young, they tend to identify with (the deep feelings) of his 
characters," he explained. "Of course, the goal they have during staging is 
being able to make those characters real, to make life out of the poetry of his 
language while not overacting." 
</P>
<P>
 In describing the one-acts, Golson started with "The Case of the Crushed 
Petunia," which centers on an older woman who runs a small shop. Her barren 
days seem to have no end until a young man enters the scene and "arouses 
passion in her life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello From Bertha" is about a dying prostitute and the poignant letter she 
writes to a friend. The experience, Golson explained, allows her to "relive her 
memories of a man who was nice to her and a time that was better." 
</P>

 In "Moony's Kid Don't Cry," a young couple sees their marriage collapsing 
after the wife gives birth and the demands of parenthood settle in. "Williams 
takes us through their disillusionment with their dreams and with the romance 
they had, but the ending is happy," Golson said.

 He described "Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen" as the most poetic 
play of the program. Two lovers just talk, trying to communicate what they mean 
to one another.

<P>
 "It's really a mood piece, very hard to put into words," Golson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Property Is Condemned" is more straightforward. One of the best known of 
Williams' one-acts, it focuses on two adolescents as they reveal the hardships 
of their lives to each other.

ART; MCLAUGHLIN SHOW RESCHEDULED FOR '96; THE LAGUNA MUSEUM EXHIBITION ON THE 
ABSTRACT PAINTER HAD BEEN THE BABY OF THEN-DIRECTOR CHARLES DESMARAIS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Laguna Art Museum has rescheduled its retrospective of work by seminal 
Southern California abstract painter John McLaughlin for the summer of 1996, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also announced that Peter Selz, a professor emeritus at UC 
Berkeley, will join three other art historians working on the exhibition. The 
exhibition, a four-year project of former museum director Charles Desmarais, 
who was fired in March, was to have opened in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Desmarais originally was to have written the chief catalogue essay 
for the exhibition, acting museum director Susan M. Anderson said Thursday that 
he is no longer a participant in the show. It will be revamped to include some 
early (pre-1950) paintings and an essay addressing McLaughlin's legacy in 
Southern California. Neither aspect was part of the original version of the 
show, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selz joins catalogue essayist Susan C. Larsen, a professor of art history at 
USC, Anderson and museum assistant curator Lisa Buck as contributors to the 
exhibition. But the museum -- rather than any particular individual -- will be 
credited as the principal "author" of the catalogue, with Larsen assuming a 
more active role as project coordinator, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selz, 75, has had a long career in the art world, including jobs as chief 
curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York 
(1958-65) and founding director of the University Art Museum, Berkeley 
(1965-73). 
</P>
<P>
 Selz was involved with the 1959 exhibition "Four Abstract Classicists" -- 
which first brought McLaughlin's severely geometrical work to broad public 
attention -- at what was then known as the Los Angeles County Museum of 
History, Science and Art. The show also included work by Lorser Feitelson, Karl 
Benjamin and Fred Hammersley. 
</P>
<P>
 Selz's role in that show was the subject of debate. Selz -- who at the time 
was leaving Pomona College for his new job at MOMA -- was credited in the 
preface of that show's catalogue for "initiating" the exhibition. But art 
critic Jules Langsner wrote the catalogue. And in the preface, then-L.A. County 
Museum assistant curator James Elliott said Langsner "played a major role in 
its organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Selz or Langsner deserved curatorial credit for that exhibition was 
argued in an exchange of letters between Selz and Langsner's widow. The letters 
were published in 1975 in the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, 47, is an authority in American abstract art whose books include 
"Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America, 1927-1944" (with John R. Lane). 
She also was curator of the permanent collection at the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York and wrote a major essay on McLaughlin for a 1977 Los 
Angeles County Museum project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the original venues on the tour (the Oakland Museum, the 
Baltimore Museum of Art and the Newark Museum in New Jersey) are "still 
interested" in hosting the show after it leaves Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering Desmarais' statement earlier this week that his version of the show 
would be ready for presentation in October and that all funding was in place, 
Anderson said the museum needs to raise an additional $77,000 to meet the 
$173,000 budget, which includes a major catalogue. (Anderson said the budget 
for the new show would be roughly similar to the exhibition conceived by 
Desmarais.) 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais said Thursday that the $173,000 figure was the original budget goal 
but that it had been scaled back to $100,000 before he left the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is no longer involved in the project, Desmarais said: "The fact 
still stands that I conceptualized the show. I did the research. . . . The real 
question is: Why change it, when the exhibition is already done? To be more 
true to McLaughlin and his work? To better serve the public? Or is it personal? 
. . . It may or may not be legal, but it doesn't strike me as fair or ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson: "After (Desmarais) left the museum, we envisioned the project 
anew. The museum's view of his participation and his view were irreconcilable. 
He didn't like the idea of a group project. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There were changes in the checklist, the catalogue, the (accompanying) video. 
We discovered we were envisioning a product that was different. We were talking 
about a new show with a new curatorial team, and it didn't make sense for any 
one person to be called sole author of the project. . . . We certainly don't 
want to take his exhibition and claim it as our own. We're moving forward with 
a new team."

HBO TAKES ROAD NETWORKS FEAR TO TREAD; TELEVISION: THE CABLE CHANNEL MINES THE 
RICH TERRAIN OF TV HISTORY, A SUBJECT AVOIDED BY ABC, NBC AND CBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Network TV, expert at churning out ripped-from-the-headlines dramas, has been 
notoriously deficient in recording the story of one of the great social forces 
of our time: itself. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certainly specials about TV on network TV -- but they tend to give 
superficial historical looks at the medium, from the Emmy Awards to reunions 
based on old hit series to, say, a drama about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while, something special about what network TV has meant to this 
country -- for better and worse -- pops up, usually elsewhere. PBS had a 
terrific series in the 1980s marking the medium's first half-century. Ken 
Burns' 1992 documentary "Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio," also on 
PBS, dealt with, among other people, TV visionary David Sarnoff, who headed 
RCA, former parent of NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS recently presented a prime-time special about Edward R. Murrow's showdown 
with Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. The same network aired a tribute to its former 
chairman, William S. Paley, when he died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet TV is so much a part of our lives, from presidential elections to the 
freeway chase of O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco, you would think that network 
creators could devise more than just a few substantial programs about the major 
and fascinating stories involving the broadcast organizations themselves and 
the impact of their decisions and corporate inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing series, from sitcoms to dramas that deal with TV -- from "Buffalo 
Bill" to "Murphy Brown" to "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" -- don't really fill the 
bill, despite their often-trenchant comments on the state of the business.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger scope is generally missing, despite such great potential yarns 
as the emergence of Fox Broadcasting Co. and the attempts of colorful 
entrepreneurs Ted Turner and Barry Diller to take over CBS, not to mention such 
significantly related tales as the creation and success of CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on and on. But the networks, for obvious reasons -- competition 
with each other, the preferences of advertisers and a simple lack of 
imagination -- rarely, if ever, look at themselves in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 A pay-cable channel that doesn't rely on advertisers, HBO has found rich 
terrain in the networks, their shenanigans and their history, from the comedy 
"The Larry Sanders Show" -- a wickedly wonderful backstage spoof of a 
late-night talk program -- to several dramas about famous figures and events of 
the medium that alternately repel and fascinate. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO has already, for instance, presented a drama about Murrow. And, Robert 
Cooper, head of HBO Pictures -- which virtually swept the 1993 Emmy nominations 
for best TV movies -- gave a status report the other day on two more films 
about network television that he has in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 One is "The Late Shift," based on Bill Carter's recent book about the battle 
between David Letterman and Jay Leno to succeed Johnny Carson on "The Tonight 
Show." The other is based on Sally Bedell Smith's 1990 book "In All His Glory," 
which detailed the public and personal life of Paley, one of the mammoth 
figures of television. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Late Shift" is being produced by Ivan Reitman, whose motion pictures 
include "Dave" and "Ghostbusters." And Barry Levinson ("Avalon," "Diner") is a 
producer of the saga of Paley, who died at 89. 
</P>
<P>
 The film "Broadcast News" showed that the public can be won over by backstage 
dramas about TV, and HBO seems to have gotten the message far more clearly than 
the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, whose best-known HBO films include "And the Band Played On" and 
"Barbarians at the Gate," thinks it is part of his channel's strategy to tackle 
subjects that networks won't -- like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be different from network TV. We've got to have something worth 
paying for," he says. "My job is to fill in the spaces that they won't. We can 
take greater risks, not because we're more courageous, but because there's no 
intermediary (sponsors). It's just us and the people at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper says the script of "The Late Shift" is being written and that, unlike 
other HBO films that took a number of years to develop, "I think it's something 
we ought to make soon" because of the timeliness of the Letterman-Leno story. 
He says that the planned film could be on the air around the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman cracks that although it's a "one-in-a-million" shot, he'd like to ask 
Leno and Letterman to play themselves. As for talk about who would be good to 
portray them, he says movie stars carry their own baggage of personality: "It's 
better to just get good actors. I don't think they have to be absolutely 
unknown, but you don't want Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that it's a great human story," adds Reitman. "It's different 
because they (Leno and Letterman) are in our bedrooms every night. So from a 
ratings standpoint, I guess that makes it attractive to HBO. This was the 
lifelong dream of both guys and they both deserve it. There's no bad guy in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper says the latest script of the Paley drama came in several weeks ago and 
"they're now looking for a director." Among other things, he says, the story 
deals with the CBS leader's competition with Sarnoff, his relationship with 
Murrow and what Paley "said he did and what he really did and didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Mutrux, a producer involved in developing the Paley drama for Levinson's 
Baltimore Pictures, says that HBO wants the film done by the summer of 1995. 
She says that Levinson thought the story "was a good way to tell the history of 
broadcasting in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Has CBS called her about the drama? "No," says Mutrux, "but we'll see what 
happens when I ask them for clips." Smith adds, "I haven't detected any 
animosity" from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith's book about Paley first came out, a CBS spokesman, noting that HBO 
had already done the Murrow biography, said: "HBO seems to find CBS lore good 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is, just like the lore that comprises the history of the other 
networks. There can hardly be a richer bounty of popular American culture just 
ripe for the picking. But you won't find much of it in the networks' prime 
time. Or perhaps, after Paddy Chayefsky's dark film satire "Network" -- which 
gets frighteningly truer each year -- they just don't like what they see in the 
mirror.

POP BEAT: WHEN DEFIANCE, DISCORD AND HONKY-TONK COLLIDE; POP BEAT: A NUMBER OF 
NEW BANDS ARE FINDING THAT BACKWOODS COUNTRY AND PUNK-ROCK ARE ODDLY 
COMPATIBLE. THE RESULT: BLUEGRASS 'ON STEROIDS.' 
</P>

<P>
 "Wahoo!" hollers a blue-haired man in the audience at Emo's nightclub, as the 
Bad Livers pluck banjo and upright bass at such furious speed that you could 
barely wedge a piece of straw between the rollicking notes. In fact, most of 
the young crowd are howling in approval after starting out merely amused. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing ironic or novel about the Bad Livers. The Austin trio is just 
a modern-day hillbilly band whose members once stomped their feet to Black Flag 
and the Dead Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe probably never dreamed there would ever be 
anything like the Dead Kennedys, let alone that the music he invented would 
someday be meshed with punk's discordance. And the Dead Kennedys probably never 
considered bastardizing a Bill Monroe tune. But some 70 years after the 
introduction of bluegrass and more than 15 after the birth of punk, the spirit 
of backwoods country and punk have collided. 
</P>
<P>
 And such bands as the Bad Livers, Killbilly, Mule, Doo-Rag and Southern 
Culture on the Skids prove that the two are quite compatible, and maybe even 
strangely related.  
</P>
<P>
 Speed, spontaneity, recklessness and a do-it-yourself approach, as well as a 
defiant and sometimes dark attitude, are common elements in both styles. Both 
are also raw forms of bigger commercial presentations -- popular Nashville 
country and palatable mainstream rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I was brought into punk in the first place was for its honesty and 
sincerity and sense of urgency," says Mark Rubin, 27, the Bad Livers' bassist 
and tuba player. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there just came a point when punk-rock stuff started turning to 
(expletive). . . . Rather than become overly cynical, it dawned on me that 
there was some great traditional bluegrass, country blues, hillbilly and 
honky-tonk out there. What I heard in that was the very same things that drew 
me to punk-rock in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Killbilly drummer Mike Schwedler describes what makes bluegrass fit so well 
with punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that manic energy," he says from the band's home base in Dallas. "That 
freight-train speed and intensity. Then we take that and even speed it up more, 
like it's on steroids." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not new for punk bands to draw on country music -- X, for one, cited 
George Jones as a big influence. But '80s "cowpunk" bands such as Los Angeles' 
Blood on the Saddle drew more from folk and Nashville-style country than the 
pre-electric, back-porch twang of America's outback. Current hillbilly bands 
weaned on punk zero in on the less-polished sounds of bluegrass, blues and 
old-time gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mule's hillbilly-meets-grunge is far from the Bad Livers' pure, well-tuned 
sound. The Detroit trio's distorted music flails around in delirious melees 
while P.W. Long wheezes and huffs the lyrics as if he's gone cabin crazy. The 
band, whose members were in the punk bands the Laughing Hyenas and Wig, play 
scary, dirge-like music that would have been perfect for the more warped scenes 
in "Deliverance." 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who talks with the same husky tones of his singing voice, reckons his 
demented approach is partly the influence of country heretic Johnny Cash. "If 
you listen to the strain in his lyrics and vocals, there is psychosis in there 
somewhere. The lyrics are delivered real flat and psychotically aggressive. I'm 
sure I got a lot of my twistedness from him." 
</P>
<P>
 And the influences go even further back. Says Rubin (who was in Killbilly 
before the Bad Livers formed four years ago), "One of the most twisted things 
I've ever heard is the banjo-playing of Dock Boggs, or the guitar-playing of 
Blind Willie Johnson. To me, those guys are more downright spooky and scary 
than Bauhaus ever was." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction to the old styles is also rooted in a back-to-basics feel and, 
ironically, a sense of discovering something new that has the edgy elements 
required by the post-punk generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep finding seminal recordings that profoundly affect me," says Rubin. "I 
find that more and more when I dig into the recorded past than I do when I turn 
on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Long: "There's a lot of cool stories in those old songs. Some of them 
started out as field hollers; then a blues guy put a tune to it; then some 
country dude would record it. It's kept the same story going for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our first single, we took some words that had been passed down, and put 
our music to it. That used to be the way to preserve songs. I guess that's 
kinda what we're doing -- keeping it alive."

AUTOPSY PLANNED TODAY ON CORPSE OF FROZEN WOMAN; PROBE: ARIZONA MURDER SUSPECT 
ONCE LIVED IN LAKE FOREST. THE VICTIM WAS FOUND INSIDE FREEZER IN TRUCK RENTED 
BY HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 The frozen body of a woman, found in a truck rented by a former Lake Forest 
man, cannot be examined for the cause of death until it thaws, authorities in 
Prescott, Ariz., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no apparent cause of death, and we wouldn't know until (Saturday) 
when the medical examiner can perform the autopsy," Yavapai County sheriff's 
spokeswoman Laurie Berra said Friday. "She is still partially frozen." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities described the victim as Caucasian and in her 20s to 30s, weighing 
124 pounds and 5-feet-4 to 5-feet-6, with long dark hair. Berra said they have 
some possible leads as to her identity, but have been unsuccessful trying to 
match her fingerprints with those of women reported missing across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could take as long as a day, and then, on the other hand, I've seen 
corpses remain unidentified for six months," she said. "There is no way to 
predict." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies went to the Prescott Country Club home of John Famalaro on 
Wednesday after receiving a tip from Phoenix police that the Ryder truck he had 
rented in Lake Forest in January was stolen. Famalaro was arrested shortly 
after the body was found in a freezer in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 He has retained a private attorney and has not given a statement to police, 
Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old house painter kept a post office box in Lake Forest while 
living in his country club home and made several trips back to California, 
Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Prescott Coutier, Famalaro, who was described by his 
customers as well-spoken, moved to Prescott to take care of his father, who has 
Parkinson's disease and is hospitalized. Famalaro's mother lives in another 
home at Prescott Country Club. Deputies searched the 20- to 25-foot truck after 
Phoenix police said it may be involved in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was found after deputies saw an extension cord running from the 
freezer in the truck to his house, Berra said. The cord powered the freezer, 
which had been left on for days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck and the freezer have been taken to the Department of Public Safety's 
crime lab in Phoenix. Several cans of paint also were found in the back of the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have obtained a search warrant for Famalaro's car and home, but 
Berra would not comment on what was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held in Yavapai County Jail on suspicion of theft and 
first-degree murder.

COWPOKING ALONG; CARS GIVE WAY TO CATTLE FOR A LITTLE DRIVE DOWN FAIRVIEW ROAD

 It looked like "City Slickers III": 250 young cattle thundering down the road, 
herded by hoof-nipping sheep dogs and cowboys on horseback and urged on by 
knee-slaps and hollers of "yee haw!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the shouts came from more than 1,500 urbanites, and the mile-long cattle 
drive wasn't on a dusty trail but on Fairview Road, from Costa Mesa High School 
to the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Camcorders whirred and some residents turned out in western wear for the 10 
a.m. stunt organized by the fair, in keeping with its theme "Saddle Up for 
Fun." 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic moment, all 250 bewildered cows darted off course and took an 
unplanned detour onto Merrimac Way. But dozens of cowboys and sheep dogs led 
the doe-eyed critters back to Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city slickers here, like Tamme Wienland, 21, of Costa Mesa and her 
2-year-old son, Shawn, had never seen anything like this except in movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn "has an Old MacDonald book so he knows how (cows) sound, but I wanted to 
show him what they looked like," Wienland said.  
</P>
<P>
 They were in for more than a little look-see. Hundreds of cattle crowded by 
them, trampling on mulch provided by fair organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff also was on hand, although the Orange County lawman was there as 
one of the celebrity cowboys, not to keep the varmints out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand and on horse were members of a Los Angeles-based group called the 
Cowboy Lawyers Assn., whose members exchange suits for spurs on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are surprised that a bunch of dirt-looking people are lawyers, but 
actually the two go together nicely," said the group's founder Jim Nichols, 49, 
of Burbank. "It's a high-pressure business and (riding horses) decompresses the 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 100 lawyer/cowpokes enjoy riding and the spirit of the West, 
Nichols said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wear boots, eat steak and beans and hang out at campfires. We ain't dainty 
doily guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests at the cattle drive included Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. 
Snowden, Mayor Sandra L. Genis, western romance writer Dorsey Adams, former 
"Dukes of Hazzard" star Denver Pyle and look-alikes of various western heroes, 
such as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cattle drive lasted less than 20 minutes, one Costa Mesa man said 
he "had goose bumps all over" watching the cattle go by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was thrilling," said Ron De Geare, 58, of Costa Mesa, who was 
yelling "yee haw!" and "yippee!" with one arm raised in the air as the calves 
tramped by. "I've never seen a cattle drive before." 
</P>
<P>
 Most in the crowd followed the herd into the fairgrounds parking lot and then 
into the fair, which continues through July 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen protesters from the animal rights activists group Orange County People 
for Animals passed out leaflets decrying what one member called a "foolish, 
dangerous . . . publicity stunt" by fair organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pati Chamberlain, wearing a T-shirt that read "Meat Stinks for the 
Environment, for the Animals, for Your Health" and describing herself as an 
animal rights activist, disagreed with the organization, of which she is not a 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely Americana," she said. "This is how the West was won." 
</P>

THE STRAIGHT POOP: LAGUNA GETS DROP ON PET OWNERS; LAW: IT WILL CONSIDER 
REGULATION FORBIDDING ANIMAL OWNERS FROM LEAVING HOME WITHOUT A CONTAINER TO 
DISPOSE OF EXCREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pet owners here soon may have a new rule to live by: Walk a dog, tote a 
Baggie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach City Council on Tuesday will consider a law that would forbid 
dog walkers from leaving home without a container for animal waste. 
</P>
<P>
 City law already requires that owners clean up after their pets "in a sanitary 
matter," but Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said dog excrement continues to 
litter parks, beaches and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem," Purcell said, "and people are just tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 When confronted, lax pet owners often say they are not equipped to retrieve 
the waste, said Purcell, who is proposing the tougher law. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just kind of look around and say, 'I haven't got anything to pick it up 
with,' " he said. "If there's an ordinance that requires people to carry 
something when they have their dog in a public area, they will be more likely 
to pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said he even has had to riffle through the trash to find a container 
to tidy up after his shar-pei, Mei Ling. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded law would make it illegal to walk an animal without also toting 
"a suitable wrapper, bag or container." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the tougher law need not be a weighty burden for pet owners, Purcell 
said, because some disposal bags now come tucked in dainty, powder-scented 
plastic capsules barely an inch long. Plastic wrap or resealable bags may also 
do the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be something you can pick up or scoop up (with) other than your 
personal clothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tougher law clears the first hurdle Tuesday, it will be returned to the 
City Council for final approval, probably on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it passes, animal control officers will not stop dog walkers simply to 
check for containers, Purcell said. But if the officer has a "lawful reason" to 
detain a pet owner, such as seeing a dog off a leash, the officer may ask if 
the owner is properly outfitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the ordinance would be a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we don't have to write any citations," Purcell said. "It's just 
one more tool in the toolbox, if you will, to get people to voluntarily 
comply." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said flyers probably will be distributed about any change in the law, 
and animal control officers would give warnings before issuing citations for 
the first few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Any pet-related regulations tend to raise hackles in Laguna Beach, the only 
city in Orange County that set aside a park for dogs only. The fenced "Bark 
Park" along Laguna Canyon Road is the only place in town where dogs can legally 
romp unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Further showing the city's concern for animals, Purcell said Friday he had 
just signed a purchase order to buy a drinking fountain for the dog park with 
bi-level spigots so "masters and doggies can drink at the same time."

KILLER OF GIRLFRIEND GIVEN 30 YEARS TO LIFE; COURTS: A TEARFUL RICHARD NUNNO, 
21, PLEADS FOR LENIENCY IN KILLING THEN-16-YEAR-OLD SWEETHEART, SAYING HE HAS 
FOUND GOD. BUT JUDGE IS UNCONVINCED, ADDING FIVE YEARS TO TERM FOR USE OF GUN.

 Judy Austin remembers wearing a pretty flowered dress with an antique lace 
collar when she learned her 16-year-old daughter was shot twice in the heart by 
an obsessive boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 She forced herself to wear the dress for the first time since then on Friday 
as Richard K. Nunno was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for murdering 
Melissa Austin on June 13, 1993. The girl had told Nunno she no longer wanted 
to date him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives have been shattered beyond description," Judy Austin said as she 
struggled to hold back her tears during Friday's sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Austin, Melissa's father, also wept as he recalled the popular sophomore 
at Mission Viejo High School, who was just beginning to consider careers and 
dreamed of owning a convertible. Austin smiled as he acknowledged that his 
daughter aspired to win a letter in soccer in part because she considered the 
jackets "cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see my daughter graduate from high school and college," he told 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon. "I wanted to see 
her grow into a young woman and have a happy life. That vile, satanic felon 
ended those dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno's first-degree-murder conviction carried a mandatory 25-years-to-life 
sentence. On Friday, the judge turned away Nunno's last-minute plea for 
leniency. Weatherspoon exercised his discretion by adding a maximum five-year 
penalty for using a gun -- saying he could not imagine more "aggravated" 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno, who contends he killed Austin when their murder-suicide pact went awry, 
asked the judge for mercy just moments before he was sentenced. He said he had 
found God and planned to begin a ministry in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a good kid," he said. "I wish all of this had never happened."  
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's hearing, tears sprang to his eyes while he recalled his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno, now 21, had turned a gun on himself after shooting Melissa Austin. He 
told the court he tried to kill himself again in jail but God stopped him and 
said: "You are my child. I would like you to be my servant." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't save Melissa's life, but now I want to save others'," Nunno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy and Michael Austin forbade their daughter to date Nunno because they 
considered him too old for her. They also believed Nunno, who was 20 at the 
time, was a bad influence who coerced their daughter to sneak off to be with 
him, to run away from home and even break into cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of her youth and innocence she could not know what kind of a man he 
was," Judy Austin told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But during his trial, Nunno had cast the pair as a modern-day Romeo and 
Juliet, star-crossed lovers who decided to die together rather than live apart. 
When Melissa Austin tried to back out of the murder-suicide pact, Nunno 
testified he "flipped" and shot her. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled the crime scene and shot himself in the chest, but the wound was not 
fatal. He left behind a suicide note for the Austins: "(Expletive) you Mr. and 
Mrs. Austin, you ruined my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde P. Von Der Ahe had argued at trial last month that 
Nunno killed Austin because he refused to let her break off their relationship, 
and said there was evidence that Melissa had begun dating a boy her own age. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender E. Robert Goss Jr. had argued the killing was done in 
passion and was not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors disagreed and convicted Nunno of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Nunno had several convictions as a juvenile, 
including for petty theft, making threatening phone calls to a teacher and 
starting a fire in a house. 
</P>
<P>
 As Judy Austin left the courthouse Friday, she said she will never again wear 
the flowered dress -- it's too painful a reminder of her loss. Mike Austin said 
he would fight any future attempts to parole Nunno, but said his case holds 
powerful lessons for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love them every single day of the week," he said, adding that he and Melissa 
exchanged hugs, kisses and said "I love you" the day before she died. "Hold 
them close every day of the week."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL WILL REVIEW CITY BUDGET TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Council members will review the city's $37.3-million budget with department 
heads in an all-day session today. 
</P>
<P>
 The city projects deficits of $406,000 in the general fund and $654,000 in the 
water fund, Finance Director Greg Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not suggesting any cuts, but we're also not adding any new programs," 
he said. "We're trying to maintain services at their present levels." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will begin at 8 a.m. in the council chambers at 6650 Beach Blvd., 
and will run for most of the day, Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the negotiations with city employees are ongoing and the budget 
may have to be amended. Budget projections call for no pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien attributed some of the deficits to a slight decrease in revenue for 
the general fund, which is down by just under $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds will be taken out of the city's reserve, which now totals about $3.1 
million, Beaubien said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; HISTORICAL BUILDINGS MAY BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With three history-rich buildings -- including the old Fahrenheit 451 
bookstore -- threatened with demolition, city officials and Heritage Committee 
members will meet at the beachfront property Monday to try and determine if the 
buildings can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The land was purchased recently by Wyland, an artist who 13 years ago painted 
the adjacent "Whaling Wall," a large retaining wall that faces the Hotel 
Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 The property includes two dilapidated cottages built in 1902 that were part of 
the original settlement at Main Beach. Wyland, who said he paid $825,000 for 
the property, intends to build a home and studio at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning commissioners have said they would like the existing structures 
to be used in the redevelopment. But Jim Conrad, Wyland's architect, said the 
structures should be razed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buildings are in such poor condition, it will be impossible to renovate 
them," he said. "It would be crazy, it's just totally impossible. They are 
termite-ridden, dry-rotted, falling apart structures." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ann Larson, the city's liaison to the Heritage Committee, said it would be 
possible to reconstruct the building "board-by-board." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Laguna Beach Historical Society spoke on behalf of the old 
bookstore at the last Planning Commission meeting, asking that the tiny 
two-story building, once the site of the city's most popular book depository, 
be recognized for its historic value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, city workers and history buffs will try to determine whether the 
buildings can be rehabilitated and made safe. A study has already determined 
that the bluff-top property is sliding, Larson said. He said another option 
might be to move the buildings to another location. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad said neither option is realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go inside the buildings and let them take a real good look at 
them," he said. "All the buildings at the site are in terrible condition." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Wyland would like to see preserved is the retaining wall alongside 
his property. The 28-by-165-foot wall is covered with a mural he completed on 
his 21st birthday. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POLICE DETAIN WRONG MAN IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after a Household Bank branch was robbed Friday afternoon, a police 
officer spotted a man matching the description of the suspect. Thinking he had 
his man, the officer detained him at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out it was the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Lt. Jeff Cope said of the man, 
who just happened to be walking in the area of Beach Boulevard and Garfield 
Avenue about the same time as the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that a good citizen got exposed to something like this, but 
he was very cooperative," Cope said. "He has been eliminated as a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began shortly after 3 p.m. when a man walked into the bank in the 
19000 block of Beach Boulevard and handed a teller a note demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man said he was armed and the teller gave him money," Cope said. "The 
suspect then left the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer who was across the street saw a man he thought was the robber 
and detained him, Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank robber was described as white, 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, with light 
brown, short hair. He was wearing a striped button-down shirt over a white 
T-shirt, blue jeans and a white baseball cap, Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber remained at large. There were no injuries during the holdup. GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STUDENTS GET BRIEF LINK WITH SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Kline School got a lesson in perseverance and the sometimes 
capricious nature of technology Friday when their experimental linkup with the 
Space Shuttle Columbia dissolved into static. 
</P>
<P>
 The students briefly achieved two-way radio contact with the shuttle via an 
elaborate satellite "telebridge" that involved ground-control stations in Costa 
Mesa, Hawaii, Chicago and at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The fragile 
radio link was broken when Hawaii lost contact with Columbia shortly after 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
 K.D. (Doug) Borcoman, an amateur radio enthusiast who initiated the 
experiment, said it was "a little bit disappointing" when the conversation with 
astronaut Donald A. Thomas was cut short. But Borcoman was heartened that the 
students will get another chance on Tuesday morning to ask Thomas about life in 
outer space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to persevere," said Borcoman, a philosophy logic instructor at 
Rancho Santiago College and the parent of a student at Kline School. "They'll 
schedule us for a really good orbit next time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said radio contact failed because the Columbia was too low on the horizon 
in relation to the control station in Hawaii and because an antenna on the 
shuttle was pointed in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider the complexity of this, there are so many things that can 
go wrong," said Borcoman, a 43-year-old Newport Beach resident. "We'll try it 
again. I think everybody's having a good time participating." 
</P>
<P>
 During the brief contact between the students and the space shuttle, Thomas 
thanked the youths for sending him a T-shirt they designed for the SAREX 
(Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment) program. 
</P>
<P>
 Then student Blake Maxwell, a 9-year-old from Newport Beach, donned a headset 
and asked Thomas about temperature conditions inside the Columbia. There was no 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really pumped up," Maxwell said about trying to make contact with 
Thomas, a mission specialist. "I really want to find out the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Kline, a private school with 45 students ages 5 through 12, was the only 
school in California, and one of only 13 worldwide, that was given permission 
to link up with the astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kline applied for the SAREX program 14 months ago. For the past eight weeks, 
students have been learning about space flight and high-tech communications. 
They went on a guided tour of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where 
they watched Columbia's blast off on a huge TV screen July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle is on a two-week mission to study the development of aquatic 
animals and cells. 
</P>
<P>
 When the students attempt to contact Columbia next week, they will be ready 
with some highly technical questions about genetic mapping of nematodes; 
swimming patterns of goldfish lacking gravity-sensing inner ear organs; and 
growth rates of plant seedlings in a weightless environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio contact with Columbia will coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 
Apollo 11 moon landing mission. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; WATER DISTRICT PLAN APPROVED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeowners association has lost the first round in a legal battle over the 
proposed construction of water district administrative offices in what 
opponents say is a pristine, backwoods meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein ruled this week that the Trabuco Canyon 
Water District can move forward with a two-building complex that nearby 
residents say is too extravagant and ruins the natural beauty of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans for the center include a workout room and a 500-square-foot office 
for district General Manager Fred Sims, who will also have a tiled shower and 
bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed at the ruling," said Don Chadd, president of the 
660-home Trabuco Highlands Homeowners Assn. "You shake your head that this kind 
of thing can go on." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' group tried to get an injunction against the proposed office 
complex. They contended that the district improperly gave notice of a public 
hearing on the issue and argued that the project isn't allowed under specific 
plans filed with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadd said the association plans to appeal Goldstein's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials were "pleased Judge Goldstein has ruled that the water 
district followed the proper procedures in gaining all necessary approvals to 
build the Operational Control Center," said Charles Wall, president of the 
Trabuco Canyon Water District board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall disagreed with Chadd's characterization of the offices as opulent.

 "The shower is for when (Sims) has to work overnight to establish service for 
the district during an emergency," he said. "There's nothing excessive about 
that building. We're not ashamed to create a good environment for our 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 As for complaints about the administrative offices bringing too much traffic 
into the wooded area, Wall said many recreational enthusiasts already use the 
open space. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BEACH BOULEVARD WIDENING TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A section of Beach Boulevard will be narrowed to four lanes beginning Monday 
while construction crews widen the street and add turn lanes to help smooth 
traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction between the San Diego Freeway and Ellis Avenue is expected to 
take about four months, said Dave Webb, the city's associate civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the $2.8-million project is completed, Beach Boulevard will have four 
lanes in each direction and synchronized traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory is to have it possible for drivers to get a green light 
continuously along Beach," Webb said. "We're also trying to inject 
technological advances like a device on top of the lights that emergency 
vehicles can trip for all green lights." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is discussing with the Orange County Transportation Authority how to 
keep buses that usually stop on the shoulder from holding up traffic and ways 
to prevent the construction from affecting bus schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-turn pockets will be added at major intersections, including where Beach 
Boulevard meets Warner Avenue, so cars waiting to make a right turn do not back 
up. Additional left-turn lanes also will be installed at some intersections to 
relieve congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach Boulevard is a six-lane street with a shoulder on either side. In the 
widening, both the shoulders and on-street parking will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said that the street, which is "riddled with trenches and potholes," will 
be repaved using a rubberized asphalt. The rubberized asphalt, which contains 
recycled tires, will cut down on street noise and last longer than other paving 
materials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that drivers heading for the beach from the San Diego Freeway use 
Golden West or Magnolia streets as alternative routes during the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Other good cross-town routes are Gothard and Newland streets. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY OKS BLUFFS PLAN, SCRAPS PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Improvements to the bluffs on the coastal side of Pacific Coast Highway 
between Golden West and 9th streets were approved this week by the California 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners scrapped a plan to build a parking lot below the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 246-space parking lot was planned along an abandoned oil access road, next 
to the beach. Building the parking spaces against the bluffs was opposed by 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who is a member of the Coastal Commission, 
voted Thursday to delete the parking lot from the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reason was that it would change the character of the beach forever," 
Moulton Patterson said. "I'm not convinced that we absolutely need the 
parking." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson and other City Council members approved a coastal 
development permit in February to build the parking lot as well as the park 
improvements on top of the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said the council's vote in favor of the parking lot was to 
ensure public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after studying it, public access is definitely being achieved, and it was 
not worth it to me to change the character of the beach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements on top of the bluffs include building separate paths to 
accommodate pedestrians and cyclists, installing new lighting, constructing a 
new retaining wall and putting in landscaping, said Ron Hagan,city community 
services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said that because the parking lot will not be built, permanent restrooms 
and concessions also planned for the base of the bluff won't be constructed. 
Portable toilets will continue to be used, he said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY, POLICE UNION TALKS HIT IMPASSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Contract negotiations between the city and the Huntington Beach Police 
Officers Assn. are at an impasse, with the city refusing the union's demand for 
a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salary is the only issue at hand," said Senior Officer Richard Wright, 
president of the 244-member police union, which represents 85% of the Police 
Department's personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract at issue is for 1993-94. The last contract expired in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Franz, deputy city administrator, said the city has not provided salary 
increases for any employees this year. He said the city has agreed to bring in 
a state mediator to resolve the police contract dispute and declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said police officers have not had a raise since October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has not negotiated in good faith," he said. "The city has not given 
their negotiators any latitude on salary (increases) whatsoever. None. We've 
sat at the table and wasted time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said officers are frustrated that the city will not budge on giving 
either a salary increase or a pay bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're basically taking it as a slap in the face. Here we have a 
city who applauds their policemen for being such professional policemen and for 
being part of the best agency in the United States. And they refuse to 
compensate them," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN ARRESTED IN KILLING, ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Luis Moreno and his wife were robbed at knifepoint of $12 and car keys 
Thursday night, he didn't call the police -- he called his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tragic decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair tracked the alleged thief to a Santa Ana fast-food restaurant. But in 
the fight that ensued, 23-year-old Hector Moreno was fatally stabbed in the 
chest and Luis Moreno was slashed on the arms. By Friday, the suspect was in 
custody and being treated at a Santa Ana hospital for cuts sustained in the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided to take justice into their own hands and lost," said police Sgt. 
Dick Faust. "I wish the guy would have called the police first." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Pena, 21, of Santa Ana, was arrested at Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana Friday afternoon on suspicion of murder and robbery, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Moreno, 25, was treated and released from the same hospital on Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Pena held up Luis Moreno and his wife Bertha in a supermarket 
parking lot on Grand Avenue about 8:15 p.m., then fled on his bicycle. He made 
no attempt to steal the couple's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno telephoned his brother for help chasing the thief, police said, and the 
pair confronted him a block away outside a fast-food restaurant on 17th Street. 
During the resulting fight, Pena stabbed Hector Moreno in the chest, killing 
him, and slashed Luis Moreno several times on the upper arms, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police used dogs to hunt for Pena and found him a block away hiding in bushes, 
Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the weapon, a five-inch paring knife, was found several hours 
later.KEN ELLINGWOOD

 Moviegoers at Cinemapolis this summer can catch the film debut of 22 children 
from Sierra Vista Elementary School in Placentia along with the previews for 
the season's blockbuster movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The children will be featured in a 45-second segment produced by the 
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District with the help of Disneyland's 
Arts Partnership Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The second- and third-graders are depicted turning off lights, a television 
and water faucets while singing a rap-style song called "Turn it Off." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do a public service announcement with an environmental message," 
said district spokeswoman Karen Bass. "Sierra Vista had put on a play about the 
environment for their parents so we used that as the basis for the trailer." 
</P>
<P>
 The action was taped last month in the school's multipurpose room. It took 
about six hours, Bass said. Many pupils were excited about the taping, and by 
the time it was over they had learned about many aspects of the film business. 
"It was a wonderful experience for the kids," said Bass, who organized the 
taping. "By the end of the day they didn't think it was such a glamorous job 
(to be an actor), and some of them ended up being more interested in the 
cameramen's job and other behind-the-scenes aspects of filming." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinemapolis agreed to show the film clip if it was professionally produced. 
Bass asked Jill Bolton, manager of Disneyland education programs, if the park's 
experts could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the 90-minute video of the (Sierra Vista) program and picked out one 
song that was the most lively," Bolton said. "We used the same students and the 
same backdrop, but the rest of it was scripted and staged by our production 
manager."  
</P>
<P>
 Bolton said the joint effort is the first film production for the Arts 
Partnership since it was formed in October. The program was created to 
supplement visual and performing arts curriculums in schools. It includes 
grants to teachers and art lessons created by Disneyland artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn it Off" will be screened in all 13 theaters at Cinemapolis as well as in 
the lobby. Cinemapolis is at 5635 E. La Palma.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RED CROSS WORRIED OVER BLOOD SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Red Cross officials are urging healthy people to donate blood to offset an 
unusually early summer blood shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide shortage is especially worrisome in Southern California because 
blood has to be imported here from throughout the country during normal times. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless donors step forward, the blood supply may fall below emergency levels, 
forcing patients to delay elective surgeries, said spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, blood shortages are rare before Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 This year blood supplies have been chronically low in part because severe 
weather in the midwest and eastern portions of the country during the winter 
hampered blood collection efforts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, about half of the people who schedule appointments to donate 
blood fail to show up. If all the people who scheduled appointments followed 
through, the crisis would be over, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential donors should call (800) 974-2113 to make an appointment. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOLS RATIFY FEE ACCORD WITH CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District board this week approved an agreement 
that requires the city to pay the district $67,719 for using school facilities 
for city-sponsored and nonprofit youth programs, classes, activities and sports 
league games. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be spent on repairs and maintenance to school buildings and 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea City Council members earlier this month unanimously approved the 
agreement, which also requires the city to pay the costs of electricity used to 
light Brea Olinda High School by recreational groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement brings an end to a longtime debate on whether to charge the 
town's youth groups for using district facilities, said board member Frank 
Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is recoup some of our costs" of maintaining the 
school grounds and fields, he said, adding that the city's money will not cover 
all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the coming year at least, Davies said the city's recreational groups 
will not be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement "is a compromise between the district and the city so as to 
support all the youths in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the city will be required to pay the fee, which is expected to 
increase.MIMI KO

<P>
 Three Orange County charities that help child abuse victims will receive 
proceeds from a benefit golf tournament at Tustin Ranch Golf Course on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The "$100,000 Tee Off Against Child Abuse" will support ARK, Services for 
Abused Children; Child or Parental Emergency Services (COPES); and Family 
Services of Orange County.The three charities are considering a merger, 
according to Monica Milstead, ARK's community relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange-based ARK provides free counseling, tutoring, social activities and 
other services for abused children placed in foster homes by the county. The 
agency also matches the children with adult volunteers in a program similar to 
"big brothers/big sisters" and arranges monitored visits between the children 
and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 COPES operates group homes for abused children in Santa Ana, Tustin and 
Orange. Family Services, with offices in Laguna Hills and Fullerton, offers 
crisis counseling for families and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the golf tournament is $150 per person, which includes green 
fees, a continental breakfast, gifts and an awards luncheon. A $100,000 cash 
prize will be presented if a golfer makes a hole-in-one on the 17th hole. Other 
prizes include a cruise of the Bahamas, a golf weekend, and round-trip airline 
tickets.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; DISTRICT OKS PLANS FOR CHARTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District board has approved Santiago Middle School's 
application to become the county's first charter school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 6-0 vote Thursday, with one trustee absent, the board endorsed the plan, 
which will release the school from district control and exempt it from 
virtually all provisions of the state education code, beginning in September, 
1995. The move is an attempt to allow parents, teachers and staff to create a 
new school outside the restrictions imposed by state and local control. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 62 other charter schools in California, all created after new 
legislation was passed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Santiago Principal Mary Ann Owsley emphasized that the school 
will remain in close touch with district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not see ourselves as operating in a vacuum," Owsley said. "I want to 
personally guarantee that communication will be first-class." 
</P>
<P>
 David Reger, president of the Orange Unified Education Assn., and Becky 
Mayers, president of the local chapter of the California School Employees 
Assn., said their labor unions backed the plan. But Mayers said her union wants 
more discussion on the charter's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not our position to oppose or support it," Reger said when the board 
asked him to comment. The union's job is to explain the issues to the teachers 
and to work on their behalf with the school, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the charter mandates parental involvement in the school, Owsley said 
the school will draft a list of ways for parents to earn "points" by 
volunteering for various tasks. The list contains some 40 choices.  
</P>
<P>
 A greater role for parents was one of the main reasons Santiago sought the 
charter, along with greater flexibility to deal with budgets, teaching methods 
and class size, Owsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and the 877 students at the school will be required to sign attendance 
contracts before the 1995-96 school year. Owsley said she and her staff have 
heard "zero concern" from parents to date but acknowledged that not every 
parent is aware of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a handful have participated up to the birth of the charter," parent 
Terri Sargeant said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; LAW WOULD BAN FREE LUNCHES, OTHER GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members moved to put an end to gratis lunches and other freebies 
with the introduction this week of a gift ban for all city officials and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban would take effect Oct. 1 if adopted, as expected, at the council's 
July 26 meeting. Under its terms, council members and employees would be able 
to accept up to $5 worth of coffee, doughnuts or wine, but will have to pay 
entrance fees to events such as Chamber of Commerce mixers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance takes its definition of gift from the state's Political Reform 
Act, which considers a gift to be anything of value not offered to the general 
public, said activist Shirley Grindle, an Orange resident who drafted the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists and those doing business with the city could not take officials out 
to lunch or dinner, pay for trips or memberships to clubs, or for functions 
that charge the general public for entry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptions to the ban are "informational material," such as books and 
calendars, gifts from immediate family members, reported campaign contributions 
and personalized plaques or trophies worth less than $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials may also enter charitable or educational events free of charge and 
accept flowers, plants and balloons as long as one source does not give more 
than $50 worth of these gifts during the course of the year. They must return 
other gifts or donate them to charity without claiming a charitable tax 
deduction, according to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said she patterned the ordinance on the gift ban adopted last year by 
the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said some businesspeople in the city were concerned 
about the repercussions of the law, which could lead to misdemeanor charges if 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong possibility that we'll be giving a negative message to the 
business community if we don't explain what we're doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz proposed adding a preamble to the ordinance noting that the law was not 
drafted in "an accusatory way." But other council members refused to delay the 
vote until a preamble could be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Robert O. Franks said he would explain the law to city employees 
and the council agreed to prepare an explanatory package to go with copies of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle explained what she had in mind when City Manager David F. Dixon 
brought up the example of a reception business leaders gave him when he was 
first appointed to office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what this ordinance is set to stop," Grindle said. "That's what 
disenfranchises the public out there because they can't hold receptions for 
you. This is about the wining and dining of city officials."LESLEY WRIGHT

EX-TEACHER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO CHILD MOLESTATION CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former junior high school home economics teacher pleaded no contest to one 
felony count of child molestation involving a 14-year-old student and was 
sentenced to three years probation, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her sentence, Michelle Lynn Smith, 36, of Orange, was ordered to 
stay away from the boy and ordered to register as a sex offender, according to 
court documents.She was also ordered to pay restitution of $200. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing in North Municipal Court Wednesday before Judge Stephen J. 
Sundvold, Smith relinquished her teaching credential and resigned from Kraemer 
Junior High School, where she had taught for 13 years, Placentia police 
spokeswoman Corinne Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a defendant does not admit guilt when entering a no contest 
plea, but declines to fight the charges. The plea, however, is considered the 
same as a guilty plea for the purposes of sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Kenneth L. Schreiber, refused comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is married and the mother of three young children, was arrested in 
February and initially charged with eight counts of child molestation, which 
allegedly occurred with the one victim over the course of a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police arrested Smith just after midnight on Feb. 26 after receiving 
an anonymous phone call involving "possibly suspicious" activity in a parked 
car on a city street. Officers found Smith and the boy inside the car, police 
said.

JUSTICE LAUDS COURTHOUSE IN SANTA ANA; SPEECH: SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR SAYS REAGAN 
NAME IS APPROPRIATE FOR PLANNED STRUCTURE, CITES HIS IMPACT ON JUDICIARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told a gathering here Friday night 
that "it is high time you get a federal courthouse in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before the Orange County Bar Assn. at Le Meridian Hotel, O'Connor 
also said it was appropriate to name the future federal courthouse after former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "A president's legacy is shaped to a great extend by his appointment of 
federal judges," said O'Connor, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by 
Reagan in 1981. "It has been more than five years since President Reagan has 
left office, but his impact (on the judiciary) is still being felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of Orange County's new 10-story, $123-million Ronald Reagan 
Federal Building and United States Courthouse is expected to begin in December. 
The completion of the courthouse's first phase is expected to be sometime in 
spring, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also is expected to boost the local economy, including an 
estimated 600 construction jobs and 600 permanent jobs, and accommodate an 
increasing Southern California caseload. Orange County, along with Los Angeles 
and five other counties, is part of the most populous federal judicial district 
in the country -- the Central District of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Orange County cases have overwhelmed the Santa Ana Federal Building 
and a temporary structure on Santa Ana Boulevard and many must be shifted to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building will be in downtown Santa Ana, southeast of Santa Ana's Civic 
Center on a city-donated, four-acre site bordered by 4th and 5th streets and 
Broadway and Ross streets.

TUSTIN TO CONSIDER ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to stiffen controls on smoking in public places is among the items 
scheduled for consideration by the City Council when it meets at 7 p.m. Monday. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The revised anti-smoking ordinance, which was suggested by Councilwoman Tracy 
Worley, would prohibit smoking in any facility owned, operated or leased by the 
city.In addition, retail sales and retail service establishments would be 
included in the places where nonsmoking areas must be designated. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance does not call for substantial changes regarding smoking in 
restaurants. Under current city law, restaurants are required to set aside 
nonsmoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to come before the council is a proposal intended to discourage 
public officials from accepting gifts from people doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would set a limit of $250 on the value of gifts given to any city 
official in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Atty. Lois E. Jeffrey said the proposed ordinance is similar to 
legal restrictions applying to state officials.

IRVINE TO WEIGH LAND ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year after the idea was first suggested, city officials are slowly 
moving toward a consensus on whether to annex 37 square miles of unincorporated 
land that lies in the city's sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly undeveloped land is located at the northeast edge of the city. 
Proponents argue that annexing the area will give the city more control over 
development and bring added fees and tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning officials are now preparing a report that will list several 
annexation options, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Attempting to annex all of the sphere at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Annexing chunks of unincorporated land as individual developments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Annexing just selected portions of the sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Halting all annexation activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to explore the issue later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Barry J. Hammond suggested that special attention be paid to the 
unincorporated lands near the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The base is 
slated for redevelopment -- possibly as a commercial airport -- when the 
Marines move out at the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexing land around the base would give the city more development control 
over the base as well as what is built near it. If the base is converted into 
an air cargo facility, planners expect the surrounding land will become prime 
real estate for commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's interest in annexing the unincorporated land dates back to 1992, 
during the controversy over the Northwood 5 development. It was poised to annex 
the Northwood 5 land and approve a 2,800-home project when slow-growth 
advocates demanded that the issue be placed before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy prompted the Irvine Co. to halt annexation plans and instead 
develop the project through the county. As a result, the city lost $8 million 
in development and construction fees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said that much of the county land would be 
slated for residential housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Any annexation proposal would need approval from the Local Agency Formation 
Commission. The city and county would also have to agree on how to divide 
future tax revenues. Irvine Expansion Irvine officials are eyeing as many as 37 
square miles of unincorporated land on the city's fringes for possible 
annexation. The mostly undeveloped land lies within Irvine's "sphere of 
influence" but is controlled by the county.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; BY SACCHI'S DECREE; PLAYERS, PRESS AND PUBLIC 
WERE SLOW TO ACCEPT VISIONARY COACH'S MERCURIAL STYLE, BUT HE HAS WON THEIR 
RESPECT AND NOW ALL OF ITALY IS ALONG FOR THE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you focus on the ballet of 22 well-shod Italian feet in the Rose Bowl on 
Sunday, spare a thought for the man to whose tune they dance. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Coach Arrigo Sacchi, and it is easy to find him, for he sports a 
gleaming pate with a fringe of hair that is white before its time. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the end of the Italian bench closest to midfield. Sacchi wears 
lime-green sweat pants, a light blue shirt, sunglasses and a chess player's 
mask of total concentration. But he is never still. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy plays to Sacchi's visionary beat. Reluctantly sometimes, imperfectly 
often. But loyally. Always. As Pope of the Italian team playing for an 
unprecedented fourth Cup title, Arrigo Sacchi is more ayatollah. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi is 48, a small-town boy from the Romagna region of central Italy who 
gladly swapped selling shoes for coaching soccer 18 years ago. He climbed 
quickly, making AC Milan, a billionaire's toy, the best club on Earth. Then he 
left because it was not challenge enough.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed new motivations as a coach." says Sacchi (pronounced Sa- key.) 
</P>
<P>
 In countries like Italy and Brazil, where seasons, governments and people come 
and go but soccer is eternal, the post of national-team coach is a crucible for 
which there is no real American parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most difficult profession," analyst Gianni Rivera says. 
</P>
<P>
 It also can become an excruciating burden when the ball bounces wrong. Sacchi 
knows. Harvesting some of the world's premier soccer talent and wrapping it 
around a veteran corps of AC Milan stars, Sacchi was nevertheless slow to bring 
the results that Italians are weaned to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi demands a new style of play: total soccer based on midfield pressing, 
zone defense and quick moves. Run, run, run. He tried out more than 70 players 
and demanded a convert's commitment from the team he eventually selected and 
dictatorially commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "My schemes are demanding and players must be in their best condition to 
accomplish them," he says. But in the heat of an American summer, even the 
superbly prepared Italians have been unable to sustain Sacchi's game for a full 
90 minutes. They sag in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi sometimes seems to be seeking a perfection that only he understands. He 
brought 22 players to the Cup and thus far has played 20, an extraordinary 
feat, considering only three substitutions, including the goalkeeper, are 
permitted a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most predictable thing about Sacchi is that he will be unpredictable," 
says commentator and former Italian star Giorgio Chinaglia. "He's always 
thinking. He's also very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi hails from the close-to-the-earth town of Fusignano (pop. 8,000) where, 
La Voce of Milan reports, two cloves of local garlic sit atop every television 
set during Italy's games. The garlic is a portafortuna, or talisman, whose 
origin is lost to history but important to Sacchi and his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Sacchi has changed his lineup every game, the newspaper Tuttosport 
says he "changes not just for the whim of changing but in accordance with the 
situation . . . the adversaries and the physical conditions of the players. He 
seems to have broken through the old strategy of having 11 players and 11 
reserves. He has 22 players." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Antonio Matarrese head of the Italian Soccer Federation, "From him you 
can expect everything and the opposite of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi is a classic one-game-at-a-time coach. Focus, focus, focus, he demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think you have won is when you lose," he told reporters during 
preparation for Wednesday's semifinal with Bulgaria. "You must keep dedication 
and concentration. Every team should do what it does best and this can be 
achieved by controlling the tempo of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi brought his newfangled ideas to work with him in 1991. But until late 
in the tournament, the Sacchi System never quite ignited. Italy limped into the 
Cup and staggered through the first round, a third place also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Press and public screamed for his scalp. The charge: unnecessarily 
complicating a simple game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sacchi is now poised between sainthood and a lynching," said a smiling 
Chinaglia as he watched Italy last-gasp past Spain in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sacchi never blinks. Affably, almost offhandedly, he outflanks blindsiding 
reporters, artfully turning aside criticism and nasty questions of the sort 
that sometimes leave his Brazilian counterpart Carlos Alberto Parreira 
red-faced with anger and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Cup progressed, Sacchi's Italy labored on. There are prima donnas on 
the Italian team, and bullies, and workmen earning a day's wage, and a magician 
or two. But they are all consummate professionals. With the final at hand, one 
'94 Cup lesson is plain: Money on the table, pride on the line, Italy finds a 
way to win. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not always Sacchi's way, but it has been enough to earn him applause 
from fans and barbed-tongued sportswriters who demanded his ouster less than 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Resurrection of Arrigo," proclaimed one headline as Italy marched 
triumphantly toward California.  
</P>
<P>
 "Goodby misfortune, catcalls, resentment, Sacchism and anti-Sacchism," wrote 
Gianfranco Teotino in Corriere della Serra as Italy assumed an accustomed place 
in the final four. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi leaves nothing to chance, thinking, planning, organizing, instructing, 
demanding. Italy took the field against Spain arrayed more exactly than any 
Roman cohort, but within a minute of the opening whistle there was Sacchi, 
repositioning a midfielder with loud calls and broad gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half against Bulgaria when one of his defenders missed a pass, 
Sacchi came surging a few reflexive paces toward the ball as it neared the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a like a puppet master, pulling the invisible strings" of players who 
have been sometimes too tired to respond, notes Italian observer Vittorio 
Zuconi. 
</P>
<P>
 You look tired, a reporter told Sacchi minutes after the sapping semifinal 
victory against Bulgaria.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking of the final," Sacchi replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this an easier game than some of the others? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. They're all exhausting." 
</P>
<P>
 Are the players more relaxed now?  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not. I like them tense." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi himself emerges at game's end looking as physically and mentally 
drained as his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "By now they are no longer games but wars," Sacchi had observed as Italy 
advanced deeper into must-win competition. 
</P>
<P>
 An apt metaphor, for the Italian press, having long ridiculed him as Custer, 
has now reincarnated Arrigo Sacchi as Patton. But he's not listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to settling accounts at the end of competitions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His strategist's eye, far-sweeping like Napoleon's, fine-sighted like 
Wellington's, is focused precisely now, seeing only Pasadenaloo.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; ANALYSIS; FINAL FOUR A BLEND OF FAMILIAR, 
UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY A. KISSINGER and ANTHONY DAY, Henry Kissinger is the unpaid honorary 
chairman of World Cup USA 1994. Anthony Day is Los Angeles Times senior 
correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A month of competition has sorted out the two best teams in the World Cup. 
Italy and Brazil are three-time champions, and both are very reluctant to give 
up goals. They offer vastly contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to the final was different than what most experts had predicted. When 
the Cup moves into sudden death, the essential qualities of the teams become 
more decisive. These represent an amalgam of strategy, technical skill and 
psychological endurance. Usually, the semifinalists are established soccer 
powers with a long history. Thus in Italy in 1990, the semifinalists were 
England, Germany, Italy and Argentina -- each of which had won the World Cup 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The current composition broke this pattern. Italy and Brazil are familiar, but 
Sweden had not gone this far since 1958 and had won little before or since, and 
Bulgaria -- which qualified only at the last minute in what was wrongly 
considered a freak victory over France -- had never before won a World Cup 
game. All this shows that soccer is in a state of transition and that the 
tactics of European soccer especially might be changing to put greater emphasis 
on sudden thrusts. Teams not encumbered by previous successes may be free to 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason might be technical: The draw pitted many established powers 
against each other in the quarterfinals, leaving several spots open for 
outsiders. For example, the Brazil-Netherlands game involved teams capable of 
winning the Cup. For Brazil, it was the "beautiful game," led by Romario and 
Bebeto, that Brazil invented and that others either envy or try to imitate, the 
game of intricate, controlled passing and fluid, constant attack. Romario made 
one goal, Bebeto a second, and Branco a 28-yard free kick through the Dutch 
wall that clinched the game in the 81st minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands, which plays the most attractive game in Europe from the 
spectator's point of view, has a fascinating Cup history. It lost to Germany by 
one goal in the final in 1974, lost to Argentina in overtime in 1978 and lost 
to Germany again by one goal in the round of 16 in 1990. Its excellent players 
seem to lack the ultimate cohesion and discipline required for final success -- 
though they put on a terrific show while they last. This year, of the three 
Brazilian goals, one was caused by an egregious defensive error, another 
because the Dutch defenders seemed oblivious to the new interpretation of the 
offside rule, whereby players not participating in the flow of the game are not 
considered offside. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy-Spain was also a contest between established soccer powers. Italy has 
been described as a lucky team, and in truth it had two narrow escapes -- 
against Nigeria in the 89th minute and against Spain in the 88th. On the other 
hand, it cannot be an accident that Italy has given up only five goals in six 
games -- never more than one a game. You do not see many teams with such a 
percentage.  
</P>
<P>
 Italy does not score many goals -- five of its eight are the work of its great 
Roberto Baggio, who oscillates between brilliance and somnolence. The Italians 
are masters, however, at throwing the opponent off its game, inviting mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what happened to Spain. Until the Italy match, Spain had emphasized 
defense; against Italy it stressed offense -- especially in the second half, 
most of which took place in front of the Italian goal to such an extent that it 
seemed only a matter of time until the dam would break and Spain would prevail. 
Instead Italy suddenly launched a counterattack, scoring the decisive goal in 
the 88th minute on a marvelous dribble by Baggio against a Spanish defense that 
had moved too far upfield.  
</P>
<P>
 In the New Jersey Meadowlands, perennial champion Germany played upstart 
Bulgaria. The German team had been touted before the Cup as a favorite, along 
with Brazil. But it never managed a convincing game. The only time the Germans 
looked like champions was in the first half against Belgium and South Korea. 
The team was too old and too lacking in coherence and perhaps commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The tired and uninspired defending champions fell to a fast and furious attack 
by the little-heralded Bulgarians, 2-1. The Germans' lone goal came on a 
penalty kick by Lothar Matthaeus. The Germans did everything right but they had 
neither imagination nor flair. The Bulgarians looked much more focused and also 
much faster. Hristo Stoitchkov tied the score with a terrific free kick in the 
76th minute and three minutes later Yordan Letchkov's header cinched the 
biggest upset of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Germans had some excuses. For a moment in the 73rd minute the 
Germans thought they had a second goal, but two of their players were ruled 
offside, apparently correctly, in a complex interpretation best left to 
theological scholars. (The point was the same as the day before in the 
Brazil-Netherlands game -- whether the player concerned, this time Rudi 
Voeller, was involved in the original pass toward the goal.) The gentlemanly 
Germans did not complain. And in truth the Germans should not have cut it so 
fine and would not have, had they had another choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinal between Sweden and Romania brought together unseeded teams 
that were never expected to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had made it the hard way: Romania had won a rousing game over Argentina; 
Sweden had overcome Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately the styles of the teams did not 
make for a great match -- at least until the 79th minute. Both teams dropped 
back, above all concerned about preventing the opponent from scoring. Sweden 
played, as usual, stolidly and conservatively. Romania was waiting for Sweden 
to make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sweden made few attempts to assail Romania's defenses but offered no 
vulnerability, the game was about as interesting as watching a cat waiting for 
its prey. The cat finally pounced when Sweden's Tomas Brolin took a pass on a 
free kick and scored 11 minutes before the end of regulation time. Ten minutes 
later, Florin Raducioiu scored for Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven minutes into overtime Raducioiu scored again. Fourteen minutes later 
Kennet Andersson tied it for Sweden. A war of attrition had turned into a 
free-for-all.  
</P>
<P>
 The exhausted teams stumbled into penalty kicks, which, as the whole world 
knows, Sweden took 5-4 on two brilliant saves by goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals left little room for abstract speculation. Italy defeated 
Bulgaria in a stunning display of precision soccer in a game close enough so 
that a lot of glory was left for doughty Bulgaria. Italy's first half was the 
best of any team in the tournament: cool, precision passing and masterful 
finishing by Baggio.  
</P>
<P>
 Brazil against Sweden was much more one-sided. Brazil attacked incessantly. It 
had 26 shots on goal to Sweden's three. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it took Brazil until the 81st minute to score. It was curiously 
indecisive in completing its flamboyant maneuvers. Romario stumbled when in the 
clear; he seemed to want to dribble the ball into the goal; on another 
occasion, a Swedish defender rescued an out-of-position Ravelli on the goal 
line; Rai and Bebeto missed from close range. If Baggio is able to play, 
Brazil, for all the joy its style supplies, might not be able to defeat the 
tough, disciplined, cerebral Italians, who do just manage to win and seem to 
improve with each game.

WATSON TURNS BACK CLOCK WITH A 65 TO TAKE THE LEAD; GOLF: HE IS SEEKING TO END 
43-TOURNAMENT DROUGHT IN MAJORS, WIN SIXTH BRITISH OPEN. FAXON AND SWEDEN'S 
PARNEVIK ARE TIED FOR SECOND.

 The Tom Watson Time Warp Invitational (a.k.a. the 123rd British Open) advances 
to its third day with our hero hitting sic-'em shots at the Ailsa Course 
flagsticks as if it were 1977, not 1994. If he plays any younger, he will have 
peach fuzz. And if he plays any better, he will be puffing on a victory cigar a 
few nights from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson continued to flirt with Open history Friday as he moved into the 
second-round lead with a near-flawless five-under 65, which gave him a two-day 
total of 133, one shot ahead of Sweden's Jesper Parnevik and fellow American 
Brad Faxon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bad for a 44-year-old has-been, is it?" said Watson, who last won a 
tour event in 1987 and hasn't won a major tournament in his last 43 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the British Open, his pride and joy, the tournament he has won 
five times. If Watson can hold onto the lead, he will tie Harry Vardon's record 
for most Open victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have an Open championship under my belt," said Watson, who scored 
his last major victory in 1983 at Royal Birkdale. "I'd just like to have any 
championship under my belt." 
</P>
<P>
 At 135 is defending PGA champion Nick Price, followed at 136 by first-round 
leader Greg Turner, Frank Nobilo, Jonathan Lomas and David Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Watson's favor is this: Of the 21 players on the leader board Friday, only 
five -- Watson, Price, Fuzzy Zoeller, Greg Norman and Ernie Els -- have won 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel I can win," Watson said. "At the beginning of the year, I said 
it's not a matter of if I'll win, but when I'll win. My prediction hasn't held 
true, but maybe it will this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson had chances at the last two U.S. Opens, the PGA in 1993, the Players 
Championship in 1992, the Masters in 1990, the British in 1989, 1987 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 This time is different. At least, that's the word from Watson's support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "His putting is great," said Bruce Edwards, his longtime caddie. "It's just a 
matter now of reading the putts. That's the way it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can do this for two more days, we can really give it a go." 
</P>
<P>
 If it happens, Watson might want to send a percentage of the winnings to Lee 
Trevino, who provided the putting tip that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last several years, Trevino has watched his best friend stab at short 
putts. Together with Watson for six days on a pre-British Open husband-wife 
trip to Ireland, Trevino half-ordered his friend to change his stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 So Watson changed, but it took a while before he became a believer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday night, which happened to be his 21st wedding anniversary, Watson 
finished dinner with his wife, Linda, and the Trevinos and retired to the hotel 
putting green, where he practiced for nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he was making putts from everywhere," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Wednesday at Turnberry, during a practice round with Jack Nicklaus, Greg 
Norman and Nick Price, Watson sank more putts. And he did so again Thursday, 
when he shot a first-round 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Watson wasn't completely convinced. Then he talked to Trevino on 
Thursday evening. Trevino read him the putting riot act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, just trust it," Trevino told him. "What you were doing before wasn't 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a 65. So confident is Watson that when he birdied the 452-yard 
par-four Friday (driver, wedge, 10-footer), he turned to someone and said, "I'm 
going to make these bookies quiver now." 
</P>
<P>
 He is. He was 50-1 on Wednesday, 3-1 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnevik and Faxon had their moments, too. The Swede had a four-under 66 and 
did it with Jack Nicklaus in his threesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Nicklaus, whose 145 missed the cut by two strokes, was asked if he 
had any advice for Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need to give him any," he said. "I need some advice from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon, who is making his first appearance at Turnberry, started the day four 
shots off the lead, but his 65 Friday changed that. Not only will he remember 
the 65, but he will remember who he shot it with: Gary Player, making his 40th 
visit to the British. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that as a kid I putted with four balls, called them Nicklaus, 
Watson, Player and myself," Faxon said. "I spent hours putting at night, hoping 
to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Three down, one to go. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the one left, Watson, likes his chances. He isn't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me," said Trevino, who didn't make the cut, "if he putts likes he's 
been putting, you might be looking at a six-time champion."

DODGERS BEAT JACKSON TO SPLIT; BASEBALL: THEY DEFEAT THE PHILLIES, 3-2, DENYING 
THE LEFT-HANDER HIS 12TH VICTORY, AFTER LOSING THE FIRST GAME, 4-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Shortly after the Phillie Phanatic crushed a Dodger helmet while doing a dance 
and Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda responded by throwing a baseball at the mascot, 
the Dodger offense came to life, proving that you never know what it is going 
to take to win a ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told that guy (the Phanatic) that I don't want him to do anything to 
destroy Dodger property," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored two runs on four hits and a sacrifice fly in that sixth 
inning, giving them an eventual 3-2 victory and a split of a doubleheader 
against the Philadelphia Phillies before 58,247 at Veterans Stadium on Friday 
night. The Phillies won the first game, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers beat a dominating left-hander, Danny Jackson (11-4), who gave up 
10 hits before leaving after seven innings. The Dodgers got only five hits in 
the first game, three against left-hander David West (4-7). 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been more satisfying to beat the Phillies in both games, 
obviously, but we did it against one of the best pitchers in the league -- this 
is big for us, " Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger starter Tom Candiotti (7-4) gave up four  
</P>
<P>
 hits in six innings, but began to tire in the heat and humidity and was 
replaced by Ismael Valdes, who had pitched a scoreless inning in the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes walked leadoff batter Kevin Stocker, but struck out Mariano Duncan, 
stranding Stocker at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to pitch, " Valdes said. "I would be there to help the team. It's 
why we are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell pitched the final two innings for his eighth save, retiring six 
of seven. The one who got away was pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich, who hit a solo 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing both games would have been a disastrous start to the Dodgers' longest 
trip of the season, and especially at a time when the San Francisco Giants, 
with the help of Darryl Strawberry, have won six games in a row to move to six 
games behind the Dodgers in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked dismal after the first game, which began before a crowd of about 
500 who braved stifling heat and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so hot that the Delaware River mud the umpires rub on new baseballs was 
dripping from the balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the umpire's pocket where he keeps the balls, and it was soaking 
wet," said Gross (7-6), who took the loss in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "So (David) West and I were out there on the mound rubbing the mud off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger offense, however, remained cold, except for Wallach, who went three 
for seven over both games with one run batted in and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Bournigal hit a two-run double in the first game and Raul Mondesi went 
two for four and scored two runs in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we have one of those teams where when one guy is out, they all 
go out," batting coach Reggie Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on things and hopefully will ride through this, but it is 
unique. Usually one man can carry a club and we have guys who can in (Mike) 
Piazza, Wallach and (Eric) Karros. But they seem to be tied together . . . when 
one is hot, they all are and when one is not hitting well, the others seem to 
be in the same boat."

ORIOLES ROLL OVER ANGELS; BASEBALL: FERNANDEZ EARNS SECOND VICTORY OF SEASON 
AGAINST CALIFORNIA AS BALTIMORE ROMPS, 9-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Against the rest of the league, Sid Fernandez is just another veteran pitcher 
making a lot of money with a well-directed mixture of not-so-fast fastball, 
decent curveball and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Angels, he's Hall-of-Fame material. 
</P>
<P>
 The rotund left-hander brought a 5-4 record and a less-than-awesome 4.96 
earned-run average to the mound Friday night and immediately went into his 
Sandy Koufax impersonation. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Angels faced him, tbey managed only three hits in 8 1/3 
innings. Heck, they really must have had him figured out that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at Anaheim Stadium, the Angels couldn't muster a hit until J.T. 
Snow lined a double to left with one out in the fifth inning as the Orioles 
rolled to a 9-2 victory in front of 18,886. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 16-27 at home and 15 games below .500 overall. Maybe they were 
still mourning the loss of beloved coach Jimmie Reese, whose memorial service 
was attended by the entire team Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Fernandez just has the stuff to render their offense completely 
listless. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, who earned his first victory of the season in a 6-4 decision at 
Anaheim on April 28, had the Angels totally befuddled and bedazzled this time 
around. He gave up a two-run homer to Bo Jackson in the seventh inning, but he 
probably cooled off a bit while sitting on the bench for almost 30 minutes and 
watching his teammates put together their second three-run inning of the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he just lost interest. Pitching against the Angels is hardly a challenge 
for him. Angel batters, who got four hits in seven innings against him Friday, 
are 11 for 74 against Fernandez since he came over to the American League after 
10 seasons with the New York Mets and one with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich, making his fourth start since returning from a stint on the 
disabled list because of an inflamed lower leg, had averaged seven innings and 
three earned runs in the first three outings after coming back to the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost two of those games, but still elicited praise from Manager Marcel 
Lachemann as "a staff saver." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich allowed the first batter he faced, center fielder Brady Anderson, to 
score and gave up five runs in 5 2/3 innings. And when the Orioles got to the 
Angels' bullpen, the game really got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore roughed up Joe Magrane for three runs in the seventh and picked up 
another against Mike Butcher, who was optioned to triple-A Vancouver after the 
game, in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles scored a run in the first when Anderson tripled down the 
right-field line and scored on Rafael Palmeiro's sacrifice fly to right. It was 
the 13th first-inning run given up by Leftwich in 16 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez struck out two Angels in the first, two in the second and two in the 
fourth and had retired 12 in a row when Snow broke up his no-hit bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez retired five more Angels in a row before Chili Davis led off the 
seventh with a single to right and Bo Jackson followed with a towering 441-foot 
shot into the bleachers in right-center. It was Jackson's first homer since 
June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore took a 4-0 lead in the fifth inning. Jeffrey Hammonds led off with a 
walk and stole second. He took third on Mark McLemore's slow roller to third 
and scored when Anderson's high pop fly to right managed to fall between second 
baseman Damion Easley and right fielder Tim Salmon. And then Chris Sabo 
deposited Leftwich's 1-0 delivery over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammonds' run-scoring double in the sixth inning chased Leftwich and Lachemann 
opted for Magrane, who was making only the fifth relief appearance of his 
career. It didn't last too long. By the time he had retired two Orioles, 
Baltimore led, 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson singled to lead off the seventh, Sabo walked, Palmiero doubled in one 
run, Cal Ripken Jr. singled home another, and Palmiero scored on Harold Baines' 
groundout.

 THIRD-PLACE GAME at Rose Bowl 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria vs. Sweden 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 12:30 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: In his quest for the "Golden Boot," Hristo Stoitchkov needs to 
sneak a few shots past goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, the hero of Sweden's 
penalty-kick victory over Romania and one of the few Swedes who held his own 
against Brazil. Ravelli, with a goals-against average of 1.26, also might be 
facing off against Bulgarian goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov (1.11), probably the 
only keeper standing between the Swede and the Lev Yashin Award for 
tournament's best goalkeeper. Of course, much will depend on how long Ravelli 
and others play. Both coaches figure to clear the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely forward Martin Dahlin will play because of a leg injury that 
forced him out of the Brazil match. Henrik Larsson probably will start in his 
place. Midfielder Jonas Thern and defender Roger Ljung will sit out because of 
suspensions. Stefan Schwarz, returning from a suspension, will step in for 
Thern. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: This is Sweden's chance to partially redeem itself for setting 
soccer back 20 years with its mindless defensive strategy against Brazil. It's 
a shame, because the Swedes have more to offer offensively with such talents as 
forwards Dahlin and Kennet Andersson to go with Tomas Brolin, the ever-hustling 
midfielder. That this kind of firepower should be choked, almost by coach's 
mandate, to three shots against Brazil will be the albatross Coach Tommy 
Svensson carries away from an otherwise successful tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 As one soccer scribe noted of Bulgaria, "No team has ever had to travel so far 
for a seemingly meaningless third-place game playoff." The Bulgarians have been 
full of surprises in this tournament after losing their opener to Nigeria. 
Regardless of today's outcome, they return home champions. Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev has equated his team's success to the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, do you think Bulgaria fears Sweden? 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Betting against Bulgaria has not been wise in the tournament, but 
there are factors pointing to a Swedish victory. The Bulgarians had to play 
their semifinal in New Jersey on Wednesday, then fly west. The team's upset of 
Germany already had left the Bulgarians partied-out and exhausted. This could 
be where it all catches up. If this turns into a game of bench warmers, Sweden 
has some talented players in reserve, notably midfielder Stefan Rehn, who 
entered Wednesday's match late and gave Brazil a scare with a rare shot at 
Claudio Taffarel. Sweden wins. CHRIS DUFRESNE

JAPAN ALREADY PUSHING HARD FOR 2002 BID; SOCCER: FORMER ENGLAND PLAYER CHARLTON 
LENDS SUPPORT. SOUTH KOREA IS MAIN COMPETITION.

<P>
 World Cup '94 has two games left. World Cup '98 is only a glimmer in France's 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't view the 8 a.m. news conference Friday called by World Cup Japan 
2002 as premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee to bring the event to Japan is four years old, has enlisted the 
former president of Nissan as its chairman and Friday produced two Diet members 
-- Japanese congressmen -- to sit in silent solidarity with Japanese soccer 
officials before the world's press. 
</P>
<P>
 The political and industrial clout of the Japanese was on display because, to 
some extent, the Japanese, who have never qualified for the event, are behind 
their primary competition for the 2002 Cup, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they say, they are gaining ground quickly. Fifteen Japanese cities -- not 
including Tokyo -- are already building new stadiums in anticipation of the 
2002 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA wants the tournament in Asia, and when it is awarded in 1996 by FIFA's 
executive committee Japan or South Korea will get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Asia's time," said Bobby Charlton, one of two former British soccer 
players to be knighted and under contract as an adviser to World Cup Japan 
2002. "South America has had it, now North America, and Europe again will have 
it in 1998."  
</P>
<P>
 Charlton said Saudi Arabia might compete for the Cup and that a possible 
Colombian bid might be in the works. But newcomers to the 2002 race would be 
hopelessly behind the Asian nations, and although FIFA eventually wants to see 
the World Cup in Africa, the growth of the sport in the Far East makes the 2002 
competition a two-horse race. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA wants soccer to be the world's game, and I think the feeling is that the 
time is right to go to Asia," he said. "After that, the time likely will be 
right to go to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is that it be done right, that Asia put on a good show. And, 
certainly, I think the Japanese are most capable of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the population, they have the finances and they have the ability to 
mobilize on such a scale." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese certainly have the bullet trains and airlines to zip from site to 
site and the communications systems to handle any press crush imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 What they don't have is Chung Mong-Joon, the president of the Korean Football 
Assn. and the recently elected vice president of FIFA, a position with 
considerable sway over who gets the Cup and who does not. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has qualified for the World Cup four times, including the last 
three. Japan has yet to make it. And South Korea is coming off the glow of the 
1988 Olympics, staged without incident in the shadow of a hostile North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chung writes in the bid literature, if Korea gets the Cup, "it will no 
doubt contribute greatly to reunifying South and North Korea. . . . This, I 
believe, will be a way to uphold the spirit of the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 But as 15 Japanese cities build stadiums, South Korea is still looking for 15 
cities for what will be a 32-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charlton: "The number of cities and breadth of (Japan) is perfectly 
suited for the 32-team format. A lot of countries really don't have enough 
major cities to host the event. I would think that would be Korea's primary 
problem."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; SOMEONE MAY GET CONSOLATION TODAY; THIRD PLACE: 
BULGARIA, SWEDEN HOPE TO AVOID ENDING SUCCESSFUL MONTH ON A LOSING STREAK.

 College basketball dumped its consolation game in 1982. The NFL red-carded its 
"Playoff Bowl" between Western and Eastern Conference also-rans in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 (Die-hards will recall the Rams' resounding 31-0 victory over Dallas in the 
last Playoff Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the battle for bragging rights -- 'We're No. 3!" -- continues in the 
World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, at 12:30, Sweden and Bulgaria will meet at the Rose Bowl in a 
consolation game almost devoid of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, semifinal loser to Brazil, and Bulgaria, loser against Italy, already 
have exceeded World Cup expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, today's losers return home, presumably as heroes, on the heels of 
consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the point? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are often asked that question," Andreas Herren, a FIFA official, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no financial incentive to win the consolation match. FIFA doles out 
prize money based on games played, and both Sweden and Bulgaria were guaranteed 
seven by advancing to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can rest assured the players' clubs, which have much larger financial 
stakes, cannot be thrilled having them exposed to potential injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel a third match to determine the bronze team is an opportunity 
for the team to entertain spectators," Herren said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA President Joao Havelange said the third-place playoff would remain a 
feature of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a competition of this magnitude it is important to have a third place. It 
is an honor to be third and that warrants a match." 
</P>
<P>
 Because enormous World Cup pressures have been lifted, Herren reminds that 
consolation matches are often entertaining. He mentioned France's 4-2 victory 
over Belgium in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only hope. Wound tighter than a steel drum against Brazil, Sweden 
managed only three shots Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure to win is not as high as in the finals," Herren said. "The teams 
are more relaxed. The players can be free of thoughts, and the coaches can give 
some players benched so far some playing time." 
</P>
<P>
 And, every now and then, crops up the occasional angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoitchkov will be in pursuit of the "Golden 
Boot," awarded the player who scores the most goals in World Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
 With six goals, Stoitchkov is tied with Russia's Oleg Salenko, who scored his 
six goals in three games -- five against Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the hunt for the "Golden Boot" are Brazil's Romario and Italy's 
Roberto Baggio, each of whom has scored five goals. 
</P>
<P>
 They square off in a slightly more important match Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing only 2-1, Stoitchkov left the semifinal game against 
Italy in the 79th minute, complaining of a slight leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, however, Stoitchkov is apparently fit as a fiddle and itching 
to claim the scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels fine and will play," Bulgarian Coach Dimitar Penev said. "He wants 
to become the leading scorer." 
</P>
<P>
 For the privilege of playing in today's consolation, the Bulgarians only had 
to fly cross-country from New York after a tough loss on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the honor was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has approached FIFA about changing the regulations," Herren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't underestimate the commitment of the players. They're all pros and 
want to win."

4 BRAZILIANS NAMED TO CUP ALL-STAR TEAM; SOCCER: CHOICE OF BELGIUM'S 
PREUD'HOMME OVER SWEDEN'S RAVELLI AS GOALKEEPER IS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE. LALAS 
GETS HONORABLE MENTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Four Brazilians -- defenders Jorginho and Marcio Santos, midfielder Dunga and 
forward Romario -- were named to the World Cup '94 all-star team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy and Bulgaria each have two players on the team selected for the first 
time by FIFA, soccer's world governing body. Italian defender Paolo Maldini 
joined forward Roberto Baggio, considered by many the tournament's top player. 
Forward Hristo Stoitchkov and midfielder Krasimir Balakov were the Bulgarians 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme and midfielders Gheorghe Hagi of Romania 
and Sweden's Tomas Brolin round out the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine players drew honorable mention, among them American defender Alexi Lalas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas, not regarded among the tournament's elite before the competition, got 
high marks for attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "His fighting spirit," said Jurg Nepfer, a FIFA coordinator who sat on the 
six-member all-star panel. "And he is an idol for American youth. He is very 
popular and that must be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, what distinguishes defenders is their fighting spirit. He might not 
be technically the most skillful, but when you consider his stamina and spirit 
he is among the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Nepfer discounted the notion that Lalas was a public-relations nod to the home 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we would discuss defenders, Lalas would be one of the first names 
mentioned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lalas' mention was a coup for the Americans -- Lalas, Argentina's 
Fernando Redondo and Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini were the only players honored 
from teams that failed to make it to the quarterfinals -- the relegation of 
several players to honorable mention was surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Juergen Klinsmann, the Netherlands' Dennis Bergkamp, Brazil's Bebeto 
and Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli all might have expected all-star status, 
but it was the choice of Preud'homme over Ravelli -- the hero of a quarterfinal 
shootout with Romania -- that raised the most eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 But selection-panel member Walter Gagg said none of the goalkeeping had been 
spectacular.  
</P>
<P>
 "This World Cup has shown us that we have very high levels of tactical play, 
and very weak goalkeeping. We saw this particularly in the first-round 
matches," Gagg said. "Perhaps that is due to a lack of concentration."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; BRAZILIANS ALREADY GETTING A SNIFF OF THE BIG 
GAME; SOCCER: KEY PLAYERS ARE SOUND AND EVERYONE IS CALM BEFORE SHOWDOWN 
AGAINST ITALY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 One person who was not complaining about the air quality in Southern 
California on Friday was Brazil assistant coach Mario Zagalo. After he left the 
team's practice at Cal State Fullerton, he said the only thing he sensed in the 
atmosphere was "the smell of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 With apologies to those members of the Brazilian press corps who seem 
personally offended that the team has not won every game by six goals, the 
people who matter most, the coaches and the players, are finding very little to 
complain about as they prepare for Sunday's World Cup final at the Rose Bowl 
against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Italy is fretting about injuries to two players, forward Roberto Baggio 
and midfielder Roberto Donadoni, Brazil has not had a player hurt since the 
68th minute of the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 While Italy has lost two players to suspension, defenders Mauro Tassotti and 
Alessandro Costacurta, Brazil has lost only defender Leonardo, and the man who 
replaced him, Branco, has proved more than capable. He scored the winning goal 
in the quarterfinals against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 While Italy had to fly from New York to Los Angeles after its semifinal 
victory Wednesday, Brazil had only to ride a bus back to Fullerton from 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reasons, Brazil's most interested observer, Leonardo, described the 
team's mood Friday as "optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Calm," goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relaxed, confident, determined," Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Brazilian media might report it differently, Brazil has virtually 
cruised to the final in comparison to Italy.  
</P>
<P>
 There was potential for controversy after the first round when Parreira 
benched his playmaker, Rai. The coach said later that Rai was "naturally 
unhappy," but the midfielder, who also is the captain, put team unity first and 
has not publicly objected. 
</P>
<P>
 As for injuries, Brazil's medical staff might as well be spending its days at 
Disneyland. The team lost one central defender, Ricardo Gomes, before the 
tournament with a hamstring injury and the other, Ricardo Rocha, with a groin 
pull in the second half of the opening game. But their replacements, Aldair and 
Marcio Santos, have been outstanding. Santos was named to FIFA's 11-man 
all-tournament team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defender, left back Leonardo, was sent to the sideline for the 
remainder of the tournament by FIFA after he fractured U.S. midfielder Tab 
Ramos' skull with an elbow in Brazil's 1-0 second-round victory. Parreira was 
under pressure from some in the media to replace him with the daring Cafu. But 
the coach opted for caution with Branco, who not only is a solid defender but 
also, as the Dutch discovered, a dangerous free kick specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's defense, suspect when the tournament began, has been so effective at 
interrupting attacks -- on those rare occasions when opponents chose to attack 
-- that Taffarel has hardly been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Could that be a concern for Brazil, Taffarel's readiness if Italy tests him? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Parreira said. "In the moment we need him, I am confident he will say, 
'Hello, I'm here.' "

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; ITALY MIGHT BE LEFT HAMSTRUNG BY INJURIES TO 
BAGGIO, DONADONI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Injuries might leave the Italian team without the services of midfielder 
Roberto Donadoni and star forward Roberto Baggio in the World Cup championship 
game Sunday at the Rose Bowl. Each has a hamstring problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither player practiced Friday and the team doctor said fatigue, heat and 
travel had aggravated what might otherwise have been nothing more than nagging 
injuries and have left the two players questionable for the game against 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Other injuries, to Franco Baresi and Alberigo Evani, combined with the 
suspensions of defenders Mauro Tassotti and Alessandro Costacurta -- have 
severely narrowed Coach Arrigo Sacchi's options. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt, we are struggling with a number of problems, including Brazil's 
strength," Sacchi said Friday. "But I am very confident because my players have 
evidenced a great determination and winning spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how Sacchi painted it, though, the situation appears grim. Baggio 
injured his right hamstring in Wednesday's semifinal and left the game. 
Afterward, he needed assistance to get down from a platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Baggio, if even for a half, would be a potentially deadly blow to 
the team. He has scored five of Italy's eight goals and has provided the 
inspiration when Italy has fallen behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio said Friday he felt twinges of pain, but, like most athletes, figured 
he could play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not hurt when I walk," he said. "But I can feel it when I flex the 
muscle. . . . I'm confident, I hope I can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi refused to speculate on the availability of Baggio. "It's a decision 
that could be taken at the last minute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baggio is one of the greatest players -- there are few players who can be 
compared to him. It would be a bad blow for us if he cannot play. Others will 
have to engage harder to make up for his absence if he does not recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Donadoni's problem is in his left hamstring. Team doctor Andrea Ferretti said 
the problem showed up after Wednesday's game and the team's long flight from 
New Jersey made it difficult to immediately assess the seriousness of the 
injury.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; HUNGARIAN TO REFEREE THE FINAL; SOCCER: SANDOR 
PUHL GETS THE HONOR AFTER WORKING ITALY-SPAIN QUARTERFINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Potentially, the best thing about Sunday's World Cup final, from an official's 
standpoint, is that Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl will be forgotten by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is always the worst-case scenario: Disaster might strike and 
he could join the rueful duo of Edgardo Codesal Mendez of Mexico and Ali Ben 
Naceur of Tunisia in the World Cup referee's wing in the Hall of Dishonor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was heavily criticized for his officiating in the 1990 World Cup final, 
in which he red-carded two Argentines, and Ben Naceur was derided for failing 
to see Maradona's "hand of God" goal in the 1986 quarterfinal game between 
Argentina and England. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's Puhl. He was plucked out of a pool of 24 candidates to officiate 
Sunday's final between Italy and Brazil at the Rose Bowl, it was announced 
Friday by the referees committee of FIFA, soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 For Puhl, who turned 39 on Thursday, the assignment was like a late birthday 
present. For the chosen few, even being at the World Cup is the pinnacle of an 
officiating career.  
</P>
<P>
 To be the referee in a championship game can't even be compared to working a 
Super Bowl, according to American referee Arturo A. Angeles, an engineer who 
lives in Temple City and worked in the World Cup's early play. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it is more than that," Angeles said. "You figure how many World Cups have 
there been and how many have been the referee for the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the ultimate for a referee. There's the opening game of the World Cup 
and then there's the final." 
</P>
<P>
 Puhl had not refereed in a World Cup before this tournament. He began working 
on the international scene as a linesman in October, 1988, and moved to 
refereeing in 1989. He has worked in European Cup matches, UEFA Cup 
competitions and World Cup qualifying matches. 
</P>
<P>
 In 19 matches of refereeing before the World Cup, Puhl listed a February, 
1993, friendly between Argentina and Denmark at Mar del Plata as his most 
difficult to work and an October, 1993, World Cup qualifying game between 
Argentina and Australia at Sydney as the most important. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's worked major matches in different parts of the world and has an 
outstanding record, as far as the reports we've been given," said David H. 
Will, chairman of FIFA's referee committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, of course, at the end of the day, there's his performance here at the 
World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Puhl worked three first-round games -- one involving Brazil -- and already has 
weathered a controversy from the Italy-Spain quarterfinal match. Late in the 
match, he missed an elbow thrown by Italian Mauro Tassotti that broke the nose 
of Luis Enrique of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no call on the play, but FIFA reviewed the incident and fined 
Tassotti $16,000 and suspended him. 
</P>
<P>
 But FIFA did not blame Puhl for missing the call because the foul was 
committed off the ball and the officials had turned their attention to another 
part of the field to follow the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The linesmen for the final will be Venancio Zarate Vazquez of Paraguay and 
Mohammed Fanaei of Iran.

 Third-place games rarely generate much interest, and it doesn't help when the 
competing teams do little to spur the imagination.Italia '90 at least had the 
host team and a recognized power in England to draw interest. But Sweden and 
Bulgaria? 
</P>
<P>
 So how tough a sell have been tickets to today's game? Enough so that anyone 
purchasing an adult admission to SoccerFest on Friday at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center and expressing an interest in attending was given a free 
ticket. That's the same ticket that was selling for $60 a week ago and had been 
listed as sold out in advertisements the last few days. VAN NIGHTINGALE

 Sabino Molinar, 18, will visit Jefferson High today to present the soccer team 
there with new uniforms and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabino is a high school senior from Albuquerque, originally from Chihuahua, 
Mexico, who recently won an essay-writing contest sponsored by the National 
Assn. of Bilingual Education. 
</P>
<P>
 His prize included not only a $5,000 scholarship and a computer, but a chance 
to be a World Cup "Junior News Team" reporter at the first and final stages of 
the tournament. He arrived Thursday in Los Angeles with his high school teacher 
and chaperon, Robert Cineros, for this weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to Orlando, to Washington -- a wonderful trip," said Sabino, who 
has lived in this country for five years and will enroll at the University of 
New Mexico this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I will never forget is the big celebration after the 
Mexico-Ireland game. I saw Irish and Mexican people singing and dancing 
together in the streets. No fighting. All friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a wonderful trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Except earlier in the week, while Sabino was still in Washington, the trip was 
interrupted when he received a telephone call. His best friend, Jose, had 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 He hurriedly made arrangements, with help from Junior News Team sponsors from 
Coca-Cola and World Cup. But his plane sat on a runway at Washington National 
and was unable to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got to Albuquerque at 10 o'clock in the morning and went straight 
from the airport to the cemetery," Sabino said. "He was like a brother to me 
and I got there just in time to say goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabino flew directly to Los Angeles. He will write articles on his experiences 
that will appear in a number of bilingual publications, sponsored by the 
National Hispanic Newspaper Assn., including the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Which will be won by . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil," he said. "Don't you think?" MIKE DOWNEY

 The mystery involving Bulgarian translators continues. At the Rose Bowl on 
Friday, Coach Dimitar Penev was asked to update the media on an injury to 
midfielder Daniel Borimirov. 
</P>

 Through translator Svetla Gosteva-Ivanova of the Bulgarian Football Union, it 
was understood that Borimirov was injured at Thursday's practice and would sit 
out today's third-place game against Sweden.

 The rest of her answer had the scientific community jumping.

 This World Cup is having a bigger effect on countries' politics than any 
previous World Cup. . . . This World Cup is more serious. For a start, there 
are more TV sets in the world today than there were even four years ago.The 
tournament is attracting vast audiences. The average human -- a Chinese 
peasant, Essex Man, Alexander Solzhenitsyn -- will probably have watched six 
World Cup games by the end of Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwandans root for Nigeria, Bangladeshis for Maradona, and no doubt the Eskimos 
have their favorite team. . . . Ethnic tension rises, and rulers look to the 
World Cup to foster unity.

<P>
 In Italy, where soccer is perhaps the least tarnished national institution of 
the moment, Silvio Berlusconi got himself elected prime minister with a party 
named after a football chant. 
</P>

 In Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, presidents have appeared on TV during the 
World Cup to suggest changes to the national team's lineup. Even in Norway, 
Prime Minister Gro Brundtland appeared on a TV panel commenting on the 
country's opening game.

 Some of the nicknames given Brazil's players are understandable -- Bebeto

 Nobody knows what Dunga means, or what a Dunga is, other than a fine 
midfielder on the Brazilian team. But Francisco Marcos, the team's liaison, 
thinks the name will become part of the Portuguese language.

 In discussing the future of professional soccer in America, The Guardian 
commented: "Soccer's problem, when it comes to U.S. TV, is that it has no 
pauses for commercials, although ABC has neatly sidestepped this handicap by 
inserting a bar into the screen's upper left hand corner on which is placed a 
clock with an ever-changing advertising logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "At regular intervals throughout the match, announcers say: 'This portion of 
the game is being brought to you commercial-free by Coca-Cola.' Who else 
besides Americans could devise a commercial message congratulating the sponsor 
for abstaining from advertising?"

 "This is my fifth World Cup. I always go as something different," said 
Andrade, who went to Mexico in 1986 dressed as a parakeet. "They wouldn't let

 Why would anyone wear a hot, heavy costume dotted with the green and yellow of

 After (the semifinal) was over, the Swedish coach, Thomas Svensson, stoically 
declared that he was disappointed with the day, but pleased that Sweden had 
achieved this much. 
</P>
<P>
 Achieved? It ill becomes an Englishman to find fault with a World Cup 
semifinalist.But what was the point of playing an entire semifinal on the 
retreat? What semblance of sport is there in collecting a side simply to try to 
keep the score down to respectability? 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, we have seen, knew how to attack Brazil, and had done so admirably for 
half an hour in the claustrophobic Pontiac Silverdome during the first week of 
the competition. Maybe, like everyone here, they had grown weary in the 
ferocious heat, the sapping demands of a tournament played in such an alien 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Swedish homeland, a restaurant in Malmo had rustled up trade by 
offering customers a free beer for every goal Sweden scored. There were parched 
tongues.

 Despite the moaning of soccer widows, football can be a relationship saver. 
During the last World Cup, I was living in Italy and on the verge of breaking 
up with my boyfriend.We were sitting in a restaurant, with the Italy-Ireland 
quarterfinal playing in the background. "It's over then," I had just said, when 
(Salvatore) Schillaci scored the only goal. In the excitement our conversation 
was forgotten and we stayed together for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 We were truly reconciled, however, a few days after the restaurant when we 
were sitting in the stands at the England-Cameroon match in Naples. My 
boyfriend said something hurtful to me, my eyes filled with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then Cameroon was awarded a penalty. Turning to me for a reaction, he saw 
me weeping and concluded that it was out of trepidation at England's prospects. 
"She really cares," he boasted to friends for months to come. "You should have 
seen her face when she thought England was going to lose." I never told him 
what the real problem was.

COBB'S AWARD REDUCED $1 MILLION IN RULING BY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Drake ruled Friday that a 
$2.1-million jury award June 6 to former USC assistant athletic director Marvin 
Cobb should be reduced to $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in response to a motion by USC's attorneys to correct the 
verdict, based on an incorrect form submitted to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury had awarded Cobb $1.1 million in economic losses stemming from his 
breach of contract suit against the USC athletic department, and an additional 
$1 million in non-economic losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake overturned the non-economic losses award. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb said he was disappointed at the decision, but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware that the defense had made a mistake on the jury form and that 
this might happen," he said. "It's disappointing but very, very small, in 
truth, to the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that the school had failed to give Cobb a promised promotion 
after two years of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer representing USC, said 
the verdict form submitted to the jury contained a line allowing Cobb damages 
for non-economic losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under well-settled law in California, an employee is not entitled to recover 
non-economic losses for the breach of an employment contract," Cochran said. "I 
am pleased the judge agreed that justice demanded that he strike the award for 
non-economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our next step will be to file a motion to overturn the remainder of the 
damage awarded." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on a charge that USC had racially discriminated against 
Cobb, and a retrial is set for Oct. 3, Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb is still employed by USC in an administrative role at USC's Health 
Science campus. MATT WHITE

TOWNSEND EXPECTED TO BE TRADED; RAIDERS: MOST LIKELY DESTINATION FOR 
32-YEAR-OLD DEFENSIVE END IS PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Raider veterans reported to training camp Friday, defensive end Greg 
Townsend was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked him not to report," Coach Art Shell said. "We're working on a trade. 
Something will happen, hopefully by Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely destination for Townsend, 32, is Philadelphia. The Raiders are 
believed to be asking for draft choices from the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two factors combined to make Townsend expendable:  
</P>
<P>
 -- His salary. The 11-year veteran is scheduled to make $1.5 million this 
season. With the Raiders bumping up against the salary cap, they have told 
Townsend they don't want to pay him much more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His competition. The Raiders signed free-agent lineman Jerry Ball in the 
off-season and re-signed Scott Davis on Thursday, ending a two-year retirement 
by the Raider lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Tom Rathman felt frustrated sitting out half of last season because 
of a dislocated right shoulder, the first injury of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman, an eight-year veteran of the San Francisco 49ers, felt even more 
frustrated when he learned that if he stayed with the 49ers, he was going to 
have to share playing time this season with Marc Logan and rookie William 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Rathman's frustration turned to elation when he signed a two-year, 
$1.2-million contract with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman had found a new home, the Raiders a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers have obviously given up on him," Shell said. "But we feel he can 
still play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always liked him as a player. He's a very versatile guy. He can catch 
the ball, he's an excellent blocker, he can run and pass-protect. You get a 
chance to get a guy like that, you have to take the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old Rathman, a 6-foot-1, 230-pounder, rushed, received and 
returned kickoffs for 4,392 yards and scored 34 touchdowns for San Francisco. 
He played in two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I would have played for the 49ers," Rathman said. "It was in 
my best interests to come here -- best for the 49ers and best for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also pretty good for the Raiders, who cut fullback Steve Smith in the 
off-season rather than pay him $1.05 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had not signed Rathman, the Raiders would have had a choice at 
fullback between Napoleon McCallum, a short-yardage and goal-line specialist 
with poor speed, and Derrick Gainer, known more for his blocking than his 
running. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran guard Max Montoya, who considered retirement, has signed a contract 
and will return. . . . Offensive lineman Rich Stephens has signed a two-year 
deal. . . . To get down to the 80-man limit, the Raiders released three free 
agents Friday, rookie running back James Hill and one-year veterans Craig 
Ritter, a guard, and Lester Ridley, a safety.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; STREAKING GIANTS WIN AGAIN, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Bonds hit two home runs and Darryl Strawberry homered for the second 
consecutive game to lead the surging San Francisco Giants to a 7-3 victory over 
the Montreal Expos on Friday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back to the same combination we had last year with Will (Clark), only 
more powerful," Bonds said. "Hopefully, we can get ourselves going." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Portugal (8-6) gave up eight hits in seven innings for the Giants, who 
are 6-0 since Strawberry joined the team.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 3-2, New York 7-1 -- Tony Gwynn and Phil Plantier hit back-to-back 
home runs in the 14th inning against Mike Maddux to give the Padres a 
doubleheader split at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The homers ended the four-hour, 10-minute nightcap that began as a pitching 
dual between Andy Benes and Bret Saberhagen, both the subject of trade 
speculation. Benes worked the first eight innings and struck out a career-high 
14. Saberhagen pitched 10 innings and struck out 11. 
</P>
<P>
 With the game scoreless with one out in the 14th, Gwynn hit his 10th homer 
against Maddux (1-1), followed by Plantier's 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Bobby Bonilla went three for four, including a three-run 
home run, in support of Bobby Jones (10-7).  
</P>
<P>
 Pirates 11, Houston 8 -- Carlos Garcia homered and drove in four runs and the 
Pirates staged one of the greatest comebacks in their 107-year history, 
rallying from eight runs down at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelo Manzanillo (3-2), batting only because Pittsburgh was running out of 
reserves, hit a game-tying two-run double in the fifth and pitched 1 2/3 
scoreless relief innings as the Pirates overcame a seven-run Houston first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 6, Florida 4 -- Rookies Javier Lopez and Jose Oliva each hit home runs 
and drove in two runs at Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Glavine (11-7) gave up five hits, didn't walk any and struck out three in 
seven innings as the Braves ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Chicago 1 -- Reggie Sanders homered into the upper deck at 
Cincinnati to highlight a five-run third inning as Jose Rijo (9-4) struck out 
five and gave up eight hits over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' 15th home run capped the Reds' third, when Cincinnati sent 10 batters 
to the plate against Willie Banks (8-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 10, St. Louis 6 -- Charlie Hayes had four hits, including two 
triples, as the Rockies battered Bob Tewksbury (10-8) for seven runs and 10 
hits in 4 1/3 innings at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kingery and Eric Young each drove in two runs for Colorado, which chased 
Tewksbury in the fifth inning as Hayes tripled and scored on Kingery's single. 
Kingery scored on third baseman Todd Zeile's error, and Nelson Liriano's 
sacrifice fly gave the Rockies an 8-1 lead.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FIGHTING TIGERS SPLIT WITH K.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie Bob Hamelin, ejected from the first game for charging the mound, hit a 
three-run homer in the second game Friday to lead the Royals to a 5-3 victory 
over Detroit and a split of their doubleheader at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers won the first game, 14-2, as Cecil Fielder had a three-run homer 
and a season-high five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin charged the mound in the ninth inning of the first game after Greg 
Cadaret sailed his first pitch behind Hamelin's head. Hamelin punched Cadaret 
in the face, and Cadaret tackled Hamelin and shattered Hamelin's glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Hamelin hit his club-leading 17th homer. It came in the 
fifth inning against Mike Moore after Dave Henderson had a single and Wally 
Joyner walked. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three fans suffered minor injuries when part of a fireworks display 
exploded in the right field bleachers after Hamelin's homer.  
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 3, Chicago 2 -- At Chicago, Mark Clark and Jeff Russell combined on 
a six-hitter and helped the Indians end a seven-game White Sox winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark (11-3) gave up only one extra-base hit, walked two and struck out five 
in 8 1/3 innings. He defeated Jack McDowell (7-8), who had won his previous 
five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle's bat was removed from the game in the first inning after White 
Sox Manager Gene Lamont asked home plate umpire Dave Phillips to inspect it. 
The bat will be inspected for cork. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Oakland 1 -- Tom Brunansky's three-run home run capped a four-run 
rally in the ninth inning against Dennis Eckersley for the Red Sox at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 1-0 lead to protect, Eckersley (2-4) retired the first two and was one 
strike away from ending the game when Mo Vaughn lined a single to center. 
Pinch-runner Scott Fletcher stole second and scored the tying run on Mike 
Greenwell's pinch-single. After Scott Cooper singled, Brunansky homered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were three great at-bats in front of me," Brunansky said, "and they all 
got two-strike hits. By the time it got to me, the game was already tied. Mine 
was just a one-pitch at-bat. I was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, Texas 5 -- Juan Guzman (9-9) survived six walks, three wild pitches 
and two errors to get his third consecutive victory for the Blue Jays at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto scored four runs in the first inning -- three unearned -- and watched 
the Rangers commit their league-leading 84th, 85th and 86th errors -- all on 
potential double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 8, Minnesota 7 -- Rookie Jeff Cirillo hit his first major league 
homer and drove in three runs and Ricky Bones (8-7) benefited from an early 7-1 
lead at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo, whose two-run pinch-double in the ninth inning gave the Brewers a 
victory over the Twins on Thursday, singled in two runs in Milwaukee's four-run 
first inning against Scott Erickson (8-8) and hit a solo homer against Dave 
Stevens in the fifth.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; ASHLEY TRADE PLAN DENIED BY CLAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not only is triple-A outfielder Billy Ashley not on the trading block, but he 
is in the Dodgers' plans for next season, Fred Claire, executive vice 
president, said Friday. Ashley, a 24-year-old left fielder, had been reported 
to be part of a trade to the Chicago Cubs for left-handed reliever Randy 
Myers.Claire has denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billy is a potential 40-home run hitter and is a player we definitely see as 
part of our team in 1995," Claire said. "He will have the opportunity and the 
rest is up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielders Brett Butler and Cory Snyder are signed through this season. If 
Butler is not re-signed, Raul Mondesi would become the center fielder. Claire 
says two other top outfield prospects at triple-A, Todd Hollandsworth and Roger 
Cedeno, need more experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley is batting .326 with 20 home runs and 64 runs batted in 64 games for 
the Albuquerque Dukes. However, he has 71 strikeouts in 233 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Neither Mike Piazza nor Butler started the second game of the doubleheader. 
Butler took a ball off his right foot in the eighth inning of the first game 
and suffered a bruise. "I'll be back tomorrow," he said. Piazza was merely 
rested for the second game, with Carlos Hernandez getting the start with Tom 
Candiotti. Piazza took a foul tip off his right shoulder, but it was his left 
shoulder he was icing after the game. Piazza's left shoulder has been sore for 
a couple of weeks. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; REYNOLDS VOWS TO STAY POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds, who said a week ago he thought about retiring every day, said 
reports of the imminent end of his career were premature and blown out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to stay in my routine and try to stay positive," said 
Reynolds, who has been relegated to reserve status since the Angels moved 
Damion Easley to second base last month. Reynolds has made only one start in 
the last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to play," he said. "I like the guys here. I like the coaches 
here. I just hate the bench. I'm not happy with earning a letter anymore. I'm a 
four-year letterman already. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only July and I sure don't want to sit on the bench until October." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels optioned right-handed reliever Mike Butcher to triple-A Vancouver 
after Friday night's game and recalled left-hander Andrew Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, a 21-year-old rookie who was 9-3 with four complete games, two 
shutouts and a 3.24 earned-run average in 17 starts for Vancouver, will be 
assigned to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher is 2-1 with one save and had a 6.67 ERA in 33 games with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Ken Patterson, who underwent surgery to reconstruct his elbow in 
May, was in Anaheim for Jimmie Reese's memorial service and said he discovered 
how much he missed baseball by watching Angel games on television from his home 
in McGregor, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching other games didn't bother me, but watching your teammates play 
without you really eats at you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said he hopes to start throwing in late August. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe (Magrane) told me that at least I picked the right year to take off," he 
said. "The year of the juiced ball. I tell you, some of the people I've seen 
hit home runs this year . . . something's up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander John Dopson will undergo a rehabilitative process for an inflamed 
rotator cuff before surgery is considered. "They're going to try and strengthen 
the area with exercises, then he'll throw again and see if there's any 
problems," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. . . . No. 5 hitter Jim Edmonds is 
slumping and the Orioles twice walked clean-up hitter Chili Davis in RBI 
situations Thursday night. So Lachemann is considering putting Tim Salmon 
behind Davis in the order and moving Edmonds to the No. 3 spot. "We can't 
continue to let them take the bat out of Chili's hands like that," Lachemann 
said, "so that's something you might see." . . . Tonight's game, on the 
schedule for 8:05 p.m., has been moved to 5 p.m. for the debut of The Baseball 
Network on ABC. JOHN WEYLER

ANGELS' JIMMIE REESE EULOGIZED; BASEBALL: THE COACH, WHO DIED WEDNESDAY AT 92, 
IS REMEMBERED AS A GENEROUS FRIEND WHO WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Angel Gary Pettis took a breath, smiled, then told his Jimmie Reese 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy hit a home run against us one day. I get back to the dugout and Jimmie 
said, 'Mullion, how come you didn't catch that one?' I said, 'Jimmie, it was 10 
rows back.' He said, 'Come out early tomorrow, and we'll work on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who died Wednesday at 92, was remembered Friday, not only with tears, 
but smiles. The service at Calvary Church in Santa Ana brought friends from 
across the nation, among them Nolan Ryan and Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needn't weep for Jimmie," the Rev. John Werhas said. "We need to weep for 
baseball. We need to weep for life as a whole. He was the ultimate man." 
</P>
<P>
 The service included eulogies by Pettis, Tim Mead, Angel assistant general 
manager, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann and Bonnie Bish, Reese's godchild. Each 
spoke of Reese's generosity and kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan came in from Texas for the service. He and Reese were friends from the 
day they met. Ryan named his son Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you name a son after someone, I think it's pretty obvious how you feel 
about them," Ryan said. "There are special people in your life, who make an 
impact on you. Jimmie was that to me. He helped me on and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who had been an Angel coach since 1972, was in his 78th season in 
professional baseball, having started as a batboy with the Los Angeles Angels 
in 1917. He played in the major leagues with the New York Yankees and St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms from the Yankees, Cardinals and Angels were displayed, as well as 
photographs of Reese. A procession of cars and three buses carrying Angel 
players and staff drove from Anaheim Stadium to the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone who wants to speak came up here, we'd be here forever," said 
Werhas, who has presided over chapel service for the Angels the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would get to the ballpark early each Sunday, just so I could talk with 
Jimmie. If I was feeling down, it would take only about a minute with him to 
cheer me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Angel players and three former Angel managers, as well as many others 
involved in baseball, attended. Each had a story. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times did we see Jimmie walking in the outfield during batting 
practice with his back to the plate?" Lachemann said. "Line drives would be 
whizzing all around him, but he never got touched. He truly was an Angel." 
</P>
<P>
 That spirit touched others outside of baseball as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bish, whose father had been one of Reese's close friends, had known him all 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me my first job, picking up nails with a magnet in his workshop," 
Bish said. "He paid me six cents a day, which was good wages for a 5-year old. 
He kept on me to save that money for my future education." 
</P>
<P>
 All said they would remember Reese for the way he treated others. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about Jimmie, you think of the respect he showed you and 
everyone," former Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Werhas: "Jimmie always talked about rooming with Babe Ruth. I never knew 
Babe, but in my opinion he roomed with Jimmie Reese."

ANDERSON CONTINUES HIS ASSAULT; ORIOLES: CENTER FIELDER'S HOT STREAK AT THE 
PLATE HELPS BALTIMORE COOL OFF THE ANGELS AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baltimore center fielder Brady Anderson stepped into the batter's box Friday 
night with a modest .265 batting average, but also with a reputation as one of 
the hottest-hitting leadoff men in baseball lately. 
</P>
<P>
 And Anderson, a former UC Irvine standout, showed the Angels that his red-hot 
reputation was well-deserved. He went three for four, scored three runs and 
drove in another in Baltimore's 9-2 victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, that has been a typical performance for Anderson, whose hit-and-run 
style of play has helped the Orioles keep pace with the New York Yankees in the 
AL East race. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is such thing as a streaky hitter," Oriole Manager Johnny Oates 
said, "it's Brady. He has been pretty streaky this year but has been on the 
rise as of late. He's right where he should be, in the .270 to .280 range. And 
he's been scoring runs -- his goal is to score 100 and anything else is a 
plus." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start this season, Anderson's resume in the month of July reads 
like that of an All-Star: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is 20 for 47 this month and is riding a 10-game hitting streak, 
including five-consecutive multi-hit games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the last 10 games, he has increased his batting average with runners in 
scoring position by more than 70 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has dominated Angel pitching in the first two games of the four-game 
series, going five for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has stolen 20 consecutive bases without getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was on the basepaths early and often Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the game with a triple, belting Phil Leftwich's pitch down the 
right-field line and into the corner. As Tim Salmon scrambled to get the ball, 
Anderson rounded second and easily beat the relay throw to third. He scored on 
Rafael Palmeiro's sacrifice fly to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking and stealing a base in the third, Anderson drove in Jeffrey 
Hammonds in the fifth when a towering fly to shallow right field somehow fell 
between a charging Salmon and a retreating Damion Easley. Chris Sabo followed 
with a two-run homer to left, giving the Orioles a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson reached base again in the seventh on a line drive down the first-base 
line off Joe Magrane, moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on a double by 
Palmeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro, Sabo and Anderson did most of the damage Friday night, combining to 
score seven runs and drive in five. The trio helped make a winner of Sid 
Fernandez (6-4), who held the Angels scoreless for six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we want from the top of our order," Oates said. "That's 
why we have them hitting there. The whole club has been swinging the bat well 
as of late, but those guys (Sabo, Anderson and Palmeiro) have a pretty good 
track record."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; COOL AIR SETS STAKES RECORD

<P>
 Cool Air left eight rivals feeling her draft as she posted a stakes record 
time of 1:01 3/5 for 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf in capturing Friday night's 
$155,600 Budweiser Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Air, the only filly in the field of eight sprinters, surged under jockey 
Chris Antley in the final furlong as she drew away to win by 2 1/2 lengths over 
D'Hallevant. Bahatur finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner's share of $88,100 boosted Cool Air's earnings to $448,503.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; THE TALE LENGTHENS: SEA CADET TO RETURN IN BEL AIR 
HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Not many horses from the 1991 Kentucky Derby are still running. Not many 
horses with only a hint of a tail have won major races. Not many horses that 
brought less than $3,000 as yearlings have gone on to earn $1.7 million. Sea 
Cadet fits all those descriptions, and his remarkable career isn't over. It has 
merely turned a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The resilient 6-year-old is scheduled to run Sunday for the first time in 20 
months, in the $150,000 Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Sea Cadet ran in the Bel Air, he was a 3-year-old who was 
taking a break from a steady diet of derbies in 1991. He won the El Camino Real 
Derby at Bay Meadows; finished third, behind Dinard and Best Pal, in the Santa 
Anita Derby; ran eighth in the Kentucky Derby; was fourth in the Jersey Derby, 
and won the Longacres Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 If the race was shorter than 1 1/4 miles, Sea Cadet was especially dangerous. 
He led the Kentucky Derby until the top of the stretch, but faded in the last 
eighth of a mile. Against older horses, he was third in the Bel Air, then 
finished the year with four victories, a second and three thirds in 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like an ugly duckling, with that tail missing and all," said Sea 
Cadet's trainer, Ron McAnally. "But he's always trying. He never gives up." 
</P>
<P>
 It's because of that abbreviated tail that Sea Cadet is racing for Verne 
Winchell, who bred the Bolger-Hattab Gal colt with Lonnie Owens of Paris, Ky. 
Owens, the owner of Hattab Gal, consigned Sea Cadet to a yearling auction at 
Keeneland in 1989, and when the bidding stalled, Winchell's farm manager, David 
Fiske, bought the horse back for $2,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing wrong with the colt's conformation, but nobody liked him 
because he didn't have a regular tail," Winchell said. "That was a bad day at 
the sale. There weren't many live buyers there. If the horse had brought 
$15,000 or $20,000, we would have let him go through. But $2,800 was too cheap 
to sell him. We thought that at least he had the potential to become a 
high-class claimer. But of course as it's turned out, he's been much more than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cadet quietly earned $92,850 in eight starts as a 2-year-old, scoring his 
only stakes victory in a minor race at Bay Meadows. After earning $679,800 as a 
3-year-old, he won more than $1 million in only six starts at four. He found a 
home in Florida that winter, winning the Donn Handicap and the Gulfstream Park 
Handicap and beating Strike The Gold, the 1991 Kentucky Derby winner, by seven 
lengths in the latter race. Sea Cadet came back lame after running second to 
Best Pal in the Oaklawn Handicap in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A tender ankle prevented McAnally from racing Sea Cadet until mid-October, and 
in his first start he won the Meadowlands Cup, earning $300,000. The $3- 
million Breeders' Cup Classic, at Gulfstream Park, was less than three weeks 
away, and even though Sea Cadet wasn't eligible, Winchell wasn't fazed by the 
$360,000 supplementary fee, or the prospect of facing A.P. Indy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been my horse, I would have been reluctant to put up the money," 
McAnally said. "After I gave Verne the pros and cons, he decided to go ahead. 
There was something to the argument that the horse had won twice over the 
track, once at the same distance (1 1/4 miles) as the Breeders' Cup race." 
</P>
<P>
 Horses' tails serve two important functions: They contribute to their sense of 
balance and they help shoo flies. Three days before the Breeders' Cup, on a 
hot, humid morning at Gulfstream, Sea Cadet was kicking at some flies in his 
stall. He slammed a rear leg against the back wall, was injured and was 
withdrawn from the race. Winchell's $120,000 -- the first payment of the 
$360,000 -- was non-refundable. A.P. Indy won the Classic and was voted horse 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cadet returned to action at the end of the year, running second in the 
Hawthorne Gold Cup, and hasn't raced since. Recovered from his leg problems, 
Sea Cadet was in training this winter at Santa Anita when he was stricken by 
colitis, an intestinal disorder that is sometimes fatal. The horse spent a 
couple of months at a hospital in Chino before he was released about two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky," McAnally said. "Colitis can be fatal if they don't catch it 
early. But as it was, we still almost lost him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cadet ran his first race at Hollywood Park, finishing second against 
maidens on July 22, 1990. He has won twice there, once in the Laz Barrera 
Handicap, his final start as a 3-year-old. He will carry high weight of 119 
pounds Sunday against Lykatil Hill, 118; Region, 117, and Tinners Way, 117, who 
are next highest in the weights. Others entered in the 1 1/16-mile race are 
Brilliant Blue, Williamstown, Dr. Pain and Seahawk Gold. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday at Hollywood, Sea Cadet worked five furlongs in a fast 58 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been working like he might be capable of returning to his former 
brilliance," Winchell said. "They did a fine job at Chino to save him. We're 
not ready to make a stallion out of him yet -- I've got enough stallions at my 
farm these days. I'd like to think that he could run another year after this 
one."

SIMI VALLEY LEFT OUT IN COLD BY QUAKE; CONSTRUCTION: STRUGGLE OVER RELIEF FUNDS 
COULD LEAVE REPAIR OF DAMAGED GYMNASIUM MORE THAN A YEAR AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Simi Valley High's earthquake-damaged gymnasium may not be repaired until 1996 
because of an ongoing struggle among school, state and federal officials over 
disaster relief funds, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym and multipurpose room suffered major structural damage in the Jan. 17 
quake and are expected to cost about $1.7 million to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Simi Valley Unified School District in February was given $10,000 
in disaster aid for architectural and engineering costs associated with the 
gym's repair, subsequent requests for funding to repair structural damage have 
been denied by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state Office of 
Emergency Services, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not realize the demands" of the applications, said Roger Grady, 
director of planning and building for the district. Grady said the setback 
means the gym probably won't be repaired until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials have rejected two applications for funding because 
the district failed to provide enough documentation on its forms, Grady said. 
FEMA and state officials could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the third (application) and hopefully it will address the points in 
the right manner," Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is still awaiting approval for funds to construct a temporary 
gym. But Grady said that even if the district received the money today, it 
would take about 90 days to erect a temporary structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Students returning to school in the fall could be without a gym until December 
at the earliest, Grady said. Physical education classes probably will be forced 
to use outdoor fields and blacktop surfaces until a facility can be erected.  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Athletic Director George Ragsdale spent Friday sending letters to 
area churches and public parks inquiring about the availability of their gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of knew we would not have the gym ready but we thought we would have 
a portable gym," Ragsdale said. "Now we're keeping our fingers crossed that we 
get that at the start of the new year."

MALIN'S FIRE EXTINGUISHED IN QUARTERFINAL; TENNIS: TIRED AND UNABLE TO MOTIVATE 
HIMSELF, DEFENDING CHAMPION IS ELIMINATED IN NATIONAL MEN'S 45 EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gene Malin of Woodland Hills says his competitive flame has been blown out. He 
can't relight it -- even when somebody's threatening to end his reign as a 
national tennis champion. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of desire finally caught up with him Friday. Second-seeded Malin was 
upset by fifth-seeded Charlie Hoeveler of Ross, Calif., 6-3, 6-1, in the 
quarterfinals of the U.S. Tennis Assn. national men's 45 hard court 
championships at Westlake Tennis & Swim Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Malin, who will turn 46 in October, was the defending champion. He felt good 
physically, and his arsenal included a strong serve-and-volley combination and 
a deadly backhand. He was playing in his own backyard. But could any of that 
motivate him? 
</P>
<P>
 Malin shook his head and smiled weakly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried everything to psych myself," he said. "I'm burnt out." 
</P>
<P>
 Malin's opponent was no slouch, however. Hoeveler, 49, captured the tournament 
championship in 1991 and '92 before Malin defeated him in the '93 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess turnabout is fair play," said Hoeveler, who didn't give Malin many 
breaks in this match. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malin, at 6-feet and 188 pounds, looked as though he could overtake 
Hoeveler (5-10, 145), even at match point. Malin agreed, but added: "I didn't 
have any fight. I had no eagerness." 
</P>
<P>
 Malin had his serve broken four times, twice in each set. Down, 5-0, in the 
second set, Malin started to rally. He served a love game to make it 5-1, then 
hit a scorching backhand off a Hoeveler serve for a break point. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's normally how I play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malin didn't capitalize on the break point, providing only a flash of 
domination instead. Hoeveler regained the advantage, and on match point lunged 
at a Malin passing shot and got just enough racket on the ball to make it nick 
the top of the net for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeveler's well-placed returns had Malin running at a drop-dead pace. Malin, 
however, wasn't in the frame of mind to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first set was a real battle," said Hoeveler, who was down a game and 
facing break point. "We had a lot of long points. But when he could have gone 
ahead, 4-2, he just missed a backhand. He had a lot of momentum at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoeveler held serve. He slapped and tapped and hit spinners until he wore 
Malin down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's tough to play against because he doesn't give you much pace," Malin 
said. "But (Hoeveler's style) doesn't give me trouble if I'm eager. I can 
overhead against that. I just missed a lot of overheads." 
</P>
<P>
 Malin, a private coach, said he's tired because he's had less than seven days 
off the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just need a vacation," said Malin, who was planning to take a trip to 
Yosemite National Park after Sunday's final. "Now we'll probably leave 
Saturday."

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: LARRY YOUNT; HIS CAREER WAS A ONE-LINER; BUT ROBIN'S OLDER 
BROTHER IS MAKING A NAME IN THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Zeroes. Lots of them, in a long, tidy string. Like a row of pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, they're a pitcher's best friend. In the matter of right-hander Larry 
Yount, this isn't necessarily the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a gander at the goose eggs in Yount's career summary with the Houston 
Astros. Dream stuff -- including a lifetime earned-run average of zero -- 
except for a couple of not-so-minor numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Say, for instance: 
</P>
<P>
 Games: 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Innings pitched: 0. 
</P>
<P>
 No runs, no hits, no nuthin', which is where Yount's major-league story 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 And where it ends. Some guys are in the big leagues for the proverbial cup of 
coffee. Yount had a teaspoon of espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past few years, I've been asked about it a little more often," said 
Yount, 44. "Because of my brother and all." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount's kid brother Robin, the former All-Star shortstop and center fielder 
for the Milwaukee Brewers, is a lead-pipe cinch for the Hall of Fame. Sure, 
Larry went to The Show. But it was a short subject, if not a one-act play. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin played in the major leagues for 20 superlative years before retiring in 
1993. Truth be told, Larry warmed up in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all there in The Baseball Encyclopedia, which lists the career stats of 
everybody who played in the majors. In Larry's case, it lists somebody who 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take my little story and add it to my brother's story, I guess it's a 
little different," Larry deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yount heard the klaxons sound in his elbow while he was warming up in the 
bullpen. He'd been with the Astros for a week or so, but hadn't pitched. Maybe 
he warmed up too quickly after the layoff, or with too much enthusiasm. The 
elbow felt funny before he ever made the long, fateful walk to the pitcher's 
mound for his big-league debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros were in the process of losing to the Atlanta Braves, 4-2, when 
Yount was asked to pitch the top of the ninth inning in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sept. 15, 1971. Beyond that, details are sketchy for Larry, who like 
Robin graduated from Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you how much I remember," Larry said. "I can't remember whether it 
was (played) in the Astrodome or Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he blocked it out, or maybe the years that passed have muddied the 
mental waters. Perhaps the prospect of pitching to the heart of the Atlanta 
order numbed his brain. Due up for the Braves were a couple of lightweights 
named Ralph Garr and Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, all of 21 years old, carefully threw a warm-up pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was announced over the public-address system and entered on the plate 
umpire's lineup card. The appearance was now official. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount threw another pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates loosened up by firing the practice ball around. Joe Morgan and 
Bob Watson in the infield, Cesar Cedeno and Jimmy Wynn in the outfield. Former 
Taft star Larry Dierker was the opening-day starting pitcher that year. Yount's 
arm ached, but he couldn't let them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Another warm-up pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 It felt like someone had stuck a cattle prod in his right elbow. Finally, 
Yount realized he couldn't continue and another reliever was called upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure you'll run out to the mound, that the adrenaline will be pumping 
and that you'll figure out what's wrong," Yount said. "I threw a couple of 
pitches and said, 'Something's wrong,' then called the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might have been the most sensible thing I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure seemed that way at the time. Big deal, right? Yount would pitch in his 
first game -- and throw a pitch to a live batter -- another time. Soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Yount had no idea that he'd scaled the mountain and fallen off the 
other side before he even got to eye the scenery. No rain checks for players, 
buddy. Aloha can mean both hello and goodby. Yount never made it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount's tendon problem cleared up a couple of weeks later and he pitched well 
in fall instructional league. The following spring, he struck out the first six 
batters he faced and was a prime candidate for a spot in the starting rotation 
until a three-run homer by the Dodgers' Willie Davis spoiled a string of 
successful appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount was the last player cut from the '72 roster. A minor setback. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the year with a 3-0 record at Houston's triple-A affiliate in 
Oklahoma City, but from that point, Yount's career took a palpable nose dive. 
He finished the season 5-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started going south," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So did his control, which also headed east and west, like his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I completely lost the ability to throw the ball over the plate," he said. "I 
just got progressively more screwed up. I couldn't throw it near the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 It was like an insidious virus. Coaches tinkered with his delivery. Teammates 
made suggestions. Between the lines, between the ears, Yount was an 
equal-opportunity mess. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974 he was traded to Milwaukee, the organization that earned instant 
dividends on brother Robin, who in that season appeared in his first big-league 
game at age 19. By then, Larry was trying to find a compass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was clearly lost at that point," Larry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount visited Maury Wills' psychologist in Los Angeles and learned a little 
something about himself. Mainly, that he was way too pragmatic to listen to 
such mumbo-jumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, now pitching exclusively in relief, stopped by a Taft practice and 
talked to his former coach Ray O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said Yount was borderline arrogant in high school. Now, the pitcher 
was a rudderless ship, his self-confidence all but drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "His fundamentals were so screwed up," O'Connor said. "He couldn't come close 
to the plate. . . . I don't think his coaches were smart enough to develop the 
tools he already had. They took him and tried to make him into what they 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount hung around for a few more years with pure savvy, throwing junk. In 
1976, after showing few signs of big-league potential, Milwaukee gave Yount his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had plenty of opportunities to make it back," he said. "Nobody can say I 
didn't have the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt I had the ability, but I just didn't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 What an unforeseeable end. A roundhouse punch to the kid with the roundhouse 
curve. When he was selected in the fifth round of the 1968 draft, Yount was 
full of vinegar and promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fully expected to be in the big leagues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemed reasonable. Shoot, he was sent straight from Taft to triple-A Oklahoma 
City. In his first start, Yount pitched a three-hitter . . . and lost, 2-0, to 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, the loss was a harbinger. While Yount's playing career didn't 
pan out, he found a future in the game with the team that wrecked his pro 
debut.  
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, Yount has served as president of the Phoenix 
Firebirds, the triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a natural fit for Yount, who moved to Phoenix after he retired in 1976 
and since has established his own real estate business, LKY Development 
Company, Inc. Yount, an honor student in high school, earned his real estate 
license while playing in the fall league after his aborted big-league debut. 
</P>
<P>
 LKY are the initials of Lawrence King Yount, networking prince of the Valley 
of the Sun. For a triple-A team, which thrives on corporate sponsorship and 
promotional ties, Yount has been a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a succession of good (presidents), all good baseball people," said 
Martin Stone, who owns the Firebirds. "But they all had limited contacts in 
Phoenix. Larry knows everybody from bank presidents to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a businessman in Phoenix in a top position who doesn't 
know him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of them know the story behind Larry's combination debut/swan song with 
Houston, which Stone succinctly described as "an almost one-pitch experience."  
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't know the details, it's spelled out in the Firebirds' team 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, in fact, has achieved a measure of notoriety for his micro-career. Last 
year, a magazine detailed the careers of several big-league players who, like 
Yount, were finished almost before they started. Guys like outfielder Pete 
Gray, who had 234 at-bats for the St. Louis Browns during war-torn 1945. Gray 
had one more arm than Venus de Milo. 
</P>
<P>
 The postscript cited Yount as the inspiration for the story. It might be a 
point of embarrassment to some, but Yount shrugs it off with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very strong person," said his wife, Gail, another Taft graduate. 
"Maybe it would bother him more if he hadn't made a mark for himself (after his 
career ended)." 
</P>
<P>
 Yount's success and aggressive nature in the business world aren't 
particularly shocking to O'Connor, his coach at Taft. The die was cast years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry was a little egotistical," O'Connor said. "He thought the world 
revolved around him. On the mound, it did. He probably had the best curveball 
of any high school player I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the best high school teams the area has ever known. Yount's 
teammates included Rick Auerbach and Pete LaCock, who each had productive major 
league careers. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor gets downright angry when he thinks of the unfulfilled promise of the 
'68 team, which lost in the first round of the City Section playoffs. Yount won 
13 games his senior year, including a 13-strikeout performance in Taft's 
regular-season finale against Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the first round of the playoffs, though, Yount injured his 
pitching shoulder while rough-housing with classmates. Shot down moments before 
prime time. Sounds familiar, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 With Yount unavailable for the first round, Taft was upset. So was O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have strangled him," O'Connor said. "The jerk comes to school on 
Monday and says, 'Coach, I hurt my shoulder.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it wasn't always a dreamscape for Yount on the baseball field. But 
that didn't stop him from lending a hand to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry was still pitching in the minors when Robin, five years his junior, was 
playing for O'Connor at Taft.  
</P>
<P>
 After a solid junior year in 1972, Robin spent the summer with his brother in 
double-A Denver, soaking up the atmosphere, taking batting practice and infield 
against seasoned professionals, seeing how he measured up. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robin returned to school, he could hardly contain himself. He excitedly 
told O'Connor: "I hit guys in double-A. They tried to get me out (in practice) 
and I still hit 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to have a pretty good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty good career, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry had a tremendous influence on Robin," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1973, when Robin was drafted by Milwaukee as the third pick 
in the nation, Larry served as his kid brother's adviser during contract 
negotiations. Good move, since Larry had been through the bargaining wars 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry has served as Robin's agent-adviser ever since. Kept the money in the 
family that way, Larry cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up and Larry barely has time to breathe. He's in the office by 7 
a.m., and when the Firebirds are in town, he rarely gets home before 10 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 His wife said he recently joined a health club to shed a few pounds. While 
riding the stationary cycle, he conducts business on his cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Younts also have four children. "I don't know how he does it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount is nothing if not determined. His development company struggled during 
the recession, when property values in Phoenix tumbled and the savings-and-loan 
scandal rocked the region.  
</P>
<P>
 Yount took the job with the Firebirds to supplement the family income and 
simply worked that much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I clearly don't believe in quitting," Yount said. "You can't be afraid of 
things. I'm willing to give myself the chance to be very embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 He could just as easily be red-faced about his career numbers, which are 
reducible to a couple of lines in a 2,800-page tome.  
</P>
<P>
 On the facing page of the Baseball Encyclopedia is the career summary of 
someone named Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it is the facing page. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard to be there (in the majors) for a long time," he said. "The 
reality of the world is that you can't change what happened yesterday just 
because you'd like to." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrets? Not really. Even though it smacked of bittersweet chocolate, at least 
Yount had a taste of the majors. "Hey, a lot of people haven't," he said.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; LAMB STILL KEEPING HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER 
</P>

<P>
 David Lamb and his Albany (Ga.) Polecat teammates are in the midst of what has 
become a 28-day trip, and they aren't too upset about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty smelly down there (in Albany)," said Lamb, a former Newbury Park 
High shortstop. "There were coffins (from flooded graveyards) floating around 
and snakes everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Albany has been flooded by the recent devastating rains in the 
Southeast, the Class-A Polecats of the South Atlantic League have temporarily 
moved their home games to Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much satisfied to be up here," Lamb said from his hotel room in 
Chattanooga. "It would be a mess if we played there and no one would want to go 
to the games anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was the first day the roads to Polecat Park were opened since the 
flooding began. Lamb said what was an eight-minute drive from his apartment to 
the park became a two-hour excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 All Lamb knows about Albany is what he's seen on television or heard from club 
officials and wives of teammates. The Polecats were on the road when the 
flooding began and haven't been home since. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing got pretty messy," he said. "We were lucky we were on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw some things on CNN. It's pretty disgusting. You've got to feel bad. 
There are 30,000 people without homes back there, so we're not doing that bad 
playing out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The week-long home stand scheduled to begin Wednesday was moved to 
Chattanooga. The Polecats then hit the road and won't return to Albany until 
July 29, nearly a month after they left for what was supposed to be a 10-game 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only brought enough clothes for that trip," Lamb said. "I'm definitely 
going to have to do some laundry pretty soon." 
</P>

 Driven: Shortstop Mark Loretta was supposed to be the area's only 
representative in the double-A All-Star game Monday in Binghamton, N.Y., but a 
funny thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta, a St. Francis High graduate, and two of his El Paso teammates were on 
the way to fill up the gas tank before the Diablos' game Sunday, but their car 
ran out of gas a block from the station. The three pushed the car the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta was standing outside the car, steering through the window, as he 
attempted to align the vehicle next to a gas pump. But the car began rolling 
backward and Loretta's left knee was pinned between the car and a bar 
protecting the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta, 22, said the knee was only slightly bruised, but it kept him out of 
action for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loretta, who was hitting .313 at El Paso, couldn't have played in the 
double-A all-star game anyhow -- because on Monday he was promoted to triple-A 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More all-stars: Ottawa catcher Tim Laker had the best game among the four area 
players who participated in the triple-A all-star game Wednesday night in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker, a Simi Valley High graduate, was two for three with a double and two 
runs batted in, leading the National League affiliates to an 8-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Rich Aude, a Chatsworth graduate, was hitless in three at-bats for 
the National League and Vancouver's Garret Anderson, of Kennedy, was 0 for 2 
for the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver left-hander Andrew Lorraine, of Hart, gave up one run in two innings 
for the American League.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Taking the heat: When Nate Dishington learned that the St. Louis Cardinals 
were sending him to Chandler, Ariz., site of the team's rookie-level Arizona 
League team, he knew he was in for a tough summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wake up at 5 a.m. and play in 110-degree heat," Dishington said. "They 
say, 'If you can play there, you can play anywhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona League, in which teams play scorching day games in front of crowds 
in the dozens, is considered one of the least-attractive leagues for pro 
players. But the Cardinals wanted Dishington, a second-round pick out of Hoover 
High last year, to work on his hitting and catching in a pressure-free 
environment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to have worked. Dishington, 19, was hitting .267 through Thursday, 
after batting above .300 for much of the season. In his debut last season at 
Johnson City, Tenn., Dishington hit .157 with 52 strikeouts in 121 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a big adjustment," Dishington said. "It's a big jump from high 
school to the pro level and there's nothing really to prepare you for it." 
</P>

 American dream: One year after defecting from Cuba to pursue a professional 
baseball career, shortstop Rey Ordonez is quickly moving along in the New York 
Mets' system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez, 23, was promoted this week to Binghamton of the double-A Eastern 
League after leading Port St. Lucie of the Class-A Florida State League in 
several offensive categories. 
</P>
<P>
 He was leading the club in batting (.309), hits (97) and doubles (21), and was 
fourth in RBIs (41), despite hitting second in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez, who had been living in Sylmar, defected last July while the Cuban 
team was playing at the World University Games in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Former Providence standout Jeff Cirillo, recently promoted to the 
Milwaukee Brewers, drove in the go-ahead runs with a pinch-hit double in the 
ninth inning Thursday against Minnesota. Cirillo, 24, who hit .309 at triple-A 
New Orleans, was hitting .107 in 12 games with the Brewers before Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "You reach barriers at every level," Cirillo told the Associated Press. "Every 
level you climb in this game you have to prove yourself again. If you can hit 
in Class A, nobody assumes you'll hit in Class AA until you show you can do it. 
And the same thing is true here." Cirillo homered and had three RBIs on Friday 
night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Salkeld, 23, was demoted from the Seattle Mariners' rotation to triple-A 
Calgary on Sunday. But, unlike his two earlier demotions, this was not because 
breaks in the schedule allowed the Mariners to do without a fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
 This demotion was performance-based. Salkeld, a Saugus High graduate, was 2-5 
with an earned-run average of 7.04. In 55 innings, he allowed 69 hits and 
walked 41.

TO PLAY OR NOT TO PLAY . . . ; CAREER-THREATENING INJURY IS DOWNSIDE OF PREP 
ALL-STAR GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A hush fell over the stadium when Tony Gonzalez didn't get up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine minutes into the Orange County All-Star football game July 8, the 
Huntington Beach tight end caught an 11-yard pass before a gang of defenders 
tackled him. 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, Gonzalez, who has a scholarship to play football and 
basketball for California next season, was on the Orange Coast College turf, 
clutching his right knee and writhing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought his career was over right there," said Judy Gonzalez, Tony's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for the 6-foot-6, 230-pound Gonzalez, he suffered only a second-degree 
sprain. He will miss six to eight weeks of action, but with rehabilitation and 
therapy, Gonzalez should be ready for Cal's season opener at San Diego State, 
Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, The Times Lineman of the Year and a two-time all-county selection, 
had an MRI exam on his knee Thursday in Berkeley. He won't receive the results 
for a few days, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor told me I should be good as new in about a month or two," Gonzalez 
said. "Of course I have regrets about playing in that all-star game now. I had 
never been seriously hurt in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play in that game for (Huntington Beach) Coach (George) Pascoe. 
He's done so much for me. Besides, what was the chance that I would get hurt in 
that game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some football coaches say chances for injuries in an all-star game aren't any 
higher than other athletic contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics have an inherent injury factor," said Bill Workman, Orange Coast 
College football coach and former Edison High coach. "There's a chance you 
could get hurt in an all-star game and there's a chance you could get hurt 
lifting weights." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what quarterback Jim Karsatos thought in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980 season, Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney watched Karsatos pass 
for 2,703 yards, then a single-season Orange County record.  
</P>
<P>
 Karsatos earned a scholarship to Ohio State then played in the 1981 Orange 
County All-Star football game where he suffered a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still see that play unfolding," Devaney said. "Jim was passing and a 
defensive lineman was down on his hands and knees, crawling toward Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim had just planted his right leg to throw, and the guy lunged at him. It 
was a freak accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum performed surgery on Karsatos' knee to repair ligament damage, 
and the initial diagnosis indicated that Karsatos' career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Karsatos' knee recovered better than anticipated, he was back on the 
football field and earned the starting quarterback job at Ohio State as a 
junior in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing for more than 5,000 yards in his Ohio State career, the Miami 
Dolphins selected Karsatos, a 6-3, 220-pounder, on the 12th round of the 1987 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to tell how that knee injury affected his career," Devaney 
said. "He got his shot to play with the Dolphins, but he blew his other knee 
out in an NFL exhibition game just planting his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he just have bad knees? Well, he was a big person, and his upper body was 
perhaps more muscular and developed than his lower body. Maybe the injury 
reduced his chances, but who knows how and why it affected him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Karsatos, Santa Ana's George Tuioti didn't get to play in the Orange 
County all-star game. He blew out his knee preparing for the 1987 game. 
</P>
<P>
 During a non-contact drill in a practice, Tuioti, a flamboyant linebacker who 
had signed with USC, tore ligaments in his left knee and needed arthroscopic 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-4, 226 pounds, Tuioti's physique and skills attracted many recruiters. 
But Tuioti didn't meet the NCAA's freshman eligibility requirements under 
Proposition 48, and USC officials suggested that he attend a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuioti ended up at Rancho Santiago in 1990, before accepting a scholarship to 
play at New Mexico State in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the injury may have cost Tuioti a chance to play football at USC, he 
cautioned future all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you play, you should protect yourself," Tuioti told The Times in 1989. 
"You don't have to go out and bust your head or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been high-profile players who skipped the game, such as former USC 
and Raider quarterback Todd Marinovich, who played at Mater Dei and Capistrano 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Valencia running back Chris Draft knows the risks but still 
encourages participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I get hurt it will be a little injury," said Draft, who has 
signed with Stanford. Draft gained 43 yards in 11 carries in this year's 
all-star game.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is only one game, so you have time to recuperate," he said. "If you 
start thinking about getting hurt, that's when you will get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Shea, an assistant coach at Stanford who also has coached at San Jose 
State and Cal, said the Cardinal staff encourages players to participate in one 
all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the games are a reward for the players," Shea said. "A lot of times 
it is a charity game for the community, so it's also for a worthy cause." 
</P>
<P>
 What concerned Shea is the reduction of training time for some all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a player has two weeks of practice, I think they can get into adequate 
football shape," Shea said. "Some games are cutting down on training time. But 
in the 20-plus years I've been coaching, I've only seen a handful of serious 
injuries in all-star games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Workman: "I think players are more apt to be hurt during two-a-day drills 
than an all-star game. It would take a scientific study to say they are in 
worse shape before an all-star game than heading into hell week (the first week 
of fall practice). 
</P>
<P>
 "An injury could happen just as easily in an all-star basketball game or a 
pickup game. If you're in athletics and all you're worried about is getting 
hurt, then maybe you shouldn't be playing at all."

of Colorado's cold winters were factors in her decision.

 "I wanted to come back home," Barajas said. "I wasn't really all that happy 
(at Colorado). . . . Homesickness had a lot to do with that."

VENTURA RACEWAY; WESTON GRINDS IT OUT IN THE END, TAKES THIRD STREET STOCK MAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Friday night's 20-lap Street Stock main event at Ventura Raceway, James 
Weston, Adail Gayhart, Randy McGraw, Paul Moore and Bill Bartels spent the 
entire race grouped together, handily pulling away from the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were only three lead changes during the race, the top five cars 
put on quite a show while battling for position. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, of Santa Barbara, passed hometown favorite McGraw on the 16th lap -- 
after several laps of fender-banging -- then charged through slower traffic to 
capture his third victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Points leader Moore, of Oak View, passed McGraw with two laps remaining to 
take second. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, nickname "Bam Bam" because of his hard-charging style, denied that the 
bumping and grinding with McGraw was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to bang on him," Weston said. "But my car was really sliding 
in the corners, to the point where it started pushing towards the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15-lap Mini Stock Main, Gary Hubert of Somis took the lead on the 
fourth lap and coasted to an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Bruce Dunson was second, followed by Camarillo's Richard Webster and 
Tim Gill, also of Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a similar scenario to the Street Stock race, in that the three cars 
behind Hubert spent the entire race jockeying for position after running away 
from the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme's Don DeAzevedo led all but the first lap in grabbing his first 
15-lap Pony Stock feature victory. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAzevedo had to hold off several challenges from points leader Scott Boucher 
of Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher inherited second place from Michael VanDeventer on the ninth lap after 
VanDeventer was forced from the race when Ventura's Tina Verdun rammed him 
coming off Turn 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdun had been driving erratically for three laps before her collision with 
VanDeventer, but stayed in the race, only to almost knock DeAzevedo out of 
contention on the final lap.
