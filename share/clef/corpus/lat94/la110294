 TEAM DEFENSE: The stakes are high: Ventura County's two Navy bases and the 
$1.5 billion they pump into the local economy. With so much in the balance, 
county officials have hired a high-powered lobbyist to spare the bases at Point 
Mugu and Port Hueneme from closure (B1). . . . The Washington firm includes a 
former California congressman and an attorney with extensive experience in base 
closures. "They are well-positioned to help us pry open doors wherever we need 
to," said Carolyn Leavens of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 WARM REGARDS: With winter approaching, Operation Warm-Up today kicks off its 
annual push to shield the homeless from the cold. . . . For the past six years, 
the group has donated sleeping bags, blankets and other items to Ventura 
County's estimated 2,000 to 3,000 homeless people. The items will be 
distributed through April of next year. . . . "We care about the homeless and 
we are doing our best to address their warmth requirements," spokeswoman 
Darlene Howery said. 
</P>
<P>
 PUMPKIN EATERS: Ever wonder what happens to post-Halloween pumpkins? At 
McGrath Farms in Ventura, Food Share gleans the good fruit from the pumpkin 
patch. And at Faulkner Farms near Santa Paula, pumpkins become cattle feed. . . 
. Despite selling 500 tons of the overgrown gourds, Faulkner had about 50,000 
pumpkins left over. A cattle company will haul them away. "They are used 
completely: the seed, the stems and everything," said Linda Ayers, co-owner of 
the ranch. "I mean, they eat the total pumpkin." 
</P>
<P>
 MURDER TRIAL: According to the prosecutor, Mark Scott Thornton was a desperate 
man, running from the law and in need of a getaway car: That's why he kidnaped 
Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan on Sept. 14, 1993, and shot her dead (B1). . . 
. Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher steered clear of the slaying during 
the first day of the murder trial, but acknowledged that his client was under 
intense pressure. "Mark spent a sleepless night Sept. 13," he said.

 Remember when schools raised money with car washes? 
</P>
<P>
 They do things differently at Franklin Elementary School on trendy Montana 
Avenue in Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 The donated items in a silent auction held by that school included: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Consultation with reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist. 
. . . Value: $225." 
</P>
<P>
 * "One walk-on part in TV's 'Baywatch' as well as "lunch with the cast and 
'Baywatch' hat. . . . Value $150." 
</P>
<P>
 * "One walk-on appearance for an entire family (up to five persons) in an 
episode of CBS's 'Diagnosis: Murder,' starring Dick Van Dyke. . . . Value: 
$550." 
</P>
<P>
 * "One audio scope super-wide-angle door scope with in-built electronic 
intercom. . . . Value: $50." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Luxurious seven-day Caribbean cruise for two aboard either MS Nieuw 
Amsterdam or the MS Westerdam. . . . Value: $3,780." 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know about you, but we've always preferred the MS Westerdam.

 Sorry, we're in a drought. Would you settle for a 5.0 earthquake?The folks at 
KNX radio relayed to us a fax that may or may not have been the work of a 
serious sender. We just thought the sentiment was so charming that we had to 
pass it along.

 A real tale-gater: Susan Kasten of Arcadia studied one entry in the Sierra 
Madre News' police blotter and commented, "I'm a firm believer in law and 
order, but it looks as if the youngster in question may have been picked up for 
a crime that many of us are also committing." His infraction was listed as 
"wreckless" driving. 
</P>
<P>
 More from those wacky postal folks: Maren Sampson writes, "My husband Chris 
was the recipient of this inadvertent Halloween greeting from the Venice Post 
Office" (see reproduction). 
</P>
<P>
 She adds: "He was in line, right in front of B01 and behind A99. We think it 
resembles a smiling bat." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Her Ex marks the spot: Alumni of the L.A. Herald Examiner will hold a reunion 
Saturday afternoon poolside at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to observe the 
fifth anniversary of the newspaper's death. (Tickets are $25 apiece). 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt some of the talk will center on the funny-sad events of the final 
months, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * The male reporter who performed an impromptu striptease after rumors that 
the paper would be bought by the Toronto Sun, known for its photos of scantily 
clad women.  
</P>
<P>
 * The mysterious uniformed people who began showing up each day in the 
newsroom to do nothing more than dust the telephones. They were dusting them 
the day the paper folded. 
</P>
<P>
 * The time Robinson's decided to test-advertise a pillow sale in the paper -- 
the first such ad by a local department store in years. Notices were posted at 
the paper appealing to Her Ex employees to buy pillows and thereby show that 
advertising in the Herald paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Bates of the Orange County Register, who planned the reunion, asked the 
Hearst Corp. for permission to hold it at the paper's 82-year-old Spanish 
Colonial building on Broadway. She was turned down. The building is unavailable 
except as a movie set these days. miscelLAny It will be interesting to see if 
the Africanized "killer" bees will continue on their way toward L.A. after what 
happened to one swarm at the Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in Riverside 
County. Those bees were destroyed the day they were discovered in the prison. 
Let's hope the others get the message: Three stings and you're out.

FAMILY ASKS FOR HELP SOLVING 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The family of a Dorsey High School cheerleader killed in a baffling slaying 
over the weekend made an emotional plea Monday for help in finding Anitra Jolie 
Watson's killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, anyone who knows anything . . . ," sobbed Denise Cato, the 
17-year-old senior's aunt. "We need to know why our baby was killed the way she 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends described Watson, who had been president of her ninth-grade 
class at Bancroft Junior High School, as a popular and vivacious teen-ager who 
loved dancing and music. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's body was found Saturday morning in an unoccupied duplex in the 
Inglewood area. She had been shot several times, execution-style, about 10 p.m. 
the night before, said Lt. Sergio Robleto of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 She had called her Hancock Park-area home earlier Friday night to tell her 
mother she was leaving the Dorsey football game with friends, police said. She 
was seen in her white Nissan Pulsar following three men in a dark Buick Regal 
after the game, Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Watson was at the duplex about 9:30 p.m. Friday with a 
man named Antoine, Robleto said. No more is known about Antoine, and police 
have not been able to locate the duplex's residents, he added. Watson's car was 
found at the building, her cheerleading uniform in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a genuine mystery," Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said more than one gun was fired in the duplex Friday night because 
numerous bullet holes were found in the walls, but only one weapon was used to 
kill Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't involved in anything she deserved to be killed for," said fellow 
cheerleader Michelle Skinner, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "She touched everyone's life," said Watson's mother, Barbara Schwab. "She was 
a dream! " 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow cheerleaders recounted how, even though she was sidelined from the 
squad with an ankle injury this semester, she would urge them to stay with 
cheerleading even when they felt like quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson transferred to Dorsey's magnet program in mathematics and science in 
the spring after attending Palisades High School. Her mother said she had 
considered attending USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to be something," said Tiffany Brown, a friend and fellow 
cheerleader. "She wasn't going to turn into a waste with her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on Watson's death is asked to call police at (213) 
237-1310.

WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD VOTE 'NO' ON PROPOSITION 187; THIS GREAT STATE IS BIGGER 
AND BETTER AND WISER THAN THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the passions that swirl around this election's now most controversial 
decision -- Proposition 187 -- voters who still haven't made up their minds 
should understand that in their hands lie one of the most significant matters 
they will ever confront in a polling booth. 
</P>
<P>
 FRUSTRATION PERSONIFIED: Many Californians -- including Gov. Pete Wilson, who 
is fighting for reelection -- are embracing this deeply flawed measure in part 
out of pent-up frustration with the federal government's failure to enforce 
basic border control and its refusal to provide the money to help impacted 
border states cope with increased immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if California defines illegal immigration as nothing but a problem -- 
thereby ignoring the powerful economic benefits that derive from this valuable 
labor pool -- there is no wisdom in lashing out in precipitous action that the 
state would come to regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, almost everything about Proposition 187 is wrong. It is wrong morally, 
because it would cast an indiscriminate shadow on people whose only real sin is 
to try to escape grinding poverty and make something of themselves. It is wrong 
politically, because the proposition's very presence on the ballot is dividing 
the state into two emotionally polarized camps at the very time all 
Californians should be working together. Nothing is ever accomplished when the 
people are divided, as they certainly are now over this ill-named "Save Our 
State" initiative -- which surely would prove to be a "Tear Our State Apart" 
consensus-wrecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most telling argument against Proposition 187 is in a document 
called "Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local 
Government Fiscal Impact," which appears in the California General Election 
Pamphlet, given to every registered voter. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative analyst's office is nonpartisan; Republican and 
Democratic legislators alike avail themselves of its penetrating and 
time-proven analyses to help determine the likely impact of legislation. The 
professionals who work in the agency are highly regarded: When they have done 
their work on a pending bill and then speak out, legislators generally listen. 
</P>
<P>
 FLAWS MAGNIFIED: So listen to what these experts say about Proposition 187: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their analysis raises the specter of unintended consequences . Rather than 
save money, 187 might deprive the state of money: The ballot measure, they 
conclude, "places at risk billions of dollars annually in federal funding for 
state and local education, health and welfare programs due to conflicts between 
the measure's provisions and federal requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They worry about considerable administrative disarray: "This measure does 
not set out any specific requirements as to how verification of citizenship or 
legal presence in the United States would be done." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They suggest that any savings from denying services to immigrants might be 
offset by the administrative costs of verification: "Ongoing annual costs could 
be in the tens of millions of dollars, with the first-year costs considerably 
higher (potentially in excess of $100 million)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They say that 187 might save money at first, but not in the long run: 
"Denying some medical services to illegal immigrants could result in future 
increased state and local health costs. For example, eliminating prenatal 
services to illegal immigrant women could result in higher Medi-Cal costs for 
their infants, who would be citizens. In addition, failure to treat and control 
serious contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis, among illegal immigrants 
could increase future costs to treat the disease in the general population." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such a finding from the legislative analyst concerning some 
ordinary bill, as opposed to this monumental ballot measure, most state 
lawmakers would back away, return the bill to committee, do some more homework 
and work up a better measure. That's exactly what California should do with 
Proposition 187: Hold off and do something more intelligent. For if this 
initiative passes on Nov. 8, that would be much harder to do. Yes, the courts 
might invalidate one portion or another, but the counterproductive statement 
will have been made. In the end, maybe the only people who will truly benefit 
will be the lawyers on either side collecting fees for litigating this whole 
misconceived thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, let's get control of U.S. borders, but let's not lose sight of our 
principles or abandon all reason. Vote "no" on Proposition 187.

ONE CITY HALL, ONE CITY; A TIMEOUT, PLEASE, IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES-VALLEY 
BICKERING OVER SCARCE DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things have been ugly in the chambers of the Los Angeles City Council. We mean 
more so than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some examples. 
</P>
<P>
 October: San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles lawmakers lock horns over a 
relatively small, $1.6-million study on transit planning and economic 
development that would exclude the Valley. When Councilman Hal Bernson, a 
Valley representative, suggests the inclusion of five Valley Metrolink 
stations, Councilman Mike Hernandez responds, "You had an earthquake on Jan. 17 
and now you know what it's like to have needs." One Valley station ends up 
being included in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 September: Three Valley members of the council recommend increasing the 
Valley's share of another small, $2.2-million federal grant to help senior 
citizens recover from the quake . . . at the expense of seniors in South and 
South-Central Los Angeles. Lawmakers from those areas protest in a voice that 
can be heard on Mt. Wilson. (Fortunately, a compromise eventually is reached.) 
</P>
<P>
 August: There is disagreement between South Los Angeles lawmakers and Valley 
representatives over affordable-housing money. The Valley wins a bigger share, 
but in the midst of the dispute when Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick suggests 
dividing the money evenly she is scolded by Valley colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough already. Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said it best: "I'm increasingly 
disturbed by the notion that there has to be a 'we' and 'they' in our disaster 
recovery plan. I think that shows a real failure of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 It's time that Valley legislators remember that the city's woes did not begin 
Jan. 17. And the folks in South Los Angeles must stop looking at the Valley as 
that greedy and unneedy appendage to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's problems are the culmination of the recession, the riots, cutbacks 
in defense spending, bankruptcies and business departures, high unemployment . 
. . and a succession of natural disasters that included an earthquake that was 
the costliest disaster in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the street gangs know how to fashion a truce. The council can, too, for 
the sake of the recovery of all of Los Angeles, not just part of it.

A WAR SHIFTS ITS GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems no small coincidence that a trial involving the murder of an abortion 
doctor is in the news at the same time that clinical tests of RU486, the 
so-called abortion pill, are getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The national controversy over abortion is now in a new stage; clearly the 
battle for the hearts and minds of Americans on this question has shifted its 
ground.The constitutional arguments that once preoccupied courts have receded, 
and the major political parties are largely sidestepping the issue. Women in 
need of abortions and the doctors who provide them are pretty much on their own 
and more than ever are on the firing line. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1977, hundreds of bombings, arson attacks, acts of vandalism and threats 
have been directed at abortion clinics across the nation. In 1993 the threats 
became deadly reality when Dr. David Gunn was murdered outside a clinic in 
Pensacola, Fla. Then earlier this year another abortion doctor, John Britton, 
was killed, also in Pensacola; Paul Hill, whose trial began Monday, is charged 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill represents the anti-abortion movement's violent fringe, a collection of 
individuals committed to choking off women's access to abortions in any way 
they can, regardless of the law. Their tactics unfortunately are paying off: 
84% of American counties now have no abortion services.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why the U.S. trials of RU486 -- regarded as safer and more private than 
a surgical abortion -- are so important. Approval of this drug by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration could come as early as 1996. When that happens, perhaps 
the tug of war over abortion clinics will become moot, and none too soon.

CONTROVERSY OVER PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I teach a class of first-grade students in Santa Ana. Half of my students were 
born in California and half were born in Mexico. I must add my voice to the 
growing protest against Prop. 187. This initiative requires that the "unlucky 
half" of my children who do not possess U.S. birth certificates be prohibited 
from attending school. I shudder at the thought of having to explain to the 
remaining "lucky half" as to why their former classmates, cousins and sometimes 
even siblings are banished from school due to the lack of a legal document.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Prop. 187 is poorly conceived. The proposition states that the school 
will "provide 90 days of additional instruction to a suspected illegal 
immigrant student in order to accomplish an orderly transition to a school in 
the student's country of origin." Did the authors of 187 seriously think that 
the immigrant students would go back to Mexico? Not likely. Their families 
endured plenty of hardships to get here and wouldn't be leaving unless forcibly 
removed. Yet Prop. 187 makes no provisions whatsoever for deportation. My 
greatest fear is that the "unlucky half" of my class will become the next 
generation's permanent underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Prop. 187 is morally wrong because innocent children will be 
punished for a crime in which they had no part. In my 20 years of teaching in 
the Latino community, every immigrant parent I ever met wanted his/her child to 
learn English as quickly as possible, do well in school, and become a 
productive American citizen. I find it hard to condemn parents for acting upon 
that dream.

 * Re Wayne A. Cornelius' article opposing Prop. 187, Commentary, Oct. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 If during Cornelius' 20-year study of Mexican migrants to California, he has 
yet to "encounter a single one for whom getting access to some tax-supported 
service was the principal reason for coming here," why is he objecting to a law 
that would merely codify the expectations of those same people? Prop. 187 
would, if Cornelius is correct, not give illegals what they don't want. So 
what's the problem?

<P>
 * Two headlines (Oct. 22) point up why California needs to pass Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles School Board President Mark Slavkin projects 10,000 teachers will 
lose their jobs if Prop. 187 passes. If each teacher represents about 30 
students, the projected teacher firing accounts for 300,000 illegals or roughly 
50% of the LAUSD student population. How can LAUSD survive when half of the 
enrollment are illegals and growing at an alarming rate! 
</P>
<P>
 The other headline reports on a UCLA study declaring taxpayer-financed health 
programs in L.A. County are in danger of collapse. Free health service to 
illegals is a major contribution to L.A. County's fiscal problems.

 * Look a child in the eye and say, "Too bad if you get measles. You don't 
deserve an immunization." Tell another child, "Sorry if you want to learn. You 
can't go to school." Or say to a pregnant woman, "So what if your baby is born 
with complications? You're not entitled to see a doctor." If you can do these 
things, then go ahead and vote yes on Prop. 187. But don't tell me you're 
"sending a message to Washington." The only message you are sending is to 
thousands of your fellow human beings: "My money is more important to me than 
your lives." 
</P>
<P>
 If you support Prop. 187, then be honest with yourself. And sleep well.

 * Again we hear Cardinal Roger Mahony tell us it is our "moral obligation" to 
oppose Prop. 187 (Commentary, Oct. 25). He tells us it is an insult to ethics 
and goodwill. Well, where was the good cardinal while illegal immigrants were 
taking thousands of construction and other jobs away from American citizens? 
Why didn't the cardinal talk about goodwill then? Why didn't he say anything 
about protecting the children of men and women who lost their jobs to illegals? 
Instead he talked about the illegals only taking jobs that Americans didn't 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it also our moral obligation to feed and clothe illegals, to give them free 
medical and social services while our own senior citizens and multiple 
thousands of our homeless are without these services? And is it also our moral 
obligation to spend twice the amount of money on illegal students than we do on 
our own kids? 
</P>
<P>
 I believe it is our moral obligation to vote yes on Prop. 187 -- to put our 
own citizens first.

 * As one of an estimated 150,000 persons who according to CNN participated in 
the Oct. 16 Downtown Los Angeles march against Prop. 187, I am dismayed by 
initiative backers who denigrated that event as a nationalistic or separatist 
rally because so many Mexican flags were in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latinos, that march was reminiscent of the 1960s civil rights movement. 
Moreover, it was a glimpse into the future. Most marchers were young people who 
more accurately reflect what Los Angeles is and will increasingly become -- 
youthful and ethnically diverse. These people are the prototype of what the 
majority of voters in our community will look like in the next few generations.

<P>
 Ironically, as more and more of them participate in the political process it 
will become more difficult for cynical politicians such as Gov. Pete Wilson to 
ride the wave of cultural and racial backlash at the polls.

 * I write to express my personal disappointment at both the manner and content 
of your Oct. 26 editorial endorsement of Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills). The lack of analysis and factual errors disserve your readers.Most of 
all, the frankly snide tone reinforces the notion that The Times is neither 
open to new ideas nor prepared to oppose any incumbents.  
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that your editorial went out of its way to mischaracterize me on 
conservative issues in an attempt to bolster the incumbent: 
</P>
<P>
 * You criticize me for calling defense conversion "industrial welfare." Please 
recall that I said the Clinton Administration's proposals amounted to such 
until we in Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Planning and Research took the lead in 
working with other states to make sure they were not. Further, the reason we 
have "a state devastated by defense/aerospace cutbacks" is precisely because of 
precipitous and unwise defense cuts championed by Beilenson (and he says he 
wants $40 billion more in cuts). 
</P>
<P>
 * I make no apologies for calling the crime bill ineffective. The partial 
federal funding will cover precisely 28,740 police nationwide for one year. The 
effect on Los Angeles will be virtually nil. It is just more pork-barreling.  
</P>
<P>
 The amendment to the crime bill securing reimbursement to California for 
incarceration costs of illegal alien prisoners is a Wilson proposal, from my 
office, and Beilenson gave it away in negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration by agreeing to defer full reimbursement until 2004.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, your brief discussion dismisses me as vague on welfare reform. I 
suggest you read your own newspaper; at your invitation I wrote an article with 
detailed proposals for such reform in your Aug. 14 issue.

SINGLE-PAYER INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Amazing! An independent study by a prominent national accounting firm shows 
that in its first five years of operation Proposition 186 would save 
Californians $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 How does that result in a headline like "Single-Payer System Would Balloon 
State Budget, Study Says" (Oct. 27)? Did the headline writer forget to read the 
article, or did The Times just decide to bury the story's most significant 
facts? 
</P>
<P>
 While the study's cost estimate is cited in the article's lead paragraph, the 
$112-billion saving isn't mentioned until the sixth paragraph. The fact that 
employers would save $3 billion to $7 billion annually isn't mentioned until 
the second to last paragraph. What's wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
 The information is in the story: According to the study, California businesses 
and individuals would spend much less under Proposition 186 than they do now 
and would get better health benefits. Too bad The Times didn't think that was 
worthy of headlines. LAURA REMSON MITCHELL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Anyone considering voting yes on Proposition 186 should ask themselves this 
question: What is the proper function of government, on any level? The answer 
should be based on the premise that the primary purpose of government is to 
protect its citizens against the initiation of force from any quarter 
(including its own power seekers). This is what rights are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is immoral for one man to force another to sacrifice his legal rights, 
to whatever degree and to whatever purpose, it is no less immoral for our 
government (which is, after all, only a lot of individuals) to force some 
citizens to sacrifice their rights for the "public good." Proposition 186 
violates this principle. Don't enslave our doctors. Vote no on Proposition 186. 
It is immoral.

PERSPECTIVES ON INSURANCE REFORM; INSURERS MOUNT A STEALTH CAMPAIGN; THE 
INDUSTRY, THWARTED BY VOTERS AND THE COURTS, IS NOW TRYING TO BUY THE OFFICE OF 
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARVEY ROSENFIELD, Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103, is 
director of the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians don't ordinarily get to vote on a ballot initiative twice. But 
when it comes to reforming the auto insurance system, next Tuesday's election 
will provide the opportunity to cast another vote for lower and fairer 
insurance rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103, the insurance measure approved by the voters in 1988, 
mandated rollbacks in auto, homeowner and business premiums, required prior 
approval of all rate increases and eliminated the unfair territorial rating 
system. Then, to guarantee that these reforms would be implemented properly, 
the initiative made the insurance commissioner accountable directly to the 
public through election. 
</P>
<P>
 The six years since 103's passage have proved the wisdom of that policy. 
Between 1988 and 1990, Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, appointed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, did everything she could to stymie the law. But when John Garamendi 
became the first elected commissioner in January, 1991, he ordered all rates 
frozen until insurers paid the rollbacks and issued a series of pro-consumer 
regulations to govern not only the rollback process, but also future requests 
for rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's rules -- the strongest in the nation -- prohibit insurers from 
passing through to policyholders excessive and unjustified expenses, such as 
multimillion-dollar executive salaries, lavish agents' commissions and 
political contributions. Insurance companies that operate efficiently and 
comply with the law can earn a fair, but not excessive, profit.  
</P>
<P>
 In Garamendi's hands, 103 has worked. Despite constant lawsuits by insurers, 
more than 6 million Californians have received more than $833 million in 
rollbacks. And, ironically, the insurers' stalling has delivered greater 
savings than 103 itself called for. The rate freeze has saved consumers an 
average of $1 billion per year since 1988. In 1989, when 103 took effect, 
California had the seventh-fastest-growing auto premiums in the nation. Now it 
ranks 48th. The average auto insurance premium has actually dropped in 
California since 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to portray 103 as a failure, the industry claims that the national 
recession, not insurance reform, is responsible for the reduction in premiums 
in California. If so, then why did premiums rise an average of 20% everywhere 
else in the country?  
</P>
<P>
 While Garamendi has occasionally stumbled -- a hasty endorsement of no-fault 
insurance in 1991; a few too-generous rollback "settlements" -- he has set the 
standard by which future commissioners will be judged. The California Supreme 
Court's decision two months ago upholding Garamendi's regulations cleared the 
way for another $1.5 billion in rollbacks and equal savings every year from now 
on. In sweeping aside the insurers' lawsuits, the court affirmed that it was up 
to the insurance commissioner to determine how best to carry out 103's reforms. 
And that, of course, is why the insurance industry has already spent more than 
$2 million in an all-out campaign to elect a pro-industry insurance 
commissioner, a little-known member of the Assembly, Charles W. Quackenbush 
(R-Cupertino). Quackenbush is an avowed opponent of 103 who says that the "free 
market" is best for consumers. He would push "deregulation" of insurance as far 
as he could go and return us to the pre-103 days of 20% annual insurance 
increases. As commissioner, Quackenbush could force consumers to reimburse the 
insurance companies for what they spent to elect him. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers are trying hard to disguise their campaign for Quackenbush. For 
example, Allstate employees, using company phones to call 100,000 voters urging 
them to support Quackenbush, identified themselves as members of a police 
union. Insurance agents and brokers have held "$99 fund-raisers" in order to 
skirt campaign disclosure laws: Contributions of $100 or more must identify the 
donor's occupation.  
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush himself refuses to make public appearances or debate Art Torres, 
his underfunded Democratic opponent. Indeed, Quackenbush's TV ads don't even 
mention the post he is running for, or insurance matters at all. They focus on 
this year's political shibboleth, street crime, a problem over which the 
insurance commissioner has zero authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lost at the ballot box in 1988, and, finally, in the courts, the 
insurance industry is desperately trying to buy back the office that it once 
controlled and that now belongs to the people. The insurers hope that the 
combination of overwhelming amounts of political money and a stealth campaign 
will obscure the stark differences between the two candidates, and the billions 
of dollars at stake in next week's election. But the public isn't likely to 
forget the importance of the office it created just a few years ago. No other 
elected official affects the public's pocketbook so directly. The robber barons 
of the insurance industry spent $80 million to stop reform in 1988 and failed. 
They always underestimate California voters.

PERSPECTIVES ON INSURANCE REFORM; AN UNFREE MARKET KEEPS RATES HIGH; 
CALIFORNIANS HAVE PAID MORE AND INSURERS HAVE MADE HIGHER PROFITS THAN THEY 
WOULD HAVE WITHOUT PROPOSITION 103. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER B. LEWIS, Peter B. Lewis is chief executive officer of the Progressive 
Corp., Mayfield Village, Ohio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter who is elected California insurance commissioner, it is time to 
recognize that the administration of Proposition 103, passed by the voters in 
1988 to control costs, has instead forced consumers to pay more for auto 
insurance that they would have under the less-regulated, free-market system 
that existed before 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of how much more California drivers have paid for auto insurance 
because 103 is law range from $3 billion to $6 billion. I know those numbers 
don't square with the proclamations of Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
and consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield, whose personal and political interests 
demand that they demonstrate benefits for their constituents. Their 
self-justification drives them to make the flawed assertion that 103 has saved 
Californians $4.5 billion because auto insurance rates in California rose 9 
percentage points less than the national average since it became law. Their 
numbers ignore the effect of claims suddenly plummeting with the onset of 
California's recession. (Hard times mean lower costs because of less driving 
and fewer accidents.) 
</P>
<P>
 Auto insurance rates are the sum of expected claims and costs of doing 
business, less expected investment income on underwriting cash flow, plus 
planned profit. In a competitive state, rates follow costs down almost 
immediately. This didn't happen in California, because 103 forced insurance 
decision-makers, faced with suffocating regulation and profit controls, to 
ignore their competitive instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, some large companies, including mine, pulled back from the California 
market. Almost no companies reduced rates when their California profit jumped, 
as they always had before, and do in other states. Why? Because they knew that 
increases they would need when inflation or claims increased would require 
approval by a politician who depends on being elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of 103 to Californians is evident in how much more profit companies 
have made on auto insurance in this state during the past five years than they 
would have without the law. Before 103, auto insurers' profit margins in 
California were consistently 2 percentage points below the national average 
because the state's "open rating" law made it the most competitive U.S. auto 
insurance market. Since 103, California auto insurance profit margins have 
ballooned to 3.6 percentage points above the national average because 
regulation has replaced competition. That's where the $3 billion to $6 billion 
overpayment estimates come from. 
</P>
<P>
 Savvy consumers who know what they need and can readily buy from many 
companies can manage the trade-offs in price, quality and innovations; 
bureaucrats, let alone politicians, can't. Would a California "computer" 
commissioner have driven down prices in that highly competitive industry any 
faster than Compaq, Dell, AST and others did themselves? The beauty of the 
competitive free-enterprise system is that it forces companies to deliver a 
better combination of price, quality and innovation, because doing so rewards 
them with profit and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many ways to meet California consumers' demands for lower auto 
insurance rates, the most powerful being to re-establish the competitive 
market. Another would be to eliminate all requirements for people to buy 
liability insurance, relying on uninsured motorists coverage to protect against 
injury by those who chose not to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 A further method would be to eliminate abuse of the legal system. Sure, there 
are many legitimate, large or complex claims needing lawyers, but there is huge 
waste in those questionable and inflated claims contested by personal-injury 
lawyers, who have made a business exploiting the fact that insurance companies 
too often responded to insured and claimants slowly and discourteously.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it is a time-consuming hassle for consumers to shop carefully 
enough to take advantage of the large price differences that result from the 
intense competition in auto insurance. The insurance commissioner could help 
consumers save money by complying with Proposition 103's requirement that his 
office provide an easy way to shop the market. Typical of 103, however, is its 
ludicrous mandate that the commissioner develop a shopping system that cannot 
be built economically.  
</P>
<P>
 My company tested a more realistic consumer comparison shopping program in 
California in 1992. Data showed large price disparities among the companies we 
compared, enabling huge savings for people using our service. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad fact is that we will not offer free comparison shopping in California. 
The costs and risks of doing business here require the opportunity (not the 
certainty) to earn much higher returns on capital then those allowed by the 
state. I have no doubt our competitors have their own new programs that 
Californians will not enjoy, unless and until the insurance commissioner learns 
the dominant economic lesson of this century -- private enterprise and free 
markets are better at business than government is.

 Homeless Debate: Activists for the homeless are urging a listener and 
advertiser boycott of Los Angeles radio station KFI-AM (640) over a remark made 
by weekend talk show host Emiliano Limon suggesting that the homeless "be put 
to sleep." The comment was made a few months ago but only recently brought to 
the activists' attention. Protests culminated late last week when Jerry Rubin, 
director of the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival, was arrested for trespassing 
after chaining himself to a post outside the station. KFI program director 
David Hall has said that Limon made the comment as a drastic suggestion for 
combatting the homeless problem. "He had what turned out to be a very unpopular 
opinion," Hall said. "But the station supports his right to have that opinion 
regardless of its being politically (incorrect)." The activists have asked the 
station to apologize and are now considering filing a complaint with federal 
authorities. KFI, meanwhile, has told Limon to volunteer at a homeless shelter.

 Howard's Roots: Stern-o-philes will have a chance to check out their hero's 
early days with the upcoming re-release of an album the shock jock recorded in 
1982 while working as a deejay at a Washington radio station. Originally titled 
"Howeird Stern's 50 Ways to Rank Your Mother," the album consists of the same 
kind of lewd and crude shtick and song parodies that ultimately made him 
famous. The album was released at the time only through the station and has 
since been unavailable. The reissue, on the independent label Citizen X, will

 Tiptoeing Through Wedding Vows: Halloween doesn't get much scarier than this: 
Tiny Tim renewing his wedding vows before a ghastly group of ghouls and 
groupies at Boston's Spookyworld horror theme park. The singer's remarriage 
Monday to second wife Jan Alweiss was televised on NBC's "Tonight Show With Jay 
Leno" -- an eerie echo of his marriage to first wife Miss Vicki on "Tonight" 25 
years ago. The 1969 wedding drew 45 million viewers. Early ratings figures 
estimated 4.6 million viewing households for Monday's ceremony. Tiny Tim, 72, 
the long-haired ukulele player famous for his falsetto rendition of "Tiptoe 
Through the Tulips," originally married his current wife, 26-year-old New York 
graphic artist Jan Alweiss, in 1984. He confided Monday that the couple has 
never really lived together and that his heart actually belongs to another 
woman he called "Miss Sue." But he said he hoped the ceremony would please 
"Miss Jan," since "she loves the limelight." POP/ROCK

 Legal Rap: Rapper Tupac Shakur must serve at least 10 days in jail and 
complete 35 hours of community service for threatening a local Michigan rapper 
with a baseball bat during a concert at Michigan State University last year. 
Shakur has faced a host of legal troubles recently, including pending sexual 
assault charges in New York. . . . Meanwhile, a Miami judge has ordered 2 Live 
Crew leader Luther Campbell to pay $1.6 million to a fellow rapper who said he 
was shortchanged on royalties from two albums released on Campbell's label, 
Luke Records. Peter Jones, known as MC Shy D, said he received less than the 
agreed-upon 20% of proceeds from "Gotta Be Tough" and "Comin' Correct in '88" 
because the label overstated expenses and understated album sales. Monday's 
judgment includes back royalties, punitive damages and interest in the civil 
case. In an interview, Campbell blamed the problems on inexperience and said he 
has hired a new accounting firm to "straighten out" the label's procedures.

MOVIE REVIEW; CHARTING TROUBLED LIFE OF GAY TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his fourth and best feature, "Totally F***ed Up," provocative and talented 
independent filmmaker Gregg Araki delves into the troubled world of gay 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 As in his first two films, the "no-budget" "Three Bewildered People in the 
Night" (1987) and "The Long Weekend (O'Despair)" (1989), he evokes desolate 
images of L.A, especially at night, which makes our town, in the words of one 
of this film's young men, "the alienation capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 As an angry gay man, Araki here addresses the disproportionately high suicide 
rate among gay teens. Although more serious than he has ever been, Araki speaks 
his mind without being preachy and, what's more, as in "The Living End" (1992), 
which told of two very different HIV-positive young men on the run, uses color 
and direct sound without losing the grit of his earliest pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal among six friends, two of them a solid, good-humored lesbian couple 
(Susan Behshid, Jenee Gill), is the lonely Andy (James Duval), an appealing 
youth with a James Dean look and vulnerability, who doesn't believe love exists 
-- until he's swept off his feet by the handsome, slightly older but vastly 
more experienced Ian (Alan Boyce). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Andy's pals Steven (Gilbert Luna), an aspiring filmmaker, and his 
lover Deric (Lance May) soon experience a crisis in their relationship when 
Steven strays, trying to blame it on the fact that the new guy in his life just 
happened to have a bootleg Nine Inch Nails tape to tempt him with. Rounding out 
the group is the more easygoing skater dude Tommy (Roko Belic). 
</P>
<P>
 Araki effectively punctuates his story with quotes in the manner of one of his 
acknowledged idols, Jean-Luc Godard, and probing interviews by Steven, who's 
always poking a camcorder in his friends' faces. Indeed, the film is tautly, 
faultlessly structured, and once again Araki manages to create a spontaneous, 
off-the-cuff quality while actually maintaining tight control of his material. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we're in the world of looming billboards, deserted parking 
structures and all-night coffee shops in which his disaffected young people do 
an awful lot of hanging out. Whereas in his first two films Araki brought out 
the humor in his people's self-absorption, here he's lashing out at the 
gay-bashing and what he aptly sums up as "institutionalized homophobia" that 
makes the teen years so tough on so many kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Araki presents none of his young people, all of whom are played so expertly by 
his cast, as gay stereotypes but rather as indistinguishable in dress and 
mannerisms from other L.A. teen-agers. (Only one of the actors is actually 
gay.) The irony is that if any of these young men had been even slightly 
obviously homosexual, they might have developed lots more resiliency.

THEATER REVIEW; ACTORS' GANG 'TITUS' HAS FEW HITS AND MANY MISSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The weekend before Halloween was the perfect time for the Actors' Gang to open 
"Titus Andronicus," a horror show featuring enough Grand Guignol gore to 
satisfy the most sanguinary-minded. Presented as part of the UK/LA festival 
celebrating the British fine arts, Shakespeare's gruesome drama puts 
controversially violent recent films like "Natural Born Killers" in historical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it is arguably the most flawed of all Shakespeare's dramas, a 
mediocre Seneca rip-off with a strained plot and one-dimensional characters, 
"Andronicus" was a favorite in its day simply because it was a rip-roaring, 
crowd-pleasing, slash-and-splatter spectacle with no pretensions to greatness. 
Hacked limbs, hewn tongues, cut throats -- they're all gristle for the mill in 
Shakespeare's lurid potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-directors Brent Hinkley and Dean Robinson bear this in mind, with 
occasionally sensational results. Unfortunately, although dealing admirably 
with the play's complicated stage effects, Hinkley and Robinson take their 
Shakespeare a little too seriously. Surely, "Titus Andronicus" is the perfect 
vehicle for the savage inventiveness so typical of the Actors' Gang. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening, when the actors stomp in, one by one, barking modern-day 
racial slurs at a downtrodden captive, we realize that this is meant to be 
Shakespeare with a message. That message dies aborning, in large part because 
of the company's uncharacteristically straight approach to its material. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't moments of inspired silliness. Late in the play, 
Andronicus (Lee Arenberg) prepares for the treacherous barbarian queen Tamora 
(Karen Foster) a pasty containing her own sons. He bursts onto the scene like a 
demented Benihana chef, sporting a tall chef's cap and wielding a cleaver that 
we know will be used for more than serving pie. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of playful irreverence is sadly in short supply. Most often, the 
audience chuckles uncomfortably, uncertain of the appropriate response. 
</P>
<P>
 So funny and fine in past Gang productions, Arenberg has occasional lunatic 
extremes that hint at just how effective his performance could have been given 
the proper direction. Foster is marvelously malevolent as the scheming queen of 
the Goths, who plots Andronicus' downfall with the aid of her devilish lover 
Aaron (Joseph Haj), a hellspawn who would make Freddie Krueger seem as 
convivial as Fred Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hoover's set, a hybrid of Rome after the fall and Santa Monica Freeway 
after the earthquake, has a radically raked playing area center stage that 
threatens to catapult the actors into the front row. The set certainly proves 
the performers' agility but is otherwise user-unfriendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, there are thrills, chills, and kills aplenty in this production, but 
what could have been as spooky and fun as a Halloween haunted house is only 
marginally campy. One expects more from the Actors' Gang. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; KCET LOOKS INSIDE PROP. 187 CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who could have predicted that a tiny group based in Tustin, with the help of 
former Immigration and Naturalization Service honchos Harold Ezell and Bill 
King, would turn this election year upside down? The group's baby, Proposition 
187, may not save the state, but it's certainly saved us all from a state of 
total electoral boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET reporter Jeffrey Kaye doesn't so much look inside the 187ers with his 
"Life & Times" report "And Close the Door Behind You" as balance the arguments 
on both sides of the incendiary illegal immigration debate. If anything, we 
hear more from Ezell than, for instance, from key Proposition 187 opponent Juan 
Jose Gutierrez, who helped organize the recent massive Los Angeles protest 
against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye offers a clear summary of Proposition 187's provisions and of how 
supporters expect victory as well as immediate legal challenges. Indeed, Ezell 
tells Kaye that he hopes and anticipates that the Supreme Court will be the 
ultimate arbiter on the measure's provision to ban undocumented youth from 
public schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell doesn't allow himself an on-camera chuckle, though, at the 
less-than-shrewd tactic by his opponents of waving Mexican flags at anti-187 
rallies. Gutierrez bristles at the notion that this isn't exactly the way to 
woo voters, but that doesn't make the notion wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 For all the solid reporting here, including a concise history of California's 
love-hate relations with immigrants, Kaye blows a golden opportunity to explain 
the Mexican economic conditions that make the United States so attractive. The 
border wouldn't be "a state of mind," nor would crossing it illegally be "a 
tradition" in small northern towns if those towns were full of employed people 
generating wealth. Until that happens, nothing will really change. 
</P>
<P>
 * "And Close the Door Behind You" airs at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

SNYDER'S RECORDS SEIZED IN INQUIRY; INVESTIGATION: SEARCH IS FIRST FORMAL SIGN 
EX-COUNCILMAN IS SUSPECTED OF CRIMINAL ACTS IN A CAMPAIGN FINANCE PROBE THAT 
HAS LED TO NEARLY $1 MILLION IN PENALTIES FOR ASSOCIATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Signaling that a campaign money-laundering investigation has expanded to 
include suspicions of more serious criminal activity, the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office seized records Tuesday at the home and law offices 
of former City Councilman Arthur Snyder, a prominent lobbyist and political 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 A search warrant used in the early morning raids indicates that investigators 
suspect Snyder and his law partner, Gilbert Archuletta, of a conspiracy to 
violate campaign finance laws by funneling donations to candidates, according 
to two lawyers representing Snyder and his associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The searches were the first formal indication that Snyder is suspected of 
illegal activity in a wide-ranging probe that already has led to nearly $1 
million in penalties against several individuals and entities associated with 
Snyder and his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fines included the largest such penalty in U.S. history, $895,000 from a 
huge Taiwan-based shipping firm that was managed locally by Snyder's 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's development was one of the most significant in an ambitious 
three-year effort by state and local investigators to examine the inner 
workings of campaign financing in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, who could not be reached for comment, has not been charged with any 
wrongdoing and has steadfastly insisted he knew nothing of improper political 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's attorney, Mark Geragos, said the raids were "nothing but further 
harassment because (investigators) have been unable to make a civil case 
against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Geragos, who also represents Archuletta, said Archuletta already has resolved 
questions about improper contributions by agreeing in June to pay $16,000 in 
penalties and by admitting to eight campaign law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, declined to 
comment Tuesday, saying "we can neither confirm nor deny anything about that 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the state Fair Political Practices Commission, which has been 
pursuing the case and had a representative accompany county investigators on 
the raids, declined to provide specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 FPPC Chairman Ben Davidian would say only that "we've been very pleased with 
the work of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. As we have in 
past, we will work with that law enforcement office, and any other office on 
any alleged wrongdoing . . . that falls within our jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Snyder's associates centers on allegations that tens of 
thousands of dollars were given to candidates by donors who were secretly 
reimbursed. Such money-laundering is illegal because it conceals the source of 
a candidates' financial backers and circumvents limits on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, such violations lead to administrative fines. But Tuesday's 
searches show that investigators are pursuing a possible felony conspiracy 
case, Geragos said. He added, however, that such an investigation would be a 
pointless fishing expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators Tuesday seized campaign-related records and any related checks, 
notes, communications and files going back six years. While the raids were the 
first indication of a criminal investigation, Geragos said bank records from 
the law firm had been subpoenaed by the district attorney in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to searching Snyder's home and law office, investigators took 
documents from the home of Chi May Chen, the controller at Snyder's firm who 
already has admitted to a series of violations and paid $38,000 in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's attorney, Susan Strick, said her client is not a target of the 
investigation and has been granted immunity from prosecution. She declined to 
say whether Chen will cooperate with investigators, but added that "she hasn't 
been uncooperative."

IN HIS CORNER; LAW: MORE THAN 100 ATTORNEYS COME TO THE DEFENSE OF OUTSPOKEN 
LAWYER STEPHEN YAGMAN, WHO WAS SUSPENDED FROM PRACTICING IN FEDERAL COURT AFTER 
HARSHLY CRITICIZING A JUDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He may not be the most popular lawyer in Los Angeles, but Stephen Yagman, the 
Bad Boy of the Federal Courthouse, has a friend in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he has 111 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many attorneys signed a friend of the court brief urging the U.S. 
9th Circuit of Appeals to reverse a decision of three federal district court 
judges suspending Yagman from practicing in Los Angeles federal court for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges ruled in July that Yagman, a 50-year-old Venice civil rights lawyer 
who specializes in police brutality lawsuits, had "impugned the integrity" of 
the court by his stinging criticism of their colleague, U.S. District Judge 
William D. Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief was lodged on behalf of the American Jewish Congress' Pacific 
Southwest Region, a liberal advocacy group; Article 19, a London-based 
nonprofit organization that promotes freedom of expression, and the individual 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by four prominent 1st Amendment lawyers, the brief was filed in 
conjunction with Yagman's appeal. An oral argument in the case is scheduled for 
9 a.m. today at the 9th Circuit courthouse in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the attorneys who signed the brief say they are not personally 
enamored of Yagman and others say they disagree with what he said about Keller, 
a 60-year-old appointee of Ronald Reagan.  
</P>
<P>
 (Among other things, Yagman accused the judge of anti-Semitism and labeled him 
"ignorant, dishonest . . . a bully . . . and one of the worst judges in the 
United States.") 
</P>
<P>
 But they are united in their belief that the decision to suspend him 
represents a fundamental threat to the free speech of lawyers and if upheld 
will have a chilling effect on the willingness of attorneys to speak candidly 
about judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any particular soft spot in my heart for Steve, but this is 
clearly the right thing to do," said Douglas E. Mirell of Loeb & Loeb, one of 
the few lawyers from a large Downtown firm supporting Yagman. "It would be a 
moral outrage to allow this to go unchallenged by the legal community." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lawyer who signed the brief, criminal defense lawyer Gerald L. 
Chaleff, said: "I would venture to say that most people who signed that brief 
are not friendly with or admirers of Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not him, it's the principle -- lawyers should have the right to 
criticize judges in public or in private," said Chaleff, former president of 
the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Gunn, a deputy federal public defender who signed the brief, said the 
sanctioning of Yagman "has the potential to make lots of lawyers think they 
can't say anything negative about a judge." He said it would be particularly 
unwise to inhibit "the most reliable source of information on judges -- the 
lawyers who practice before them." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Yagman said: "I was pleasantly surprised by the number of 
lawyers who signed on to something potentially controversial and harmful to 
them. . . . I've always thought people looked at me as something of a pariah." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica criminal defense lawyer Richard Hirsch was among those who said 
they disagree with what Yagman said but believe it is critical to defend his 
right to make the statements. "I would never have made those remarks. I'm not 
suggesting those remarks are true," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Yagman is expressing his opinion, it's just his opinion," Hirsch said. 
"It's not ground for removing him as a lawyer from the district," which spans 
seven Southern California counties from Riverside to San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who signed the brief range from Harland W. Braun, an outspoken criminal 
defense lawyer who once described another federal judge as "sort of an evil man 
who is . . . trying to disguise himself as the Pillsbury Doughboy," to Dianna 
J. Gould-Saltmann, who quietly practices family law in Hancock Park. She said 
she has never met Yagman but believes he is being treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief was written by Mirell, USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky and Los 
Angeles attorneys Gary L. Bostwick and Paul L. Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1st Amendment stands as an insurmountable obstacle to the imposition of 
sanctions against an attorney for 'impugning the integrity' of the court by 
public criticism, even intemperate criticism, of judges," they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal court judges are public officials whose performance and public 
integrity must be open to challenge, like every other public official in our 
democratic system. If attorneys believe that sitting judges are anti-Semitic or 
dishonest, they are free to say so publicly. This is so even if it turns out 
that they are wrong and even if is painful to the judge involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham E. Berry, the lead attorney for the special disciplinary committee, 
said he was not surprised about the filing of the brief "because this matter 
has quite properly generated considerable debate among the legal community." 
</P>
<P>
 In his own brief, Berry strongly defends the discipline taken against Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry contends that the district court judges were correct in ruling that 
attorneys surrender some of a citizen's normal freedom to criticize judges 
because they are officers of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for the application of different standards to attorney criticism 
of the courts as opposed to press (criticism) and individual defamation of 
individuals is that different interests are involved," Berry wrote. He cited 
several cases in support of this argument, including the U.S. Supreme Court's 
latest word on the issue, a 1991 decision called Gentile vs. State Bar of 
Nevada: 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the majority on the 1st 
Amendment issue, concluded that speech by an attorney is subject to greater 
regulation than speech by others because courts historically regulate admission 
to the practice of law before them and control the professional conduct of 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend of the court brief also cites the Gentile ruling, noting that the 
Supreme Court said the only time a lawyer's speech can be restricted is when it 
would create a risk of substantially prejudicing a pending case -- which is not 
the situation in the Yagman matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief does not contend that no restrictions can be imposed on lawyers' 
speech. It cites the Gentile case and the landmark libel decision of New York 
Times vs. Sullivan as authority for its position that in order to sanction a 
lawyer for comments about a judge, it must be proved that a lawyer not only 
spoke falsely, but with actual malice or reckless disregard of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend of the court brief states that the judges who sanctioned Yagman 
turned that standard on its head and imposed an impermissible, unconstitutional 
burden on Yagman to prove his statements about Keller, or at least show that he 
had diligently researched the topics. Rather, the attorneys said it was 
Keller's obligation to prove that the statements were false. They also noted 
that he was free to pursue a libel action. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the brief contends that the three-judge panel "erred seriously 
and fundamentally in holding that (Yagman), or any attorney, may be subject to 
discipline for impugning the integrity of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criticism of the courts -- even blistering criticism -- is safeguarded by the 
1st Amendment, though it may have the effect of discrediting the judiciary. 
There is no reason to believe that the public image of the judiciary is so 
fragile or that speech critical of judges will weaken the effectiveness of the 
judicial process. Indeed, the relative insulation of the federal judiciary from 
political accountability makes speech about such judges . . . all the more 
important." Federal judges have life tenure, are subject to removal from office 
only by impeachment and are rarely disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel that punished Yagman justified its action in part by 
concluding that the outspoken lawyer had criticized Keller with the goal of 
forcing the conservative jurist to recuse himself from presiding over Yagman's 
cases in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman's supporters say that is ludicrous because it is generally difficult to 
remove a federal judge from a case, and is particularly unlikely if the sole 
justification for the recusal is a provocative act by an attorney in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend of the court brief signed by the 111 attorneys is not the only one 
advancing Yagman's cause. In his own brief -- filed by his partner, Marion 
Yagman, and his lead lawyer, former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark -- Yagman 
maintains that his 1st Amendment rights were violated, and contends that he is 
the victim of a vendetta engineered by some of his longtime adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing in on his behalf is the Los Angeles chapter of the National 
Lawyers Guild, a left-leaning lawyers organization that contends that the 
nature of the proceedings against Yagman violated his rights to due process of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 USC professor Erwin Chemerinsky helped to write court brief. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas E. Mirell, from large Downtown firm, has offered his support.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; L.A. TEACHERS SIGN PLEDGES TO IGNORE 
MEASURE; EDUCATORS WOULD BE FORCED TO VERIFY STUDENTS' CITIZENSHIP, ORGANIZER 
CHARGES. INITIATIVE'S CO-AUTHOR SAYS THAT ISN'T TRUE.

<P>
 A sheaf of pledges from teachers who say they won't comply with Proposition 
187 filled Steve Zimmer's arms Tuesday as he stood outside an Echo Park 
elementary school, using the threat of lawbreaking to drum up opposition to the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers would be asked to determine the status of students and report those 
who were in the country illegally if Proposition 187 passes, Zimmer said at a 
news conference. And that, said the teacher at Marshall High in the Los Feliz 
area, would shatter the essential bond of trust between teacher and pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is more of a crime to enforce this than to break the law," Zimmer said 
outside Logan Street Elementary, where most of the teachers signed pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot would bar illegal immigrants from public 
education but does not specify who would be responsible for enforcing the law. 
It only says that school districts would have to verify the legal status of new 
students by Jan. 1 and of continuing students and their parents by a year 
later. Students found to be illegal immigrants would have 45 days to prove 
otherwise and 90 more days to leave school. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer, who showed off the signatures of 1,000 Los Angeles-area teachers 
opposed to the measure, said he and others feel that verification would trickle 
down to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be on the front lines," said Zimmer, who recounted forming On Campus 
-- a teachers' anti-Proposition 187 movement -- in his living room after one of 
his students dropped out of school citing fears about the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 An author of the initiative, which would also bar illegal immigrants from 
other public services, said Zimmer and the other pledge signers had 
misunderstood the measure's intent. School administrators, not teachers, would 
be expected to verify students' immigration status, said Alan Nelson, former 
commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of this pledging not to go along with the law goes a little far 
-- that's anarchy," Nelson said. "But no one's asking them to do some of the 
things they're saying we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer said Tuesday that he was prepared to be arrested for refusing to 
enforce Proposition 187, but acknowledged that he could not speak for other 
teachers. On Monday a state Department of Education spokeswoman said county 
prosecutors could file misdemeanor charges against educators who fail to 
enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Many public school officials and teachers throughout the state, including the 
members of the Los Angeles Board of Education, have announced their opposition 
to Proposition 187. The state Board of Education declined to take a position, 
although Gov. Pete Wilson, who appoints its members, has endorsed the measure. 
Both candidates for state superintendent of public instruction -- Wilson's 
Education Secretary Maureen DiMarco and Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin 
(D-Fremont) -- oppose Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles, the union for Los Angeles Unified School District 
teachers, took a position against the measure in August but did not become 
involved in Zimmer's petition campaign for fear of angering voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But any UTLA member that I know of would be happy to sign that the day after 
the election if it should pass," UTLA President Helen Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Protests against Proposition 187 continued without incident Tuesday when 
students walked out briefly at eight Los Angeles schools. Meanwhile, 
administrators braced for a rumored countywide walkout today that is opposed by 
anti-Proposition 187 campaign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's largest protest occurred during the morning nutrition break at 
Belmont High School, when about 300 students marched toward Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 A mass school walkout originally was planned for today by the Latino activist 
group that staged a large protest march through Downtown last month. The group 
called off the walkout last week after parent complaints and an agreement with 
the district to encourage formal school discussion of the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But student leaders said they suspect that many will leave school anyway 
tomorrow. A statewide coalition of student groups opposed to Proposition 187 
has called for after-school sit-ins instead of walkouts today and on Monday, 
the day before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has increased the number of administrators and school police at 
high schools and middle schools for today. "The whole emphasis is to try to 
persuade the kids to stay in school," district spokesman Bill Rivera said.

DWP TO CUT STAFF BY 1,000 OVER 18 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from Los Angeles city leaders to streamline operations, the 
Department of Water and Power will reduce its staff by 1,000 employees -- 10% 
of its work force -- by July and will implement other cost-saving measures 
within the next 18 months, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP Director William R. McCarley said the staff reductions will account for 
$60 million of a projected $160-million savings between now and the end of 
fiscal 1995-96 -- cuts that must be made if the city wants to compete once the 
electric utility industry is deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a pleasant job to have to do this," McCarley told the department's 
Board of Water and Power commissioners, who unanimously approved the 
reductions. "But it is something we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts are the first phase of a plan to slice the DWP's 10,400-employee work 
force by up to 2,900 positions within five years, McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is hopeful that the reductions can be accomplished mostly through 
attrition, voluntary retirement and placement of employees in other city jobs. 
However, he predicted that up to 200 layoffs may be necessary to eliminate 
1,000 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply a fact of life," McCarley said. "It is being done in other 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the reductions are in place, he said, the DWP would be in a better 
position to upgrade its facilities or cut customers' rates. Some of the 
savings, City Council members contend, could also be used to help fund the 
expansion of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could give a long list on how we could use that money," Councilwoman Laura 
Chick said. "Using it to make the city safer would be the first on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 DWP employees and union leaders said that although they were dismayed by 
Tuesday's decision to cut staff, they were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everybody else, they're cutting," said a 30-year-old clerical worker who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've just got to accept it," said another clerical worker, a 34-year-old 
Mid-City woman who has worked for the DWP for 14 years. "I'm not very worried," 
she added with a laugh. "I'm old." 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Valverde, a clerk who has only been with the department for a year, 
called the cuts "the kiss of death." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a shame that they view this as a cash cow, and keep raiding it 
for all its money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Kamakeeaina, a construction worker who has been with the DWP for 18 
years, added: "All it boils down to is politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, city officials have long bashed the semi-independent DWP as wasteful 
and have sought to tap into its funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The department came under heated criticism last year after it was disclosed 
that the DWP had spent more than $800,000 on catered food at the time of a 
nine-day strike by employees. The utility's managers had previously been 
chastised for expensive charter airline flights and its handling of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, frustrated at the way the department was being run, hired a 
private firm in late 1993 to audit the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, they released the report, which urged the DWP to cut its staff by up 
to a quarter to save as much as $223 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, conducted by a New Hampshire-based consulting firm, compared the 
DWP to other utilities and found that it generally charged customers lower 
rates but that its expenses were high. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with deregulation of the power industry looming, the firm concluded 
that 2,300 to 2,900 employees should be cut from the work force to bring the 
DWP in line with the staffing of private utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the council, McCarley agreed to comply with the audit's 
findings and went to work on the first round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the result of many months of effort," McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the department will cut 20 administrators, 330 engineers and 
other professionals, 80 technicians, 150 clerks and 420 maintenance and 
construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley said he will report back to the Board of Commissioners within 30 days 
with a final list of reductions. He said he will also inform the City Council 
members of his plans. However, the DWP does not need their approval to move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The other cost-saving measures include cutting travel expenses and reducing 
equipment budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders praised the department's decision to make the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are running a utility here, not a charity," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick added: "I have been hearing for a long time and suspecting for a long 
time that there are ways to run DWP more efficiently. This is a first step in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I don't want to see job loss, I hate the idea we might have unneeded 
employees."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; LANDLORD 
HELD IN SLAYING, BURNING OF VICTIM'S BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Monterey Park man was ordered held on $1-million bail Tuesday on a charge 
that he murdered a tenant, dismembered his body and tried to get rid of the 
parts by burning them and throwing them into a dumpster.  
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment for Peter Earl Burza, 41, was set for Nov. 15 in Alhambra 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Burza was arrested Friday, when police arrived at his home and saw smoke 
rising from his chimney and smelled the pungent odor of burned flesh, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stanley Williams. Police were tipped by gas station 
employees who said they had seen Burza throwing something into their trash bin 
earlier in the day. Williams said the victim, Craig Russel Kensinger, 42, had 
recently begun renting a room at Burza's Monterey Park home.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN VOWS TO FIGHT 
FOR U.S. FUNDS TO BEEF UP LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) vowed Tuesday to fight for the maximum 
funding from President Clinton's crime bill so that Los Angeles can hire more 
police officers and, in particular, increase patrols in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to the city Police Commission, Berman urged police and city officials 
to take advantage of the new $8.8-billion crime bill by submitting an 
aggressive application to bolster the Los Angeles Police Department's force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting more cops on the beat in the communities of Los Angeles is the single 
most effective step we can take to confront the scourge of crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman said he that hopes whatever crime bill funding is approved 
will mean more officers in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really ought to be 1,000 more officers in the Valley," he said an an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by Berman's promise of support, officials said they will consider 
applying for a waiver of federal funding limits when they submit an application 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "His support is very important because he's a very influential member of 
Congress," said Michael Thompson, city director of criminal justice planning 
who is helping draft the city's funding application. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill that Congress passed in August, cities, towns and counties that 
wish to share in the $8.8 billion earmarked for hiring police are required to 
submit plans to the Justice Department explaining how the officers will be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bill offers to pay only about $25,000 per officer per year for a 
three-year period and cities must provide 25% of the cost.  
</P>
<P>
 Because it costs Los Angeles as much as $100,000 annually to pay for a new 
officer's salary, training and equipment, the city would have to pick up most 
of the costs of each new officer even if an application is approved, Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's application is likely to seek between $75 million and $100 million, 
enough to fund at least 500 new officers and equipment, Thompson said. Federal 
officials are expected to decided on the applications by July. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman said that if the U.S. attorney general grants a waiver for proposed 
limits, the bill can pay more for each officer. He added that if Los Angeles is 
willing to exceed its 25% share, the attorney general may also increase the 
per-officer amount funded by the bill. HUGO MARTIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; MENENDEZES' 
BID TO SUPPRESS TAPED CONFESSION REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a bid by Lyle and Erik Menendez to block the most direct evidence 
against them, a state appellate court has ruled that prosecutors may present 
the audiotape in which the brothers confess to their psychologist that they 
killed their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal turned down a defense claim that the 
61-minute tape, recorded on Dec. 11, 1989, was once again secret under the 
rules of confidentiality between a therapist and patient -- although it was 
played at the brothers' first trial.The defense bid was based on 
technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Any secrecy, the court said in a unanimous ruling Monday, evaporated because 
the brothers made their mental state the central issue in the first trial. 
Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's chief attorney, vowed Tuesday to appeal to the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, the brothers tell psychologist L. Jerome Oziel that they killed 
their mother to put her "out of her misery" and that their father's infidelity 
caused her despair. Lyle Menendez also comments that while he missed his 
parents, he also missed "not having my dog around." 
</P>
<P>
 At their first trial, Lyle Menendez, now 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, admitted 
to the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents but testified 
that they fired in fear after years of abuse. Prosecutors contended that the 
brothers killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 That trial ended in January with separate juries deadlocked between murder and 
manslaughter charges. Their retrial is set March 13.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
D.A. OPENS INQUIRY INTO VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office announced Tuesday that it has opened a criminal 
investigation into allegations of voter registration fraud in Burbank, Pasadena 
and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said several people have been 
interviewed and that the investigation should be completed in two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry was started at the request of the County Board of Supervisors 
after Registrar-Recorder Bea Valdez confirmed several instances of voter fraud 
reported by the media. The fraud ranged from a dog being registered to 
discoveries that 11 people were improperly registered at one address.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; JOB TRAINING 
PROGRAM AVOIDS THREATENED EVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Compton nonprofit job training program that faced eviction from the building 
it has occupied for 25 years will get to stay there after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-Cities Assn. for Retarded Citizens reached an agreement Tuesday with 
the building's owner under which the organization will begin paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate dealer bought the property on Alameda Street at auction after 
the building fell into default on property taxes. Mid-Cities officials said 
they fell behind in tax payments because the county failed to give proper 
notice. The county denied any improprieties. Mid-Cities will pay $1,476 a month 
to the new owner, Frank Prior. Half the money will go to a trust fund to be 
distributed after the issue of ownership is resolved in Superior Court next 
March. Program officials said they are the rightful owners because they would 
have paid taxes had they known they were due.

BODIES OF 2 MISSING MEN ARE FOUND IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>

 Two Redondo Beach men who disappeared mysteriously last week from a Torrance 
cellular phone store were found dead in a San Diego parking lot, and police 
said they are investigating the possibility that they were kidnaped and 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies, discovered Monday, were identified from fingerprints Tuesday as 
Peter Kovach, 26, and Ted Gould, 29, said Lt. Wally Murker of the Torrance 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The two disappeared from the small phone and beeper shop where they worked the 
evening of Oct. 26. When the owner arrived at the shop late that night, the 
front door was unlocked, the lights were on and the missing men's car keys were 
still on their desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at Rossfelder Corp., a light industrial firm in northern San Diego, 
discovered the bodies about 9 a.m. in the parking lot behind a commercial 
laundry, police said. The workers initially believed the bodies were mannequins 
and part of a Halloween prank, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the men, who had been dead for several days, may have been 
killed elsewhere and dumped at the San Diego site. They have no suspects and no 
motive for the disappearance, Murker said. Authorities would not release 
information about the condition of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop's owner, R. J. Panah, said he drove by the store at 11 p.m. on Oct. 
26, noticed the lights on and stopped by. Panah said a friend of Gould's told 
him that the men were missing when he had arrived at the store three hours 
earlier for a dinner appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 No cash, furniture or merchandise was missing. In fact, Gould's prescription 
sunglasses were left in the shop, as was Kovach's $1,200 cellular phone. The 
men never left without those items, Panah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, who described the men as model employees, was notified of the discovery 
of the bodies Tuesday. Gould had worked at the shop only three weeks before he 
disappeared, Panah said, and Kovach had worked there about a year.

HALLOWEEN PARTY IN COMPTON ENDS WITH DEATH OF 2 YOUTHS; CRIME: TEEN-AGERS ARE 
FATALLY SHOT BY TWO MEN CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLES. POLICE SAY GANG WARFARE MAY BE 
INVOLVED.

 Standing in the middle of a now-quiet Compton street, Danayne Ashorn holds a 
9-millimeter shell casing that may have been wrapped around the bullet that 
killed her son, Frank. A thick swath of dried blood remains on the sidewalk 
where he died.  
</P>
<P>
 Ashorn's son, Frank Isaac Martinez, 14, and his friend, Jose Zermeno, 15, 
attended a Halloween party Monday night called "Monsters in the Closets." A 
recording directing people to the house in the 1200 block of North Spring 
Street requested that party-goers "come in peace. We don't want no snappers 
(troublemakers)." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite that plea, Frank and Jose were slain by two men carrying 
semiautomatic assault-style rifles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 p.m., Frank and Jose were standing on the sidewalk in a group of 
about 10 people when two African American men dressed in black walked by and 
fired into the gathering, police said. Frank died at the scene and Jose died 
later at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A gang war between rival black and Latino gangs has been going on in the area 
for more than a year, according to community activist Lorraine Cervantes. 
Compton police detectives believe that the shooting may have been gang-related, 
but they did not know if Frank or Jose belonged to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police offered few details about Jose on Tuesday and were even uncertain about 
the spelling of his name. Eyewitnesses said he was a student at Paramount High 
School. Administrators acknowledged that a student named Jose Zermeno was 
enrolled there, but would not say if he was the second victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Frank, many of whom gathered with his mother at the place where 
he died, said he was not a gang member. Instead, he and his friends described 
themselves as a "party crew" called Mind Events that promotes underground 
parties featuring house music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just kick back with a couple of friends," said Elena Torrez, 18. "It's not 
a gang or a clique. Just friends looking out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved music," his mother said. "When he was younger he loved baseball, 
football and wrestling. But lately all he wanted to do was go dancing and 
listen to music." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashorn said the sharpest pain comes when she recalls that police officers 
would not let her hold her son's body in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked so frail," she said. "He didn't look like my son. He had a hat on 
and I lifted it up and looked into his eyes. They were full of hurt and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends say Frank, a freshman at Compton High School, was a bright spot 
in everyone's day. He was the only one who could make his half brother, Little 
Frankie, stop crying. On Tuesday morning, his 2-year-old brother called out 
"Kiki, Kiki," not knowing that his older brother would not be there. "Whenever 
I came over mad and hurting, he'd do something to make me laugh," Annette 
Moreno said. "He'd tell me a joke and make me feel better, and then he'd tell 
me I owed him money for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank's mother said she was also sorry that he did not get to know his father, 
Frank Sr., better. They were reunited in June after a 10-year separation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just getting to know him," Ashorn said. "But now his father has been 
robbed of his son. We're all robbed. They robbed us of our joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Compton police continued to look for suspects Tuesday. Ashorn urged anyone who 
has information to come forward.

AIKMAN

<P>
 Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer is upset about what he sees as a deliberate 
attempt to hurt quarterback Troy Aikman, and he's complaining to the NFL about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 What has Switzer angry is a head-shot by Cincinnati's James Francis during 
Sunday's game, won by the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew what he was doing and it was uncalled for," Switzer said. "He went to 
Troy's head and that bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals received a 15-yard penalty for the blow. Dallas got an extra 
chance on the fourth-and-nine incomplete pass and eventually scored a touchdown 
on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive week Aikman had been hit in the head. He 
suffered a concussion the previous week when he was hit by Arizona's Wilber 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman did not appear to be injured by the Francis hit.

 The San Antonio Spurs, saying they will not tolerate Dennis Rodman's 
outbursts, suspended the star forward without pay Tuesday, one day after he was 
ejected from his team's final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get his attention as best we can," Coach Bob Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spur General Manager Gregg Popovich said team officials will decide soon on 
the length of the suspension. However, he will be suspended at least through 
Friday's season opener against Golden State. 
</P>

 Rodman, 33, who led the league in rebounding last season with an average of 
17.3 a game, earns a reported $2.4 million per year.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; DANZIG FALTERS; TYPE O GIVES INFUSION OF ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Danzig returned to Irvine Meadows on Monday night to rule as the 
amphitheater's dark lord of Halloween for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig and his band, also called Danzig, had a rewarding night of 
trick-or-treating the first time through: Four live tracks recorded at Irvine 
on Halloween, 1992, helped propel the subsequent EP, "Thrall-Demonsweatlive," 
past the gold sales mark earlier this year, giving the band its biggest success 
since it came on the hard-rock scene in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Danzig arrived needing another good turn of fortune, its new, 
widely publicized album, "Danzig 4," having fallen like a dropped pumpkin 
recently after debuting in the Top 30 on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig, the commander of a sizable but still not massive following, has 
wondered in print lately why he isn't a first-magnitude star in the heavy-metal 
firmament. Playing to some 10,000 believers, he answered his own question with 
an inconsistent performance that had its persuasive moments but lacked vocal 
power and the aura of diabolical, titanic potency that he hopes to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig's singing reconstitutes Jim Morrison's oft-copied style in much the 
same way that Dr. Frankenstein's experimenting reanimated used body parts. It 
breathes new life into the dead but leaves the revived entity shambling about 
rather awkwardly, with scars and stitch marks showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig's collection of Morrisonian moans, bellows and bluesy howls often 
wavered or fell flat under the Black Sabbath-influenced stampede of his three 
band mates -- guitarist John Christ (who played with authority and with a 
no-noodling sense of economy rare in a featured metal ax-wielder), bassist 
Eerie Von, and drummer Randy Castillo, a capable new recruit who has replaced 
original member Chuck Biscuits. There were no indulgent solos to interrupt the 
flow of the 90-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig, who writes the band's material, does a better job stitching together 
his songs than he did putting them across. The show offered plenty of catchy 
shout-along choruses in a traditional metal mode, and they came with a good mix 
of tempos and moods. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hard-chugging speed runs that stirred up considerable frenzy in the 
pit, including the Blue Oyster Cult-ish hit "Mother" and "Twist of Cain." Among 
the other strong points were a swaying, darkly romantic ballad, "Going Down to 
Die," and such swaggering, blues-tinged fare as "She Rides" and "Dirty Black 
Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig's inflated, cosmic-scale depictions of rebellion, destruction and 
erotic unions require a stage Prometheus if the writer's ideas are to be 
amplified along with his music. Danzig's cosmology seems to have parallels to 
the idiosyncratic one envisioned 200 years ago by the poet William Blake in 
"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," wherein the biblical God -- or at least the 
one conceived of by many literal interpreters of the Bible -- is seen as a 
tyrannical old control freak, and Satan gets points for rebelling and stirring 
up some excitement in an otherwise stillborn universe. Danzig's version is 
shallow, however, his lyrics constantly rehashing vague, hand-me-down conceits 
that he fails to flesh out with imaginative stories or memorable 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The muscular bandleader's performance fell far short of Promethean, despite 
energetic efforts that included lots of the shadowboxing, fist shaking and pose 
striking typical of old-line heavy-metal front men from the '70s and early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Between songs, Danzig was barely more talkative than the Frankenstein's 
monster played by Boris Karloff. Instead, he chose to commune physically with 
the moshing masses, many of whom dived forward atop a pack of bodies to touch 
the star's hand or shout song lyrics into the microphone he stretched out to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to Danzig's encore guest, Rob Zombie of the band White Zombie, to 
add a stroke of playfulness and unpredictability. Dressed in a long coat and 
looking like a seedy embodiment of Jethro Tull's famous perverted vagrant, 
Aqualung, Zombie lurched, flopped and stumbled about the stage, then started a 
shooting war with the audience, using as ammunition a harvest of 
jack-o'-lanterns he plucked from atop a stack of amplifiers. Danzig, who craves 
a hit, took a direct one to the legs in a closing cross-fire that completely 
upstaged anything he had done during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Type O Negative is a band to watch as it weaves a stylistic 
patchwork that puts a fresh shine on that rusty old metal. As the New York City 
band worked through several long, episodic numbers from its album, "Bloody 
Kisses," it alternated between the glowering, minor-key riffing of its 
acknowledged heroes, Black Sabbath, and richly melodic sequences of poppy, 
keyboard-festooned progressive and psychedelic rock that called to mind the 
Moody Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's key asset is the arresting, highly theatrical deep baritone voice 
of bassist Peter Steele, whose impact and clarity were far beyond Brad Roberts' 
similar bass-range vocals featured in Crash Test Dummies. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved to the top of his range, the tall, thin, sallow-looking singer 
came across with rising urgency. In slower passages (and the band favors slow 
tempos), Steele sometimes sounded as if he were on the verge of breaking into 
an impassioned "Nights in White Satin." 
</P>
<P>
 A slowed-down cover of the hard-riffing Black Sabbath oldie "Paranoid" brought 
out new dimensions of anguish and humanity in that well-traveled song. Leading 
into the Sabs number was a cover of Seals & Crofts' "Summer Breeze" that was at 
least as sincere as it was tweaking. 
</P>
<P>
 While leading with a fairly straightforward sensibility that overlays today's 
commonplace baleful pessimism with dark romanticism, Steele and company also 
showed a sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, especially in the made-for-Halloween 
ditty "Black No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Steele intoned between-songs commentary in a voice that combined the low 
rumble of the Addams' Family butler, Lurch, and the droll wit of Alfred 
Hitchcock. "With a face like mine, every day is Halloween," he mused. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Type O Negative's more important message is that, while all the hard-rock 
sounds and styles may have become shopworn, new combinations are still 
possible, and not every young, metal-influenced band need sound alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles newcomers Engines of Aggression didn't start hitting on all 
cylinders until their half an hour was almost up. The band's sound is pieced 
together from hip-hop (both in prerecorded beats and sampled bits of dialogue 
and sound effects), Nine Inch Nails-like industrial rock and melodic hard rock. 
But what often works well on the album, "Inhuman Nature," coalesced only 
fleetingly on stage.

 Every year about this time, director Tony Reverditto of the Way Off Broadway 
Playhouse assembles a sort of boohaha to celebrate Halloween. This year's is 
called "The Way Off the Wall Murder Mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is, as are all the company's comedy efforts, very off the wall. 
Reverditto, who wrote the script along with his cast, has gathered characters 
ludicrous and loony, most of them familiar to WOB audiences, such as intrepid 
and dribbling private eye Spit Phlegmster (David Walloch), Jan Tiehen's 
grimacing, gravel-voiced Leona Helmsley, and Reverditto's own Judge 
Cottonmouth, who usually loses not only the wads he is chewing but also, 
somewhere along the line, the cotton eyebrows he hides behind. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some unfamiliar faces, too: the silent and mysterious prelate Monk 
Fish (James LaFave); very funny and very young Adam Jaso as Munchkin-sounding, 
diapered, cigar-chomping Pip Squeek, and an amusing scrounge of a torn-jeaned 
and dog-collared Prosecutor (Steve Andreno). 
</P>
<P>
 What they're all doing is a sort of sendup of those "murder mystery weekends" 
so popular locally. The audience is seated in the Mystery Lounge, where 
chanteuse Veronica Bacall (Laura Spurlock) is murdered during a blackout. Or is 
she? Then, along with the above-mentioned suspects (and more), we are taken to 
the Mystery Funeral Home for the last rites and viewing. During intermission, 
the whole lot is arrested: Act 2 finds everyone in County Jail and County 
Courthouse, where, you're right, here come de judge. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If it isn't anywhere near the Kids in the Hall, it does have some funny gags 
and a few good lines (and on opening night, some inadvertent goofs got laughs 
of their own). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the suspects is stand-up comic O.J. Pimpson (Godfrey Huguey) joking 
about you-know-what and wearing a T-shirt that says "Stay Alive on the 405!" 
But it's Halloween, and it's all in fun.

THEATER REVIEWS; TENDER 'REMEMBRANCE' OF LOVE AMID HATRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if "the Troubles" in Ireland seem to be on their way to some sort of 
conclusion, a healing of the pain will be a long time coming. As one of the 
characters in Graham Reid's "Remembrance" at International City Theatre says, 
the hatred didn't begin in 1916; it's been around for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The play begins in a graveyard in Northern Ireland, where Bert (Jack Axelrod) 
has come to visit the grave of his son, Sam, and Theresa (Bobbi Holtzman) that 
of her son, Peter. They strike up a casual friendship that slowly ripens into 
something much more. 
</P>
<P>
 They're in their 60s but find that it's not too late for companionship, and 
love. The only problem is their families, for Sam was Protestant and Peter was 
Catholic, slaughtered in the senseless, age-old struggle. Bert and Theresa have 
seen it all and, in their maturity, have found a wisdom that helps to obscure 
the prejudices that fire the young in any generation. 
</P>
<P>
 When her two volatile daughters and his alcoholic son discover the 
relationship, the expected explosions occur, and only the golden glow of the 
relationship between Bert and Theresa eventually tends to dampen their 
ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remembrance" is an oddly touching dramatic comedy, which is in no way 
dependent upon the Irish question. And that's to its benefit. Except for a 
denouement that too neatly wraps up unresolved questions, it is a gentle poem 
not only to late-blooming love, but to a true love that can rise above many 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Shashin Desai treats the text with tender understanding and stages it 
effectively on Bradley Kaye's tri-part set, where both Bert and Theresa's 
homes, and the graveyard bench where they meet, are beautifully illuminated 
like soft-focus album photos in Paulie Jenkins' lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod is exceptional as Bert, with humor and a sly, knowing way with a 
phrase that gives his characterization a sense of the richness of his heart. 
Holtzman's Theresa shines with the inner light of a woman fatigued by a 
difficult life but refreshed in Bert's affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Their adult children are a mess, but the actors provide a naturalistic 
solidity behind their surface that allows one to appreciate why their parents 
still abide their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Bell Denton, as Theresa's bitter younger daughter, and particularly 
Judith Bohannon as her randy sister, whose husband is serving a life sentence 
for murder, are nicely etched portraits. Tom Sminkey is right on target as 
Bert's defensive and frustrated policeman son, and Betsy Mohler gives the son's 
ex-wife a nice sharp edge atop her sensible base. 
</P>
<P>
 The flawed finale takes some of the shine off the evening, but the 
production's advantages help restore a bit of the glow. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; WORDS FAIL 'MACK AND MABEL'; ENERGETIC CHOREOGRAPHY AND 
PERFORMANCES KEEP CSUF'S PRODUCTION MOVING ALONG DESPITE A SLUGGISH BOOK.

<P>
 Throughout Cal State Fullerton's production of Jerry Herman's "Mack and 
Mabel," a nagging question keeps interrupting: Why would anyone want to revive 
this show? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, on the surface "M&M" (melts on the stage, not in your heart) appears 
to have a lot going for it: two sparkling personalities of the silent film era 
-- comedy meister Mack Sennett and ageless comedian Mabel Normand -- and, for 
its composer to mine, one of the most interesting, rapidly changing and 
fruitful eras of musical invention in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of molding these ingredients into something of substance, book 
writer Michael Stewart not only has bent film history beyond its breaking 
point, he has created a juvenile, simplistic bio-fiction about his two 
protagonists and has surrounded them with an early Hollywood that makes 
"Singin' in the Rain" look like Chekhov. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of composer Jerry Herman's score, meanwhile, sounds retread from his 
other shows. "When Mabel Comes in the Room" is a signature, leading-lady tune 
that could be sung in counterpoint to Herman's anthems to Mame and Dolly 
without clashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Has this production overcome all these problems? Only here and there. It's a 
good-looking show, as classy as a lot of Broadway musicals were in the days 
before the genre developed elephantiasis.  
</P>
<P>
 Co-directed by Donn Finn and Broadway veteran Lara Teeter, it moves along, 
except for some of the book sections, which seem too sluggish. But maybe that's 
the tone the directors want (the musical direction by Jeff Fairbanks is pretty 
sluggish itself). It's as though Finn and Teeter are trying to make it all seem 
important by giving it heaviness. But "Mack and Mabel" is only a Woolworth's 
trinket, not a Cartier tiara. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest advantages are some of the performances. Kirsten S. Vangsness' 
Mabel is delightful from her poor-Irish homespun in Act One through her 
sequined gowns in Act Two. She fills them all with authority, energy and a 
quick, puckish humor that hints of the original Mabel, along with the naive 
confusion that beset Normand's later career. And Vangsness sings like a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Bishop has the hurdle of Stewart's Sennett to surmount: He must play a 
loud-mouthed, vulgar egomaniac and make him likable. Bishop almost succeeds in 
making the difficult switches required, even within short scenes. He handles 
the vocals with ease and a vibrancy that sometimes makes the melodies seem 
better than they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also outstanding: triple-talented Dana Meller as a Sennett star who does 
better when talkies come in; a very funny Katie Zerga as Sennett's "music 
department"; Ryan James Orr as the watchman who sings that song about Mabel 
coming into the room, and Matt Schliecher as an all-purpose combo silent film 
comic. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter's bright, fresh choreography, Todd Muffatti's settings, Robert C. 
Mumm's lighting, Juan Lopez's costumes, John R. Fisher's sound design and the 
makeup/hair designs of Natalie Carter are top-notch. 
</P>

 Bobby Valentine became the first former major league manager to be hired to 
manage in Japan, with the announcement Tuesday that he had signed with the 
Chibe Lotte Marines. Valentine, fired by the Texas Rangers during the 1992 
season after more than six years in the job, reportedly signed with the Marines 
for $1 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine's contract also is said to have incentive clauses that will pay him 
$600,000 to $1.7 million a year extra, depending on how high the Marines 
finish. The club did not disclose terms of the deal, which was in the works for 
about a month.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; ACROSS THE NATION; SWITZER SAYS FOES WANT TO INJURE 
AIKMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer is upset about what he sees as a deliberate 
attempt to hurt quarterback Troy Aikman, and he's complaining to the NFL about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer's anger stems from a head shot by Cincinnati's James Francis during 
Sunday's game, won by the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew what he was doing and it was uncalled for," Switzer said. "He went to 
Troy's head and that bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals received a 15-yard penalty for the blow. Dallas got an extra 
chance on the fourth-and-nine incomplete pass and eventually scored a touchdown 
on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive week Aikman had been hit in the head. He 
suffered a concussion the previous week when he was hit by Arizona's Wilber 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Insisting they aren't giving up on quarterback David Klingler, Bengal general 
manager Mike Brown says he agrees with Coach Dave Shula that Jeff Blake earned 
another start after throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns Sunday in a 23-20 
loss to the Dallas Cowboys. "But I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that there's 
been a permanent change," Brown said. Klingler's knee injury two weeks ago gave 
Blake his chance.

 San Francisco 49ers right tackle Harris Barton, who tore his left triceps in 
the season opener, is on pace to return for Sunday's game at Washington, about

knee, might also play Sunday, Coach George Seifert said.

 Denver offensive coordinator Jim Fassel plans to change several audibles and 
checks that quarterback John Elway uses for Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Ram backup quarterback Tommy Maddox knows the Bronco offense, 
having backed up Elway for two seasons in Denver before being traded to the 
Rams in August.

 Rookie Isaac Bruce, the sixth receiver taken in the draft, is second among 
rookie receivers in touchdowns with three, trailing only Cincinnati's Darnay 
Scott, who has four. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, who's second-string behind Flipper Anderson and Jessie Hester and plays 
in passing downs, is second on the team in touchdown catches behind tight end 
Troy Drayton (four).

 With the bye week, Ram tailback Jerome Bettis dropped to fourth in the NFL 
with 723 yards in 200 carries, trailing Detroit's Barry Sanders (1,035 yards in 
188 carries), Dallas' Emmitt Smith (748 yards in 184 carries) and Indianapolis 
rookie Marshall Faulk (812 yards in 196 carries). Bettis' longest run from 
scrimmage this season is 19 yards, the third-lowest among the top 20 rushers in 
the league.

 Denver running back Leonard Russell, who sprained his left ankle in the fourth 
quarter of the Broncos' 26-14 victory over Cleveland, is questionable for 
Sunday's game. Don Maggs, whom the Rams were interested in as a free agent last 
spring, will start at right tackle in place of Russell Freeman (fractured eye 
socket). MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCGLOCKTON WOULD MAKE ALL-SWAT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some defensive players seem to specialize in sacks. Others go for 
interceptions. But tackle Chester McGlockton might be working on his own unique 
category: Most swats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter of last Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers at the 
Coliseum, McGlockton barreled through the line and, as quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver pulled his arm back to throw, McGlockton slapped the ball free with a 
flick of his wrist, showing the hand speed of a magician. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluke play? 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Houston got the ball, Tolliver was again back to pass and 
McGlockton was again back to join him for yet another swat. Raider teammate 
Nolan Harrison recovered both fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the highlights of another big day for McGlockton, who also 
recovered a fumble and recorded two sacks and seven solo tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a typical day for McGlockton, who leads the Raiders with five 
sacks and has been dominant in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been playing like that all year," Coach Art Shell said. "You may not see 
it stat wise, but he's always in the area of the quarterback when he's throwing 
the ball. He's always one of the first guys there, always making tackles up and 
down the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about all these defensive tackles in the league. I don't know if 
there's one better than this guy. You might say I'm prejudiced, but the guy is 
a great player." 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight has been elsewhere on the line. Anthony Smith, who came into the 
season with 36 sacks over the three previous years and was getting his first 
chance to be a starter, got much of the attention at the beginning. Scott Davis 
got his moment in the spotlight by avoiding it, disappearing for two weeks to 
take care of unspecified personal business. Jerry Ball has drawn a lot of 
notice. So has Harrison, who has effectively switched from tackle to end to 
make room for Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton? A player who rarely talks to the media and likes to keep a low 
profile, he has, however, been getting most of his attention from opposing 
teams. STEVE SPRINGER

 Washington State Coach Mike Price, on Saturday's USC game: 
</P>
<P>
 "The USC game is one of the biggest games in my tenure here. The Arizona game 
was a big game, but there were still a lot of games left. . . . Beating USC is 
one of the things our seniors want to do more than anything. USC is one team 
they haven't knocked off yet."

 USC Coach John Robinson is worried about the team's depth at guard with Phalen 
Pounds sidelined because of a knee injury and Chris Brymer possibly sidelined 
because of an ankle sprain. "We'd get down to scout team players if we had to 
replace anyone else," Robinson said.

 Washington State, which defeated UCLA in September, has never beaten UCLA and 
USC in the same season. . . . Linebacker Errick Herrin moved into second place 
on the USC tackles list. He had six against California and now has 50, trailing 
only leader Jeff Kopp, who has 65. EARL GUSTKEY

FISH REPORT: LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE BEST OF LUNKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catfish might be giving way to trout as the primary target of Southland 
anglers, but at Ventura County's Lake Casitas, largemouth bass still reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fish topped 10 pounds in the last week, with the biggest -- an 
11-pound 12-ounce fish -- landed by Robert Hefernam of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course catfish still have some feeding to do at Casitas before settling 
down for the winter.  
</P>
<P>
 George Collier of Port Hueneme proved that by filling a stringer with seven 
fish totaling 90 pounds.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: 993-POUND BLUE MARLIN LEAVES THESE ANGLERS SEEING 
GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baja's biggest and the world's richest billfish tournament has come and gone, 
but for some, the memories are sure to linger. 
</P>
<P>
 One fleet operator called this year's Bisbee's Black and Blue marlin 
tournament off Cabo San Lucas "the most successful, nerve-racking and 
productive" in its 14-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeana Medina, a Bisbee's employee, went a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humongous, unbelievable . . . I've never seen anything like it," she said. 
"But then I've never been there. This is my first one." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Joe (Rocky) Gentile's first tournament, a profitable one at that. 
Gentile, a Chatsworth resident fishing aboard the Picante, landed the biggest 
fish the tournament has ever produced -- a 993-pound blue marlin that took only 
25 minutes to boat -- on the first day last Thursday. The fish earned his team 
-- one of 135 in the event -- $321,510 in prize money and, for being the first 
fish weighing more than 750 pounds, a $280,000 boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that only a few fish that size have ever been caught off Land's 
End, Gentile's was considered a sure winner until it was learned that a few 
miles offshore, an angler aboard the Juanita VII was battling one estimated at 
more than 1,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But at dusk, 10 hours into the fight, his fish broke free. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pisces Fleet owner Tracy Ehrenberg: "It was rumored that you could hear 
the anglers crying from the Solmar (Hotel) beach." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't the only ones. A team aboard the Jonathan IV brought a large 
marlin to the boat, but the crew accidentally backed over it, mutilating the 
fish and disqualifying it, costing the team a chance at some of the more than 
$1 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of conservation, only marlin of 300 pounds or more qualified for 
the tournament. And only 19 -- 17 blues and two blacks -- met that requirement. 
More than 100 were released. And although 19 marlin died so a few fishermen 
could profit, they at least played a part in raising $40,600 for charities and 
giving a much-needed boost to the Cabo economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A baby tiger shark was caught off the Manhattan Beach Pier late last Thursday 
night -- the second in six weeks. That would seem to indicate that there are 
more of the little beasts around. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, brings up a troubling question: Are their mothers, which can 
measure 25 feet and bite a swimmer in half, still around? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not, considering that tiger sharks -- commonly found in sub-tropical 
and tropical seas -- prefer water temperatures well above the low 60s currently 
off our coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Seigel, an ichthyologist and shark expert at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History, said it was possible that the mothers "pupped" off 
the Southern California coast during last year's El Nino or this summer -- when 
temperatures were slightly above normal -- and moved out when the water cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think the young sharks would be trying to find warmer water, too," 
Seigel said. "Maybe that's why they're staying in the shallows and being caught 
from the pier." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sharks were about three feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lowly buzzard? 
</P>
<P>
 No bird has ever flown higher, says Outside magazine, citing an incident more 
than 20 years ago, when a vulture collided with a commercial jet at 37,000 feet 
over Africa's Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the bird probably got caught in a strong updraft and froze to 
death in the icy heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, Outside's Patrick Clinton says, but "whether he was a visionary or 
just a frozen ball of feathers tossed in the path of destiny, he still got 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Some birds do actually fly above the clouds. In 1967, 30 whooper swans were 
spotted by a pilot flying at 27,000 feet off western Scotland. A mallard was 
recorded at 21,000 feet over Nevada in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding duck hunters, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- The Oceanside and San Diego fleets continue to find large schools 
of tuna south of the border. Anglers are averaging about three fish per rod, 
with yellowfin in the 10- to 25-pound class making up most of the catch. 
Farther down the Baja coast, there is an abundance of tuna -- and other fish. 
The American Angler returned from a 10-day trip Tuesday with 390 yellowfin, 156 
dorado, 50 yellowtail, 32 wahoo, 25 marlin (16 released) and four sailfish. All 
the way down, off Cabo San Lucas, billfish remain the focus of attention, in 
large part because this is tournament time. But anglers can't help but notice 
the dorado. The colorful dolphins are striking feathers up and down both sides 
of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 FRESHWATER -- The 61.8-pound catfish pulled from Irvine Lake by Westminster's 
Le Hai last week was determined by biologists to be a blue catfish and thus it 
becomes a new state record. The previous record was a 59.4-pounder also caught 
at Irvine, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- A drawing for two new pheasant hunts in the San Joaquin Valley will 
be held Nov. 9. The hunts -- at the state's Los Banos Wildlife Area and near 
Merced on the weekends of Nov. 19-20 and 26-27 -- are geared for the family. If 
a hunter is drawn, he or she may take a family member along. Details: (209) 
222-3761.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; MISTRI EYES SPOT IN NCAA SOCCER 
PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been a season of highs and lows for Cal State Fullerton men's soccer, 
but Coach Al Mistri is optimistic his team can finish strong and gain an 
at-large berth in the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's chances were boosted last weekend when the Titans upset top-ranked 
Indiana, 3-2, in overtime, then tied Notre Dame, 2-2, to win the MetLife 
tournament at UCLA with a 1-0-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mistri says that doesn't make his team a clear choice for an at-large 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, have improved to 10-6-2, and climbed back into Soccer 
America's Top 20 this week (No. 17). The loss dropped Indiana (17-2) to second 
with South Carolina (15-2) taking over the top spot. Indiana defeated UCLA, 
2-0, in its second match in the UCLA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has two regular-season games remaining: one at home Thursday night 
against California and the other at Loyola Marymount next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri hopes the Titans can finish as one of the top four teams in the Far 
West region. If that happens, he said, the Titans will have a good shot at a 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked UCLA (15-2) and 14th-ranked Fresno State have clinched their 
divisions in the Mountain Pacific Soccer Federation and will meet Nov. 13 to 
determine who gets the NCAA automatic bid. The loser will get strong 
consideration for an at-large bid. The only other ranked team in the West, 
Santa Clara at 11-4-1, is in range of its conference championship and an 
automatic bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans did receive an at-large bid last year and made the most of it. They 
were 13-6 in the regular season, then won three consecutive playoff games to 
advance to the NCAA's semifinals before losing to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior scoring leader Eddie Soto has 13 goals this season and 33 in his 
career. He needs two to tie the career school record for goals set by Mike Fox 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto has been on a roll lately. He has scored at least once in each of the 
last four games and has six goals in that span. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be able to tie the record this week at home," Soto said. "It 
would be a nice farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' Heather Killeen, who missed last year's Big West cross-country 
meet because of a hip injury, still is aching with disappointment from another 
bad break in last weekend's conference event. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronchitis, combined with the 4,600-feet altitude at Logan, Utah, turned out 
to be too much for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was about 20 seconds ahead with less than a half-mile to go, but her 
blood oxygen got so low that her body just quit on her," Coach John Elders 
said. "It was amazing that she was able to finish the race. The doctors 
speculated that she may have suffered a mild seizure at that point. Apparently, 
the bronchitis and the altitude brought it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Killeen finished fourth even though she virtually staggered at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says she didn't remember a thing that happened in that last half-mile of 
the race," Elders said. "It's really a shame because she was clearly the best 
in the conference, and that's not meant to discredit the people who finished 
ahead of her, because a couple of them ran the race of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 She stayed an extra day in Utah to recover, and returned home late Sunday. 
Whether Killeen can be back in good health in time for the NCAA Regional 
Championships, Nov. 12 in Tucson, Ariz., still is uncertain, Elders said. 
"She's fatigued right now, but we should know more in a few days," Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's and men's teams finished fourth in the conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sinderson led the Fullerton men, finishing sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 are expected for tonight's "20 Years of Excellence" reception and 
dinner paying tribute to the Fullerton women's gymnastics program. The alumni 
returning for the event include the program's first NCAA champion, Carolyn 
Burdick, and its first All-American in the sport, Julie Knight, now an

round of the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; IS HE FREE OR NOT? BAGWELL DOESN'T KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the National League's most valuable player, Jeff Bagwell symbolizes the 
contract uncertainty confronting players, agents and general managers at a time 
when no one is sure what rules will apply and most clubs have yet to set budget 
parameters because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, the Houston Astros' first baseman, might be eligible for salary 
arbitration or he might not. 
</P>
<P>
 He might be eligible for free agency or he might not. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have a lot of leverage or he might have none. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I approach Jeff's situation? That's a $64-billion question," his 
attorney, Barry Axelrod, said. "What I'm seeing and reading is that the general 
managers don't know what to do. They don't know if they're constrained by a 
$12-million budget or may have twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of any rules, I'm trying to proceed as if it's business as 
usual with my players, but we're all pretty much dead in the water, paralyzed 
so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell ended the 1993 season with three years of major league service, 
qualifying for arbitration. He filed for that process, then negotiated a 
one-year, $2.4-million contract with the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, because of the strike that began Aug. 12, Bagwell is without the service 
time that would give him a fourth full year and make him eligible for 
restricted free agency -- the Astros would have right of first refusal -- under 
the new compensation system proposed by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he get that service time back when an agreement is finally reached? Will 
a new free agency system be part of it, starting with fourth-year players 
rather than the current sixth-year men? Will salary arbitration still be an 
option or will it be eliminated, as the owners have proposed? 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to have the answers, which suggests the owners weren't looking 
ahead when they began this fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod, of course, wants to see his client prosper and knows the teams have 
taken a financial beating and have no money coming in from the paralyzed sale 
of tickets for a season that might not be played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hearing that the premier players won't be hurt, that the money will 
still be there," he said. "We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 free agents were eligible to begin signing with any team on 
Monday, but it is difficult to predict what will evolve. No team seems to be 
caught in more of a quandary than the Angels, who would like to reduce their 
$23-million payroll of last year -- including $3 million to Gary Gaetti -- but 
may actually have to raise it to reach the floor of the owners' proposed salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, General Manager Bill Bavasi insists he won't wait, that he hopes to 
be active right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to assume that no matter what plan is in effect, free agency will be 
part of it," he said. "I expect free agents to be signed and that the top 
players will receive the same money they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going after people. We may not have the money to compete with the big 
boys, but we're going to make an effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' priorities are a right-handed starting pitcher, a closer and one 
more power hitter. Among their interests: former Dodger right-hander Kevin 
Gross, who became a repeat free agent when he was not offered arbitration by 
the Dodgers, meaning any club that signs him does not owe the Dodgers a draft 
choice as compensation. That enhances the appeal of a 33-year-old veteran who 
was 9-7 with a $2.7-million salary last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are free of the Gaetti obligation but have already guaranteed about 
$16 million to eight players for 1995, and Chili Davis will raise that to more 
than $20 million for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be able to do it all," Bavasi said of his priorities. 
"We'll just have to take it a player at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal by free-agent third baseman Tim Wallach that he return to the 
Dodgers with either a two-year contract or one for a year with an option, at 
$800,000 a year less than his $3.3 million salary of 1994, has been rejected by 
Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim recognizes that the Dodgers have suffered significant losses (because of 
the players' strike) and is willing to absorb some of it to stay with the team, 
but he also has to keep his options open and investigate the interest of other 
teams," agent Alan Meersand said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred's position is that the Dodgers are still interested in Tim but are still 
evaluating (third base prospect) Ron Coomer. We have to hope they're not 
stringing Tim along." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel President Richard Brown said Anaheim is expected to deliver an answer by 
Dec. 1 regarding a new baseball stadium that would open in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he is encouraged by the city's enthusiasm and commitment and 
expects it to become a reality, regardless of what the Rams do. He also said 
the Angels are prepared to move -- to another prime location in Orange County 
-- if they aren't satisfied with progress of negotiations regarding inequities 
in the Anaheim Stadium lease and other problems with a facility that no longer 
fits the requirements of either baseball or football. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the economy is management's first order of business, it is 
difficult to explain a 1995 schedule that has the Angels twice making round 
trips to the East to play only one series. They go from Anaheim to Toronto to 
Anaheim April 28-May 1, and from Anaheim to Milwaukee to Anaheim July 27-30. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Baseball's expansion committee heard presentations Tuesday from Phoenix, 
Tampa-St. Petersburg, Orlando and two areas in Northern Virginia. It's pretty 
much a charade. Unless labor problems prevent it, Phoenix will join the 
National League in 1998, and Tampa-St. Petersburg will join the American 
League. A decision is expected in February or March. The committee knows it 
must act before April, Maricopa County's deadline for financing a Phoenix 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been criticism of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America for giving 
awards in a strike-shortened season, but the season was long enough for 
National League Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to establish a career high 
for complete games with 10. The only National League team to produce more was 
the Dodgers with 13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Reed, who turned down a three-year, $7.8-million offer from the Dodgers 
last winter and ultimately accepted a $350,000 contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers, might be tempting fate again. Reed, who batted .271 and led major 
league second basemen by making only three errors in 587 chances, has rejected 
a $1-million offer from the Brewers for 1995 to try free agency again.

EL CAMINO REAL SHARES TITLE; GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL: VICTORY OVER CHATSWORTH GIVES 
CONQUISTADORES PART OF LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>

 Gretchen Vandenberg didn't expect much in this her final season of volleyball 
at El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Conquistadores finished the regular season undefeated before 
they were upset in the first round of the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Four starters graduated, including standout outside hitter Jessica Dinaberg, 
leaving Vandenberg and setter Lisa Brende as the only returning players. 
</P>
<P>
 But with El Camino Real's 15-13, 15-10, 3-15, 15-11 victory over Chatsworth 
Tuesday, the Conquistadores tied Chatsworth for the West Valley League 
championship. Both teams gain automatic berths in the City Section 4-A 
playoffs, which begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "After what we lost last year, I had no idea how we would do," Vandenberg 
said. "I thought we would be down but it's been a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 This season Vandenberg has been the only serious hitting threat for El Camino 
Real and Tuesday was no exception.  
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg had 21 kills and outside hitter Kari Hiraiwa had three kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg almost single-handedly closed the match for El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (7-3, 7-1 in Northwest Valley Conference play) trailed, 11-8, 
in the final game before scoring the last seven points on Tami Jones' serve.  
</P>
<P>
 After El Camino Real tied the game, Vandenberg had a block, then three 
consecutive kills to end the match and avenge the Conquistadores' only loss in 
league play. Chatsworth defeated El Camino Real in three games last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of athletes on the team but Gretchen is the one we go to," El 
Camino Real Coach Lori Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our last timeout, I just told Lisa to get the ball to Gretchen three times 
and to get this match over." 
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg had 14 kills in the first two games as El Camino Real took early 
control of the match.  
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth recovered to dominate the third game behind outside hitters 
Jennifer Joseph and Tynitia Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph led the Chancellors (8-3, 7-1) with 10 kills.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added seven kills and four blocks.

 Fishermen Want Government to Buy Their Boats: The plan could cost more than 
$100 million, but the fishermen, whose industry is on the verge of collapse, 
contend the government should help them because it promoted over-expansion of 
the fishing fleet in the 1970s and 1980s. The call for boat purchases comes 
after the New England Fishery Management Council, which oversees commercial 
fishing in the region, proposed harsh new restrictions including a ban on 
fishing off Georges Bank, once one of richest fisheries of the Atlantic Ocean.

 Supermarket, Meat Industries Seek to Stop E. Coli Testing: The industries sued 
the U.S. Agriculture Department to halt government testing of the ground-beef 
supply for the rare but potentially deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7. The 
lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, Tex., claims the testing, 
which began Oct. 17, would mislead consumers into believing any ground beef 
they bought would be free of pathogens. The plaintiffs did not ask for an 
immediate injunction, so it could be several weeks before U.S. District Judge 
James Nowlin acts.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A SOUTHERN-FRIED DETECTIVE STORY; ARMADILLOS & OLD LACE BY 
KINKY FRIEDMAN ; SIMON & SCHUSTER $21, 236 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you missed a country and Western novelty act called Kinky Friedman and the 
Texas Jewboys back in the 1970s, you may need a little background to get the 
extended inside joke that crackles and pops through the pages of "Armadillos & 
Old Lace," the latest title in a series of offbeat mystery novels by the man 
who calls himself "the Kinkster." 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Richard "Kinky" Friedman is both author and hero of "Armadillos," 
which celebrates the unlikely exploits of a "middle-aged over-the-hill country 
singer" who has reinvented himself as an amateur private detective. And so, 
when the character known as the Kinkster croons a song called "Ol' Ben Lucas," 
he is mouthing words that were actually penned by the novelist of the same name 
back in his country music days. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's cotton-pickin' time in Texas," sings Friedman in a display of the 
in-your-face adolescent humor that he favors, "boys, it's booger-pickin' time 
for Ben. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "Armadillos & Old Lace" is so thoroughly self-referential that it 
might pass as a lightly fictionalized autobiography or, at times, a slightly 
cracked confessional novel. Friedman's alter ego, like the author himself, 
lives on his father's ranch in the Texas hill country, where he occupies a 
ramshackle trailer that resembles "a failed time-share arrangement between John 
Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac." 
</P>
<P>
 While his father is hard at work running a purely idyllic summer camp (just 
like in real life), the Kinkster is halfheartedly courting a young 
arts-and-crafts instructor with a come-hither look and, almost incidentally, 
dogging down a serial killer who is stalking the old ladies of Kerrville, Tex., 
and environs. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman clearly enjoys the novelist's prerogative to riff and rave. He 
invents a patois of his very own that owes a little something to Raymond 
Chandler but much more to Lenny Bruce: A telephone is a "blower," a skullcap is 
a "yamaha," a cemetery is the "bone orchard," and "cutting buns" becomes a verb 
of locomotion. Midnight is "the time Cinderella met the guy with the shoe 
fetish." And I won't tell you what Friedman means by the phrase "to take a 
Nixon," but you'll figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery purists are not likely to find Friedman's whodunit very satisfying. 
Now and then, Friedman manages to work in some twists -- a swarm of killer 
bees, a trip to the Alamo, a few ghosts and one dirty (and deadly) little 
secret. But mostly he sets up straw men and knocks them down again, and he 
indulges himself in what must be regarded as the cardinal sin of mystery 
fiction -- the crucial clue comes too early. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard-boiled mystery subplot in "Armadillos" is almost beside the 
point. Friedman flashes back and forth between the detective work and what's 
going on back at the ranch, which is a seismic midlife crisis for a 50-year-old 
guy who chases women, chain-smokes cigars, and gulps whiskey the way most of us 
drink our morning coffee -- and who possesses the shaky self-esteem of a 
13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what's best about "Armadillos" is Friedman's own struggle to make 
sense of the world around him, an effort that is sometimes boisterous and 
buffoonish, sometimes poignant and endearing. He's a cross between Holden 
Caulfield and Woody Allen, a Southern-fried Jew with an identity crisis as big 
as Texas and a heart to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd become ambivalent about performing country music gigs," Friedman writes 
of his character and himself, "and I'd come to realize that anyone who uses the 
word 'ambivalent' probably shouldn't have been a country singer in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Armadillos & Old Lace" is only a halfhearted mystery, it is the 
wholehearted self-revelation of an unabashedly sentimental man. The Kinkster 
may come across as wasted and burned out, but we come to realize that he's a 
sucker for animals and little children and old ladies in distress, a 
post-industrial Peter Pan who refuses to grow up, a refugee from the real world 
who sees his father's ranch as a kind of sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hills seemed to echo their energy and joy," Friedman writes of the sight 
and sound of children at play on the ranch, "and it was a little sad to think 
how very briefly they would stay this way before joining all the other gray, 
weather-beaten souls in the quotidian adult world." 
</P>
<P>
 This book -- and the whole notion of writing mystery novels -- appears to be 
Friedman's way to put off the day when he must join the rest of us in that 
world. The Kinkster is a catcher, not in the rye, but in the sagebrush, and 
that's what is truly appealing about him and his work.

SHOOTING NOW SEEN AS ATTEMPT TO KILL CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PIERRE THOMAS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators now believe that Francisco Martin Duran, the Colorado 
man accused of opening fire on the White House, came to Washington to kill 
President Clinton, sources close to the investigation said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are leaning toward charging Duran with attempted assassination 
even though Clinton was nowhere in sight during the shooting Saturday 
afternoon, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Tuesday that further examination of evidence uncovered from 
Duran's truck and an interview with a man who worked with Duran in Colorado 
have significantly altered their deliberations by suggesting that the hotel 
upholsterer came to Washington not merely to get attention or protest but 
specifically to kill the President. 
</P>
<P>
 David Millis, an employee of the Broadmoor Hotel and Resort in Colorado 
Springs, told the FBI that Duran said he was going to Washington to harm 
Clinton, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millis told the TV show "A Current Affair" on Tuesday that Duran said he 
planned to go to Washington "to take out the President." In the TV interview, 
Millis said he didn't take Duran seriously, but after the shooting, fearing 
that he might get into trouble, he went to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have taken from Duran's truck a map with the words 
"kill the (prez)" written on it, said a number of sources familiar with the 
shooting. The exact spelling of the abbreviation of the word President could 
not be determined. Handwritten notes recovered from Duran's truck refer to the 
occult, the sources said, noting that the material heightened their concerns 
about his mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, 26, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm by a convicted 
felon, destruction of government property, resisting a federal officer while 
armed and unlawful use of a firearm during the commission of a felony. If 
convicted on these charges, he could face a maximum sentence of 35 years in 
prison and $1 million in fines. An attempted assassination of the President 
carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Treasury officials were initially skeptical that there was enough 
evidence to warrant charging Duran with an assassination attempt because the 
gunman aimed at the White House, not the President. FBI officials believe, 
however, that the written material indicate Duran's intent, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the 
Secret Service met Tuesday with FBI officials , and sources said the government 
was close to a decision to add the new charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two notes have emerged as of great importance to the case. One letter 
confiscated from Duran at the time of his arrest has been described as a 
"semi-suicide" note in which Duran hints that he expected to die in the 
assault, sources said. In that scrap of paper Duran discusses how to distribute 
his property to his son and wife, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have been silent on the second note taken from Duran's truck and 
the details about the other items recovered at the same time. A federal 
magistrate ordered the note sealed during a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder declined to elaborate on the second note at the hearing, other than to 
tell the judge that its contents were troubling enough to bring to the judge's 
attention. Assistant U.S. Atty. John F. Finnegan said the letter "brings into 
question whether the defendant is truly competent to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Magistrate Deborah A. Robinson ordered that Duran undergo a day of 
psychiatric screening to determine whether he is competent to face the charges 
against him. Duran's lawyer, Public Defender Leigh Kenny, launched a series of 
legal moves Tuesday in an attempt to block the psychiatric tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny lost an appeal of a federal magistrate's ruling but succeeded in 
delaying the examination until today. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Duran's possible use of an insanity defense. His lawyer is 
concerned that prosecutors could develop information through the psychiatric 
screening that could be used to thwart the insanity defense, if one is used by 
Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran is due back in court today. Prosecutors are hoping that the doctor can 
conduct the examination by this afternoon and submit a report to Robinson. The 
magistrate then will decide whether Duran is capable of understanding the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran is accused of opening fire on the north side of the White House from 
Pennsylvania Avenue with a Chinese-made SKS semiautomatic rifle Saturday. 
Authorities said he fired at least 20 rounds at the mansion. Several hit the 
building, some shattering the glass near the press room. As he attempted to 
reload, bystanders tackled and subdued him.

 TICKET-FREE: Southwest Airlines has something new for passengers who don't 
have time to get tickets: a no-ticket system. Passengers can confirm their 
reservations by phone with a credit card and then can board their planes with 
just a confirmation number and picture I.D. . . . Southwest operates 48 flights 
daily in and out of Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 FIGHTING BACK: Speaking of tickets, wouldn't it be great if parking tickets 
also disappeared? Not a chance. Parking tickets are a part of life, and very 
few people bother to contest them (B2). . . . But John Romano of Chatsworth is. 
Romano got a ticket while helping his disabled wife out of the car a few weeks 
ago, and says that under the current system, "you are guilty until proven 
innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 MESSY BUSINESS: Mirk Mirkin, above, is a major mess. Or, at least, his office 
is. The Sherman Oaks marketing and meeting planner recently won an honorable 
mention from Home Office Computing magazine in a contest seeking the messiest 
home office in America. . . . Mirkin, 67, who keeps papers, boxes and files 
everywhere, tries to keep tidy "but it catches up on me when the mail comes." 
</P>
<P>
 VALLEY GIRLS: It's a movie about a bunch named Brady . . . but don't look for 
Valley natives Eve Plumb and Maureen McCormick. Although many of the TV actors 
make cameo appearances in the Paramount production due out next year, the Brady 
Bunch's original Jan and Marcia both turned down parts. . . . Much of the 
picture was shot at Valley locations (F1). 
</P>
<P>
 GOING PUBLIC: The ax is poised over CSUN athletics. The only question is: 
Where will it fall? On Tuesday, administrators said they'll ask the public to 
help them make that decision (C8). . . . The cuts became likely after students 
voted last month against a $49 semester fee that would have generated $2.25 
million for the athletic department.

PEARL PRIMUS; DANCE PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pearl Primus, pioneer of the anthropological modern dance movement who brought 
dances rooted in Africa and the Caribbean to American audiences and students, 
has died. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Primus died Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y., after a brief 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her best known works was "Strange Fruit," which she created in 1943, 
using lyricist Lewis Allan's poem of that title as a narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 At a presentation of the dance at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art this 
year, Times critic Lewis Segal commented: " 'Strange Fruit' showed 
choreographer Pearl Primus many decades ahead of her time in linking a spoken 
text and a gestural, non-dance vocabulary to a social theme -- murderous 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Primus continued to perform until 1980, and taught throughout the United 
States until her death. Among her many university appointments, she was the 
chancellor's distinguished lecturer in fine arts at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance is my language," she said at Irvine in 1990. "I started to dance not to 
entertain, but to help people better understand each other. I wanted to speak 
of the heritage of peoples of African descent, their dignity, beauty and 
strength. . . . I used the dance to fight racism, to fight ignorance where I 
found it." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Trinidad in the British West Indies, Ms. Primus was raised in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned a bachelor's degree in biology from Hunter College, intending to 
become a doctor. But she found no laboratory jobs available to African 
Americans, so she applied to the Depression-era National Youth Administration, 
which put her in the New Dance Group Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 She became a cabaret dancer at the racially integrated Cafe Society in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Study trips to Africa altered her dancing. In the 1940s she began combining 
anthropologically analyzed movements with modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
 She also earned a doctorate in anthropology from New York University. 
</P>
<P>
 She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met in 1953 during a visit home to 
Trinidad. He died in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, she earned the National Medal of the Arts, the highest accolade for 
performers in her adopted United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by one son, Onwin Borde, of Miami.

CRAFT LAUNCHED IN NASA STUDY OF SOLAR WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A NASA spacecraft called Wind rocketed into orbit Tuesday on a three-year 
journey to study the electrified particles that stream from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The unmanned Delta rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, 
10 miles from the Kennedy Space Center, where shuttle Atlantis awaits a 
Thursday launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight instruments -- six U.S., one French and the first Russian instrument to 
fly on an American spacecraft -- will analyze solar wind, the energy hurtling 
from the sun at more than 1 million m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Solar wind gusts can cause geomagnetic storms that can disrupt electrical 
power, radio communications and satellite operations. Scientists hope Wind's 
findings will help them foresee outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, plans call for Wind to be catapulted out of Earth's orbit into a 
circle 200,000 miles in diameter, 1 million miles from Earth and 92 million 
miles from the sun. At that point, the gravities of Earth and the sun balance 
and should keep the craft there forever.

MONEY-BURNING FIRE AT FED BANK BRANCH TURNS CASH TO ASH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was money to burn -- literally -- in Portland when a fire in a vault at 
the Federal Reserve Bank branch damaged an undisclosed amount of currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Welders working in an upper vault Monday apparently let some hot slag fall 
through a vent into another vault below, leading to the blaze early Tuesday, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire crews had to use a torch to cut their way into the vault, which was 
sealed by a time lock. The burning money was removed and doused, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve branch said relatively few $20 bills 
were singed but declined to give a total amount.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager who was tossing eggs as a Halloween prank unwittingly created a 
fireball that knocked out electricity for at least 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the 15-year-old boy tossed one or two eggs over a fence at a 
Pennsylvania Electric Co. substation Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of splattered egg and rain made the 34,000-watt transformers 
arc, creating a flash that was visible in most of Franklin. One witness 
reported seeing a fireball. The boy turned himself in and was treated at a 
hospital for ringing ears.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY; PARADE 
ORGANIZERS STRUGGLE TO RAISE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of the annual Holiday Lane Parade are struggling to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors the parade, has raised only one-third 
of the $27,000 needed to pay for the event. The 43rd annual parade will take 
place as planned Dec. 4, but officials say it may be the last one if they can't 
break even. Parade chairman Michael J. Prokop attributed the financial problems 
to lack of donations from businesses and a city decision to charge organizers 
for police patrols and other services, such as setting up bleachers. About 42 
of the city's 2,500 businesses have donated this year, Prokop said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TAX FOUL-UP: ONCE IS ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County must reform the way it handles appeals of property assessments 
if it is to avoid another costly loss of money and public confidence in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The office of County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs tells property owners how much 
it thinks their land and buildings are worth and how much tax they owe -- 
usually just over 1% of assessed valuation. When taxpayers disagree, as they 
have done frequently in recent years as property values plunged during the 
recession, they can appeal. If the county does not review an appeal within two 
years, the property owner's valuation prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month county officials said an inordinate number of appeals had slipped 
past the deadline without action by either the assessor's office or the Board 
of Supervisors' clerk's office, which schedules appeals hearings. One 
eye-opener was a Bank of America parcel, which the bank valued at less than $24 
million and the county pegged at nearly $120 million, a staggering difference. 
The appeals deadline passed, and the bank won. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing might have pegged the agreed-upon valuation somewhere between the 
two figures. Had the county prevailed, it could have gained an extra $1 million 
for schools, cities and the county itself. Instead, the county now must refund 
about $1 million per year for two or three years, depending on when it received 
the appeal and when it next will reassess the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of America disclosure got everyone's notice, and when the county 
administrative office looked into the assessments it found that more than 200 
additional cases might be lost by default. The supervisors' clerk, who also is 
clerk of the appeals boards, said the appeals had "fallen through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 An especially unseemly part of the problem has been the finger-pointing and 
blame-ducking. Jacobs said it was the clerk's fault; the clerk blamed Jacobs. 
The county supervisors understandably want to know who is to blame and how to 
prevent it from happening again. If they can't get satisfaction from the 
administrative office's inquiries, they should ask the Orange County Grand Jury 
to investigate. If it feels it needs outside help, the grand jury can hire an 
accountant or systems expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the supervisors authorized more help for Jacobs after the backlog of 
appeals grew too large. That was a blemish on a record that until then had been 
good. Jacobs is an elected official, over whom the supervisors have little 
control aside from the budget. He and the appeals board clerk owe an 
explanation to the supervisors and to Orange County residents of what went 
wrong and how they plan to make it a one-time aberration. If the supervisors 
don't get convincing answers, they should rescind the raises they approved for 
Jacobs and the clerk before this fiasco came to light.

PRAYERS AND PLEDGES AGAINST PROP. 187; RELIGION: INTERFAITH GROUP ORGANIZES A 
VIGIL AT GOP FUND-RAISER TARGETING HUFFINGTON'S SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They sang, they lit candles, they prayed, they carried out a carefully planned 
demonstration against Proposition 187 and Rep. Mike Huffington, the Republican 
candidate for the U.S. Senate who backs it. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 strong, waving placards and shouting in response to their pastors' 
promptings, members of a coalition of 15 Christian and Jewish congregations 
across the San Fernando Valley gathered outside a Republican Party fund-raiser 
Tuesday night to oppose the ballot measure that seeks a state constitutional 
amendment blocking services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to change Mr. Huffington's heart with prayer," said Karen Lack 
of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Susan Guzzardi of a Canoga Park church: "We want to make life better for 
immigrants' children, not worse. If we throw them out of schools and deny them 
inoculations, our own lives will also worsen because street crime and disease 
will escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 While the candlelight vigil outside the Universal City Hilton had the 
appearance of a spontaneous grass-roots outpouring, it was actually the result 
of careful planning by organizers of a group called Valley Organized In 
Community Efforts, or VOICE. 
</P>
<P>
 The group uses techniques developed decades ago by legendary immigrant and 
labor movement leaders Saul Alinsky, Cesar Chavez and Fred Ross. Ross' son, 
Fred Ross Jr., is a principal organizer of VOICE, helping to coordinate events 
such as the one held Tuesday night with techniques born of United Farm Worker 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearded, youthful Father Thomas H. Rush of Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima, 
one of Ross' students at VOICE, said the recent revelation that Huffington 
employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny for years heightened the ecumenical 
group's anger at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real double standard on his part," said Rush. "We're saying to 
Huffington: 'You took Marisela (the nanny) in as one of your own. But what 
about the rest?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, asked about the protesters, said that "it's entirely appropriate 
for members of the cloth to pray for what they think is right," but that he 
felt more strongly "the prayers . . . wishing me the best in my campaign for 
the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the service's political nature, it had a strong religious flavor. A 
central theme was a prayer from Leviticus in the Old Testament read by Father 
Pat Murphy of Holy Rosary Church in Sunland: "If a stranger lives with you in 
your land, do not molest him. You must count him as one of your countrymen and 
love him as yourself. For you were once strangers yourself in Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the prayer service, Murphy asked the congregants to shout 
repeatedly to bemused Republicans and TV camera crews: "Love a stranger as 
thyself." 
</P>
<P>
 The vigil was one in a monthlong string of events planned by VOICE members to 
call attention to the ballot measure. In contrast to the high-concept campaign 
events organized by highly paid political consultants, the VOICE events were 
devised at small church and synagogue meetings over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sophisticated TV and radio ads to get out their point of view, 
VOICE members rely on sermons from pulpits and door-to-door campaigning in the 
barrios and boulevards of the Valley. Teams fan out on Saturdays, going from 
gas stations to beauty salons to persuade business people to post 
anti-Proposition 187 signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Wildhaber typifies VOICE's grass-roots orientation. By profession, she 
is director of a child-care facility in Canoga Park. But she spends 20 hours a 
week as a VOICE volunteer and has been a leader of the group's efforts against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the 15 Catholic, Protestant and Jewish congregations that 
compose VOICE hold small "house meetings" three times a year to identify 
political and social issues to rally around. 
</P>
<P>
 Each congregation then sends a delegate to a "strategy team" at VOICE that 
meets twice a month to formulate a plan to deal with those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildhaber said a research task force first focused on Proposition 187 only two 
months ago, after initially "mistakenly" thinking it was a positive measure to 
limit taxpayer funding of services for illegal immigrants. Team members read 
the measure carefully, talked to its formal political opponents, then 
formulated an attack after deciding that the ballot measure was "an effort by 
politicians to walk on the backs of children to advance their careers," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so angry about it, we thought: What can we do to make a difference?" 
said Wildhaber. "And even if we can't make a difference, this is something that 
we can just not ignore." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's most visible events have been two in-your-face confrontations with 
Proposition 187 co-author Harold W. Ezell. Less obvious but closer to the 
community have been attempts to organize boycotts of local businesses that 
refuse to put up posters opposing the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The first confrontation with Ezell, a former regional manager of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, came at the Museum of Tolerance on the 
Westside, where VOICE joined forces with sister grass-roots group United 
Neighborhoods Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The second came two weeks ago when a dozen VOICE activists, including several 
clergy members, shouted Ezell off a stage as he was about to address a group of 
Republican women. They then hounded him from corner to corner of the room until 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 48 hours to pull that one off," Wildhaber said proudly. She said her 
research team had received a tip about the speech from a Republican member of 
the group, then designed an action to maximize attention on Ezell's role in the 
ballot measure effort. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ezell termed the VOICE activists who interrupted his meal 
"savages" and protested that "the conduct of these people suggests anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildhaber's group has sent teams of activists to Valley commercial districts 
on the past five Saturdays in an effort to persuade business owners to promise 
that they will not only personally oppose Proposition 187 but also put a VOICE 
poster in their window. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildhaber said 150 businesses have complied. And the ones that refuse? 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell the congregations which businesses in their communities signed, and 
which refused -- so they can boycott the ones that don't support us," Wildhaber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Murphy, the Sunland pastor, said that the owner of a Sunland beauty 
parlor who refused to support the group on a Saturday surrendered to the 
economic pressure by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their business had suffered -- people had called to cancel appointments," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Republicans attending the $150-a-plate fund-raiser appeared to be unaware 
of the vigil, or said they were unmoved by it, though not all favor the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will abstain from voting on that measure," said Tom Rice, a private 
investigator attending the fund-raiser. "I think the issue needs to be 
addressed, but Proposition 187 isn't the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 VOICE members considered their involvement to be more about morality than 
economics. Said Gustavo Valdivia of Pacoima: "I think no human being is 
illegal."

POST-QUAKE REDESIGN WILL DELAY OLIVE VIEW HOSPITAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of a much-needed emergency room and perinatal facility at Olive 
View-UCLA Medical Center will be delayed at least four months while engineers 
scramble to improve the design of the steel frame building after the high 
failure rate of similar structures in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing up the old blueprint and redesigning the proposed four-story building 
will cost at least $2 million extra, officials said. The county plans to apply 
to the Federal Emergency Management Administration for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of Olive View patients, the delay also means enduring 
overcrowded conditions even longer. The earliest the project could now be 
completed would be mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need the space in the new building," said Caroline Rhee, the county 
hospital's chief operating officer, pointing out that the hospital delivers 
twice as many babies annually -- 6,201 -- as the existing obstetrics unit was 
designed to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesign of the $54-million building could end up saving lives, said Larry 
Colvin, director of the county Department of Health Services' facilities 
implementation team. Colvin said several other proposed buildings in the 
county's $2.3-billion health facilities replacement and improvement plan may 
also have to be redesigned.  
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, we could go ahead and build using our current designs because the 
plans were approved before the Northridge quake," Colvin said. "But it'd be the 
wrong thing to do. It's important to build the safest structures possible to 
avoid the potential of a collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel frame buildings, designed to bend without breaking, were long considered 
among the safest to ride out an earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 None of these modern office buildings, hospitals and other steel frame 
structures collapsed in the Jan. 17 quake. But cracks have been discovered in 
the welded connections of at least 130 buildings, more than a quarter of all 
steel frame buildings in quake-affected areas in the San Fernando Valley and on 
the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 In August, the California Seismic Safety Commission took the unprecedented 
step of urging building officials throughout the western United States to 
suspend a construction code and require proof that new mid- to high-rise steel 
frame buildings can withstand major earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and engineers now have to substantiate building designs submitted 
to Los Angeles County on a case-by-case basis by proving additional 
calculations, testing, improvements in design, inspection and construction 
practices.  
</P>
<P>
 A consortium of scientists, structural engineers and others in the steel 
industry have embarked on a government-funded research project to come up with 
new construction guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a year from now, we'll be able to restore confidence in how to design 
steel frame buildings," said Paul Fratessa, a structural engineer and chairman 
of the Seismic Safety Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The county plans to have its new design tested by researchers at the 
University of Texas at Austin, who will build a model of the structure and 
subject it to a simulated earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 The free-standing building will increase Olive View's capacity by about 50% 
when it is built on vacant land just north of the existing hospital. The new 
emergency room will contain 40 treatment areas, more than four times as many as 
the hospital has now, Rhee said. The new perinatal unit will be able to handle 
8,000 births.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CLERGY SIGN LETTER OPPOSING PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy-six Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and Islamic clergy in the San 
Fernando Valley denounced Proposition 187 in a brief statement opposing the 
state ballot initiative as "an ineffective way to deal with the genuine problem 
of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an affront to the unity of humankind which all our traditions teach," 
said the statement, circulated primarily by the Revs.Charlotte Shivvers, 
minister of the Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society, and Jeffrey Utter, 
pastor of Chatsworth Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those signing the statement as individuals, not as representatives of 
their churches, were the Rev. Brandon Cho, the Chatsworth-based district 
superintendent for the United Methodist Church; Jan Diwan, the worship leader 
of the Islamic Center of Northridge; Auxiliary Bishop Armando X. Ochoa, of the 
Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese; the Rev. Robert Fernandez, a Panorama 
City-based regional executive for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); the Rev. 
Joon Nam Lee, Valley Korean Baptist Church of North Hills; the Rev. William 
Broadus, Calvary Baptist Church of Pacoima, and the Rev. Balint Nagy, Grace 
Hungarian Reformed Church of Reseda. JOHN DART

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EVENT MARKS $11-MILLION PARK PROJECT

 Todd Ciocca, 71, leaves his Northridge home and goes to Lake Balboa Park once 
every couple of weeks in search of old memories and a little peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like to walk around here," Ciocca said Tuesday. "It reminds me how the 
Valley looked when there was some open space left." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, across Lake Balboa, a group of politicians and officials were 
packing up charts and papers and heading back to work. The city of Los Angeles 
and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers had just completed a signing ceremony, 
where they agreed to split the cost of an $11-million preservation and 
expansion project inside the 2,100-acre Sepulveda Basin, the largest park in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciocca, who once fished for crawdads in creeks near the basin, hadn't heard 
much about the agreement, but was happy to learn that 184 acres of land would 
be decorated with native plants, trails would be expanded, and new athletic 
fields would be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll give the young people around here something to see besides apartment 
houses and stores," Ciocca said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls on the corps and the city to spend $5.5 million each on a 
two-year project to improve facilities at Lake Balboa Park, Balboa Sports 
Center and Hjelte Park, and to construct new athletic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, existing nature preserves, used by migratory waterfowl as a 
foraging area, will be expanded and planted with riparian, oak savannah, oak 
chaparral, buckwheat and native grasses. The basin's reclaimed water system -- 
treated waste water -- also will be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development in the basin is a great example of the kind of superb public 
facility that it is possible to create when two levels of government share 
resources and work toward common goals," said Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), who helped obtain federal funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda Dam and Reservoir, completed in 1941, is an important part of 
the flood control plan for the Los Angeles County drainage area. Constructed 
after a devastating 1938 flood, the basin regulates runoff from a 
152-square-mile area. The Department of Recreation and Parks leases 1,600 acres 
of the basin from the Army Corps of Engineers for park uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmentalists, who've fought various proposals for development in 
the basin over the years, said Tuesday they were generally pleased with the 
agreement, but wondered why they did not have more time to review it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The maps look pretty good," said Glenn Bailey, a founding member of the 
Coalition to Save the Sepulveda Basin. "But we're wary about giving anybody a 
blank check to fool around in here. We'd like time to review it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Swift, a former parks commissioner and member of the Basin Users Group, 
was worried about schematic drawings for the project that included a 40-acre 
swath of land inside the basin to be used for a future arts park. Swift's group 
had opposed the arts park because of the extra pollution and traffic that the 
proposed facility would create. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start putting up buildings in a flood plain area, you're going to 
have real problems," Swift said. "You're displacing soil. We're shocked that 
the plans include land for that arts park." 
</P>
<P>
 But a landscape architect for the corps said the arts park was left in the 
plans only because no one was told to delete it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just there conceptually," said Deborah Lamb, an architect in the corps's 
district environmental design section. TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL HAS BIG 'THANK YOU' FOR FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>

<P>
 Exactly one year ago, the skies above Meadow Oaks School in Calabasas were 
filled with black soot and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 With the flames of the 1993 firestorm encroaching on the campus, more than 500 
students and teachers were evacuated by firefighters from nearby Station 68. 
</P>
<P>
 To honor them, as well as those from the Malibu and Las Virgenes fire 
stations, Meadow Oaks held a schoolwide assembly Tuesday where they presented 
the firefighters with flowers and plaques. 
</P>
<P>
 All around the playground were student-made banners adorned with pictures of 
Dalmatians and firefighters' hats that read "Buckets of Thanks" and "Thank you, 
firefighters. We think you're hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Students, their teachers and their parents wore green ribbons with "Never 
forget. Be prepared," printed on them. 
</P>
<P>
 John Baran, a firefighter from Station 68, was among those who helped evacuate 
Meadow Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administrators here, they had a plan and they implemented it. Without it, 
it would have been really difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand for the presentation were Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley and Malibu Mayor 
Jeff Kramer, who also gave certificates of appreciation to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a special treat to the youngsters, representatives from the fire stations 
brought two firetrucks to the playground, inviting the children to climb into 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting in line to clamber about one of the big, shiny red trucks, 
Caroline Hambright, 8, said she would like to be a firefighter when she grows 
up. "I'd like to be a hero one day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Brett Rehder, also 8, said he would also like to be a firefighter: 
"I want to save people's lives and be on television." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; OFFICIALS OF 4 CITIES CRITICIZE PROP. 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elected officials from four cities gathered Tuesday to denounce Proposition 
188, a November ballot measure that would override local ordinances banning 
smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proponents of Proposition 188, in our opinion, have been tap-dancing 
around the truth," said Fran Pavley, a City Council member from Agoura Hills, 
which hosted the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley was joined by officials from Calabasas, Thousand Oaks and Westlake 
Village. Also on hand was Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), who 
spearheaded a state law to take effect in January that bans smoking in all 
enclosed places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 All the cities represented at the news conference have ordinances prohibiting 
smoking in public places such as restaurants. The ballot measure is 
undemocratic, the officials said, in that it would void locally approved 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in Westlake Village see it as a grass-roots issue," Westlake Village Mayor 
Doug Yarrow said. "We had residents who came to us and asked us to consider 
putting this ordinance into effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188, sponsored by Philip Morris Inc., would override all 
anti-smoking laws that have been set up by local communities. Under the 
measure, smoking in public would be allowed in enclosed, designated areas, as 
long as certain ventilation standards were met. Restaurants would still have to 
provide nonsmoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The drafters of Proposition 188 argue that the law would protect nonsmokers, 
while making sure that government does not interfere with personal liberties. 
And some opponents of smoking ordinances argue that the ordinances could hurt 
business at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and the others denounced the pro-Proposition 188 campaign as an 
attempt to hide the truth, which, they said, is that secondhand smoke kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 188 is dangerous to the health of Californians," Friedman said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT GETS GRANT TO SOUNDPROOF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded $3 million to Burbank Airport 
to soundproof two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA grant will be coupled with $722,546 from the Burbank Airport Authority 
to soundproof St. Patrick's School in North Hollywood and Mingay Adult School 
in Burbank. Both schools are about one mile from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is scheduled to take at least two years, said Victor Gill, 
spokesman for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The soundproofing project is the result of an acoustical assessment done in 
1989, after which the FAA and airport allotted a total of $10 million to 
sound-insulate neighboring schools. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; MAN FOUND STABBED DIES FROM WOUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who had been stabbed several times while sitting in his car was 
discovered by teen-agers early Tuesday who originally thought the man's body 
was a Halloween prank, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leopoldo Yerena, 42, of Arleta, died at Holy Cross Medical Center, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three youths, who were driving in the area about 1 a.m., found Yerena sitting 
behind the steering wheel of a parked car in the 10200 block of Vena Avenue 
near Van Nuys Boulevard, said LAPD Detective Frank Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first they thought (the body) was a dummy, some Halloween prank," Bishop 
said. "But after they saw all the blood, they weren't sure and called police." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives have no leads. "We don't know why he was sitting there," Bishop 
said. "We don't know who did it. There were no witnesses." TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

ELECTION '94; 44TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), 48, was first elected in 1992. A 
former insurance executive, Hoge lives in Pasadena, is married and has three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challenger Bruce Philpott, 50, is the former chief of the Pasadena 
Police Department. Philpott lives in Sunland, is divorced and has three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be a highly competitive race, especially if Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) jumps in to give Philpott financial help. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Hoge is known for casting about as many no votes as anyone in 
the Assembly.The incumbent is also affiliated with Christian fundamentalist 
politics. When TV evangelist Pat Robertson was running for President, he 
nominated Hoge as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1990, and 
Hoge's 1992 campaign was financed with $40,000 from conservative Christians 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such ties, Hoge has been involved in drafting gambling legislation 
that state Atty. Gen. Dan Lundgren, a fellow Republican, has twice condemned. 
In 1994 alone, Hoge had received at least $50,500 in campaign contributions 
from horse-racing, Nevada gambling, alcoholic beverage or tobacco industry 
sources as of Sept. 30, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was supposed to be a strong Christian, family-type guy," 
Philpott said recently. "But when he takes money from these interests, it seems 
inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott hopes to appeal to the growing minority and Yuppie populations in the 
44th District by painting himself as a moderate and Hoge as an 
ultra-conservative with an appetite for special interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott is no stranger to controversy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he urged Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates to resign after the 
Rodney King beating. And in late 1990, Philpott was detained by Glendale police 
for driving unsafely. Although never cited, the chief complained he was the 
victim of racism because his passenger was a black woman. The incident stirred 
up a feud between the mayors of Glendale and Pasadena that ended only after 
Pasadena's mayor agreed to stop accusing the Glendale Police Department of 
racism and has been raised as a character issue by the Hoge campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in this district is 45% Democratic, 42% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian Ken Saurenman, a contractor from Pasadena.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; CRIME TOPS LIST OF CONCERNS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime and decaying buildings concern more property owners than any other 
issues in Panorama City's densest commercial and urban area, according to a 
recent survey by Los Angeles planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their perception of the area was that there is a very high crime rate in the 
area," said Kevin Jones, planning assistant in charge of the Panorama City 
Community Citizen Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was sent to owners of 400 businesses and homes between May 28 and 
June 8. One hundred people responded in the survey area, which included 
Parthenia Avenue on the north, the Southern Pacific rail line on the south, 
Lennox Avenue on the east and Willis Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to list what kind of problems the area has, 93% said crime, 78% 
percent listed deteriorated lots and buildings, and 62% cited poverty. 
Respondents were allowed to list more than one item. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve the community, 92% of the property owners said they would like to 
see more police. Eighty-one percent said more landscaping would help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is more data from the survey to be analyzed, Jones said the 
numbers have already indicated that the problems are more than city planning 
officials can handle alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Department conducted the survey to determine what issues could be 
tackled by planning solutions, which include rezoning, limiting liquor licenses 
and revoking the licenses of businesses deemed a nuisance to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, we felt that perhaps there were a lot of land-use issues that we 
could tackle ourselves," Jones said. "Unfortunately, most of the issues 
(concerning the respondents) were economical in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the final analysis is done by the end of the year, Jones said 
the survey could help other city departments -- such as police and building and 
safety -- identify trouble spots where attention should be focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The survey) could lead to cooperation of a number of departments to address 
the issues in the area and bring about some improvement overall," Jones said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FAMILY'S PAPERS TRACE AREA'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A collection of documents tracing Glendale's history back to its days as a 
Spanish settlement and once belonging to the family that owned the area will 
soon be available to researchers and historians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Public Library is in the final stages of cataloguing a collection 
of papers donated last year by actress Elena Verdugo, a descendant of Jose 
Maria Verdugo, a Spanish army officer who in 1784 was granted grazing rights to 
a 36,000-acre area that included much of what later became Glendale, Burbank, 
Montrose, Eagle Rock, La Crescenta, Glassell Park and Sunland-Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Wike, a library spokesman, said most of the papers in the collection 
date back to the 1800s. They include land deeds, school primers, family 
letters, a passport, a dance program, the 1819 U. S. Army discharge papers of a 
Verdugo family member and an advertisement for real estate in the Glendale 
area, published in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a letter from one of the Verdugos to the pre-statehood governor 
of California, asking for financial assistance because he was in jeopardy of 
losing his property. "It's like a slice of history," Wike said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Verdugo starred in B-movies during the 1940s and '50s, and had a 
featured role on the TV drama series "Marcus Welby, M.D." Verdugo, 69, lives in 
Rosarito Beach, Baja California, and had become concerned that the damp climate 
there would damage the artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because these documents are so very old, they need special care," said Marie 
Fish, an administrator at the library's central branch, where the Verdugo 
documents will be housed in the special collections wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, which will be named in Elena Verdugo's honor, will be open for 
viewing by the public in January, library officials said. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GROUP SEEKS INTERIM COUNCIL MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A newly formed coalition of homeowner associations, chambers of commerce and 
other community groups met Tuesday to discuss strategies on how to convince the 
Los Angeles City Council to appoint an interim council member to fill Zev 
Yaroslavsky's soon-to-be-vacated 5th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming themselves "Coalition for a Voting Representative for the 5th Council 
District," the group's concerns revolve around the likelihood of a non-voting 
city legislative analyst being designated to address issues affecting the 
district for the remainder of Yaroslavsky's term.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky will leave the council Dec. 5 to assume his new duties as a Los 
Angeles County supervisor. His term ends in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city employee cannot be an advocate in any of the issues affecting our 
community," said meeting coordinator Wendy Brogin of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn. (VICA). "There are major issues concerning this district that 
will be before the council (during Yaroslavsky's absence). With all the 
earthquake recovery efforts going on in the Valley, the CRA (Community 
Redevelopment Agency) project proposed for Sherman Oaks, and the manner in 
which public transportation will affect our communities, we need someone . . . 
who is cognizant of our concerns and that can cast a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to convince a majority of the 15 City Council members to appoint 
an interim member of the council's choosing, the coalition will send an open 
letter to each member and other community leaders. The letter will argue that 
full-time representation in every district is needed for good government. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition wants the appointee be familiar with concerns of businesses and 
residents and to refrain from running for the council seat in the July, 1995, 
municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The group maintains that a 5th District vote on the council is crucial as a 
unifying theme on the council. The coalition noted a recent incident in which 
City Council members representing central portions of the city were accused of 
shifting millions of housing rehabilitation dollars away from the quake-ravaged 
Valley during the absence of Valley colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, a VICA board member and the head of the coalition's 
letter-writing campaign, says he believes that incident is indicative of the 
way the council operates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately or unfortunately, City Council members look out for their own 
districts," Gaines said. "With that, issues concerning the Valley will be 
neglected without a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had vacancies in the past and the chief legislative analyst has always 
been selected to fill them because that person is most knowledgeable of the 
different district's concerns," City Council President John Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you appoint some interim person, they won't even know where the bathroom 
door is much less be able to solve the district's problems," he said. "You 
won't have someone in there with the knowledge that Yaroslavsky was able to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (they) can get eight votes, however, I have no objections to filling the 
vacancy." ANTONIO OLIVO

<P>
 A controversial plan to expand Sherman Oaks Fashion Square has won the support 
of a city hearing examiner, who will recommend the proposal to the Planning 
Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners said there is still a long way to go before they are satisfied 
with the $20-million proposal, which would increase the size of the mall 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over till it's over," said Tybe Drum, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Property Owners Assn., which has sent out hundreds of flyers opposing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission will hear the recommendations of Hearing 
Examiner Eric Ritter when it meets at 9:30 a.m. at the Airtel Plaza Hotel, 7277 
Valjean Ave., Van Nuys.

 Mall officials hope to expand the shopping center by attracting an upscale 
department store to replace the I. Magnin store that left last year. Critics 
say the expansion does not do enough to deal with added traffic congestion and 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't feel there is enough space for this project," Drum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter said Tuesday that he supports the proposed expansion, with several 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to see a lot of expansion here," Ritter said. "What we are 
going to see is the former site of the I. Magnin department store expanded so 
that the site can have a third anchor department store." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter's most significant modifications to the proposal include an increase 
from 3,843 to 4,388 parking spaces, a plan to re-landscape the front of the 
mall along Riverside Drive and a Neighborhood Protection Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would deal with concerns about traffic in the area north of the mall, 
said Allen Abshez, the attorney for the mall's owners, City Freeholds USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, mall owners would post an as-yet unspecified bond that 
surrounding residents could use to deal with traffic problems, such as overflow 
parking and cutting through residential neighborhoods to reach the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Abshez said the mall has generated more than 4,000 signatures from residents 
supporting the expansion. JEFF SCHNAUFER

FATE OF COUNTY LAND STILL UNDECIDED; GOVERNMENT: SUPERVISORS AGAIN DELAY 
DECISION ON ACREAGE FOR CALABASAS-AGOURA HILLS COMMUNITY CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Financially pinched by state budget cutbacks, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday once again postponed a decision on whether to donate or 
sell 4.5 acres to Calabasas and Agoura Hills for a community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents the western San Fernando Valley, wants 
the county to donate a vacant parcel it owns in Calabasas to both cities for 
the community center and a gymnasium. The facility would be used by residents 
of nearby unincorporated county territory as well as by residents of the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such donations of surplus county land were not uncommon two years ago, before 
the state slashed the county's funding by more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the cutbacks, the county's chief administrative officer has 
been urging for the past year that all surplus land be sold or leased, not 
simply given away. The Calabasas property, located behind the Lost Hills 
sheriff's station on Agoura Road, has become a test case of the recommended 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county's appraisal, the land is worth between $659,000 and 
$900,000. County officials are proposing that Calabasas and Agoura Hills pay at 
least $450,000 for the property, using developers' fees that the cities have 
set aside for parkland acquisition and improvement, including community 
centers.  
</P>
<P>
 But the cities contend that the county's appraisal is inflated because it 
incorrectly assumes that the triangular-shaped tract can be developed for 
industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The land was donated to the county by a developer in 1984 for public use only, 
Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's proposal is flawed because it would take developers' dollars 
dedicated to providing desperately needed recreation facilities and use them to 
pay the county for land that the county received free of charge and that is 
already dedicated for civic purposes," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter has come before the supervisors once a week for the past three 
months, only to be postponed while officials wrangle behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough issue, but we're going to work it out," said board Chairwoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.  
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are once again scheduled to vote on the matter next Tuesday.

ELECTIONS / ASSEMBLY 43RD DISTRICT; SCHIFF PLAYS CATCH-UP IN LAST-MINUTE FUNDS 
RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has made a sizable last-minute campaign 
contribution to Adam Schiff, the Democratic candidate in the 43rd Assembly 
District, turning that Glendale-Burbank contest into a battle between rival 
state party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Late contribution reports obtained Tuesday from the secretary of state's 
office showed that the Assembly Democrats Victory Fund donated $12,500 to 
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who is trying to unseat freshman 
Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (D-San Francisco) is the key player in determining how Victory Fund 
money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's log also showed a $12,500 donation from another 
Brown-controlled political committee, but the Schiff campaign said that 
donation had not actually been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state Democratic Party is lagging far behind its GOP counterpart in 
financing its champion in the 43rd District race. 
</P>
<P>
 The late contribution reports show that state Assemblyman James Brulte of 
Rancho Cucamonga, the GOP minority leader, pumped another $45,000 in party 
funds into Rogan's treasury Saturday, nearly doubling the amount he has 
contributed to the incumbent. During the first three weeks of October, Brulte's 
committee gave $58,000 to the Rogan campaign, according to finance reports 
filed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan has found himself embroiled in a fierce fight to hold onto the seat he 
won in a special election last May to fill a vacancy created when Pat Nolan 
resigned in February after pleading guilty to a charge of political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The late contribution reports filed as of Tuesday bring Rogan's campaign 
spending to at least $435,000 and Schiff's to nearly $228,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Late contribution reports must be filed within 24 hours when a contributor 
donates more than $1,000 to the campaign after the deadline -- Oct. 22 in this 
race -- for filing the last full campaign finance report. 
</P>
<P>
 Often some of the biggest and most controversial donations are made in the 
final days of a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports show that Rogan has so far received at least $58,000 in late 
contributions, while Schiff has received $38,000, with both sides picking up 
political action committee donations. Rogan's PAC money is coming largely from 
business groups, while Schiff's has come from labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest disclosures provoked predictable sniping between the campaigns. 
"Adam Schiff has accused us of taking special interest money, but his reports 
show he is taking it too," said Natalie Blanning, Rogan's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blanning cited, for example, a late contribution of $4,000 from the California 
State Employees Assn. PAC and $1,000 apiece contributions from Local 770, 
United Food Workers PAC, the California State Council of Carpenters PAC and the 
United Auto Workers Region 6 PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schiff has accused us of being the tools of conservatives for taking their 
money. Does this mean he's the slave of labor?" Blanning said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Gray-Barkan, a Schiff political consultant, said that the only PAC 
money received by Rogan that the Schiff campaign has criticized was given to 
the incumbent by Allied Business PAC, a committee whose funds come from four 
conservative Christian businessmen. This PAC and its individual members and 
their wives have given more than $35,000 to Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their PAC money is different from ours because it comes from the radical 
right and from four businessmen who live outside the district," Gray-Barkan 
said. "Our labor PAC money comes from working men and women, many of whom live 
inside the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanning said she expected Willie Brown and the state Democratic Party to dump 
much more money into the Schiff campaign than the amount reported so far.

STRIKE LOOMS AS DAILY NEWS PLANS JOB CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Composing room workers at the Daily News of Los Angeles, whose contract 
expires at midnight tonight, have voted to strike but have not set a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News says the positions have become obsolete because of a new 
computer pagination system that would eliminate the need for manual layout and 
composing work.The Woodland Hills-based newspaper plans to eliminate about 70 
of the 83 composing room jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was approved Sunday at a special meeting of the Southern California 
Typographical Mailers Union Local 17, which represents 83 Daily News employees. 
Union President Gerry Curran said a deadline for the strike would probably be 
set within the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll meet for more negotiations and see if they're willing to bargain," 
Curran said. "They haven't so far." Talks between the Daily News and the union 
have been ongoing since July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News also has said its advertising makeup work will be subcontracted 
to an outside firm in Pennsylvania. These steps will dramatically reduce the 
amount of time needed to produce the newspaper, said Tom Burke, an attorney 
representing the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper has set no date for the layoffs. But Burke said employees would be 
given 60 days' notice, as required under federal law. He said the paper also 
has agreed to extend their medical benefits for one month beyond that. The 
union scale salary for the composing room jobs is $653 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has eliminated their jobs," Burke said. "Frankly, the union has 
not faced the issue in negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's multimillionaire owner, Jack Kent Cooke, put the Daily News up 
for sale in May, but has yet to find a buyer. The paper has replaced most of 
its top management in the past few months.

VALLEY BRIEFING: HERE'S THE SCOOP; THE SUPER SCOOPER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S 
NEWEST FIREFIGHTING WEAPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After last year's wildfires, the Los Angeles County Fire Department has 
temporarily added two new weapons to its firefighting arsenal: a pair of 
amphibious aircraft known as Super Scoopers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a unique partnership between the county and insurance companies, the 
Canadian-made aircraft have been leased from the Quebec government for a 
three-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Scoopers are able to carry three times as much water as the county's 
firefighting helicopters and need not land to replenish their water supply. Ten 
seconds of contact with the surface of a nearby lake, reservoir or even the 
ocean is all that is needed between drops. The plane's ability to fly in narrow 
canyons make it ideal for battling fires in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 County firefighters first used the planes, based at Van Nuys Airport, on a 
recent grass fire in the Antelope Valley. A Look at California's Ties to the 
Super Scooper 1970: Canadair, the plane's manufacturer, volunteers a CL-215 to 
fight Berkeley fires. Los Angeles County requests use of the plane to help 
fight fires in Malibu. After three days, the aircraft are returned because of 
contractual disputes with other fixed-wing firefighting aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 1979: Two planes are tested for 2 1/2 months by Los Angeles County Fire 
Department, helping fight Laurel Canyon fire in September. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: Ballot initiative aimed at purchasing two aircrafts fails to get 
required two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 1982: Legislation introduced to authorize state purchase of two CL-215s. In 
October, two aircraft are leased for testing by forestry department. 
</P>
<P>
 1991: After destructive Oakland and Berkeley Hills wildfires, Assemblyman 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) introduces legislation to lease two Super 
Scoopers for 1992-93 fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: Legislation passes state Assembly and Senate, but is vetoed by governor. 
</P>
<P>
 1993: After disastrous wildfires in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties, 
Friedman tries again to get state approval to lease two Super Scoopers for 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 June, 1994: Friedman legislation passes Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 August, 1994: Friedman legislation passes Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 September, 1994: County Board of Supervisors votes to fund leasing of one 
CL-215 for up to three months beginning in October. Gov. Wilson signs law 
enabling state to lease two Super Scoopers for 1995 and 1996 fire seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1994: Canadair provides two planes for testing and evaluation. 
California insurance industry contributes to funding.

four hours before refueling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crew: Two Canadian pilots and one from L.A. County Fire Department 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost: Leasing over three months for $719,000 for two crews and mechanics, 
plus $515 an hour in flight. Purchase price for one plane is $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Excess water drains out of baffle The Scoop 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department has identified up to 15 local bodies of water from 
which the pla e can scoop, including the ocean. The body of water must be at 
least 4,000 feet long, 300 feet wide and six feet deep. It can scoop in head 
winds to 45 m.p.h. and waves to five feet. Pilots change technique in high-wave 
conditions, scooping across crest of waves instead of bouncing from wave to 
wave. Here's what takes place: 
</P>
<P>
 1. As plane skims water at 100 m.p.h., pilot lowers the two 3-by-5-inch 
scoops. (A) 
</P>
<P>
 2. Water rushes through scoops into two storage tanks (B). 
</P>
<P>
 3. In about 10 seconds, tank is full and plane rises off water. The Drop With 
small spotter plane leading the way, the Super Scooper begins its drop of water 
or water and foam from as low as 150 feet. Foam is often used ininitial attack 
on a fire. It is a soapy concentrate that helps water "cling" to vegetation. 1. 
Pilot opens water drop doors, releasing water onto fire. 2. If foam is used, 
pilot uses control that injects foam concentrate from its storage tank (C) into 
water tank. Upon release, mixture puffs up to 25 times its volume.

GREASE FIRE CLOSES MALL EATERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoke from a small grease fire at the Glendale Galleria temporarily shut down 
the mall's food court on Tuesday afternoon and caused an estimated $200,000 in 
damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some flames and a lot of black smoke," said Officer Brian Cohen of 
the Glendale Police Department's substation in the mall on Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time it was all over, the food couldn't be re-served and it was closed 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3 p.m. fire started in the ventilation system over a stove top at the 
Wazwan Restaurant, which features Indian cuisine. About a dozen firefighters 
put out the flames in 15 minutes, a Glendale fire dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, but about 100 customers were evacuated from the food 
court's 13 eateries and some adjacent stores. "The smoke is what caused us to 
evacuate the food court," said Melissa Beissner, spokeswoman for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 stores were closed until 4:30 p.m., she said. The food court is 
expected to reopen today..

90 TREES AND BUSHES STOLEN FROM NURSERY IN SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Someone is stealing the trees of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 trees and bushes worth $10,000 have been stolen from a Saugus nursery 
during the past two weeks. These trees did not go quietly, but were carted off 
by a group of men in pickup trucks playing loud music as they loaded up on the 
foliage at Green Landscape Nursery in Saugus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They raise all kinds of hell," said Sgt. Dick Young of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. "One of the people that lived over there called and 
complained about employees being in there at night time. (The owner) said, 'No, 
they're not my people there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent theft occurred between midnight and 1 a.m. Monday at the 
four-acre lot. A woman who lives nearby said her 12-year-old daughter 
complained of being kept awake by music coming from the area, but the family 
never suspected it was tree thieves at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was one of his workers staying out there overnight and watching 
the nursery," she said, adding she has heard music only on one other occasion a 
couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items stolen were 60 bushes in 15-gallon containers, 20 white birch 
trees in 24-inch boxes and 10 large trees of various types cut into balls and 
other shapes, said Richard Green, the nursery's owner. He said the stolen items 
make up a small part of his inventory, but other items also appear to be 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have employees making a list of the other stuff," he said. "We don't know 
the total amount." 
</P>
<P>
 A gate leading to the lot has been found locked each morning, and any tracks 
left by vehicles are apparently covered up, according to a sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said landscaping thefts are not an everyday occurrence, but are not 
uncommon. He said the stolen foliage is sold to gardeners or to a group of 
residents through door-to-door sales.

ORGANIZERS AIM TO RECRUIT WORKERS FROM WIDE AREA INTO UNION FOLD; LABOR: 
IMMIGRANTS MAKING TEXTILES AND OTHER NON-DURABLE GOODS ARE SEEN AS RIPE FOR 
ORGANIZING. A MULTI-UNION EFFORT IS PLANNED FOR ALAMEDA CORRIDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Labor leaders hope to target hundreds of thousands of immigrant industrial 
workers along the Alameda Corridor in a massive campaign they say would 
transform union organizing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before in Los Angeles -- and rarely elsewhere -- have organizers 
attempted to create a regionwide, multi-union drive targeting entire 
industries, said Peter Olney, coordinator of the Los Angeles Manufacturing 
Action Project (LAMAP) and a longtime labor organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 LAMAP, a new nonprofit group of labor and community activists and scholars, 
plans to begin organizing ethnic workers next year along the Alameda Corridor, 
an industrial swath that cuts through Los Angeles from Downtown to the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the corridor are some of the county's grittiest neighborhoods, where 
industry sometimes abuts schoolyards and where tens of thousands of jobs have 
been lost in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But as aerospace, auto and other large industries have left the area, 
industries that produce textiles, apparel and other non-durable goods have 
remained relatively stable. 
</P>
<P>
 About 66% of the workers in those jobs are Latino and 8.6% are Asian Pacific 
immigrants, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most work in 
non-union shops for low wages and no benefits, and many live in nearby 
communities on the Eastside, in the Southeast area and in South-Central Los 
Angeles, said Olney, a former organizer for the Service Employees International 
and Furniture Workers unions. 
</P>
<P>
 This immigrant population, working jobs with no real safety nets or future, is 
ripe for organizing, said David Sickler, regional director of the AFL-CIO 
Region 6 and LAMAP co-founder.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there was an economic ladder those people in the Alameda Corridor could 
climb, it would be different," Sickler said. "But you have a permanent 
underclass there, and that's where seeds of discontent are sown." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but Gordon Richards, chief economist for the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers, said the higher wages that would accompany unionization could 
raise unemployment as employers are forced to cut their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you force wages up, you slow the rate of job creation," Richards said. 
"If you raise wages within particular industries, these firms would likely 
employ less. If you squeeze a producer's profit margin, they need to make it up 
somewhere and they aren't going to raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
 LAMAP, funded with a start-up grant from the San Francisco-based Rosenberg 
Foundation, has enlisted UCLA's Community Scholars program, a joint initiative 
of the school's Department of Urban Planning and Center for Labor Research and 
Education, to analyze which industries in the Alameda Corridor should be 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
 When the UCLA group completes its study in June, Olney said, LAMAP hopes to 
unite up to 15 unions in a regionwide organizing campaign that would target 
entire industries within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the campaign could boost economic development and uplift entire 
communities, said UCLA professor Gilda Haas, who will oversee the study. Since 
the 1992 riots, Haas said, city leaders have proposed a variety of remedies, 
including small business loans, training and educational assistance, to address 
economic and social ills in Los Angeles. Now, she said, leaders should work to 
change industrial employment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have 700,000 manufacturing workers and they have poor working 
conditions and wages, that's going to affect the communities they live in," 
Haas said. "So if you're going to talk about rebuilding L.A., you have to start 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders such as Huntington Park Mayor Ric Loya and Bell Councilman 
George Cole, once an officer for United Steelworkers Local 1845 and a former 
worker at Bethlehem Steel, a plant that employed 2,000 when it closed in 1983, 
have endorsed the LAMAP plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the first time we're going to have people look at economic 
development throughout our community," Cole said. "And I'm excited about the 
organizing part because we have so many sweatshops and so much exploitation of 
people who don't have a voice in the manufacturing industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists warn that LAMAP's plan could backfire, forcing industry out of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal guess is that organizing would contribute to the departure of at 
least some companies," said Ed Lawler, a USC professor of management and 
organization. ". . . The win-win argument is that if you uplift your work force 
with good wages and good jobs, you create a positive economic cycle. But there 
are some kinds of (low-skilled) work that don't lend themselves to that sort of 
scenario and can be done cheaper in Mainland China or somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast area alone has lost more than 2,000 jobs in the past year, 
despite labor movement efforts to preserve them. But Olney rebuts any argument 
that the labor movement is dead, that companies may flee the city to avoid the 
higher costs of union labor or that immigrant workers are too hard to organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is "the industrial heartland" of the United States, he 
said, home to 717,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly twice the number of any other 
county in the nation, according to UCLA analysts. "The much-ballyhooed death of 
manufacturing in Los Angeles is largely a myth," Olney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he acknowledges that the number of manufacturing jobs in the county 
has declined from 924,000 in 1979 to 671,200 in 1993, he points out that, 
according to UCLA analysts, most losses were in the durable goods industry -- 
products such as steel, rubber and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in non-durable goods -- light manufacturing such as the garment industry 
that LAMAP hopes to target -- stayed almost level, decreasing by only about 
7,500 jobs in the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some very innovative (organizing) campaigns that speak well 
of the future," Sickler added, referring to the successful 1990 Justice for 
Janitors campaign that won a labor agreement for 1,000 workers and the 1992 
strike of 4,000 mostly Latino drywall carpenters that in some cases tripled 
wages. LAMAP's strategy will be to target manufacturers of non-durable goods 
that have demonstrated a need or a preference to stay in Los Angeles, Olney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olney: "We have to be cold and calculating about what (manufacturing) 
sectors can support higher wages and benefits without becoming insolvent but 
optimistic in the sense that organizing workers has to be done with big 
thinking. That's the only way to create a social movement."

NOAH BEERY JR.; FILM, TV CHARACTER ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran character actor Noah Beery Jr., best known as the genial, folksy 
father of private detective Jim Rockford on television's "The Rockford Files," 
died Tuesday, a family spokesman said. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Beery, who had a 60-year film and television career, was born into a family of 
great Hollywood character actors. He had been in poor health in recent years 
after a stroke in the mid-1980s, said Linda Fowler, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife, Lisa, was at his side," said Fowler, who added that the actor died 
about 7:30 p.m. at his ranch 80 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Beery became best known for his role in the 1974-1980 "Rockford" detective 
series that featured James Garner as the likable, hard-luck investigator of the 
series name. Beery played a retired trucker known affectionately as "Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
 Beery built a career playing a sidekick and pal, first in the movies and later 
in television. He appeared as a doughboy friend of Gary Cooper in "Sergeant 
York" in 1941, a classic film biography about one of America's greatest World 
War I heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked steadily in dozens of Westerns and serials. 
</P>
<P>
 Television work eventually became a staple for him. He appeared in such 1950s 
series as "Riverboat" and "Circus Boy." In the role of Joey the Clown, Beery 
played a father figure to a very young Mickey Dolenz, who later went on to 
become one of the Monkees singing group. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Beery had a supporting role with Burt Reynolds in "The Best Little 
Whorehouse in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Beery was the son of Hollywood character actor Noah Beery Sr. and the nephew 
of Wallace Beery, a versatile actor who won the Academy Award for his role in 
1931's "The Champ." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Aug. 10, 1913, in New York City, Noah Jr. made his screen debut as a 
child in the 1920 silent film "The Mark of Zorro," which starred his father and 
Douglas Fairbanks. He toured with his father in stock theater companies and 
between appearances was educated at military academies. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Beery was twice nominated for Emmy Awards for his work on "The 
Rockford Files." 
</P>
<P>
 His film credits include the 1940 version of John Steinbeck's classic "Of Mice 
and Men" and the 1960 courtroom drama "Inherit the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 His survivors include two daughters, Muffett and Melissa, a son, Buck, and 
three stepchildren, Page, Sean and Lorena. Funeral plans were pending.

PROSECUTOR LINKS SLAYING TO VEHICLE; TRIAL: IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT, THE 
ATTORNEY SAYS DEFENDANT MARK SCOTT THORNTON NEEDED KELLIE O'SULLIVAN'S CAR KEYS 
TO FLEE THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton kidnaped Kellie O'Sullivan at random and forced the 
Westlake nurse to his secret mountain hide-out before fatally shooting her -- 
all so he could steal her car keys, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging a Superior Court jury to convict the 20-year-old defendant of 
first-degree murder, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said Thornton needed 
O'Sullivan's vehicle to flee the area because local police had a warrant out 
for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher would neither 
deny nor confirm that his client murdered O'Sullivan. But Asher said the 
prosecution theory of the case is all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher acknowledged Thornton was under intense pressure to leave the area 
because the young man had violated his probation and faced a warrant for his 
arrest. Still, he said, prosecutors have no evidence to prove Thornton planned 
a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury finds Thornton guilty of first-degree murder and rules that he 
planned the act, he could be sentenced to death in the gas chamber. The 
prosecution expects to call at least 15 witnesses in the next three weeks to 
build its case. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Asher told the jury, "There will be no (death) penalty trial in this 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's trial comes more than a year after O'Sullivan was killed Sept. 14, 
1993. She had been missing for 12 days when two members of a search party, who 
had joined a massive hunt for her body, discovered it amid some thick brush in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Thornton with murder, kidnaping and robbery, saying he 
took the woman to the mountains and shot her. Thornton was arrested in Reno 
five days after O'Sullivan disappeared, and police say he had her truck with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris -- weaving a long, tragic story in his opening statement -- said the 
crime grew out of Thornton's desire to leave the area quickly and avoid arrest 
for a juvenile probation violation, an offense that could have earned him no 
more than 60 days in juvenile jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than face the short jail stay, Thornton embarked on a desperate path 
starting with forged checks and stolen credit cards and ending in murder and 
kidnaping, Kossoris told the jury. His path crossed O'Sullivan's outside a 
Thousand Oaks pet store, where she had gone to buy bird seed for her parrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellie O'Sullivan got off work in the San Fernando Valley about 12:30 p.m. the 
day of her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 After going to a Calabasas bank and a computer store, she stopped to chat with 
a doctor friend with whom she ran marathons. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only other errand before the pet store was a stop at the cleaner on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard, Kossoris said. That was a little before 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 She was in a good mood in the pet store, Kossoris said. But her smile was gone 
sometime after 2 p.m., when Margaret Spaulding saw O'Sullivan and Thornton in 
the victim's Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spaulding is expected to testify that Thornton was in the driver's seat and 
O'Sullivan, with her head hanging down, in the passenger seat. "The woman 
appeared to reach for something, and the man backhanded her against the 
passenger window," Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaulding has said the vehicle was heading toward the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before that day, Thornton had considered the Santa Monica Mountains the 
perfect place to dump a body, Kossoris said. In fact, he had told an 
ex-girlfriend from Glendale the year before just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving through the mountains after a school dance, Thornton turned to the 
girl and said, "I could take you someplace where nobody would ever find you," 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in October, 1992. Four months later, Thornton and another friend 
began hanging out at a place in the mountains only 7/10ths of a mile from where 
searchers eventually would discover O'Sullivan's body, the prosecutor told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton moved with his mother and stepfather to Ventura County in 1992. He 
had been on probation in Los Angeles County for a burglary, but that too was 
transferred to his new county. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thousand Oaks High School, he hung around with Darren DeWaele, a boy two 
grade levels below Thornton, according to DeWaele, who testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris said that on July 10, the two boys broke into a Thousand Oaks storage 
facility. Testifying under a grant of immunity, DeWaele said that Thornton 
stole a handgun, some bullets and a $100 bill during that break-in on Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not the only trouble for Thornton, Kossoris said. He also missed 
a meeting five days after the break-in with his new probation officer. What's 
more, Thornton had been thrown out of his family's house for some unstated 
reason and was living out of a room at an Econo Lodge motel, Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the motel that he met Stephanie Campbell, who had just moved to 
Ventura County after her father changed jobs and was staying at the motel 
temporarily with her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and Thornton quickly became a couple, he said, but they broke up 
after agreeing that Thornton was not right for the 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Thornton had more to worry about than a failed relationship, Kossoris 
told the jury. Probation officials had issued a warrant for his arrest on Aug. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton left the motel then and rented a room from a local Thousand Oaks 
couple, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, his new landlords discovered their checks missing. Kossoris 
said Thornton bought a police radio, maps and ammunition for the handgun he had 
stolen from the storage facility. He also put in a call to DeWaele, Kossoris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two met at school the next day -- Sept. 13 -- and went to several branches 
of the Home Savings of America bank, where they forged some checks for cash, 
Kossoris said. The next day, Thornton planned to steal a car and leave the 
county, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, Thornton wanted to take Stephanie Campbell with him. 
</P>
<P>
 After killing O'Sullivan, Thornton got a tattoo emblazoned on his body, 
Kossoris said. It read: "Stephanie." 
</P>
<P>
 He also took that time to buy some camping gear and other items. That night, 
after Stephanie's mother picked her up at work, Thornton was waiting for them 
at their house, Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Stephanie approached the front door, the defendant ran around the corner 
with a gun in hand and approached her," Kossoris said. "He said, 'Come with me, 
I have a gun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he forced Stephanie into the stolen Explorer, Thornton fired a shot at the 
girl's mother, Linda Campbell, Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Stephanie persuaded Thornton to drive to Reno so they could go to 
the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Circus Circus, Stephanie managed to slip away from Thornton and alert the 
hotel's security. While the guard plotted his strategy, Thornton was paging 
Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 Police surrounded him while he played a video game. After briefly pointing his 
gun at officers, Thornton surrendered. Kossoris said a ballistics expert was 
able to match the bullets taken from Thornton's gun to those that killed 
O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will urge you to find the murder is murder of first degree," Kossoris told 
the jury, wrapping up his lengthy presentation that included maps, charts and 
graphs. "And we will also urge you to conclude that the murder is 
premeditated." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense's opening statement was considerably shorter than the 
prosecution's. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher denied that Thornton had planned any murder. He said that his client had 
used stolen checks to purchase a pager, a large aquarium and a large television 
in the week before the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not the type of items you buy if you plan to commit a murder and 
flee police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asher acknowledged that his client purchased bullets the day before O'Sullivan 
was killed. He insisted, however, that the ammunition was not bought "with a 
plan to kill anyone but to protect himself on the road," Asher said, noting his 
client was carrying with him the money he had gotten from the forged checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher said his client realized he needed to leave town only after his 
landlord, Lenore Brier, discovered her checks had been stolen. "Mark spent a 
sleepless night on Sept. 13, unable to go back to the Briers and (with) nowhere 
else to turn," Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher also denied a prosecution suggestion that Thornton "forced" O'Sullivan 
into her truck. Had that happened, he said, employees in the pet store would 
have noticed because O'Sullivan had parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Asher said the defense planned to attack the credibility of 
several key prosecution witnesses, including Spaulding, the woman who said she 
saw Thornton and O'Sullivan in the Explorer together. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least six separate interviews with police and prosecutors, he said, she 
has told different stories, once even saying she saw the victim and the 
defendant at 4:30 -- an hour after O'Sullivan was reportedly killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher said the coroner in Los Angeles who performed the autopsy on 
O'Sullivan's body, Dr. James Ribe, also is not credible. "Dr. Ribe is willing 
to testify to whatever theory he is asked to support," Asher contended. 
</P>
<P>
 And Asher said that Stephanie Campbell, another prosecution witness, was never 
kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephanie was not held by force and was free to leave at any time," said 
Asher. "When was the last time you heard of a kidnaper paging his kidnap 
victim?"

BLUE CROSS CONSIDERING MOVE TO CAMARILLO; BUSINESS: CITY REPORTS A TENTATIVE 
DEAL. FIRM WOULD BUILD A COMPLEX TO REPLACE NEWBURY PARK AND THOUSAND OAKS 
FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue Cross of California is negotiating to build a giant regional center in 
Camarillo that would house more than 1,300 employees and replace the company's 
operations in the Conejo Valley by 1997, officials confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the move is approved -- and city officials say a tentative deal has been 
struck -- Blue Cross and its main subsidiary would buy 60 acres in an east 
Camarillo business park from Pardee Construction Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross officials would only confirm the company's tentative plan to build 
a 350,000- to 550,000-square-foot insurance sales- and policy-processing 
complex in the Mission Oaks area. Pardee officials refused any comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said Blue Cross and Pardee have agreed 
on the broad outlines of a deal, and a contract may be signed by the end of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story Camarillo site would replace two now operating just over the 
Conejo Grade -- one on Corporate Center Drive in Newbury Park and a second on 
La Tienda Road in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the 1,340 employees are expected to commute to the new offices, 
officials said. And if the company continues its rapid growth, the Camarillo 
complex could include three phases, not just the initial project now 
contemplated, company spokesman Larry Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Blue Cross' arrival would be a boon to Camarillo, which 
recently launched a regionwide campaign to lure new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said the move would beef up the city's economic base and give 
it a tax boost because of spinoff sales at nearby restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great thing," Gose said. "I hear that they will be bringing 
quite a number of employees, and I understand they will be doing some building 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city did not offer any tax rebates to lure Blue Cross and its 
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. subsidiary other than lowering the city's 
traffic impact fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like this proposal because it is a good fit with the existing 
neighborhoods and businesses, and because Blue Cross is a very reputable 
company," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, however, the mood was less than buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate when that happens," said Stephen Rubenstein, chief executive of the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. He said the move would hurt numerous 
dependent businesses, especially restaurants and stores. But he said the 
Thousand Oaks housing market probably would not be hurt since Blue Cross 
employees would simply commute to Camarillo -- only five miles from the Newbury 
Park facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo said he is concerned about Blue 
Cross' intentions and would make a last-ditch effort to keep the company in the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would very much like to talk with them," he said. "They just moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 John Siemon, a WellPoint vice president, emphasized that Blue Cross has not 
concluded its negotiations and that no contract has been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said if a deal is closed, the company would build a cluster of offices 
near the Ventura Freeway, none taller than two stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this facility is developed, we believe that it will help us streamline our 
operations in Ventura County," Siemon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new complex would be Blue Cross' central facility for the sales and 
management of health insurance policies sold to individuals, senior citizens 
and small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Blue Cross and its for-profit WellPoint subsidiary would still be based 
in Woodland Hills, where about 2,200 people are employed. The companies employ 
4,000 people statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's confirmation follows a series of economic successes by Camarillo. 
City economic development consultant James Jevens cited Technicolor Inc.'s 
acquisition of the former Everest & Jennings plant on Mission Oaks Boulevard in 
1992. And the company recently leased an adjoining 300,000-square-foot 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Jevens also mentioned a proposed 300,000-square-foot mini-mall, possibly 
anchored by a Target department store, at Las Posas Road and the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Camarillo successes include Prudential Life Insurance Co.'s proposed 
move of its Ventura County operations to a Camarillo facility, two new new 
movie theater projects and a new factory outlet mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are definitely starting to look up for us," Jevens said.

COUNTY HIRES D.C. LOBBYISTS TO PROTECT BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembling a defensive team to protect local Navy bases, county supervisors on 
Tuesday hired a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm to plot strategies against 
potential closure of the bases at Point Mugu or Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors unanimously approved the $15,000-a-month contract with the 
lobbying firm that includes a former California congressman and an attorney 
with extensive experience in base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a good contract," said Supervisor John K. Flynn. "It is 
certainly not an inexpensive contract. But the stakes are monumental." 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders agreed to administer the contract for a local task force of 
defense contractors, business leaders and public officials who are concerned 
about the financial impact of losing the bases, along with their 20,000 jobs 
and $1.5 billion they pump into the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has raised $190,000 so far from local governments and 
businesses to pay for lobbyists and rally the community to support the local 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has begun to work on a fourth round of base closures ordered by 
Congress to save tax dollars by scaling back the military after the end of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Defense William J. Perry has instructed various branches of the 
military to recommend closing about 15% of the nation's bases in this round. In 
March, they will release a hit list of bases to an independent Base Closure and 
Realignment Commission appointed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commission is designed to be insulated from lobbying efforts, 
communities around the nation are spending top dollar for top-notch lobbyists 
to help them collect data and mount a defense should their local base end up on 
the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's BRAC '95 Task Force settled on the firm Copeland, Hatfield, 
Lowery & Jacquez after reviewing the resumes of a number of firms, including an 
early favorite that had mixed reviews from past clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best of all of the ones that we've looked at," Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee said about the firm. She said the county's usual Washington lobbyist, 
Roger Honberger, said the firm comes well-recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the partners, former Rep. Bill Lowery, (R-San Diego), is highly 
regarded in Congress and in the Pentagon. He decided not to run for reelection 
in 1992, after he had written 300 overdrafts on the scandal-ridden House bank. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 12 years in office, Lowery rose to a position as the ranking 
Republican member of the House appropriations subcommittee on military 
construction. The subcommittee controls of the purse strings of military 
construction projects and has oversight of the base-closure process. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Jacquez, another partner in the firm, will do most of the leg work, 
collecting and analyzing data to help local officials prepare a defense if 
needed. She has already spent two days collecting documents from previous 
rounds of base closures and met with various officials from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows the process," said Cal Carerra, co-chairman of the task force. 
"She'll be the principal investigator for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquez has represented Alameda County, Merced County and Rock Island, Ill., 
during previous rounds of base closures in 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did a fantastic job in shepherding our efforts," said Mark Friedman, 
chief of staff to Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata. "She is extremely 
thorough and very persistent in fighting against closure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the commission decided to close the Alameda Naval Air Station, the 
Naval Aviation Depot and Oak Knoll Naval Hospital. But Friedman said it is not 
a poor reflection on her work, given that she helped save the facilities in the 
1991 round. They were closed in 1993 for factors beyond anyone's control, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquez has continued to work with Alameda County, helping line up federal 
money to help convert the military installations to civilian use.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has done an excellent job," said Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, 
who is vice chairman of his county's base conversion commission. "She has kept 
us well-informed on the things that we could take advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquez, an attorney, said the firm's strategy will be to prepare a defense 
based on a worst-case scenario, just like preparing for trial. She plans to 
collect all necessary data on the local bases and their potential competitors 
and then run the same computer programs that military officials use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be able to prove empirically the military value of the bases and 
the negative impact on military readiness that closure would have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Leavens, head of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn., said 
she was impressed with the firm and Jacquez, whom she met on a recent trip to 
the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a wealth of experience in his area," Leavens said. She said she was 
also pleased to have the county represented by a firm with Democratic and 
Republican partners with contacts in Congress, the Pentagon and the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are well-positioned to help us pry open doors wherever we need to," 
Leavens said.

ELECTIONS / COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT; DEFICIT ISN'T ONLY MAJOR ISSUE TRUSTEE 
CANDIDATES FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like so many elected officials adjusting to daunting revenue shortfalls, 
trustees of the Ventura County Community College District are scouring their 
49-page budget for another $800,000 in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say there is nowhere left to cut. The $59.6-million spending 
plan is $3 million less than what the district spent a year ago, and any 
further cuts could mean staff layoffs or class closures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest $800,000 deficit is not the only issue confronting trustees of 
the three-campus district, where the seats of Pete E. Tafoya, Karen M. Boone 
and Gregory P. Cole will be contested Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three incumbents, Tafoya is unopposed and Cole is not seeking 
reelection. Boone is being challenged by former college administrator John 
Tallman and businessman Jim Hibbs. And four others are vying for Cole's empty 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates point to a top-heavy management structure and declining 
enrollment as the major issues facing the governing board. Others say the 
district needs to integrate the three campuses -- in Oxnard, Ventura and 
Moorpark -- to cut costs and better serve students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they are not getting enough input in the decision-making process. 
Non-teaching staff members complain that morale is at an all-time low because 
they have been working without a contract for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And students are afraid they will get priced out of a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has been broken for some time," Cole said. "It was actually in 
total disrepair when I came on board five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said many of the district's problems have been resolved since he took the 
dais in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has installed some measure of financial control that was found 
lacking after the indictment of a former trustee, has gotten rid of a 
chancellor and two college presidents and has brought in fiscal managers to 
rein in excessive spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reform does take some time, but I think some of the current issues have been 
the outgrowth of some of the reforms we put in place," Cole said. "There's a 
lot more to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Area 5, where Tafoya is running uncontested, the trustee agrees that the 
district still has problems that need to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reserves are not that high and we continue to see cutbacks in education 
year after year," he said. "The four years I've been in office we have seen 
cuts of 1% to 4% each year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Area 1 seat, Boone, 37, represents Ventura, Saticoy, El Rio and north 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent was appointed to the five-member governing board in 1992, when 
Trustee Gregory Kampf resigned to accept an administrative job in Northern 
California. Boone beat out 10 other applicants for the job when she was 
appointed in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone said she is emphasizing fiscal responsibility in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of three trustees to support the final budget that included the 
$800,000 in revenues the district lost when Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed state 
legislation that would have provided millions of dollars to community colleges 
to offset sinking property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would not touch the district's cash reserves to make up the 
deficit, but would support using an anticipated health insurance refund to 
cover the shortfall. Boone also wants to establish a common numbering system 
for the three campuses so classes are more easily transferable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our condition has improved in the last two years, but we're not there yet," 
Boone said. "I'd like to see us get off the state chancellor's watch list." 
</P>
<P>
 The district was placed on a statewide watch list when it fell below the cash 
reserves required by education officials in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Area 1 contest, Tallman, who was a vice chancellor in the Ventura 
County Community College District for 10 years, has been the most critical of 
the district's spending and budgeting policies. He also complained that 
trustees passed the 1994-95 budget knowing Gov. Pete Wilson would probably veto 
the community college funding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still don't have a budget," said Tallman, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hibbs, the third Area 1 contender, is a 50-year-old former major league 
baseball player who has since taught high school, sold real estate and served 
as executive director of the Ventura College Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbs said he is most concerned with what he sees as the district's failure to 
serve its students. For example, he said, they should be able to enroll more 
easily, books and other supplies should be less expensive, and core classes 
should be made more widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go out there and recruit, and sell the importance of higher 
education," Hibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, Tallman leads in campaign fund-raising. He reported total 
contributions of $11,671, more than double the $5,048 that Boone has collected. 
Hibbs filed a form promising to spend less than $1,000 on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Area 2 seat vacated by Cole represents the Oxnard Plain, Thousand Oaks and 
the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, former Moorpark College career counselor Annette Broersman 
Burrows is up against clinical psychologist Donald W. Kingdon, orthodontist 
Norman J. Nagel and attorney Donald E. Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Burrows, 40, quit her job at Moorpark College after 10 years 
because of a dispute with the college president. She now works as director of 
career planning at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the level of student services has dropped dramatically over the 
years, and that the district should redouble its efforts to help students 
transfer to four-year schools. Burrows suggests slashing the number of 
administrators and consolidating central district services to avoid 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking at a budget that is in as much trouble as ours is in, you 
have to stop putting Band-Aids on it and look at long-term solutions," Burrows 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdon works as chief of the child and adolescent services division at the 
Ventura County Department of Mental Health Services. He said restructuring 
district finances and kicking politics out of the board meetings are his top 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized district officials for ignoring suggestions made by the 1993-94 
Ventura County grand jury, which concluded this summer that the district 
mismanaged its money. Kingdon also suggested that college presidents be given 
more authority and that the administration be downsized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't cut any more at the colleges," said Kingdon, 42. "If further cuts 
are necessary, it's probably going to happen in other places such as the 
district office." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel, who decided to move to Ventura County after a stint in the U.S. Navy, 
has practiced orthodontics in Thousand Oaks for more than 20 years. He said, 
among other things, that the district should increase its grant-writing efforts 
to increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hibbs in Area 1, Nagel suggests a more aggressive recruiting campaign to 
beef up enrollments. He also said district officials should work harder with 
Joyce Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, at 
getting a public university built locally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody at the college district level seems to have a good idea of where that 
project stands at the state level," said Nagel, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks attorney Stevens bemoaned the district's poor record of student 
transfers to Cal State or University of California campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than three out of 20 students transfer to public universities in 
California, far below the 19% state average and the national average of 22%, 
according to district records. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens also recommended downsizing the administration, establishing a 
stronger coalition with local employers and integrating course offerings at the 
three campuses to save money and make transferring simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire organization needs to be re-examined, to the end of improving 
education for the students," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four Area 2 candidates, Nagel has collected nearly $20,000 for his 
campaign -- far more than any of his competitors have to spend. Almost half of 
Nagel's war chest, however, came from a personal loan of $10,000 to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdon is the only other of the four candidates doing any serious 
fund-raising. He reported contributions of $7,961. Burrows and Stevens have 
said they will not spend more than $1,000 each on their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those outside the campaign see signs of trouble on the existing board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leanne Colvin, chapter president of the Service Employees International Union 
Local 535, which represents about 350 non-teaching staff members, said the 
board has a history of not working cohesively. 
</P>
<P>
 She complains that the classified employees union has been without a contract 
since July, 1993, while administrators keep adding accountants and other 
workers to the district payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board doesn't work together," said Colvin, an administrative aide at 
Moorpark College. "You just never know what's going to happen next. Every board 
meeting holds some surprise because they're very fractured and they seem to 
fight themselves a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hoffman, the teachers union president, is less unhappy with the 
district. Her group won a 1% raise earlier this year after lengthy 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hoffman said she is worried that teachers seem to be getting shut out 
of the decision-making processes, despite state laws designed to include 
discussion among all parties on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The participation we have is in name only," Hoffman said. "If you're in the 
room, they consider that participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and staff members are not the only ones complaining about the board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard colleges are afraid of the increasing 
cost of a community college education, the availability of classes needed to 
transfer to universities and the price of books and other classroom materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It frustrates me," said Ruby Stewart, a journalism major at Oxnard College. 
"A lot of us students plan to graduate at a certain time, and if we can't get 
the classes we need, it delays graduating." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College business major Justin McQueen said he has several concerns he 
wishes the trustees would address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our library needs to be open more because we don't always have a place to 
study in the late hours," the 19-year-old said. "And bookstore prices are 
always a problem. They charge way too much for certain things."

 A fire destroyed $550,000 worth of art in Ojai on Tuesday morning, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the fire, which also caused $75,000 in damage to the 
house on San Gabriel Street, said Pam Sears, a county fire spokeswoman. 
Firefighter Mike Middough said an electrical short caused the fire about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Middough said the damaged art included paintings and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were burned completely," Middough said. "All it was was charred picture 
frames on the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 The home and the art were owned by Leonard and Linda Kiore, who own an Ojai 
wine and cheese store, officials said. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN HELD IN SCAM AT AUTO DEALERSHIP 
</P>

<P>
 A man authorities said sold cars he did not own from a south Oxnard auto 
dealership was in jail Tuesday after being arrested on suspicion of grand 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Federico, 62, of Ojai bought Sky Auto at 3610 S. Saviers Road in 
April, Department of Motor Vehicles investigator William Forestelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestelle said Federico acted as a middleman, accepting cars from other 
dealers and private parties with the agreement to pay for the cars once he sold 
them. But Federico never paid for the vehicles and, in some cases, the people 
he sold them to never received titles for the cars, Forestelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV received numerous complaints from both ends of Federico's operation, 
Forestelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestelle said he identified 10 cases in which Federico failed to pay for the 
cars he sold. He said the people now driving those cars would probably end up 
in court with the original owners of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big mess," Forestelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sky Auto closed in July. The DMV revoked its dealership license because 
Federico failed to register the change of ownership when he bought the 
dealership, Forestelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico was arrested Monday night at the DMV office and held in lieu of 
$25,000 bail, authorities said. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA/FILLMORE; TRICKS WERE FEW ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treats were plentiful but tricks were in short supply Halloween night, law 
enforcement agencies reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only pranks reported came from Ventura, where youths tossed toilet paper 
at the home of a former mayor, and in Fillmore, where tricksters sent fountains 
of water flowing onto streets from fire hydrants, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Greg Carson said his home on the 8200 block of Denver 
Street was hit by youths throwing toilet paper onto pine and birch trees in his 
front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house has probably 75 rolls of toilet paper hanging all around it," Carson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the fourth year his house has been targeted by vandals, Carson said. It 
started shortly after he was elected to the Ventura City Council and became 
mayor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said he figured out who the pranksters were last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done by my nieces and nephews," said Carson, a Ventura native who has 
extended family in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were intimidated at first because they thought the police were going to 
arrest them for tee-peeing the mayor," Carson said. "But now their numbers are 
growing and they've become very bold." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, someone cranked open at least 10 fire hydrants throughout the 
city, keeping firefighters busy turning them off, said Fire Chief Pat Askren. 
</P>
<P>
 Askren said he does not know who pulled the prank or whether the person had 
help. Although it kept firefighters busy, the trick caused no injury or damage, 
Askren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire chief was asked if he ever pulled a similar prank when he was a 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Askren chuckled, then said: "I'm not going to answer that question." KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; CITY HEARING SET ON CAR STORAGE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council will held a public hearing today on whether to 
allow a temporary automobile import storage yard on a 10-acre vacant site on 
Port Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the site, between J Street and Ann Avenue, have contended that 
the yard would drastically increase traffic and noise, and diminish the 
character of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't think that (Port) Hueneme Road is prepared to handle the 
traffic that the facility would bring to the area," said William Turner, who 
lives across from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials said traffic in the area will not increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic already occurs," said Greg Brown, an associate planner for the 
city. "The only difference is that instead of being driven to Oxnard, the cars 
would be stored in Port Hueneme."  
</P>
<P>
 Residents are also upset that the city plans to waive requirements for 
landscaping the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said it would not be economically feasible to spend more 
than $1 million to build parking lots and sidewalks for a temporary facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, yard owner Michael Poston has agreed to pay the city $1,818 a 
year, the equivalent of what he would pay in property tax had the site been 
landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
 If the permit is granted, Poston said, he would build a turning lane off the 
road, which would allow easier entrance to the facility and decrease the 
possibility of traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than an average of 60 cars a day, or 1,800 a month, would be driven 
from the port to the yard, and the facility would be closed in the evenings, 
Poston said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors Tuesday charged a Santa Paula man with murder and attempted murder 
for allegedly shooting one man to death and wounding two others after they had 
spoken with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 David Chavarria Lopez, 39, who was released from state prison six weeks ago, 
is accused of killing Pedro Cervera and wounding Miguel Gaxiola and Raul 
Gaxiola on Oct. 25, after firing four to six times into the van that the three 
men occupied outside the Mountain View Motel in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 All three victims were construction workers from Palmdale, who were working on 
a project in Santa Paula. Lopez was arrested shortly after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervera, 28, died en route to Santa Paula Hospital. The other two, both 35, 
were treated for their injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lopez's girlfriend told them that Lopez had become enraged that 
the victims had been talking to her earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was also charged with inflicting great bodily injury on his victims and 
using a firearm in the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released from prison Sept. 21 after serving a sentence for drug and 
stolen property convictions, a prison official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez remained at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. His 
arraignment is set for Monday in Municipal Court. JEFF McDONALD

 The attorney for an Oxnard man accused of shooting his wife to death in April, 
on Tuesday blamed the slaying on his client's accomplice in a motel robbery 
hours before the killing.

 Jose Santos Castaneda, twice convicted of robbery and now facing a murder 
charge in the death of his wife, Mina, could be subject to life in prison under 
the "three strikes" law if convicted in the trial that opened Tuesday in 
Ventura County Superior Court. He is also charged with illegal possession of a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Castaneda, 26, shot his wife through the head moments 
after returning to a Santa Paula birthday party April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Murphy told jurors that Mina Castaneda, a 
25-year-old honors student at Oxnard College, was angry at her husband for 
leaving the party earlier that Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant and an accomplice, Anthony Castillo, were gone several hours 
while Castillo robbed a motel clerk at the Oxnard Inn and Castaneda waited 
outside in the car, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Castaneda and Castillo finally returned to the Santa Paula home, an angry 
Mina Castaneda was waiting with a baseball bat, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within in matter of seconds the defendant raised his arm, pointed the gun at 
(his wife) and shot her in the head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo is a convicted drug felon scheduled to receive a lighter prison term 
for the robbery after he testifies against Castaneda, Murphy told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Willard Wiksell told jurors a different story. He said 
the evidence will show that Castillo was seen with the 9-millimeter handgun 
both before the robbery and after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never gave the gun back to Mr. Castaneda; he kept it," Wiksell said. "He's 
the one that should be on trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day jury trial is expected to conclude next week. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PALMS TO GIVE AGING PLAZA A NEW LOOK 
</P>

<P>
 It looked like the scene of an arboreal massacre -- dozens of leafy tree 
branches scattered across the pavement of Ventura's California Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may have appeared as vegetation mayhem was actually the latest step 
in the city's effort to rehabilitate the aging plaza.The eight New Zealand 
Christmas trees lying pell-mell around the plaza are being destroyed to make 
way for 10 feathery palm trees, city planners say. 
</P>
<P>
 With the palms, unlike their bushier kin, residents will finally be able to 
look down California Street to the ocean, city planner Pat Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not an issue of trees," he said. "It's an issue of allowing 
better visual and pedestrian access." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, he said, this is not the city acting Scrooge-like by removing 
Christmas trees as the holidays approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't look like Christmas trees," he said. "It's just a silly name. They 
flower. They get little red balls. They are really messy trees and kind of 
dirty-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 The new palms will be planted within the next 30 days, he said. The entire 
plaza project, which includes a new patterned walkway and a fountain, should be 
finished by March 1, he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY OKS 235-UNIT HOUSING PROJECT

<P>
 The Oxnard City Council voted after a public hearing Tuesday to approve plans 
for a 235-home residential development in the northeast end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village of Santa Rosa and Village of San Nicolas developments, proposed by 
the Standard Pacific Corp. of Westlake Village, would contain 193 single-family 
houses and 42 townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 The development would be near Rose Avenue and Colonia Road. 
</P>
<P>
 About 23 homes, 10% of the total, would be priced so low-income families could 
afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Macri-Ortiz of the Channel Counties Legal Services Assn. asked during 
an Oxnard Planning Commission hearing on the project last month that 15% of the 
homes be made affordable to low-income residents, but her request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 No members of the public attended Tuesday's public meeting, and no written 
opposition to the development was submitted to the City Council. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; KOJIMA HOUSING PLAN TO BE VIEWED FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday voted not to allow anyone other than real 
estate speculator Donald T. Kojima to submit a proposal at a Nov. 15 meeting to 
build low-cost housing on a city-owned 41-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a $5.32-million land deal between Kojima and Oxnard, the city 
agreed to give the developer first crack at submitting a plan to build about 
115 homes for low-income families on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was conceived as a way to relocate residents of the Oxnard Mobilehome 
Lodge, one of the county's worst slums, by building them a new place to live. 
But housing originally proposed by Kojima was criticized by farm worker 
advocates as too expensive, and the council vowed to provide less-costly homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance, which represents the 
Mobilehome Lodge residents, asked the council to allow two nonprofit groups to 
submit alternate proposals when Kojima submits his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the request was denied after a lengthy discussion in which council members 
criticized the deal they had given Kojima but ultimately agreed to honor it.  
</P>
<P>
 After the discussion, City Manager Tom Frutchey said the Kojima proposal will 
go before the council as a special report and proponents of alternate plans 
will have an opportunity to comment. He added that the Nov. 15 meeting will be 
the first step in a long process to find the right developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the City Council likes the proposal, they will accept it, although that is 
extremely unlikely," Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael A. Plisky also said the chances of the City Council 
accepting Kojima's proposal are slim, but added that he would stick by his word 
and give the developer the first opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 "We should . . . take care of our contractual obligation and get some real 
experts involved in this project," Plisky said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; CANDIDATE SAYS HIS TRUCK IS VANDALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Thousand Oaks City Council race winds down to a tense finish, candidate 
Lance Winslow on Tuesday reported that vandals poured sugar into his truck's 
fuel tank over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, who owns a mobile carwash business, said a truck bearing his company 
logo was vandalized in a pre-Halloween prank Sunday night.The truck was parked 
outside his home in the Wildwood neighborhood, Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate who lives in the same neighborhood, financial services 
manager Michael Friedman, reported last month that someone had slashed all four 
tires on his truck. Both Friedman and Winslow said they have received 
anonymous, threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You volunteer for the community, you're trying to help everyone out, and then 
someone goes and does this to you," Winslow said. "But why? This is so 
ridiculous. Why me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow said he believes someone dumped sugar into his fuel tank Sunday 
because the truck was running roughly Monday, though he did not discover the 
vandalism until Tuesday when the truck stalled and would not move. 
</P>
<P>
 When a mechanic changed the fuel filter, Winslow said, he saw it "filled with 
crud and molasses-like granules." Despite the $82 filter change, Winslow said 
the truck still stalls frequently and might need further repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Margaret O'Donnell confirmed that Winslow filed a police report 
Tuesday. The report will be forwarded to detectives for investigation, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-candidate Thousand Oaks council race has become increasingly nasty in 
recent weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every contender has reported seeing campaign signs ripped down, torn in 
half -- even hacked with chain saws.  
</P>
<P>
 At least two candidates have requested extra police patrols around their home 
or office, O'Donnell said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: BELL CANYON; FIREFIGHTERS PLAN CONTROLLED BURN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters will conduct a controlled burn of vegetation in the Santa Monica 
Mountains on Thursday to thin out tinder-dry growth, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn will begin at 5 a.m. on 700 acres near Bell Canyon, county fire 
officials said. Residents of Bell Canyon, Agoura Hills, Hidden Hills, Las 
Virgenes Canyon and Liberty Canyon may notice smoke from the exercise, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials expect most of the smoke to loft high over populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn is needed to eliminate dry grass, officials said. That particular 
area has not burned in more than 10 years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn will be canceled if windy or other unfavorable weather conditions 
develop, fire authorities said. KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; CAR DEALERS DONATE $5,000 TO CANDIDATE

<P>
 Car dealers at the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall, pouring still more money into a 
heated City Council race, donated $5,000 Tuesday to candidate Andy Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, a firefighter who has vowed to bolster public safety if elected, received 
several hundred dollars from individual car dealers earlier this fall.His 
latest donation, from the auto mall's official dealer association, bumps his 
campaign treasury up to nearly $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, former Councilman Lee Laxdal reported lending his campaign 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village auto dealers have contributed a total of 
$28,650 to six pro-business council candidates, financing television 
commercials, direct-mail flyers and newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial services manager Michael Friedman received the biggest boost from 
the car dealers -- $13,000, donated early in the campaign. Fox tallied the 
second-highest contribution: a total of $5,450. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates backed by the auto mall dealers are incumbent Judy Lazar, 
dentist Greg Cole, retired businessman Marshall Dixon and police detective 
Michael Markey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, Lazar, Fox and Markey have been endorsed by retiring Mayor Alex Fiore. 
Despite that endorsement, Fox has painted himself as an independent, not 
beholden to any special interest or political camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Fox nor his campaign manager, Jill Lederer, returned phone calls 
Tuesday. Susan Meija, a spokeswoman for the auto dealers' association, was not 
available for comment. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY REJECTS UNION REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about triggering increases in health care costs, Ventura County 
supervisors Tuesday rejected the Deputy Sheriffs Assn.'s request to give union 
members the option of another health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to put off the request after the 
county's benefit manager and a consultant warned that it could lead to higher 
insurance rates for the rest of the county's employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Williams, president of the Deputy Sheriffs Assn., asked for the option 
because some of the 559 union members are dissatisfied with Foundation Health, 
and some retirees have trouble getting the HMO to cover health care outside of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also noted that county firefighters were given the option to use Blue 
Cross as well as the other health plans provided by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But county Benefits Manager Barbara A. Olivier said the firefighters union won 
the extra health plan as a concession to end difficult contract negotiations. 
She urged the supervisors not to give away something to the deputies union six 
months before it is scheduled to renegotiate a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, she said, Foundation Health has advised that it may increase 
its rates for next year's contract if the county allows the deputies union to 
opt out of its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier said by offering Foundation Health a chance to provide coverage for 
14,000 county employees and dependents, the county had improved its purchasing 
power and negotiated a 2% reduction in health care costs for next year. 
Removing employees from that block of patients would reduce the county's 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the supervisors agonized over the decision for about an hour before 
rejecting the request. But they vowed to start earlier next year in reviewing 
an array of health care options for county employees. KENNETH R. WEISS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Professional Peace Officers Assn., which represents about 
300 correction and probation officers, has announced its endorsement of 
supervisorial candidates Judy Mikels and Trudi Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates earned the organization's endorsement because of their concern 
about juvenile and adult justice issues and "their commitment to improving 
community-based corrections programs," said association President Nancy Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, a Simi Valley councilwoman, is competing for the seat being vacated by 
Supervisor Vicky Howard, whose 4th Supervisorial District includes Simi Valley, 
Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she was pleased to receive the endorsement and promised if elected 
to protect funding for corrections programs. "After talking with me and seeing 
me in action (on the council), they felt confident with what I was telling 
them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, an attorney and Thousand Oaks resident, is running for a seat held by 
Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, whose 2nd Supervisorial District covers most of 
the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. Like Howard, VanderKolk is stepping down 
after one term. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace officers association represents about 300 correction services 
officers, deputy probation officers, airport and harbor patrol officers and 
county park rangers. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FARMERS FRUSTRATED ON SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Ventura County farmers whose land is in a Medfly quarantine zone 
expressed frustration Tuesday about having to spray their crops with pesticide 
far longer than they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials had told growers they would have to treat their 
crops with a mixture of malathion and bait four times during the month before 
harvest. But a new schedule -- based on Ventura County's winter temperatures 
over the last 30 years -- calls for much longer spray periods, ranging from 
five to 11 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Spalla of the Cooperative Medfly Project outlined the new rules Tuesday 
morning at a meeting in Santa Paula with about 100 growers, pesticide 
consultants and packinghouse officials.  
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, some growers within the 86-square-mile quarantine area said 
that the new spraying requirements make it more difficult to decide when to 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to gaze into a crystal ball and predict what the market's going to be 
three months from now," said Alan Voorhees, a general partner with 
Hoffman/Vance and Worthington, which manages 3,000 farm acres in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees said he was also disappointed that officials with the federal 
Department of Food and Agriculture have not set a date for lifting the 
quarantine if no more Medflies are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying over crop lands must be paid for by the grower. It is done by 
ground crews or by helicopters flying a few feet above trees. In contrast, the 
aerial spraying over the city of Camarillo is paid for by the state and done by 
helicopters flying at 300 to 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to aerial spraying, avocado growers have the option of fumigating 
their picked product with methyl bromide. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said fumigation will cause light-skinned avocados to 
discolor and will probably shorten the shelf life of others. JULIE FIELDS

PROPOSAL OFFERED TO EXPAND CITY'S HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; THOUSAND OAKS: 
PARTNERSHIP PROVIDES LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND FINANCIAL ADVICE TO LOW-INCOME 
RENTERS SEEKING TO BUY HOMES OR CONDOMINIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 She's signed the papers and pocketed the keys, but Magdalena Bautista still 
cannot believe she owns a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there it is, in the Las Casitas neighborhood of Thousand Oaks -- a 
two-bedroom condominium with a green lawn and a concrete stoop. She will move 
there next week, with her husband and two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 No more rent. No more landlords. No more borrowed space. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a financial boost from the city and the nonprofit group Many 
Mansions, the Bautistas have become homeowners.  
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'It can't be.' We couldn't believe it," said Bautista, who has lived 
in the Shadow Hills apartment complex for five years. "It has always been our 
dream to own a house." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks housing analysts on Tuesday presented a plan to help more 
families like the Bautistas by expanding the city's homeownership assistance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in partnership, Many Mansions and Thousand Oaks will lend money and 
offer financial counseling to low-income renters interested in buying homes or 
condominiums. The new program offers aid to any renter now living in one of 
Thousand Oaks' nine subsidized apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're providing a bridge across the scary path to homeownership," said 
Katherine Luna, who directs the program for Many Mansions. "We're saying, 
'Don't be scared, here's a friendly face.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Qualified buyers can obtain low-interest loans worth up to 15% of the 
appraised value of their new home. In some cases, families will receive enough 
cash to completely cover the down payment and closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans comes from the city's affordable housing fund, which draws on money 
collected by the Downtown Redevelopment Agency. Finance Director Bob Biery has 
estimated the fund contains about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the new buyers on track, Many Mansions counselors will follow their 
progress for the next 18 months, explaining bills, supervising mortgage 
payments and offering general support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful opportunity," Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another satisfied tenant-turned-owner, Guadelupe Vilchiz, added simply: "We 
are very content." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has helped out first-time home buyers for several years. The new 
program expands eligibility by bumping the maximum loan up to 15% of the home's 
appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, the program allows Many Mansions to conduct an aggressive 
outreach campaign, literally knocking on doors in the subsidized apartment 
complexes to encourage tenants to consider buying a home.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll walk you through it," Luna tells prospective buyers. "We are here as 
your friend." 
</P>
<P>
 That warm support helped Bautista and her husband, Jesus, take the first step. 
They were nervous about even imagining themselves as homeowners, until Many 
Mansions counselors offered their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked very hard to get us this home," Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
 Families earning up to $42,000 a year are eligible for the "Key to 
Homeownership" program. But those with much lower incomes can often afford to 
participate. One father earning just $5 an hour recently bought a home in Las 
Casitas, with the city's help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, officials are encouraging first-time buyers to consider Las Casitas, 
where two-bedroom condos sell for about $72,000. Another option is The Groves, 
a townhouse complex where units cost about $140,000, said Dan Hardy, executive 
director of Many Mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 If renters can find low-cost housing elsewhere in the city, they too can apply 
for city aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mansions screens all candidates to make sure they have steady jobs, a 
good rental history, a decent credit rating -- and the determination needed to 
carry through with decades of mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 20-year loans carry a 3% interest rate for the first five years, 
and a 5% interest rate for the remaining 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income residents of the following subsidized housing complexes are 
eligible for the program: Leggett Court, Calle Haya Apartments, Shadow Hills, 
Montclef Apartments, The Shadows, Schillo Gardens, Florence Janss Apartments, 
Conejo Future Village, Glenoaks.

DAILY NEWS IS THREATENED WITH WALKOUT 
</P>

<P>
 Composing room workers at the Daily News of Los Angeles, whose contract 
expires at midnight tonight, have voted to strike but have not set a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News, which also publishes Ventura County editions, says the 
positions have become obsolete because of a new computer pagination system that 
would eliminate the need for manual layout and composing work.The Woodland 
Hills-based newspaper plans to eliminate about 70 of the 83 composing room 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was approved Sunday at a special meeting of the Southern California 
Typographical Mailers Union Local 17, which represents 83 Daily News employees. 
Union President Gerry Curran said a deadline for the strike would probably be 
set within the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll meet for more negotiations and see if they're willing to bargain," 
Curran said. "They haven't so far." Talks between the Daily News and the union 
have been ongoing since July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News also has said its advertising makeup work will be subcontracted 
to an outside firm in Pennsylvania. These steps will dramatically reduce the 
amount of time needed to produce the newspaper, said Tom Burke, an attorney 
representing the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper has set no date for the layoffs. But Burke said employees would be 
given 60 days' notice, as required under federal law. He said the paper also 
has agreed to extend their medical benefits for one month beyond that. The 
union scale salary for the composing room jobs is $653 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has eliminated their jobs," Burke said. "Frankly, the union has 
not faced the issue in negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper's multimillionaire owner, Jack Kent Cooke, put the Daily News up 
for sale in May, but has yet to find a buyer. The paper has replaced most of 
its top management in the past few months.

GOVERNMENTS JOIN FORCES TO FIND ANSWERS TO TRASH DISPOSAL PROBLEM; SANITATION: 
COUNTY, OJAI, VENTURA AND FILLMORE TO FORM WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY TO POOL 
GARBAGE, NEGOTIATE WITH OUTSIDE LANDFILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to end the political stalemate over trash disposal, county supervisors 
Tuesday agreed to join Ventura, Ojai and Fillmore in setting up a new waste 
management authority that could ship garbage to landfills out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also encouraged other west county cities to join the group and 
pool their trash so they can collectively command lower prices in negotiations 
with landfills and waste disposal firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who brought the issue before the board, said it's 
too early to determine how the proposed Western Ventura County Waste Management 
Authority will dispose of west county trash once Bailard Landfill near Oxnard 
closes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other supervisors expressed hope that participating cities would 
figure out a solution before Bailard shuts down. And they said this new 
approach may save local residents money because of the bargaining power of 
numerous cities with a huge volume of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is going to be a cost savings for everybody, and a cost 
savings for an individual homeowner," Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other public officials see the new waste authority as an avenue to avoid a 
landfill proposed for Weldon Canyon, located between Ventura and Ojai. With the 
west county's trash whisked off to remote locations, they reason developers 
would have no financial incentive to open a landfill locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident that this will help us find another way than opening 
another landfill," said Ojai Councilwoman Nina Shelley, an opponent of a dump 
in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the success of the new organization may depend on the ability of city 
leaders to work together, something that has bogged down past cooperative 
efforts. What's different this time, supporters say, is the changing nature of 
the trash disposal industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfills in Los Angeles County and even those in Arizona and Utah are 
actively recruiting new customers to bolster business, offering new ways to get 
rid of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Mayor Pro Tem Roger Campbell said he and his city's leaders are 
excited about the idea of joining forces with other jurisdictions under a west 
county waste authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has only one purpose: to oversee negotiations to find a landfill for 
residual trash," he said. And he predicted it could be very successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he recently asked for price quotes from nearby landfills and 
discovered that Chiquito Canyon landfill off California 126 near Magic Mountain 
was cheaper per ton of trash than Bailard near Oxnard. The extra cost of 
trucking trash was inconsequential compared to the lower rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is conceived, the waste authority will contract for services, such as 
shipping the trash out of the county, rather than opening and operating a new 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But the waste authority reserves the right to own and operate a landfill if 
its board of directors determines it necessary. It will also help arrange 
recycling and waste reductions efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors and city leaders decided to try the west county 
waste authority after years of failing to establish a similar countywide 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials asked lawmakers in Sacramento to set up the countywide 
authority with broad powers that would resolve thorny issues and end the 
political bickering that has dominated the debate over trash policies for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Legislature gutted the bill, forcing local officials to hash out their 
differences among themselves. The concept of the countywide authority fell 
apart last year as local leaders squabbled over the prospect of a Weldon Canyon 
dump, the concerns about sending west county trash to the Simi Valley Landfill 
and a delay in opening recycling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the eastern Ventura County cities of Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks 
and Moorpark set up a smaller waste authority that meets regularly to resolve 
trash disposal issues in those communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard of Simi Valley, a member of the east county's 
Wasteshed Task Force, said she supports a west county waste counterpart that 
resolves what to do with the west county cities' garbage after Bailard closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been having problems finding a place for 23 years," she said, 
"which says that they are not trying too hard."

L.A. SUPERVISORS DELAY DECISION ON LAND GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Financially pinched by state budget cutbacks, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday once again postponed a decision on whether to donate or 
sell 4.5 acres to Calabasas and Agoura Hills for a community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents the west San Fernando Valley, wants the 
county to donate a vacant parcel it owns in Calabasas to both cities for the 
community center and a gymnasium. The facility would be used by residents of 
nearby unincorporated county territory as well as by residents of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such donations of surplus county land were not uncommon two years ago, before 
the state slashed the county's funding by more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the cutbacks, the county's chief administrative officer has 
been urging for the past year that all surplus land be sold or leased, not 
simply given away. The Calabasas property, behind the Lost Hills sheriff's 
station on Agoura Road, has become a test case of the recommended policy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county's appraisal, the land is worth between $659,000 and 
$900,000. County officials are proposing that Calabasas and Agoura Hills pay at 
least $450,000 for the property, using developers' fees known as Quimby funds 
that the cities have set aside for parkland acquisition and improvement, 
including community centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cities contend that the county's appraisal is inflated because it 
incorrectly assumes that the triangular-shaped tract can be developed for 
industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The land was donated to the county by a developer in 1984 for public use only, 
Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's proposal is flawed because it would take developers' dollars 
(Quimby fees) dedicated to providing desperately needed recreation facilities 
and use them to pay the county for land that the county received free of charge 
and that is already dedicated for civic purposes," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter has come before the supervisors once a week for the past three 
months, only to be postponed while officials wrangle behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough issue, but we're going to work it out," board Chairwoman Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are again scheduled to vote on the matter Tuesday.

MIKE PENNER: UL BASEBALL LACKS CHARGE WITH BOTH CIRCUITS DOWN

</P>
<P>
 If we hadn't seen it ourselves, we'd have never believed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, the sports section you are holding would be filled 
with such post-Series rumination. Game 7 should have been played Sunday night. 
As per tradition, the next few days are reserved for reflection and afterglow. 
Was this the best World Series since (pick a date)? Is (name of winning team 
here) the next great dynasty? Or: That Series was so dull, I had to switch over 
to a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, living in these post-meltdown days, we find ourselves reading 
front-page stories about some player agent's folly called "The United Baseball 
League" and actually pouring over each paragraph with keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A United Baseball League with 10 still unnamed, unowned, unstocked teams 
playing in such locales as Vancouver, Mexico City, Caracas, San Juan, Fresno, 
Louisville, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham and . . . Riverside?  
</P>
<P>
 Say this much: It beats whatever's happening at the moment in the two divided 
baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's one thing to talk about assembling a new league and quite 
another to actually get it done, as Alan Rothenberg was saying just the other 
day. But this being hot stove season, talk is what American baseball fans do -- 
especially in the extended, remixed-by-M.C. Bud I Hammered The Season version. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the United League has a few things going for it, starting with its 
abbreviated handle. The UL. Brings to mind the former Kansas City utility 
infielder, U.L. Washington -- the type of player the UL can plan on landing 
with its anticipated average player salary of $520,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the UL, charter franchises can be purchased for $5 million. This is called 
bringing the game back to the people. If each of the two million individuals 
who used to attend Angel games every summer dropped $2.50 into the kitty, they 
could buy their own UL team and set out to do what they always wanted -- bring 
back Jim Abbott, Dante Bichette, Devon White and all the old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Moss, a high-powered baseball player agent, is one of four heavy hitters 
in charge of the UL project, an irony even Bud Selig might be able to 
appreciate. After complaining for years that the agents are running the game, 
Selig's Army shut theirs down, possibly to be replaced by a baseball league run 
by an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Former New York Rep. Bob Mzarek, Texas Rep. John Bryant and noted economist 
Andrew Zimbalist are helping Moss organize the UL. This represents a 
substantial advantage over Selig, Marge Schott, Tom Werner and Jackie Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 Players in the UL would share in their teams' financial achievements and 
misfortunes, receiving 35% of the franchise equity and 35% of the pretax 
profits. Blowing off public appearances in the community, snubbing 5-year-old 
autograph seekers, walking out a ground ball in late September, sitting out an 
important game with a hangover -- all these surlier sides of the game, gone, 
vanished, just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 The UL is also looking into long-ignored markets that deserve big-league 
baseball. Buffalo, with its great fans. Phoenix, with its great Cactus League 
heritage. New Orleans, with its great restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, if we're lucky, Anaheim will get a major-league franchise to call its 
own too. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the UL enters the ballpark with one significant flaw: 
</P>
<P>
 Probable start-up date -- 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The time to strike is immediately, if not sooner. Imagine the public-relations 
thunder the UL could create by picking off a Jack McDowell here, a Dennis 
Eckersley or a Larry Walker there. With the current 28 clubs looking at 
training camps filled with Class A hopefuls and off-the-street scrubs, the UL 
could bill itself as "the real major league in '95" and get the public to bite. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moss said Tuesday that the odds of having "a quality league" in place 
within four months "are greatly against us," meaning that the establishment 
gets another 16 months to get its act together and restore at least some 
consumer confidence. Come April '96, assuming the AL and NL have not imploded, 
the UL will debut saddled with a second-rate image burdened with two extra, 
unwanted initials. 
</P>
<P>
 From UL to USFL, there isn't much of a leap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the immortal words of Gary (ABA) (WFL) (WHA) Davidson, timing isn't 
everything, it's the only thing.

VIKINGS' GREEN SELECTED TO COMPETITION COMMITTEE; PRO FOOTBALL: COACH IS FIRST 
AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING NFL RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Dennis Green himself, the announcement was subtle. But its meaning was 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The news release Tuesday said that Green, the Minnesota Vikings' coach, had 
been named to the NFL's competition committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwritten was that for the first time in the history of the NFL, an African 
American will directly contribute to the making of its rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Green is not only the first African American on the committee, but must be 
considered one of the most influential African Americans in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the competition committee is the most important committee in the 
NFL," said Gene Washington, the NFL's director of football development. "Just 
as when the first black head coach was named in the NFL, this is news." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee annually evaluates and recommends changes in the rules. Because 
of the group's influence, these changes are almost always approved by the 
league's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, this group dramatically changed several aspects of the game by 
recommending the two-point conversion, kickoffs from the 30-yard line, and the 
return of missed field-goal attempts to the point of the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-chairmen of the committee are Don Shula, coach of the Miami Dolphins, 
and George Young, general manager of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likes of Vince Lombardi and Tex Schramm were once on that committee," an 
NFL spokesman said at the owners' meetings in Chicago. "This says a lot about 
the commissioner's opinion of Dennis, that he is on it." 
</P>
<P>
 To many in the NFL, where more than 60% of the players are African Americans, 
this appointment will be welcome news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denny has earned his way at every step," Washington said. "This has to be one 
of the sharpest, brightest guys in football. He should be on there. The fact he 
is African American is a plus. Icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Green avoids making an issue of his race. He maintained that stance Tuesday, 
preferring to discuss the importance of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an assistant coach and head coach in the NFL, you realize the effect the 
competition committee has on the rules of the game," Green said. "What I'm 
going to do is a lot of listening." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said it was important to note 
that Green was not a token appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful step for a deserving man," Lurie said. "A deserving man of any 
color." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the thorny issue of division realignment was discussed during the 
first day of the two-day owners' meetings, but there was no decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is expected to use the powers given him by the 
owners last year and simply slot the two expansion franchises into the two 
four-team divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a twist, he is expected to make the situation temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he is expected to announce that the Carolina Panthers will begin play 
next season in the NFC West, and that the Jacksonville Panthers will join the 
AFC Central. But they will play in those divisions for only one season. 
</P>
<P>
 That will give Tagliabue more time to lobby for change and Georgia Frontiere 
time to settle upon a home for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to slot the teams has several owners angry and the decision to 
make it temporary has the expansion owners uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 With no long-range solution, it will be difficult for Carolina and 
Jacksonville to build teams to match the opposition and weather in a specific 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the sooner we know the parameters of how we should build our 
teams, the better," said Jerry Richardson, Carolina owner. 
</P>
<P>
 There is precedent for a temporary arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played their first season in the AFC West 
and the Seattle Seahawks played in the NFC West. The next year they switched to 
their current divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Dan Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers: "In everything from 
marketing to personnel, it is best if the teams know where they are going to 
play right now." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Rooney is still backing a slight modification of one of the 
league's plans, which would, among other things, move the Houston Oilers to the 
AFC West and the Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals to the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should back the fans, we should back the television networks, we should 
make sure that we continue to dominate the sports scene, to use an Al Davis 
word," Rooney said. "We should show we're a forward-thinking league and 
realign." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments on Tuesday, the league adopted a slightly different 
scheduling format for its expanded, 30-team league next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The new format ensures that third- and fourth-place teams will have easier 
schedules than previously and that fifth-place teams will have more difficult 
schedules.

THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE; AFTER HELPING RESCUE FAMILY DURING DEADLY TEXAS FLOODS,

 George Foreman could not stop the rain, but it could not stop him, either. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mother Nature vs. a man who, by some reports, is almost as old and 
maybe twice as stubborn, and it was a draw. And the 45-year-old heavyweight was 
rallying at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the deluge ended, and although the muddy flatlands were still choked 
with water, Foreman felt triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Flood of '94 came, and a few days later, with the schools still 
closed, the roads still wet with overflow, Foreman was still training for his 
fight Saturday against Michael Moorer, the World Boxing Assn. and International 
Boxing Federation heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman remembered the rain falling all day and night, remembered the panic of 
being cut off from his children and parents. And, as a sweet smile distinctly 
apart from his 100-watt talk-show grin formed on his face, Foreman celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The waters closed in on the Kingwood neighborhood he calls home, and came 
within feet of swallowing his house. But Foreman, his family, and his chance to 
pull off one of sport's more improbable dreams survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that flood, everything was over, what was I going to do?" Foreman said. 
"There was no way for me to get to my parents. . . . What am I supposed to do, 
say, 'Oh, there's no way.' Or do I just make a way? Do you understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Foreman, gaining momentum, turned the point to his courtroom struggle 
with the WBA to keep the bout alive after the WBA had said no, citing his age 
and recent 17-month layoff, to sanction it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same way with this fight," Foreman said. "It was over. That was it. But do 
you just sit there? Or do you make a way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman and his promoter, Bob Arum, made their way by suing the WBA and 
winning in Nevada District Court, paving the way for the fight at the MGM Grand 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 After plunging into currents of raging flood water, carrying your children on 
your shoulders 
</P>
<P>
 for a few miles and spending a night in a shelter with your family, what, 
really, is the WBA, or even 27-year-old Michael Moorer, going to do that's so 
fearsome? 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, I'm out of it, my legs are giving out, pulling this, carrying 
children," Foreman said. "I had to carry two kids at a time, and keeping my 
parents from panicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I jumped out of the car, start going through that water, I thought, 
'Man, you've got a fight, you can't be doing this.' But I realized, 'Are you 
kidding? You better be happy to go help your parents.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a night in a shelter, just a few weeks before the most spectacular 
event in the country, but you start to realize how important it is just to have 
your family be safe. I've got my kids, my mother and father, my wife lying on 
the floor, that was good enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my fight right there. That was a fight greater than anything I'll 
ever see with Michael Moorer. A more important fight. I saved my mother and my 
family. So now I figure I've got a chance to do this stuff, I'm going to do 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour or two of rest at the shelter late on a Wednesday night, Foreman 
went back to the gym and trained. The next day, he trained again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though his three youngest children were hanging around because 
schools had not yet reopened, a rather skinny-legged Foreman -- he won't say 
but he appears to weigh a fit 250 pounds -- sparred 12 rounds against five 
partners, with only five-second breaks between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "These last few days in Houston have been like nothing you could imagine," 
said Foreman's brother and constant companion, Roy. "I think any younger kid, 
any other athlete, probably would've used that excuse to say, 'All right, I've 
got to take me a couple days,' especially when he'd been working as hard as he 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slept not on a cot but on a pad on the church floor. My back would've been 
killing me. But he said, 'I've got to get back to the gym,' and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Make way for George Foreman, churning toward higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle lives on," the old fighter said. "It's always going to be 
something. But if you sit back and you're frightened of adversity, then once 
somebody hits you, you're not going to be able to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else could happen? Michael Moorer hits me with a jab? Believe me, I'm 
not worried about that now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a man who has been famous for more than a quarter century, Foreman has a 
knack for popping up out of nowhere when everyone else's attention is fixed on 
some new generation of ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he has come out of limbo one more time to face Moorer, who was not 
yet 2 years old when Foreman walked around the ring with a U.S. flag after 
winning the Olympic gold medal in the turbulent 1968 Mexico City Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he emerged, in 1987, Foreman, then almost 40, was stalking Mike 
Tyson, a fight that did not happen then, but might yet happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman said he sees some of himself in the mean-spiritedness of Tyson before 
his jail sentence, and in the sarcasm and moodiness of Moorer, and in every 
young fighter who is embittered by the too-much, too-soon instant fame of being 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is he still around? Maybe because Foreman, already more famous now than 
any of the various champions, heavyweight or otherwise, sees too much of his 
old self in the champions of today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bad guy, but I didn't know any better," Foreman said. "I was pushed 
into a corner, like with Moorer or something. He probably grew up admiring Mike 
Tyson, thinking that's what you're supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyson kind of got mixed up in the bad part of it too, in the same way. You 
can get in trouble. I was doing bad things behind people's backs too, fighting 
people, taking over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've probably been in the same trouble Mike Tyson got himself into if 
people were reporting the things then like they are now. I'd get away with 
stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us can hide and be hypocrites about it. The same things he was doing, 
I did. He just ended up in jail. It could very well have happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman said this quickly, a middle-aged man remembering the distant demons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got away with murder," Foreman said. "A girl would come to your house, a 
girl people dream of, nice girls. And then they'd sit in your home and next 
thing you know, you're saying, 'C'mon girl,' and it's, 'Naw, naw, I just came 
over to meet you.' I said, 'No, no, you know what you came over for.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And you become this cruel guy and you take advantage of people. You know what 
I'm saying? Man, I could've gotten in the same trouble because I did the same 
things. We just didn't know any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you get to be a man . . . I mean, I raise daughters now. I realize 
people are human beings, you have to treat them right. Tyson will probably 
understand that in another year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of young ladies tell me, 'You're going to get it one day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What did that matter to the most menacing fighter in the world, a man who 
walked around thinking of ways to kill somebody in the ring with one crushing 
blow to the temple? 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person's walking around, thinking about going to the movies, and 
I'm walking around, thinking I'm going to kill one of these guys," Foreman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreman said that, even at the time, he knew something was not right. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman won the title by knocking out Joe Frazier in 1973, lost it to Muhammad 
Ali in 1974, and was knocked out of boxing in 1977 by Jimmy Young, after which 
Foreman had a religious experience that took him into preaching. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he came back 10 years later, Foreman was a transformed man -- 
gracious, garrulous and Gargantuan -- at times, nearly 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the mild-mannered guy you see now was always there inside of George," 
said Jerry Bonney, a Houston attorney who grew up with Foreman in Houston's 
infamous Fifth Ward. "But at the time, he might've felt he had something to 
prove and he was proving it with his fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's proving his abilities to achieve with his mind. And now he's gotten 
his religion and it makes him a different person. But I think that person was 
always there." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman worked his way back up, and four years and 20-plus fights into the 
comeback, got a title shot -- a blistering decision loss to Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 After a strange, listless performance against Tommy Morrison on June 7, 1993, 
Foreman was all but finished. He filmed dozens of commercials, tried his hand 
at acting in his own sitcom. But Roy Foreman knew better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he couldn't walk away from it totally," Roy said. "He needed something 
to do. He tried it, I know he tried it. The TV show was a good sign to me that 
he tried to find something to do. But that wasn't enough. Some people just need 
something to do every day, and that's George." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is a barbecue pit near his training center, and George Foreman, 
it seems, is a frequent customer. His picture is on the wall, and as he ambles 
to the counter with a visitor, his order stuns the waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need six all-you-can-eat rib plates, two whole chickens, two pounds of hot 
links . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreman is in training, and he limits himself to one rib and merry 
comments on the rest of the large dining company's voracious appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 For this camp, preparing to fight a smallish champion that Foreman and many 
others consider a good match for his bulk and power, Foreman has declined to 
play Falstaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interviews were nixed, and jokes about cheeseburgers and fries do not 
roll out of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman got this fight almost solely because of his appeal to the mass 
audience -- Baby Boomers looking for inspiration -- but has refused to blow his 
chance at winning by letting his camp become a carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say it's a lot more serious because George always trains 
hard," Roy Foreman said. "But this time he's a lot more stern. He ignores me. 
There are times I've always been like the laughing point in his life, but now 
he's got his mind set." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Foreman still around? Maybe because he fervently believes that, in a 
ring, facing a foe who wants to beat you senseless, you find a truth in 
yourself you cannot find anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 In panic, keep working for higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Muhammad (Ali), he's been a boxer since he was 12 years old," Foreman said. 
"Ever since that first bell rang, Muhammad would start moving. That tells you 
something about him. No matter how big the guy or how small he was, Muhammad 
would run. And he became great at it. Flawless with it. But he was reluctant. 
Tells you something. He always knew there was a great weakness within him. And 
look, he's sick now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Frazier, since he's been a boxer, whenever the bell would ring, he'd 
smoke. That tells you something about him. It's a reflection of our souls. What 
we have inside." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does it say about George Foreman, 26 years removed from the winning 
of his gold medal? 
</P>
<P>
 "That I'm well able. I've always been well able. There's nothing to be 
reluctant about, nothing to be fearful about, scared about. 
</P>
<P>
 "My soul has always been strong and I'll probably always be like that. I'll be 
100 years old and my wife will be like, 'George stop . . . it's time to stop.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps going. The idea is to outlive your critics. I would never be able to 
come back if Howard Cosell was still the top broadcaster. He goes off the 
scene, I'm back. You've got to let them all say, 'He can't do it! He can't do 
it!' then they fade away. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Like the story of Moses, he didn't go back to Egypt until he heard Pharaoh 
was dead," Foreman said. "Forty years. You see, 10 years is nothing."

GERMAN CLIMBER REINHOLD MESSNER SCALED THE WORLD'S HIGHEST PEAKS, BUT NOW HE'S 
HEADED TO THE FLAT EXPANSES OF THE NORTH POLE; ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first person to climb Mt. Everest without supplemental oxygen, the first 
to climb it solo, the first to climb all 14 of the world's peaks over 8,000 
meters -- often alone, always without oxygen -- has gone horizontal. 
</P>
<P>
 At 50, Italy's Reinhold Messner, often cited as the world's greatest living 
mountaineer, has decided long walks are more appropriate for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I prepare to go to the North Pole," said Messner. "The Himalaya is not as 
challenging. Twenty years ago, I would have said 'Never, it's boring going on 
the sled ice.' Now I enjoy much more these trips. Knowing the area, and all the 
difficulties, and how big the Arctic Ocean is -- a mountain is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing? 
</P>
<P>
 Messner's 1,550-mile trek across Antarctica with Arved Fuchs of Germany in 91 
days in 1990, without the aid of dog sleds or machinery, first hinted at his 
change of life. A 1,300-mile crossing of Greenland in 35 days two years ago, 
the longest unsupported traverse, confirmed it. 
</P>
<P>
 His planned unaided traverse of the North Pole from Siberia to Canada in 
spring could prove the icing on the cake. If successful, he believes that he 
and his brother, Hubert, will be the first to reach and return from the pole 
without machinery or support. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Everest I can go down to base camp in one day," Messner said. "From the 
middle of Antarctica, you need months to get out. You are much more exposed. 
Exposure is the most important factor, not only difficulties. It's one thing to 
be on a small rock wall, or a middle rock wall like El Capitan, but if you are 
there with air under your . . . and you are exposed under your feet . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Antarctica is not a vertical wall, it is a horizontal wall. But it is the 
biggest wall, and the possibility for exposure is highest." 
</P>
<P>
 Messner was talking by phone from Milan while en route to his castle in 
Bolzano, Italy, where he was preparing for an appearance tonight in Robert 
Frost Auditorium at Culver City High School, and training daily by running 
uphill pulling a sled. 
</P>
<P>
 Messner grew up in the Sud Tirol, in northeastern Italy. Until he was 25, he 
was a rock climber concentrating on the most difficult routes in Italy's 
Dolomites and the western Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first 8,000-meter (26,248-foot) expedition -- Pakistan's Nanga Parbat 
in 1970 -- his brother, Gunther, was killed. The two had completed the first 
ascent of the mountain face when Gunther disappeared in an avalanche. Messner 
lost most of his toes to frostbite. On his second 8,000-meter peak, Manaslu in 
Nepal, two friends died. 
</P>
<P>
 With Austrian Peter Habeler, he made his ascent of Everest, without oxygen, in 
1978. But his earlier experiences fostered a preference for solo ascents. When 
he scaled Nanga Parbat a second time -- also in 1978 -- he was alone. It was 
the first such ascent of an 8,000-meter peak. He reached the summit of K2 the 
next year with German MichlDacher, and made a solo climb of Everest a year 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Messner has chronicled his adventures in such books as "To the Top of the 
World" (1992) and "Antarctica -- Both Heaven and Hell" (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he has shown little regard for mountaineering convention, his books 
are another departure. Most climbing and adventure literature is written with 
drama, excitement and danger -- entertainment -- in mind. Messner's writings 
often are reflective and sometimes painfully psychological. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to express what is happening in my inner feelings," he said. "In 
my climbing, I am going practically with my feet and body in a place like the 
top of Everest -- but this is only the outside world. In the same moment, I 
climb my inner mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more I understand how limited I am. As human beings, we have 
problems. We have fear. . . . I am not seeking to achieve a summit, I am 
searching to achieve more knowledge about my fears and hopes and about being a 
human being. It is not so important to describe how many camps I make."  
</P>
<P>
 Messner has become well acquainted with fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more afraid in the beginning," he said. "Today I have the ability to 
put myself in a balance between skill and fear before starting. Fear is the 
other half of skill. I am still afraid, but now I can have a good balance."  
</P>
<P>
 On solo ascents, he occasionally converses with himself -- in a number of 
passages in his books he carefully delineates the two trains of thought. And 
just because he's traveling solo doesn't mean he's alone.  
</P>
<P>
 After his brother was killed on Nanga Parbat, Messner still felt his presence 
to the point that he could smell him. On Nanga Parbat the second time, he 
walked behind his father and talked with his brother. During a storm on 
Kanchenjunga, the third-highest mountain in the world, he thought a group of 
Japanese were securing the tent with stones. In Antarctica, he walked beside 
himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say he suffers severe hallucinations, though he would almost 
certainly take issue with the word suffer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was often like this," Messner said. "(On Nanga Parbat after Gunther 
disappeared), and totally at the end of possibilities, I would see from time to 
time a horse with a rider and I was sure now that I could get help. But there 
was always only a stone or a tree. One moment I would realize I was trapped by 
a hallucination, in the next I would again decide it was a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is not a disease," he said. "Schizophrenia can be a great help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that thousands and thousands of years ago, humans living in a 
dangerous world with dangerous animals could go into schizophrenic states in 
difficult situations. If you do something alone, and difficult, you can speak 
with a second one, and discuss your problems. A saint in the Himalayas or alone 
in the desert has this ability to become schizophrenic."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Messner's single-mindedness is his hallmark. For now, that means the top 
of the world is not a matter of meters, but of latitude. And it means both 
vanity and humility are mute considerations when asked whether he considers 
himself the greatest living mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I was a mountain climber," he says. "I still do 20 or 30 climbs a year, 
but I am so involved with my new adventure that I have problems even to say I 
am a mountain climber. After the North Pole, maybe there will be new (climbing) 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky to live in a beautiful time. In the '70s, we could reinvent 
climbing. It was a naive period. I did not go to big walls thinking, 'Now I 
will change climbing, now I invent something new.' I went like a small boy 
climbing. Only afterward we understood that we changed climbing. And we did it 
without the hero feelings like in the '50s, with flags on the summit." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Messner was achieving summits in a minimalist style that proved 
revolutionary. While others "conquered" Himalayan mountains using tons of 
equipment over long periods of time, Messner's style was fast and light. And he 
approached a mountain not as a thing to be conquered, but as a resource of 
wildness to be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he doesn't even think of mountaineering in terms of a physical act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally my activity is more near art than sport," he said. "People think 
the opposite, but the sport side -- strength and will power -- is much less 
important. I imagine my adventures first, then I do them. Doing them, I (only) 
put down my feet and hands and body. 
</P>
<P>
 "A line on a certain wall is like doing a picture. On Nanga Parbat, you see no 
line on the face, but I live months with this line in my head. I make the line 
with my suffering in weeks of work, like the painter Picasso puts his ideas on 
a canvas. I leave nothing, but my nothing is something. If I return 25 years 
later, I see the line immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradox, it seems, is at the bottom of a life lived in a vertical reality. It 
surfaced again when Messner was asked about the source of the drive to always 
ascend. (Until long walks become more appropriate, that is.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite logical," he said. "A mountain is so beautiful. Look, it is like 
an arrow pointing to the heaven. We cannot sit up there forever, but we can go 
up and go down. The beauty in life is that you can even try more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sisyphus climbs up, then the stone falls down, and he has to roll it up again 
-- life is nothing else. But perhaps we can imagine Sisyphus as a happy man, 
because he can do this, not that he is forced to do it, or that he suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is the same," he reiterated. "We begin every day new. We do 
approximately the same thing. But not exactly the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhold Messner speaks tonight at 8 p.m. in Robert Frost Auditorium, Culver 
City High School, 4401 Elenda St., Culver City. Details: (310) 473-4574 or 
(714) 556-7625.

MIKE DOWNEY: A FANTASY FIT FOR DISNEY: MIGHTY DUCKS IN PASADENA

<P>
 California currently has five very scary situations. A swarm of African 
"killer bees" has landed somewhere near Riverside. Adults and students alike 
are angrily protesting Proposition 187 and its immigration implications. A 
notorious murder trial might run concurrently with the trial of a reputed 
Hollywood madam. An earthquake study warns we can expect temblors measuring 5.0 
or greater on the Richter scale at least once a year, from here to eternity.  
</P>
<P>
 And Oregon could play in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, I would hate to rate these crises 1 through 5. Let's see: Pestilence, 
conflict, scandal, seismic activity, Oregon vs. Penn State -- which would 
horrify me most? 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing I need is some nasty hive of honey-suckers to zing me, so maybe 
I will avoid Riverside County until the swarm passes. As far as Prop. 187 is 
concerned, I merely will consult my personal spiritual adviser, 
John-Roger-George-Ringo of the Church of the Movement of What's Happening Now, 
to ask how I should cast my vote on Election Day.  
</P>
<P>
 Over at courtroom central, where jury selection for the concurrent Juice & 
Fleiss cases continues, I feel certain that sequestered jurors' greatest 
complaint about being denied access to newspapers and TV would be not knowing 
how the Oregon Ducks did in their final weeks of football.  
</P>
<P>
 And, trust me, no quake of any magnitude could jerk the needle sideways on one 
of those Richter things the way Oregon making the Rose Bowl would.  
</P>
<P>
 So, for wildest story of '94, I guess I'll have to go with this one. Killer 
Ducks Headed This Way!  
</P>
<P>
 Think of it -- Oregon in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon is to college football what Linda McCartney is to rock 'n' roll. A 
highlight film of "Great Moments in Oregon Football" would take about 60 
seconds. You could show the entire film during a timeout. Yet all of a sudden 
Oregon stands an excellent chance of representing the Pac-10 in the "Granddaddy 
of Them All," the Rose Bowl football classic. Calm down, Granddaddy. Take a 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
 This is something we never figured we would see in our lifetime, like a mouse 
dating a cat, or Michael Jackson marrying Elvis' daughter. It's sort of a close 
encounter of the fourth kind. It's up there with the Berlin Wall falling and 
the Atlanta Braves playing in the World Series. Oregon appearing in the Rose 
Bowl is like Tom Arnold appearing in "Hamlet."  
</P>
<P>
 First Wisconsin, now Oregon? What next? Northwestern vs. Cal? Minnesota vs. 
Mars?  
</P>
<P>
 I know we all want to make Penn State feel nice and comfy on its first visit 
to Pasadena as a member of the Big Ten. Nevertheless, the only other reason I 
can see for inviting Oregon to the Rose Bowl is to accommodate all those 
thousands of Californians who moved to Oregon after the last quake. Last census 
taken showed that there were so many of us up there now, the state is about to 
be renamed Califoregon.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon is a wonderful place, if you're a beaver. The water is clear and you 
can't see the air. Eugene itself is such a friendly city, the people there come 
up to you and say, "Just call us Gene."  
</P>
<P>
 Where college football is concerned, however, the University of Oregon's 
program is a step up from Pop Warner, maybe right up there with Mom Warner. 
Their fight song is "It's Not Easy Being Green."  
</P>
<P>
 Teams from Oregon are almost never ranked among the nation's top 20. (Except 
in the computer poll of the New York Times, which traditionally ranks Kansas 
State first and some community college from South Dakota second, just ahead of 
Nebraska, based on schedules.)  
</P>
<P>
 Hooray for the little Duckies, however. They are having their best season in 
years. They just edged Arizona by a bill, 10-9. This gave Oregon a tie for 
first place in the conference and the right to return for next week's games, or 
at least to leave with some lovely parting gifts.  
</P>
<P>
 After the victory, Oregon tight end Josh Wilcox said, "I don't think we really 
know what it means, but it's cool."  
</P>
<P>
 I believe Josh borrowed this quote from Bill Walsh, the guy from Palo Alto who 
coaches football at Day Before Yesterday U.  
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, players from Oregon's 1957 team that played in the '58 Rose 
Bowl were the honored guests at last weekend's game. I think you probably 
remember some of these great players -- Tree Rollins, Hacksaw Reynolds, Glenn 
(Big Log) Robinson, Cliff Branch, Limb Barney, Jesse Elms, Forrest Gregg, the 
Pine brothers, Y.A. Duck, the whole gang. Or maybe I'm mistaken.  
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, nobody can remember Oregon's 1957 Rose Bowl team. I'll 
bet if you bet them, Oregon's 1957 Rose Bowl team couldn't remember Oregon's 
1957 Rose Bowl team.  
</P>
<P>
 But here come the Ducks, back every 37 years like clockwork. The demand up 
there for Rose Bowl tickets will be so great, Oregon people will be lined up 
for miles outside those Wisconsin travel agencies, trying to buy tickets from 
that guy from UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 I am the first to admit that I am shocked, even stunned, by the news that 
Oregon could be in the next Rose Bowl. I know that everybody back at Penn State 
is saying right now, "No. 1, we hear Oregon has a very fine football team, and 
No. 2, where exactly is Oregon, anyway?"  
</P>
<P>
 You just never know here in California what is going to happen next. Wait 
until Oregon State finally gets itself a team. You think killer bees are scary 
. . .

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; A REVIVAL WOULD BE HEALING, TIMELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Another opening, another show, thankfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by problems as it left the stage last June to the yawns of a bored 
nation, so scorned that a preseason yearbook ran a cover asking "Is the NBA 
Dead?" it returns on Friday to the gratitude of sports-starved Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought all it had to do to reclaim its cachet as "the league 
that works" was play a game? 
</P>
<P>
 But with work stoppages in baseball and hockey, fans have learned to 
appreciate a game whose players and administrators can work out their problems 
on their own time. The NBA and its players are working without a contract but 
with a no-strike, no-lockout pledge that makes it impossible for either side to 
pull the plug without making itself look like "The Grinch That Stole Christmas" 
and a liar, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite everything that went wrong last season -- no Michael Jordan, bratty 
stars, a game that looked more like mud wrestling than ballet -- the NBA had 
solid fundamentals that allowed it to avoid the pitfalls that felled baseball 
and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA had undisputed and widespread prosperity, unlike baseball and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA owners long ago accepted the legitimacy of the union, unlike baseball, 
whose owners took strike after strike, trying to break the players' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA did not have a commissioner who got the job by promising the owners a 
salary cap, unlike the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, NBA Commissioner David Stern was bent on avoiding the league's first 
work stoppage. The NBA opened its books to the union, unlike the NHL, which 
offered to furnish only selected data. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA had players who had grown rich under a salary cap and weren't the 
least bit interested in a work stoppage, unlike baseball and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 A hard negotiation lies ahead, however. Stern and the former union head, Larry 
Fleisher, would engage in marathon screaming matches but they were a couple of 
New York guys who understood each other, so for them, bellowing was an 
expression of endearment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new union head, Wharton-trained Charles Grantham, is less trusting, more 
of the opinion that the league was playing him for a punk. Soon after he took 
over, a court fight produced records showing the NBA had been hiding luxury-box 
revenue from the players. The league was obliged to make a huge cash 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Grantham notes that players' gains, although significant, are nothing 
compared to those of the owners. The Lakers' Jerry Buss, for example, bought 
his team, the Kings and the Forum for $67.5 million in 1980. When Magic Johnson 
bought in last summer, he assumed a franchise value for the Lakers of more than 
$200 million, an annual rate of appreciation of more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBA owners still have their system, the games will go on, there are new 
rule changes designed to open play and everyone is happy, for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A comer on the American scene since it began its rise from YMCA dance-floor 
status, the NBA has taken its share of falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as "the game of the '70s" after Madison Avenue's beloved Knicks had won 
their first title, the NBA was instead beset by all manner of problems -- a 
rival league, drug rumors -- and limped into the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry turned the '80s into a golden age with 
engaging superstars who had the pretensions of a ballboy, preparing the stage 
for the greatest star the game had ever known, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shrinking TV market of the late '80s and '90s, the NBA posted 
impressive gains. The Dream Team took over the 1992 Olympics. The 1993 NBA 
finals, with Jordan's Chicago Bulls and Charles Barkley's Phoenix Suns, drew 
higher ratings than the World Series for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea arose that the NBA was "bulletproof" but the 1993-94 season put a 
hole the size of a .357 magnum slug in that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan retired. Two unspectacular defensive clubs, the Knicks and Houston 
Rockets, turned the finals into an entertainment debacle that had even 
basketball fans reeling from their TV sets. Golden State Coach Don Nelson said 
he turned it off and went to play golf. Ratings plummeted from the previous 
spring's record 17.9 to 12.3, the league's worst since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, NBA stars turned a new, immature face to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's accession had been personality-driven, Julius Erving & Co. 
passing the torch to Johnson and Bird. By the '90s, no one wanted to keep a 
flame that suggested obligation more than reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he'd pass it to Jordan, who said he didn't want it. No one has 
seen it lately. Maybe it's in Jordan's baseball locker in the Arizona 
Instructional League. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flame," says Johnson, laughing, "is out."  
</P>
<P>
 Players now arrive in the NBA rich, famous and jaded, having become 
celebrities in the NCAA tournament, still basketball's highest-rated event. 
They sign million-dollar deals with sneaker companies eager for new spokesmen 
to replace Jordan, Johnson and Bird. They are given ridiculous salary deals, 
like Larry Johnson's $84-million extension, which prompted Derrick Coleman to 
sneer publicly at the Nets' $69-million offer -- he handed out T-shirts mocking 
the proposal -- and persuaded Glenn Robinson's agent, Charles Tucker, to seek 
$100 million before his client had scored his first professional basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Young stars once had a few years to grow up before becoming spokesmen but a 
new generation has been thrust upon us, barely out of its teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer's World Championships was supposed to be a coming-out party for 
the NBA's young stars but they behaved more like Hell's Angels at an embassy 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "Dream Team II" repeatedly tried to humiliate overmatched 
opponents, demonstrating only how much things had changed and offending 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You already know you're better and you're going to prove that playing but 
that's the new thing so we all have to get used to it," says Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the thing of, 'I want to dunk and I want to let you know I dunked in 
your face so I'm going to sit here and growl and throw my hands up and look at 
you for 20 seconds.' 
</P>
<P>
 "In our day, when a guy did something like that, they would let him drive to 
the hole the next time and put him on his butt. No question about it. It was 
the unwritten rule. You just didn't show anybody up. Now you could say 'I got 
you!' or something -- and keep going. Like Larry and Coop (Michael Cooper) had 
a little thing but they kept playing. You never saw Larry Bird make a jumper 
and point at Coop's face. Coop would have ate his finger off. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry backed up his talk. They got guys now -- I'm watching some playoff 
game, some dude who doesn't even play that much, he's talking! See, when I 
played, great ballplayers talked 'cause they could back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's changed and I don't like it. Now people around the world don't like 
it. I traveled around the world after this happened, on my tour, and everybody 
was saying the same thing. They say (Dream Team II players) didn't have the 
class we had. We were in Spain and the Spanish writers were all talking about 
it. One of them said, 'We as writers, as fans, we cheered for you guys even 
when you played our team. But not this team.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the players hated them, the fans hated them. It's too bad. They (U.S. 
players) don't understand. It's this cool thing. It's just crazy now." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the NBA only needed time to make the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, the young star of stars, seems to be settling into his role. 
He actually talked before an exhibition game here, something he had avoided for 
his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber is a handsome, engaging young man who can play. In his first 
exhibition season, Grant Hill looked so talented and gracious, a Detroit writer 
wrote, "Grant Hill is a god." 
</P>
<P>
 A new day beckons, hopefully.

BUENA'S RAYMOND SEES LIGHT THROUGH THE HAZE; FOOTBALL: TWENTY-DAY INCARCERATION 
CONVINCED LINEMAN THAT DRUG ABUSE LEADS TO A DEAD-END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Raymond was in juvenile hall, locked in a room with windows he couldn't 
see through, when he finally got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seeing the people that were in there, some for murder, some for 
possession of an ounce of cocaine," says Raymond, a senior offensive tackle at 
Buena High. "It was enough to scare the . . . out of anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond landed in juvenile hall because he was arrested and charged with 
possession of controlled substances for sale. His 20-day incarceration over the 
summer was enough to convince him that drug abuse leads to a dead-end. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Raymond is three months removed from juvenile hall and four months out 
of an inpatient drug rehabilitation program. He says he is drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7, 270-pound mountain of a 17-year-old spends his free time working 
on the poems he started writing during drug rehab. He studies, too, preparing 
for next month's Scholastic Aptitude Test and making up for the work he missed 
when he dropped out of school in February. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, he plays football. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a clumsy oaf whose idea of offensive line play was falling on smaller 
opponents, Raymond is a finely tuned blocking machine. Such quick and agile 
feet under a huge body make Buena Coach Rick Scott speak in reverent tones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The football gods reached down and touched his body and blessed it," Scott 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters are equally impressed with Raymond's physical skills, but 
they must also try to figure out what goes on inside his helmet. Is Raymond, as 
he insists, truly clean? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a question that with his ability he can play at any 
major university," one West Coast recruiter says. "But it's a decision that 
every school is going to have to make: Do you take a chance on the kid who's 
had problems in the past? I'm sure there's going to be some to shy away from 
him, but whoever gets the guy, if he can keep a clean slate, they are going to 
get a prized possession." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, who already has seen several colleges drop out of the race for his 
services, is fully aware of the risks of publicizing his past problems. He 
hesitates to reveal details of his abuse, such as the types of drugs he used. 
He says simply that he's clean, and he intends to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am setting an example," he says. "I realize there is no future with 
substance abuse. I want to show if you are getting into some trouble, there is 
a way out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Raymond's problems began long before anyone noticed he had them. 
</P>
<P>
 He now admits he had been using drugs to some degree throughout high school, 
but his abuse began to grow more serious last fall, during his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just all the pressures of school and football and stuff," he says. "I 
never had a way to release the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Football was no longer fun. Practices were like work. And school? Forget it. 
His grades slipped and his interest slipped more. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after last football season, teammates noticed Raymond drifting away 
from school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just disappearing and you started hearing rumors about stuff," senior 
fullback Nate Coyle says. "And then when you hear it's true, you were shaking 
your head because it's such a waste of talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond's drug-induced highs became the focal point of his life. By February, 
his parents discovered was smoking marijuana. He was failing most of his 
classes, so he dropped out of school, ostensibly to finish his education 
through a correspondence school. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the things I was doing as far as the drugs, I just didn't want to be (in 
school)," Raymond says. "I would rather get my high than be in school." 
</P>
<P>
 But the care-free life he imagined without school never materialized. Instead, 
he found himself in the back seat of a police car just weeks after dropping out 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he tried to sell drugs once, but never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only time I had ever sold anything and I got caught," he says. 
"I was arrested with the stuff on me." 
</P>
<P>
 After that harsh awakening, Raymond's parents had him undergo private 
counseling in Ventura. But the sessions had only a marginal effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't care where I was going," he says. "I was just looking for 
another high. All I was thinking about was where I was going to get my next 
fix." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the arrest and despite the counseling, Raymond was undeterred. He 
continued dodging his parents and using drugs. All kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I could numb myself with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, after Raymond's attorney advised him that the court would view him 
more favorably if he entered a rehabilitation clinic, he spent three weeks at 
Vista Del Mar Hospital in Ventura. There, he discovered poetry, the outlet he 
never had while abusing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raymond's turnaround was not complete after rehabilitation. Just after he 
was released from the hospital, he went to trial for his arrest five months 
earlier. He was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days in the Clifton Tatum 
Center, the juvenile hall in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 After rehabilitation -- the positive reinforcement method of curing drug abuse 
-- Raymond got a heaping dose of negative reinforcement in juvenile hall, and 
that was much more effective, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing blue pants and white T-shirts that were too small, Raymond attended 
classes during the day. At 6 p.m., he was locked in a cell with blocked-out 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a lot of time to think," Raymond says. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbors in juvenile hall were murderers, gang members and other drug 
abusers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't belong in that place, but I forced myself in," he says 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond got out after 20 days, gaining release because of good behavior. He 
decided that high school wasn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw all the people in there and that's when I contacted my coach and I 
said, 'I want to be clean and sober and get back on the team,' " he says. "I 
saw these people had no future on the streets. I wanted to play football and 
get a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Raymond's battle hasn't ended, but it has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 While once he struggled with drug abuse and the law, he now faces skeptical 
college coaches and a difficult year of school work. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Raymond was released from juvenile hall, he enrolled in summer 
school so he could earn enough credits to return to Buena. A grueling year of 
extra work awaits him if he is to graduate with his classmates in the spring 
and earn NCAA eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 When he has free time, he sticks close to his teammates, who must stay clean 
because of a random drug testing program for athletes started at Buena High 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, Buena's football coach, says the testing was not a reaction to Raymond. 
The program finally was approved this season after Scott lobbied for it for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on the right track," Scott says. "But there's no way of assuming that a 
17-year-old is not going to have a problem again. But one of the things I try 
to do is watch him daily. We talk a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Raymond's father, Jim: "I think everything is looking positive. It's 
still a little shaky. There are peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys, but I 
think this is the plateau. There is always that little nagging doubt, but it is 
diminishing rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond has no doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over," he says firmly. "I learned my lesson on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond's teammates agree that he appears clean. It shows on and off the 
field, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really turned around," Coyle says. "He looks physically better. He plays 
better. . . . I don't see him hanging out in the same groups as he used to, and 
that's a good sign. I think he's really cleaned up his act." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond worries about next month's SAT test, saying it's his biggest obstacle 
to a college scholarship. He has told inquiring coaches from Fresno State, 
Colorado, Arizona and Washington State that his drug use is in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 He's making more believers every day.

ANGELS PLANNING TO OFFER TETTLETON A CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels plan to offer free-agent Mickey Tettleton a contract within a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hope to attract Tettleton, who played the last four seasons in 
Detroit, by making him their starting first baseman, utility outfielder and 
catcher.It's a commitment the Tigers say they're unable to make, with Cecil 
Fielder at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the threat of Mickey signing with someone," Tiger General 
Manager Joe Klein said, "particularly with one of the lower payrolls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, whose $23.3-million payroll was the lowest in the American League 
last season, want Tettleton to bat fifth, protecting designated hitter Chili 
Davis. The Angels' fifth-place hitters batted a league-low .262 last season 
with 21 homers and 73 runs batted in. In contrast, Tettleton has averaged 28 
homers and 93 RBIs the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tettleton, 34, had a cast removed Monday from his left heel. He underwent 
surgery Sept. 22 to remove a bone spur and growth, but Tiger orthopedist Terry 
Lock said Tettleton will easily be ready the start of spring training. BOB

JORDAN BRONZED IN FRENZIED FAREWELL CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a bronze statue unveiled outside the stadium and a No. 23 jersey raised 
to the rooftop, Chicago said farewell Tuesday night to the best basketball 
player this city -- and possibly this sport -- has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours, teammates, opponents, fans, former coaches, entertainers and 
family celebrated and lauded not only Michael Jordan's basketball career but 
also his life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was glitzy. It was made-for-TV. It was loud. At times the salute to the man 
who led the Chicago Bulls to three straight championships before retiring 13 
months ago gushed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the festivities, Jordan reiterated that his basketball days were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made the decision I was fixed with that, pretty firm with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that number hanging up, that puts that to rest. I've got to move on. 
There's a new team here. I'm playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 During the celebration Tuesday night, North Carolina Coach Dean Smith and 
comedian Sinbad shared the same stage, actor Woody Harrelson joined his fellow 
"Cheers" stars George Wendt and Kelsey Grammer in a musical tribute and master 
of ceremonies Ahmad Rashad jokingly tried to coax Jordan back to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's highlights -- an NCAA championship, two Olympic gold medals, three 
MVPs in the regular season and three in the NBA finals -- flashed across the 
scoreboard in the new United Center before a near sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jordan's No. 23 was retired. Jordan ended the ceremony by hoisting it to 
the ceiling as his three children stood by. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the celebration will go toward construction of a boys and girls 
club on Chicago's west side. The facility will be named for Jordan's father.

<P>
 For USC's possible Rose Bowl-decider against Washington State on Saturday at 
Pullman, Wash., Cougar Coach Mike Price had some good news Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Good news for his team, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up this morning and found snow on my windshield," he said, 
unsuccessfully trying to suppress a giggle.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy this game is in Pullman. Our stadium is sold out and the 
weather will be perfect -- cold and wet." 
</P>
<P>
 After Price had hung up on a speaker-phone news conference, USC Coach John 
Robinson talked about weather conditions for the Trojans, who are 5-2 overall 
and 4-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, same as Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players can play in the cold, it's the wind I'm more worried about," he 
said at his weekly media luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service is predicting cloudy, windy weather for this 
weekend in eastern Washington, with a good chance of rain. Temperature 
forecast: Highs in the upper 40s.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got guys on our team who've never seen snow," Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Robinson wondered why reporters worry about football players getting 
cold.  
</P>
<P>
 "The players aren't cold, they're playing in a football game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you people aren't cold, you're in a press box with heaters. The coaches 
are cold -- we're the ones you should be worrying about." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Robinson, responding in kind, had some bad news for Price.  
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, the senior USC quarterback who tore up Washington State's vaunted 
defense a year ago, will return Saturday from the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob practiced last week and he'll practice all this week," Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be our starting quarterback. We need him Saturday, because against a 
team that blitzes as much as Washington State does, you need an accurate 
passer." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson suffered a sprained right ankle twice this season, the first time Oct. 
1 in a 22-7 loss to Oregon. He rested it two weeks, tried to play against 
Stanford . . . and aggravated the sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 His backup, Brad Otton, directed Trojan victories over Oregon State, Stanford 
and, most recently, to a 61-0 blowout of California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnson, it has been a disappointing season. He passed for 3,630 yards as 
a junior and started this season as a Heisman Trophy candidate and with a shot 
at supplanting Rodney Peete as USC's all-time passing yardage leader.  
</P>
<P>
 He stands at 1,080 yards this season after playing in only three full games. 
</P>
<P>
 But to his coach, he's still the man.  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Rob is really a good quarterback," he said. "He's been on a roll ever 
since I got here. That day at Stanford, he might have thrown for 400 yards if 
he hadn't hurt his ankle again.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like Brad Otton too, but Rob Johnson is a difference-maker." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Johnson had a remarkable game against Washington State, in a 34-3 
Trojan victory at the Coliseum. He completed 21 of 26 passes for 392 yards and 
three touchdowns, with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Johnson ripped us apart last year," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He embarrassed us. There's no question he'll be the best quarterback we've 
faced this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson characterized Johnson's ankle sprain as a "high" one, on the outside 
of the leg. He said it's the kind that cost Ricky Bell several games in 1976 . 
. . and a probable Heisman Trophy.  
</P>
<P>
 "It could still be bothering him next spring," Robinson said. "He'll just have 
to play with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said his team's challenge in practice this week will be to "pick up 
the rhythm" it showed in the Cal rout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our last three games, we didn't play great teams but we didn't lose a fumble 
or an interception in any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 USC leads the nation in turnover margin, +1.9, and has not turned the ball 
over for 15 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 A repeat of the 1993 game would be fine, Robinson said. Washington State 
brought another stellar defensive team to the Coliseum last season and gave up 
517 yards against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 How many losses are tolerable, in the home stretch of the Pac-10 schedule? 
</P>
<P>
 Zero.  
</P>
<P>
 USC, Washington State, Arizona and Oregon are all 4-1. USC plays Washington 
State on Saturday, a Coliseum game with Arizona Nov. 12 and UCLA at Pasadena 
Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of our opponents, we're all alike," Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not much stronger or weaker than any of them. Washington State hasn't 
played a really good quarterback this year, and that's in our favor this 
weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oregon State will be a tough game for Oregon (Nov. 19) at Corvallis, and UCLA 
is getting a lot of injured people back . . . and if I was Oregon, I'd be 
scared about going to Stanford (Nov. 12).  
</P>
<P>
 "Like Bill (Walsh) says, he's got the best offense in football."

TO BOLT OR NOT TO BOLT ROCKS: THAT IS THE CLIMBERS' DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reaching 8,000-meter summits might or might not be a thing of Reinhold 
Messner's past, but he has much to say about bolting, a controversial subject 
among climbers and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolts are drilled into rock faces to help secure climbing ropes, and are a 
fact of life in today's sport climbing ethic, which emphasizes short, steep, 
technical routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never used a bolt in my life," Messner said. "Up to 25, I was a rock 
climber and nothing else, but I always defend the wall. The (young climbers) 
are better than we were, but they look at a rock wall like we look at a 
postcard, and this is wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 ". . . If you use bolts, you destroy the impossible; the climbing is less 
challenging. Yet today everybody uses bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were not for bolts, El Capitan would still be impossible. The bolts are 
safe and bolts mean everybody can go. You know always there is a way. If there 
is not a way, you put in one more bolt and now there is a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Messner's way shuns most technological assistance and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only do adventures when there is a possibility to fail," he said. "I failed 
at many walls as a rock climber. I found a situation I could not pass and I 
went down. I was not strong enough, or was not intelligent enough to see the 
beast was not possible to free-climb. But I never had a bolt or oxygen bottle 
in my rucksack. 
</P>
<P>
 "If human beings like adventure, they need to stop using certain equipment," 
he advised. "(On the trek to the North Pole) I am using the same equipment 
(Adm. Robert) Peary had. Better clothes, yes, but not a Ski-Doo." BENJAMIN

WESTERN CONFERENCE; WILL CHALRES FINALLY INHERIT THE THRONE?; WITH BARKLEY BACK

 Teams are listed in projected order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 PHOENIX SUNS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 56-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 108.2 (first). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 103.4 (13th). 
</P>
<P>
 A Dream Teamer at one forward, a two-time all-star at the other, two guys from 
Dream Team II at guard, two former all-stars coming off the bench . . . and Joe 
Kleine at center? 
</P>
<P>
 It could work, so you'd better watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns went 8-0 in exhibitions, averaging 121 points, more than any team has 
scored in the regular season in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is probably Charles Barkley's last season, which might be why he hasn't 
been running his mouth at the usual pace. He, Danny Manning, Kevin Johnson, Dan 
Majerle, Wayman Tisdale, Danny Ainge, A.C. Green, et al. represent massive 
firepower so let's start the fireworks and see who oohs and ahs. 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE SUPERSONICS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 63-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 105.9 (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 96.9 (sixth). 
</P>
<P>
 George Karl, the tightly wound SuperSonic coach, mourned last spring's 
first-round KO by the Denver Nuggets like a jilted lover in a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 His players, who prefer Nintendo, now face the challenge of growing up. Shawn 
Kemp had his best season, averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds but disappeared 
in the playoffs, averaging 15 points and shooting 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl's Dean Smith-type system turned this team around but it's still an open 
question if he wouldn't be better off establishing a go-to guy rather than 
balancing the offense so evenly. Kemp took only 12.5 shots a game. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more problems: General Manager Bob Whitsitt, who protected Karl from 
volatile owner Barry Ackerley, bolted for Portland. Assistant coach Tim 
Grgurich, the buffer between Karl and Gary (I've Got To Be Me) Payton, left for 
UNLV. If last season was the honeymoon, here comes the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 50-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 107.9 (second). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 106.1 (23rd). 
</P>
<P>
 After two injury-ravaged seasons, the Warriors hoped they were starting a new 
day but for old time's sake, Chris Mullin was hurt in camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He's due back in six weeks when he'll join a budding powerhouse that boasts 
Latrell Sprewell, who became a star; Chris Webber, the missing big man, and Tim 
Hardaway, returning from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big man would come in handy but 6-foot-10 draftee Cliff Rozier is 
already a bust. He looked so bad at a mini-camp, the Warriors suggested he get 
a year of seasoning in Europe, or Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Webber held out through the exhibition season, prompting speculation 
that he still isn't over his differences with Coach Don Nelson. Nelson has an 
out in his own contract after the season. One way or another, it'll be a hot 
time in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 47-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 107.3 (third). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 104.6 (18th). 
</P>
<P>
 In Laker dreams, they're lining up the aging Trail Blazers in their sights, 
but it's not going to be that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler might be 32, Terry Porter might be hurt, Jerome Kersey might be 
warming a bench and Rick Adelman might be history but Blazermania lives on. 
Center Chris Dudley, last year's missing piece who was lost early, returns. Rod 
Strickland has become a star. Cliff Robinson already was one, if a spacey one. 
</P>
<P>
 High-powered P.J. Carlesimo takes over as coach and has brought in Dick 
Harter, the guru of knife-between-the-teeth defense, as an assistant. They 
should win 47 games again, which probably makes them too fast for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES LAKERS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 33-49. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 100.4 (16th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 104.7 (19th). 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to hand it to this Jerry West guy. Rejected by Horace Grant and 
Danny Manning, seemingly with no moves left, he swipes Cedric Ceballos, a 
better player than anyone knew, for a No. 1 pick that might be as far away as 
1997. He can't find a famous coach but he gets Del Harris, who is merely a good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 If the truth were known, Harris probably doesn't like the running game as much 
as Jerry Buss does but a restoration of something resembling Showtime was part 
of the job description and in exhibitions, that's what the young Lakers did. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel could be on the verge of something big. Vlade Divac is growing 
into his $4-million-a-year contract. Whatever happens, the Lakers will be 
younger, quicker and more fun this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now West only has to steal a superstar, preferably 6-10 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 SACRAMENTO KINGS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 28-54. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.1 (13th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 106.9 (25th). 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Petrie, former general manager for the Trail Blazers, takes over for 
funny, unlucky Jerry Reynolds, who can still crack jokes from his post as 
director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Garry St. Jean starts his third season having lost 111 games and might 
be wondering if he can catch on as a director of player personnel somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's No. 1 pick, Bobby Hurley, is back but this year's No. 1, Brian 
Grant, held out and missed most of the exhibition season. Olden Polynice is the 
center. Lionel Simmons had arthroscopic surgery on a knee and will be sidelined 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Kings will not finish in last place (see next team). 
</P>
<P>
 CLIPPERS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 27-55. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 103.0 (ninth). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 108.7 (27th). 
</P>
<P>
 The only guy in the Clipper starting lineup who was starting for anyone at the 
end of last season is Elmore Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 How does 15 victories sound? Optimistic? Bill Fitch, a good man who likes a 
challenge, has a beauty. For the Clippers, a great season will consist of 
drawing the No. 1 pick in the lottery and making sure he doesn't skip off to 
Europe on them. MIDWEST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON ROCKETS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 58-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.1 (13th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 96.8 (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
 Only chemistry stands between these guys and a shot at a repeat but that 
should suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Rockets bottled lightning and, more surprisingly, their egos. 
If they can do it again, they will have as good a chance as anyone but their 
offseason was a little rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rudy Tomjanovich was arrested, although ultimately he wasn't charged, 
for drunk driving. Forward Robert Horry had a paternity suit slapped on him by 
the daughter of Rocket Hall of Famer and broadcaster Calvin Murphy. Owner Les 
Alexander, who bought a championship team intact a year ago, celebrated his 
title by firing Turbo, the mascot, and most of the publicity staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter three-point line might be a curse. The Rockets already tried more 
of the long shots than anyone else and now Hakeem Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe 
might want to get into the act. Vernon Maxwell might not set foot inside the 
line all season. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN ANTONIO SPURS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 55-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 100.0 (20th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 94.8 (second). 
</P>
<P>
 There's a new marshal in town and his name is Gregg Popovich. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the general manager hired by the new chairman of the board, Robert (You 
Can Call me General) McDermott, who likes the sound of his military title so 
much he still uses it. 
</P>
<P>
 The General and Gregg have resolved to turn Dennis Rodman into a straight 
arrow, a challenge the makers of Thorazine wouldn't have dared. When Rodman 
showed up late for an exhibition he was sitting out injured, Poppo popped him 
for $15,000. Tuesday, they suspended him for acting up. If Madonna so much as 
shows up at a game, the Worm might get banned for life. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson had a monster season but his teammates wilted down the stretch. 
But the Spurs have reacquired Sean Elliott, imprisoned for a year in Detroit 
after Isiah Thomas decided Elliott couldn't play, and he should go back to 
scoring his 18 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Spurs could keep Rodman mellow, they could be something. But they might 
as well try to catch the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 UTAH JAZZ 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 53-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 101.9 (10th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 97.7 (ninth). 
</P>
<P>
 See last season's report. Same as next season's report. Every year it's the 
same story. Karl Malone and John Stockton are a year older. Management has 
stolen a player or two to help them win 50 games and a playoff series or two, 
but never more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season Scott Layden, son of former coach Frank and an underrated 
personnel director, hornswoggled the Philadelphia 76ers out of sharpshooting 
Jeff Hornacek and the Minnesota Timberwolves out of Felton Spencer, the best of 
the bad centers, so the Jazz aren't going away. But Malone's pleas for a 
Barkley-style trade to a real contender grow louder each year when he realizes 
it's the same old deal. He'll be tuning up by January. 
</P>
<P>
 DENVER NUGGETS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 42-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 100.3 (19th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 98.8 (10th). 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine John Elway, leading cheers before a Nugget game, roaring, "Let's get 
r-r-r-r-e-a-d-y to rumble!"  
</P>
<P>
 It actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring's playoff run carried Denver within a victory of the Western 
Conference finals and turned on the city, which had all but forgotten the 
Nuggets were in town in the sorry post-Doug Moe days. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are sky high but Coach Dan Issel tries to remind everyone this 
team's best days are two or three years away. The question is, is anybody 
listening? 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets have a young nucleus -- Dikembe Mutombo, 28; LaPhonso Ellis, 24; 
Rodney Rogers, 23; Bryant Stith, 23; Robert Pack, 25; Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (25) 
-- but one problem: no great player. If you want to have a great team, you need 
more than good players, you need one real star. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets aren't likely to get one in the draft -- they're out of the 
lottery for the foreseeable future. Ellis and Rogers have a chance to be 
special but they're not there yet. 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS MAVERICKS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 13-69. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 95.1 (27th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 103.8 (17th). 
</P>
<P>
 Things are turning up. What other direction was there for them to go? The 
Mavericks have averaged 67 losses the last three seasons, a monumental feat 
considering the single-season record is 73. Don Carter, vowing to turn the team 
around before selling it, rehired 63-year-old Dick Motta, who was never known 
as a players' coach -- until he succeeded Quinn Buckner to the cheers of the 
grateful Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta's widely admired half-court offense has made stars of his forwards -- 
Bob Love, Chet Walker, Elvin Hayes, Mark Aguirre -- wherever he's gone. Jamal 
Mashburn, lost last season when Buckner tried to install the Bulls' mysterious 
triangle offense, should take off, along with Jim Jackson and Jason Kidd. Roy 
Tarpley is back from his exile abroad. The joke is over in Big D. 
</P>
<P>
 MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 20-62. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring average: 96.7 (26th). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive average: 103.6 (16th). 
</P>
<P>
 They've been sold, moved to New Orleans, unsold, moved back and finally 
re-sold to a Minnesota businessman named Glen Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this end the bad old days when co-owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner 
did a pleasure-palace decree that bankrupted their team, despite playing to 95% 
of capacity, and installed Wolfenson's son-in-law as team president? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, maybe not. Taylor's first act was to make his son-in-law team 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown's assistant, Bill Blair, succeeds Sidney Lowe, whowas more of a 
carpet than a coach and the wrong man to deal with the Brat Pack of Christian 
Laettner and Isaiah Rider. Rookie Donyell Marshall had a big exhibition season 
but talent isn't the T-Wolves' problem as much as professionalism.

COMMENTARY; ALTHOUGH NEVER NO. 1, OSBORNE A CHAMPION OF CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It always comes back to the Orange Bowl of 1984. The big bowl games were 
played on Jan. 2 that year, but the Orange Bowl between Nebraska and Miami had 
started late and run long and now it was 12:30 in the morning. Nebraska was the 
No. 1 team in the country, a runaway No. 1, averaging 500 yards a game in total 
offense. Miami came in ranked fifth in the polls. Miami led, 31-24, and then 
Nebraska scored with 48 seconds left and finally Tom Osborne, the Nebraska 
coach, had to decide whether to kick the extra point and tie the game, or go 
for two and try to win it. Sometimes in sports you are asked to make more than 
a call. You are asked who you are. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have booed Osborne as a bum if he walked out with a tie. Everyone 
would have screamed the way they did when Notre Dame's Ara Parseghian settled 
for a tie against Michigan State in 1966. But Osborne also would have walked 
out of the Orange Bowl with the national championship. He would have gone back 
to Lincoln and put another trophy in the case to go with the ones Bob Devaney 
had won for Nebraska, and no one would have ever been able to say Osborne could 
not win the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne went for two. As far as he was concerned, there was never anything to 
discuss on the Nebraska sideline. He believed there were certain rules for 
champions, that they did not just walk away from this kind of moment or this 
kind of game. 
</P>
<P>
 So Turner Gill, the quarterback that year, threw in the right flat for a kid 
named Jeff Smith. A Miami defender named Kenny Calhoun broke the play up. 
Nebraska was 12-1 and because things had broken right in the other bowls, Miami 
was national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tom Osborne's team is No. 1 again in one of the polls. The whole thing 
will probably come back to the Orange Bowl for him. If Miami beats Syracuse 
this weekend, Nebraska's opponent on Jan. 2 probably will be Miami. Maybe this 
time Osborne will finally get the points against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to look any farther ahead than today's practice," Osborne was 
saying the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the true giants of his profession. He has won everything except 
the title, and conducted himself with grace and dignity in a sport, college 
football, that is so often cheap slapstick and plain lunacy. Now he has another 
chance. He had the same chance in the last seconds of the last Orange Bowl, 
against Florida State, but a field goal was missed. 
</P>
<P>
 This always seems more unjust with Osborne because he did the right thing 
once, when it was all on the line for him in the Orange Bowl of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize you had a choice," Osborne said. "I didn't know what was 
happening in the other bowls with the teams behind us, but even if I had, I 
would have done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne paused. "I'm not going to lie to you. It would have taken a lot of 
heat off me, if I had a national championship trophy to show off. But if I had 
won it with a tie, I wouldn't feel as good about it. Ultimately, you've got to 
look yourself in the mirror. The only way you can do that is if you do the 
right thing. I've always believed I did that against Miami." 
</P>
<P>
 This is his 22nd season at Nebraska. His record is 215-47-3 in non-bowl games. 
Bowl games are a different matter, of course. Osborne is 8-13 and has never won 
the bowl game that would have given him the title. Now Nebraska fights it out 
at the top of the polls with Penn State. It would be a fine thing for Paterno 
to win another title. At the same time it is impossible to root against 
Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost his starting quarterback, Tommie Frazier, because of a blood clot in 
Frazier's leg. There was a time a few weeks ago when it seemed Osborne might 
run out of quarterbacks. Nebraska keeps going. Its 24-7 beating of No. 2 
Colorado Saturday was the best performance against a class team I have seen in 
college football this season. If they do not lose the rest of the way, they 
will be the first college team in 90 years to finish 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
 They started the season at No. 1, then dropped to No. 2 behind Florida. A few 
weeks ago, the Cornhuskers somehow fell to No. 3 after they beat undefeated (at 
the time) Kansas State. They were down to a third-string quarterback and 
Osborne's best runner, Lawrence Phillips, did not play the whole game. Penn 
State went to No. 1 that week, and it seemed Nebraska might be closed out of a 
clear shot at the title. It seemed nothing could beat Paterno if his team ran 
the table. Then Nebraska vs. Colorado changed plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was unusual when we dropped a few weeks ago, even with the polls 
being as unpredictable as they are," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past couple of years, it seems the sporting public -- at least outside 
Nebraska -- has come around to Osborne, and his team, seen them as more than 
college's Buffalo Bills, a team that cannot win it all. Nebraska was not 
supposed to have a chance against Florida State in last year's Orange Bowl, and 
then the ball was in the air on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers did not make the dramatic field goal and win the Orange Bowl 
of '94. They didn't make the two-point conversion against Miami 10 years 
earlier. Nebraska always has found a way to finish second, in a sports culture 
where finishing second is supposed to mark you as some kind of worthless loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne knows better. Because of who he is. He can live without No. 1. He 
should not have to. Tom Osborne should get the points this time.

 The San Antonio Spurs, saying they will not tolerate Dennis Rodman's 
outbursts, suspended the star forward without pay Tuesday, one day after he was 
ejected from his team's final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get his attention as best we can," Coach Bob Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spur General Manager Gregg Popovich said team officials will decide soon on 
the length of the suspension. However, he will be suspended at least through 
Friday's season opener against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, 33, who led the league in rebounding last season with an average of 
17.3 a game, earns a reported $2.4 million per year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Lakers made their first cut, releasing rookie Kendrick Warren, which 
reduced the roster to 14. Warren, a small forward from Virginia Commonwealth, 
played 18 minutes in four exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams must be down to the 12-player limit by Thursday afternoon.

 The Minnesota Timberwolves, looking to strengthen themselves at center, 
acquired Sean Rooks from the Dallas Mavericks for a conditional first-round 
draft pick in 1996, 1997 or 1998. . . . The Phoenix Suns waived guard Winston 
Garland, a former Clipper. . . . The Denver Nuggets waived forward Mark Randall 
and placed forward LaPhonso Ellis, who has a stress fracture of the right 
kneecap, and guard Darnell Mee, who has a sprained right ankle, on the injured 
list. . . . James Donaldson, a 14-year veteran, was cut by the Philadelphia 
76ers.

SCHOOLS SUSPEND PLAYERS; FOOTBALL: FOUR SYLMAR STARTERS AND FIVE POLY STARTERS 
WILL MISS GAMES FOR ROLES IN LAST WEEK'S FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Four starters from the Sylmar High football team will be suspended for 
Friday's Valley Pac-8 Conference game against North Hollywood, including two 
who will miss the rest of the regular season, Sylmar Athletic Director Bob 
Miller said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were suspended for their roles in a bench-clearing fight during 
the Spartans' game against Poly last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar administrators refused to identify the names of the four suspended 
players. However, Miller did confirm that the players were starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar is undefeated and ranked second among area teams by the Times. "It's 
going to hurt our defense," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said. "We're going to 
accept a challenge that some of our guys aren't going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Poly suspended five players, all starters, for Friday's game against Canoga 
Park, Coach Tim Feeley said. Cameron Hilton, Poly's leading rusher, was among 
those suspended. Tight end Paul Cespedes, tackle Darryl Mathis and linebacker 
Elmer Sanchez will also miss one game. Linebacker Jose Hernandez was suspended 
for two games, because he helped instigate the fight, Feeley said. All of the 
players are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be all right but we've got to move a bunch of people around," 
Feeley said. "They know what they did was wrong and they're willing to take 
responsibility for their roles. It wasn't an easy situation for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspensions were issued from each school after administrators reviewed 
film of the scuffle, which occurred near the end of the first half of Sylmar's 
69-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's suspended players will practice with the team but they will not be 
allowed on the sidelines during games. Miller said the two players who will sit 
out Sylmar's final two games will be reinstated for the playoffs, which start 
Nov. 18.

MULLEN'S NEW CAREER CARRIES A FOOTNOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wave of pride swept over Jim Mullen. He just had to let everyone within 
earshot know. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on his way home from a fight in Bakersfield 16 months ago, he rolled down 
the passenger-side window of the car in which he was riding, popped his head 
out into the dry night air, and proclaimed himself, "Heavyweight champion of 
the world!" 
</P>
<P>
 And he was. To be exact, he was World Kickboxing Assn. amateur heavyweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy who doctors once said would be wheelchair-bound with 
rheumatoid arthritis by the age of 30. Next on the agenda was a professional 
kickboxing career, one Mullen was convinced would provide comfort and financial 
security for himself and his toddler son, Trace. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know then that his professional kickboxing career would last one 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money in (kickboxing) and the abuse on your body is tremendous," 
Mullen said this week from the comfort of the living room of his Simi Valley 
townhome. And so he started a new career, one he says is potentially more 
lucrative and also easier on his chronically arthritic knees. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a professional boxer. Gloved fists only. No kicking allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Mullen boxes professionally for the fifth time, meeting Obed Sullivan 
(4-1, three knockouts) in a scheduled six-round event on the undercard of a 
six-bout show at the Warner Center Marriott. P.J. Goossen (12-0, 11 knockouts) 
of Palmdale faces Irish Pat Lawlor (20-5, six knockouts) in the 10-round main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same goal, little different sport," Mullen said. "But I still see myself 
going right to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Six feet and 212 pounds, Mullen, 25, lacks the dominant physical presence of 
many top heavyweights.  
</P>
<P>
 His pectoral muscles need tuning and he is flabby around the middle, remnants 
he said, of an adolescence in which he weighed as much as 280 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my parents divorced, I turned to food," Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martial arts, which he studied for five years, took off some of the excess 
weight and provided a much-needed boost to his self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since turning to boxing, Mullen has won his first four bouts -- three by 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at me and think I'm out of shape and slow, but the next thing 
they know, they're getting hit six or seven times and they haven't hit me," 
Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen has plenty of work to do in boxing before he enjoys the respect he 
earned as an amateur kickboxer.  
</P>
<P>
 When organizers last month announced tonight's card in a news release, Mullen 
was introduced as "Jimmy Mullins." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, at a press conference, he went out of his way to spell his 
last name -- an obvious dig at the show's promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it didn't bother me, I wouldn't have come out and said what I said," 
Mullen said. "I'm out there fighting my heart out and they can't even get my 
name right." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-round super-middle-weight bout between Robert Allen (9-1, eight 
knockouts) and Chris Sande (17-8-1, six KOs) of Kenya was added to the card 
last week when an opponent could not be found to face undefeated lightweight 
Sugar Shane Mosley. And in This Corner . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: P.J. Goossen (12-0, 11 knockouts) meets Irish Pat Lawlor (20-5, six 
KOs), 10-round super-welterweight main event. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: A six-bout professional boxing card. Undercard fights feature junior 
welterweights Anthony Johnson (9-1, four KOs) vs. Tony West (6-9-1, three KOs), 
six rounds; welterweights Santiago Negro Franco (3-3, three KOs) vs. Juan West 
(0-1), four rounds; super-middleweights Robert Allen (9-1, eight KOs) vs. Chris 
Sande (17-8-1, six KOs), eight rounds; cruiserweights Arthur Saribekyan (9-1, 
nine KOs) vs. Brad Powell (7-5, four KOs), six rounds; heavyweights Jim Mullen 
(4-0, three KOs) vs. Obed Sullivan (4-1, three KOs), six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Tonight. First bell at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Warner Center Marriott, 21850 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills.

CLARK GETS ADDED YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY; BASKETBALL: CAL LUTHERAN FORWARD GRANTED 
ANOTHER SEASON UNDER MEDICAL HARDSHIP WAIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derrick Clark, a starter on Cal Lutheran's men's basketball team for the past 
two seasons, has been granted another year of eligibility by the NCAA under 
conditions of a medical hardship waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a 6-foot-4 forward, was named All-Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference after averaging 15.9 points and 7.6 rebounds a game last 
season to help the Kingsmen win a share of their third consecutive SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, which require an athlete to complete four seasons of 
participation during a five-year period, Clark was a fifth-year senior last 
season. But the NCAA granted him another year of eligibility because a pair of 
knee injuries prevented him from playing much at Lassen Junior College in 
Susanville, Calif., during 1990-92 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark averaged 12 points and eight rebounds a game for Lassen during his 
freshman year, but suffered a season-ending knee injury early in the 1990-91 
season. He did not play at all during the 1991-92 season after he re-injured 
the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely glad to have him back," first-year Cal Lutheran Coach Rich 
Rider said. "He's such a strong player and excellent leader that he's nice to 
have around. He's one of those kids who leads by example." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is one of three returning starters -- along with point guard Dave Ulloa 
and forward-center Paul LaMott -- from last year's team that posted a 25-3 
record and advanced to the third round of Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, sophomore Jason Smith has transferred to Westmont. The 
6-5 swingman from Melbourne, Australia, averaged nine points and 4.7 rebounds 
last season.

CSUN WILL SEEK FEEDBACK BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Characterizing the issue as emotional as well as economic, Cal State 
Northridge administrators are expected to seek public feedback before any 
decisions are made regarding cuts within the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kopita, Northridge dean of students, said Tuesday that an open forum 
likely will be held before the end of the month to solicit feedback from the 
campus community.The athletic department, which faces a severe budget shortfall 
next year, has delivered to Kopita a series of funding proposals, some of which 
would eliminate programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson has indicated that she wants 
"broad-based" input before she decides which budget scenario to pursue, Kopita 
said. Feedback would be welcome from coaches, boosters, students, faculty and 
staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an economic decision, it's an emotional decision, it's an academic 
decision," Kopita said. "Cutting one program affects another. . . . We want 
everybody to understand the options and consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita reiterated that he would like to settle all athletic budgetary issues 
by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related issue, the Associated Students voted Tuesday to ratify the 
results of last month's student election. Included on the ballot was an 
athletic fee measure that would have hiked fees $49 per semester for each 
student.

BREEDERS' CUP; LONG FLIGHTS MAY HINDER SOME HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen Breeders' Cup horses from Europe had been accounted for at Churchill 
Downs by early Tuesday, and a plane carrying 12 more from England was expected 
to arrive Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane from France, which arrived with 12 horses Monday afternoon, left 90 
minutes late, was slowed down by heavy winds and stopped for refueling in 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to 23 hours of travel, with the horses expected to leave 
quarantine and be on the track today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no clue about the European horses," trainer Wayne Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a big order for them to fly on Tuesday and run on Saturday over a 
track that they're not familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a 1:14 six-furlong workout for the Classic, Dramatic Gold returned to 
the barn bleeding from a small cut above his right hind hoof. "Sometimes he 
gets a little excited with the pony," said trainer David Hofmans, who didn't 
seem concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did the same thing in Canada (before winning the Molson Export Million) 
and cut himself on the right hind pastern there too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Balmy weather turned to a winter chill in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The chill factor was in the low 20s with a stiff wind on the backstretch 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a warming trend in the forecast, with a chance of showers Friday and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature hasn't surpassed 50 degrees for either of the two previous 
Breeders' Cups at Churchill Downs. BILL CHRISTINE

TRAINERS HIT WITH LIGHT FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than 40 hours of testimony over a three-month period, five trainers 
have been fined $500 apiece and one has been fined $750 for running horses at 
Santa Anita and Los Alamitos that tested positive for scopolamine, a prohibited 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughbred trainers Ron McAnally, Willard Proctor, Mark Hennig and Lewis 
Cenicola, and harness trainer James Grundy were each fined $500 by the 
California Horse Racing Board, and Richard Mandella, who had two thoroughbreds 
that tested positive, was fined $750. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewards Ingrid Fermin, Darrel McHargue and Dave Samuel, who issued the 
rulings, also ordered that the horses' purse money be redistributed. The 
biggest purse change affected Hennig's horse, Lady Blessington, who won the 
Buena Vista Handicap in February. The winner's share of $66,300 has been 
transferred to Skimble, the second-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Craigo, who represents Team Valor, the owner of Lady 
Blessington, and Robert Clay, another horse owner, said his clients would 
appeal the rulings and ask for a rehearing. Attorneys for the trainers could 
not be reached for comment, but some of them are also expected to appeal, 
according to Craigo. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Wood, executive director of the racing board, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to penalties in other states and based on other rulings in 
California, the rulings appear light. A year ago, Gary Jones, a prominent 
trainer, was barred for 30 days after one of his horses tested positive for a 
narcotic painkiller. Jones said that he had not drugged the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lady Blessington, the horses trained by Mandella, McAnally and Grundy 
won their races. The horses trained by Proctor and Cenicola finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing for trainer Bill Shoemaker, who ran a horse at Santa Anita in April 
that tested positive for scopolamine, has not been completed.

 Birmingham High School Principal Gerald Kleinman decided that he just wasn't 
going to allow it. He'd heard other administrators say they can't stop students 
from walking off campus in protest of Proposition 187, but he refused Tuesday 
to stand by and watch it happen again on his campus. 
</P>
<P>
 So when about 150 to 200 students marched out of class Tuesday morning, 
Kleinman beat them to the front gate and locked it. When the crowd turned for 
another gate, he ran ahead of the pack again and padlocked those gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't want them on the streets," Kleinman said. "I didn't want them 
out into the neighborhood. I did not want a repeat of Friday," when thousands 
of students, including about 400 from Birmingham, left their campuses in the 
biggest student protest against the initiative to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Young protesters from 11 San Fernando Valley middle and high schools crowded 
streets and blocked intersections throughout the school day Friday, leading to 
a tactical alert by police, and scattered fighting and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many administrators have said they are all but powerless to stop the masses of 
students from walking off campus in protest of the controversial ballot 
measure, which would deny public education and other social services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Kleinman. At the first signs of a mounting protest, he and other 
administrators armed themselves with two-way radios and took positions at 
campus exits. Meanwhile, Los Angeles police heard of the fledgling 
demonstration over school police radios. About six school and Los Angeles 
patrol cars lined up in front of campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths responded to the blockade with a sit-in at the front of campus, 
asking administrators to call the news media and to allow them to hold an 
anti-187 forum. Ultimately, the students retreated to the auditorium, where 
they discussed their opposition to the ballot measure, due for a vote Tuesday, 
and planned a walkout today. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, the students have planned to meet before school in the parking 
lot, where Kleinman can't lock them in. They also agreed to stage a peaceful 
march. 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize . . . to everybody for what happened Friday," said Olga Escobar, 
a 17-year-old sophomore. "This is not the way we're supposed to do it. We're 
supposed to do it peacefully as Martin Luther King did. We are not here . . . 
to break windows, go into stores and bang on cars." 
</P>
<P>
 During their midmorning forum, several students jeered and appeared 
uninterested. One student set off a stink bomb that permeated the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to talk about 187, not to talk about a stink bomb," shouted 
Stephanie Brynildsen, a 14-year-old freshman. "You guys are against 187. Why 
don't you show people you're against 187? Show everybody that." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about safety, Kleinman urged students to confine their protest to 
school grounds. With a protest planned before school starts, however, he said 
he would be unable to replicate his Tuesday success. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they left the forum, student organizers made one thing clear: "If 
you're not going to do it right, don't do it," said Debbie Saravia, a 
16-year-old senior. "We're in this for peace . . . not violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 187, school officials would be required to verify students' 
immigration status and ultimately report their families' citizenship. The Board 
of Education has opposed the measure and Supt. Sid Thompson has appealed to 
students to remain on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, students have been staging walkouts throughout the district for 
several weeks. Los Angeles Unified School District officials said eight schools 
were involved in protests Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Canoga Park High students circled the school perimeter before 
holding a rally on the football field, where they agreed to keep their protests 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until the election, I think most campuses will face this issue," said 
Larry Higgins, principal at Canoga Park. "Kids need an arena to express 
themselves -- whether it's 187 or some other issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Birmingham students opposing the measure said they believe that everyone 
living in this country has the right to free public education and health 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have family here from Peru who are illegals and they deserve the same 
rights I have," said Paul Menacho, a 17-year-old senior. "They work just as 
hard -- if not harder -- than the American citizens. Why shouldn't they have 
the same rights?"

ACCESS TO GUN IN SUICIDE ATTEMPT QUESTIONED; INCIDENT: AUTHORITIES ARE CHECKING 
REPORTS THAT THE TEEN, WHOSE CONDITION WAS UPGRADED TO SERIOUS, TRIED TO KILL 
HIMSELF BEFORE. HIS CLASSMATES STRUGGLE TO COPE WITH THE SHOCK.

 Sheriff's investigators said Tuesday that when a 16-year-old high school 
student recovers from a near-fatal suicide attempt that jarred the calm of a 
classroom, they intend to determine how he obtained a .45-caliber handgun and 
whether his parents may have negligently made it available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are circumstances surrounding that weapon that won't go away, and which 
we'll have to look at closely as soon as we can," said Lt. Dan Martini, a 
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Martini said deputies 
were checking reports that the student had tried to kill himself once before. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said new state laws could make the parents liable if the semiautomatic 
handgun were accessible to a minor, "but it would have to be an almost blatant, 
reckless use of the weapon. This is a difficult set of circumstances. I don't 
know how much liability there will be vis-a-vis the security of the weapon, but 
it's something we're going to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but sources close to the 
family said the boy went home shortly before the incident at 12:44 p.m. Monday 
and obtained the weapon from a locked chest belonging to his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Despondent over his girlfriend breaking up with him, the junior at Aliso 
Niguel High School stood up during fifth-period photography class, placed the 
gun under his chin and fired a single shot in front of the girl and 26 other 
classmates, authorities said. No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet went up through his mouth and out the base of his nose, and despite 
needing extensive reconstructive surgery, he should recover fully, officials at 
Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center said Tuesday, 
when his condition was upgraded from critical to serious. He never lost 
consciousness and suffered no neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As Aliso Niguel High School students struggled Tuesday to cope with the shock 
of the incident, a team of psychiatrists, psychologists and other counselors 
held individual and group meetings in the school's library. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent home to parents Tuesday, school Principal Denise J. Danne 
noted that "the student left campus without permission (Monday) and returned 
with the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was despondent over the breakup of his relationship with his girlfriend 
and told her that he was going to shoot himself," Danne's letter states. "At no 
time was any staff member alerted to this personal crisis. . . . Most 
crucially, I have underlined the importance of adhering to the policy of zero 
tolerance towards any type of weapon on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, meanwhile, tried to learn more about the student's mood leading 
up to the shooting and how he readily obtained the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's recovery "is most important for now," Martini said. "This is a very 
traumatic event that the family is going through. But as soon as he's back on 
his feet, we're going to talk to him and the family extensively." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the family said Tuesday that the boy had been "seriously 
depressed for more than a year" and had attempted suicide on an earlier 
occasion. The previous attempt was confirmed by several sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy obtained the weapon from a chest that his father kept under lock and 
key, sources said, noting that the parents were stunned to learn about the 
incident and mystified about how he secured the weapon. Sources said the father 
is a Marine Corps officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted by The Times, the father of the boy's former girlfriend declined 
comment, while school officials noted that the girl didn't show up for class on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Danenhauer, the staff psychologist at Aliso Niguel High School, said the 
boy and his family moved to Orange County from Hawaii, where he attended 
Kalaheo High School during the 1992-93 school term. Danenhauer said the boy had 
been under the care of a psychotherapist for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked if the boy had previously attempted suicide, she replied, "I just 
think it would be a violation to share that information." 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Johnson, the teacher of the photography class in which the boy was 
enrolled, met with her fifth-period students on Tuesday, and later, the 
students huddled at length with 20 counselors provided by the Capistrano 
Unified School District and the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them felt angry that he had violated them, the school, and their 
security in choosing this place to do it," Johnson said. "I'm thankful that he 
is going to be all right and that no one else was hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that she too felt violated and was still in a state of shock a 
day later, since the boy had shown no indication of being depressed. School 
administrators had never warned her, she said, about the boy being potentially 
unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 She described him as a good student, albeit a quiet and moody one, and no 
different on Monday -- prior to the shooting -- that at any other time. "It's 
not like he was a flake or anything," Johnson said. "I feel kind of numb from 
it all."

SANTA ANA MAYORAL CANDIDATE PULIDO OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman and mayoral candidate Miguel A. Pulido Jr. said Tuesday that he 
opposes the anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187, a revelation that prompted 
criticism from Latino community activists who said he should have spoken up 
publicly long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido said Tuesday that he has always opposed Proposition 187 because it 
would deny public education to illegal immigrant children and turn health 
officials into de facto immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned, and I don't want to see kids thrown out of school," Pulido 
said. "That's wrong. I don't want to see hospitals act as INS agents." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayoral candidate said he had declined to take a formal position as a city 
official because the measure is a state initiative, rather than a Santa Ana 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a city, we would only polarize the community, and I think it's a very 
controversial, complicated, emotional situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido -- who was born in Mexico -- has told groups of Latinos in his 
campaigning that he is against the ballot measure but has declined to say so 
publicly, said John Palacio of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino community leaders have criticized both Pulido and Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez for not showing their cards on the issue. Vasquez, the county's 
highest-ranking elected Latino official, has remained silent on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Latino community leaders criticized Pulido's response as too late 
and timed to be politically safe. Support for Proposition 187, which had held a 
two-to-one lead in Los Angeles Times polls, has been dropping recently, and 
even some staunch Republicans have called the measure flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miguel Pulido took a calculated position of 'no position' during the time 
when the polls indicated overwhelming support for the initiative," Palacio 
said. "Now that it's politically expedient to do so, Miguel Pulido has taken a 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, said that Pulido is only 
taking a stand now because it is "politically safe" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really sad in our view. I find it sad that he would not do it at the 
moment of truth," David said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno placed an item on the council 
agenda urging council members to take a symbolic stand against Proposition 187, 
but his motion failed for lack of a second. Latino leaders had approached 
Pulido first and asked him to place the item on the agenda, but he declined. 
</P>
<P>
 David sent Pulido a letter last week that chided him for "sitting mute" during 
the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido said Tuesday that he is speaking out against the measure as an 
individual only, not in his capacity as councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is devising a plan that would require Santa Ana police to cooperate 
fully with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport illegal 
immigrants who commit crimes.

DANA PARSONS: THE VOTER WHO'S SO ANGRY THAT HE CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hunched in a corner booth at an all-night diner, he sat alone, muttering to 
himself while fumbling with his mashed potatoes and peas. " Damn lumpy 
potatoes. Damn slippery peas ." 
</P>
<P>
 He barely acknowledged me as I approached. "Excuse me, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's my damn butter?" he growled, knocking over several items on the table 
as he looked in vain for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you The Angry Voter?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shut up!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be him. If you've got a minute, I'd like to talk to you about the 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn crooks, all of 'em," he muttered. "Crooks, liars and fools." 
</P>
<P>
 "You seem pretty upset. How come?" 
</P>
<P>
 He flung a wad of mashed potatoes at me, but I ducked and it splatted on the 
back of a customer's jacket in the next booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn country's falling apart, and those people aren't doing anything about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly how is the country falling apart?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty damn obvious, isn't it? Job, schools, taxes, crime, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's obvious, but I'd like to hear it from you. Are you out of work?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I've been working every day of my life for the last 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, but you're probably pretty worried about retirement, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the company's got a pretty good pension plan, and we're covered on 
health. Not that any of us has ever been sick. The company is sponsoring a 
cruise this winter, and it looks like my wife and I are going. No damn 
Christmas bonus last year, though." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that is tough. What else has you down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn car. Can't afford a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's too bad. Got kind of a clunker, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, she's a '92 Honda, but we wanted a new one this year. Already got 
25,000 miles on her, and the kids want me to get a convertible. Fat chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "You blame the politicians for that, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you, a wise guy? Of course, I blame them." 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of house do you have?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a three-bedroom with a couple garages." 
</P>
<P>
 "Crummy neighborhood, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's pretty decent. We've lived here 15 years and there's a park two 
blocks away and the kids can walk to school." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, the schools are pretty poor, are they?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass me the damn salt. . . . Well, you hear a lot of talk, but the kids seem 
to like their teachers. All I know is they're doing homework all night. I guess 
they're doing OK, but my kids never listen to a damn thing I say." 
</P>
<P>
 "You blame that on the politicians, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn straight." 
</P>
<P>
 "And you're really getting soaked on taxes, huh? You losing a lot more out of 
your paycheck?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, not really. Our payments have held pretty steady, and I guess inflation 
ain't too bad, and the house has picked up a little value, but the money just 
seems to go, you know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure. Times are tight." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get my oldest boy a car. He's 16, you know. And just last week, my 
daughter said all her friends were going skiing over winter break, so that'll 
cost another thousand bucks. You think people in Washington give a damn about 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably not. I can see why you're upset, but let's talk about the election 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hate all those politicians. They don't give a damn about the common man. 
They're living the life of Riley back there in Washington, and we're barely 
scraping by out here. They've lost touch with us. I'd like to throw 'em all 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 "You do seem pretty angry about things." 
</P>
<P>
 "No damn baseball. No damn hockey. TV stinks. Had to repair the washer last 
week. My wife's on my case all the time. It's a crying shame. Last week, she 
made me go to the damn symphony. I told her to take the kids to the movies 
tonight and leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you mind if I ask how you're going to vote in the major races next week?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't paid much attention. Whole country's falling apart anyway. What 
difference does it make who you vote for?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me see if I have this straight. Aside from being in good health and 
living in a big house with stable payments in a nice neighborhood and having a 
steady job and going on a cruise this winter and sending your kids to good 
schools and buying your son a car and sending your daughter skiing and having 
enough left over to go to the symphony or the movies, is there anything else 
wrong with your life?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, last weekend my cable went on the blink during the fourth quarter of 
the football game. Missed two full minutes. Damn bureaucrats. I'd like to get 
rid of all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for talking to me. How about if I pick up your tab, and you leave the 
tip?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget it," he said. "I ain't leaving no damn tip."

ACCESS TO GUN IN SUICIDE ATTEMPT QUESTIONED; PSYCHOLOGY: MANY ADOLESCENTS WHO 
TRY TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES SUFFER WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE A TERRIBLE 
REJECTION. EXPERTS SAY THERE ARE OFTEN SIGNS FOR WHICH PARENTS CAN WATCH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many teen-agers who attempt suicide, the 16-year-old boy who shot himself 
in the head Monday during a class at Aliso Niguel High School recently suffered 
what he perceived as a devastating rejection or loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in adolescence, when a person has little experience at putting 
life's low points in perspective, a breakup or a death in the family can set 
off suicidal thoughts and, much less often, an attempt at self-destruction, 
experts say. If a teen-ager is impulsive or is using drugs and alcohol, the 
risk is even greater, said Michael Peck, a clinical psychologist in West Los 
Angeles who has written a book on youth suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicides among teen-agers have increased fivefold over the past 40 years, 
according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Peck 
attributes much of the rise to substance abuse. In 1990, the national suicide 
rate for teens was 11.1 per 100,000. Many more make unsuccessful attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say suicide in Orange County still is relatively uncommon -- 13 
were recorded last year -- and it is highly unlikely that a single event -- 
such as a breakup -- would prompt an attempt in an otherwise well-adjusted 
teen-ager. Suicides most often are preceded by a history of depression, family 
problems or troubled peer relationships. Many times, a successful suicide is 
preceded by previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 There often are signs to watch for: mood swings, sudden behavior changes such 
as giving away possessions, withdrawal from family and friends, loss of 
appetite and poor sleeping habits. Sometimes a teen-ager will explicitly warn 
others -- as the 16-year-old Aliso Niguel student did his friends -- that he is 
planning to kill himself, in this case because the boy's girlfriend broke up 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 These warnings, experts say, should always be heeded. Although threats most of 
the time will not come to fruition, it is important to err on the side of 
caution. Peers, mental health professionals say, should tell a responsible 
adult, even if it means risking the friendship and breaking a pledge of 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area where you break that promise," said Dr. Louis Gottschalk, 
founding chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said suicide attempts generally are a private affair, rarely taking 
place in a public setting such as a high school classroom. They speculated that 
the 16-year-old at Aliso Niguel wanted to make a public display of his anger 
toward his former girlfriend or perhaps put her to shame as a way of avenging 
the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has to be reassured that it had to be more than just her rejection that 
made him do this," Gottschalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several experts expressed concern that the public nature of the attempt and 
the media attention it has received might inspire "copycats." One UC Irvine 
professor refused to discuss the issue because of that fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the incident illustrates the importance of discussing the issue of 
suicide with teens in high schools, as part of the curricula. Jacqueline Price, 
a spokeswoman for the Capistrano Unified School District, said that the 
district already has developed its own curriculum addressing suicide and that 
upper-class students are taught about the warning signs. Grim Statistics Young 
men accounted for most of the 87 teen-age suicides in Orange County during the 
past six years. A look at teen suicide in Orange County: *

3 PEDESTRIANS STRUCK, BOY KILLED; TRAGEDY: SEPARATE ACCIDENTS IN ORANGE AND 
IRVINE ALSO LEAVE AN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN SERIOUSLY HURT.

 A 6-year-old boy walking to school Tuesday was fatally struck by a car as he 
stepped into a crosswalk just ahead of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 At almost the same moment, an 11-year-old girl and a 52-year-old man were 
struck and seriously injured in Irvine in unrelated accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first accident, second-grader Jonathan Nicasio was crossing Main Street 
at Maple Avenue on his way to Sycamore Elementary School in Orange when he was 
struck just before 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother was a step or two behind," said Orange Police Detective Roy 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Michelle Buck, who turns 12 on Friday, was toting her books and 
band instrument to Venado Middle School in Irvine when a car struck her on 
Deerfield Avenue near West Doe Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jonathan and Michelle were in crosswalks within a block of their schools, 
police said. And in both cases, a car had stopped and motioned the students to 
cross the street. As they did, they were hit by cars in another lane, police 
said. No crossing guards were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no protection for them in this kind of accident -- when someone is 
just not looking," said Michelle's uncle, Sia Adabkah. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McMillen, principal of Sycamore Elementary School, said: "They see those 
yellow-painted lines, and they get a sense of false security. They don't see it 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan died at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. Michelle was in intensive care 
in the pediatric ward at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with a fractured 
skull, Irvine Senior Investigator Jeff Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third unrelated incident, a 52-year-old man was struck by a car about 
7:40 a.m. as he crossed Yale Avenue at Woodspring in a crosswalk. James Ashurst 
of Irvine was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with head trauma and 
pelvis and rib fractures. He underwent surgery Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that all the drivers involved stopped and that none have been 
cited pending investigations into all three accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle's father, William Buck, said he was shocked at his daughter's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "One moment, I'm so angry at whoever did this to my daughter," he said. "But 
then the next moment, I'm thinking (the driver has) got to feel awful about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Livermore, an eighth-grader at Venado, was among a handful of students 
who saw the accident. Melissa, 13, said she was being dropped off when she saw 
Michelle about to cross the street. She turned around to get her things from 
the back seat, then heard a "loud thud." She turned and saw Michelle lying face 
down in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shaking all through first period," Livermore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents involving students prompted school officials to offer counseling 
services to students. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sycamore, Principal McMillen attended the classes in which Jonathan was 
enrolled to console students about the death of their classmate. Students made 
sympathy cards for Jonathan's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Sycamore is located on a busy section of Main Street. Portola Middle and Far 
Horizons Montessori schools are within walking distance. El Camino Real Park is 
down the block. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit is 30 m.p.h., but neighbors say people travel about 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents have tried to get the city to install blinking lights or 
something, anything to get people to slow down," McMillen said. "That hasn't 
happened, and again, I don't want to put the blame on the city."

RACE-CAR DRIVER, SECOND MAN SAY MOB BEAT THEM; CRIME: SPEEDWAY COMPETITOR ROCKY 
MORAN AND COTO DE CAZA NEIGHBOR SAY ABOUT 50 TEENS JUMPED THEM AS THEY RETURNED 
HOME AFTER HALLOWEEN EVENTS.

 Race-car driver Rocky Moran and another man, both residents of this upscale 
gated community, said Tuesday they were attacked separately and seriously 
injured by a mob of more than 50 teen-agers inside the gates as they were 
returning from trick-or-treating with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine or 10 of them got me down and proceeded to kick and pummel my head with 
rocks for a few minutes," said Bernard Moran (no relation to Rocky Moran), 45, 
a 230-pound former Marine who said he suffered a broken rib, fractured ankle 
and several facial bruises in the attack. "I remember severe blows and a number 
of flashes; today I feel like I was playing football without pads." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran, 44, who is 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, suffered a dislocated 
shoulder in a separate attack just moments before the attack on Bernard Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kay Moran, the attack on her husband, Rocky, began about 7:45 
p.m. Monday as the couple were driving home with their 4-year-old son from an 
evening of trick-or-treating. On Via Coyote, she said, they encountered a mob 
of high school-age kids blocking the street. "You couldn't drive your car up 
the street," she said. "Nobody would move. We went by real slowly and all of a 
sudden someone started throwing rocks and kicking the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran said that as the teen-agers dented the family's minivan, "finally, 
my anger got the best of me. I got out of the car and said something. Then 
somebody came up behind me, and three more of them came in. Then we went to 
town. I guess I watched enough 'Rocky' movies -- I just put my head down. I 
don't think I landed one decent blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran said he was told the teen-agers were from Santa Margarita High 
School. They "were smoking, swearing, raising hell. Hey, I was a kid once. I 
remember. It's Halloween. . . . But they can't be taking old (guys) out of 
their cars and beating 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran also sustained multiple bruises to the top and the back of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things that just happened so fast, and you can't believe 
it's happening when it's happening," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Moran has piloted a car through turns at 200-plus m.p.h. in the 
Indianapolis 500, where he competed in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and has raced cars 
at various other levels for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hurts more than anything I had in a race car." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Bernard Moran occurred a few moments later, he said, as Rocky 
Moran was being taken by his wife to the hospital. Coming upon the scene with 
his 9-year-old son, Bernard Moran said, he too left his car to confront the 
teen-agers who then beat him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sensed there were some drugs or alcohol involved," he said. "They really 
surprised me; I haven't ever gone one on 10 before." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men said they were taken to nearby hospitals where they were treated for 
their injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. William Francis, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
said the incidents are under investigation and no arrests have been made. 
Deputies arrived after the attacks occurred and the teen-agers were gone, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 All day Tuesday, Bernard Moran said, he had been receiving calls of support 
from neighbors outraged by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Moran said his own sense of security and well-being had been seriously 
disrupted by the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an upper-end gated community," he said, "and I don't like the thought 
of my family being in jeopardy. We plan to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a community meeting was scheduled for 5:30 tonight to discuss how to 
respond to the incident.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; ROLLER HOCKEY ARENA PLAN DRAWS 
CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Roller hockey is gaining ground among the city's youth, but apparently not 
with some people. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the growing number of players, the city is assisting two local 
groups in building arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Arenas are proposed by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Huntington Valley at 
McCallen Park, near Yorktown Avenue and Delaware Street, and at Wardlow School, 
9191 Pioneer Drive, by Kid Connection, a nonprofit youth group. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has approved spending $9,000 -- from developer fees -- to 
help the community organizations build their arenas. But opposition has mounted 
among some residents to build an arena at Wardlow School. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents believe the arena will add more traffic, noise and vandalism and 
that the site is already inundated with sports activities and recreation and 
day-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Engle, community services deputy director, said placing a stop sign in 
front of the school, posting speed-limit and "caution children at play" signs 
and increasing enforcement to snag speeders are being examined to deal with 
traffic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no opposition to the McCallen Park arena, Engle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Schneider, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club, said the 
club's arena is expected to open by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wardlow School is owned by Fountain Valley School District and a policy 
prohibits roller sports on school grounds. Trustees are tentatively scheduled 
to consider granting a waiver to the policy Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our kids are dying to play, but they can't afford it," said Tanya 
Grimes, Kid Connection executive director. "It would be such a shame to turn us 
down because they don't want kids to skate on district property." 
</P>
<P>
 Engle said the city would like to assist in building up to five hockey arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the fastest growing sport in the United States," he said. "What the 
city wants to accomplish is to take the kids off the street and put them in a 
safe area to play."DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; ADULT BUSINESS RULES WIN TENTATIVE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has toughened two ordinances dealing with adult-related 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week tentatively approved rules that would require future 
topless bars and other adult businesses to be located farther away from homes, 
churches and schools, and also would ban those younger than 18 from tattoo 
parlors unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents protesting a proposed topless bar on Garden Grove Boulevard hailed 
the decisions, but said they are frustrated that there seems no way to stop 
adult businesses from coming to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the changes for final approval next week. However, 
the distance rule would affect only future permit requests, because the 
ordinance cannot be retroactive, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is looking at ways to stay within the law and still be helpful," 
said Gary Soverns, one of the leaders of a group opposing the opening of 
Scamps, a proposed bar that would feature semi-nude female dancers.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, city officials denied a request by the Santa Fe Springs Realty 
Corp. to convert the Marquee nightclub to a topless bar called Scamps. The firm 
appealed the decision to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The case is 
pending, but the court has not stopped the bar owner from renovating the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal District Judge Laughlin E. Waters has scheduled a hearing Jan. 17, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revised ordinance, an adult business would not be allowed within 250 
feet from a school, church, park or school. The distance would be measured from 
lot line to lot line, instead of from building to building.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DISCLOSURE ORDERED ON EL TORO AIRPORT SUIT 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered Lake Forest officials to disclose 
within 48 hours the amount of money the city spent on a lawsuit to remove 
Measure A -- the so-called El Toro airport initiative -- from Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ronald L. Bauer issued the order at a hearing, where attorneys for the 
Yes on Measure A Committee argued that the money paid by the city to the law 
firm of Burke, Williams and Sorenson to pursue the city's lawsuit was in effect 
a campaign contribution intended to influence the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawsuit was rejected by a judge on Aug. 25. The Yes on Measure A 
Committee countersued in October, arguing that municipalities such as Lake 
Forest are required by the state Political Reform Act to file campaign 
disclosure statements to reveal expenditures made in opposition to ballot 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest officials, who did not return phone calls Tuesday, had argued that 
the expenditures were legal fees rather than a political contribution intended 
to influence voters. In authorizing the lawsuit last summer, the City Council 
said the ballot measure is inconsistent with the county's General Plan. The 
initiative calls for a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station when the base closes by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both backers and opponents of Measure A began broadcasting 
political ads this week in a final attempt to sway Orange County voters before 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, a group formed to defeat the initiative, 
is airing radio ads announcing that "Measure A was drafted in secret with only 
one aim; to pick the pockets of Orange County taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport opponents have made much of the fact that the initiative was the 
brainchild of a group of wealthy developers led by Newport Beach resident 
George L. Argyros. Argyros has spent nearly $634,000 in the past two weeks in 
support of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents contend it would cost taxpayers $4 billion to finance the 
construction of an airport at El Toro, even though other estimates put the cost 
at closer to $1 billion, which would be paid through the sale of bonds to 
private investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport supporters are using cable television to deliver their message in a 
30-second ad that promises 52,000 new jobs if an airport is constructed and 
implores voters to "do the right thing" and vote for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents' ad says that an airport "won't cost taxpayers a thing," and 
that "investors, not taxpayers, pay for airports." H.G. REZA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; POLICE INVESTIGATING 2 SIMILAR SHOOTINGS

<P>
 Police are investigating two shootings that occurred one minute apart, on the 
same street, in which suspects asked the victims which gang they belonged to 
before opening fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, however, said the two incidents appear to be unrelated and the 
investigations are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shooting occurred at 9:59 p.m. Monday at Westminster Boulevard and 
Westminster Lane. The victim was a 15-year-old from Huntington Beach who was 
standing with his friends in a bowling alley parking lot when the assailants 
drove up and asked what gang he claimed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he replied, they pulled out a handgun and shot him in the upper body, 
police said. The victim was in stable condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center on Tuesday. After the shooting, the assailants fled northbound on 
Edwards Street in a light blue Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 The second shooting took place one minute later about two miles away in the 
Lucky's supermarket parking lot at Westminster Boulevard and Magnolia Street. 
Two people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, about 18 or 19 years old, asked the victims what gangs they claimed 
and when they did not respond, the men shot the victims with a small-caliber 
handgun, Sgt. Rick McKinney said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lang To, 21, of Westminster was in stable condition at Western Medical Center 
recovering from gunshot wounds to his upper torso, and An Thung, 20, of Garden 
Grove was in stable condition at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center, recovering from gunshot wounds to his legs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen fled southbound on Magnolia in a brown car, which police believe to 
be a lowered Oldsmobile or Cadillac with tinted windows. DEBBIE KONG

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; ENROLLMENT DIPS AT 2 DISTRICT HIGH 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ocean View High and Westminster High show enrollment declines this year, but 
all other high schools in the three-city Huntington Beach Union High School 
District are showing increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment figures for the district were presented last week to the school 
board. The district governs high schools in Huntington Beach, Westminster and 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View High, which is in Huntington Beach, had a 7.83% decrease in 
enrollment compared with September, 1993. Westminster High dropped 4.53% in 
enrollment compared with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, enrollment at the Fountain Valley High increased 2.54%; 
Huntington Beach High increased 2.38%; Marina High in Huntington Beach 
increased 0.8%, and Edison High in Huntington Beach increased 0.16%. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. David Hagen said economic conditions appear to have caused the 
enrollment declines in Ocean View and Westminster high schools. "There are more 
apartments in those two high school attendance areas, and because of general 
economic conditions, fewer people with high school-age children are living in 
those areas," Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said that Ocean View High has been adversely affected by student 
transfers. He said that transfers, however, have not been a significant problem 
for enrollment at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, there are 13,227 students in the high school district this year, 
compared with 13,364 in September, 1993. The 1% total decline this year is the 
lowest in many years, Hagen said. He added that the district expects an 
increase in enrollment in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of high school students in the district has been decreasing since 
the late 1970s. Hagen said a major reason for the decline has been that adults 
who bought homes in the area when their children were young tended to stay 
after the children graduated. But in recent years, families with young children 
have been moving into the three cities. Many of those children will be freshmen 
in high school next year, Hagen said. BILL BILLITER

<P>
 A committee of the Orange County Grand Jury has finished an investigation in 
the practice of city employees inflating retirement pensions and will complete 
its report in two weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done our investigation and we're preparing our response, and at this 
point, we have no intention of any further investigation," said Seth Oberg, 
chairman of the grand jury's Administrative Agencies Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberg also said there are no plans at this time to pursue the matter for 
formal study to be included in the grand jury's final report in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was prompted by a resident's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's six-member committee met last Thursday with City 
Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga and Deputy City Administrator Bob Franz.

 Oberg said they have also contacted an official with the state Public 
Employees' Retirement System to get its side. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial practice known as pension spiking occurs when certain 
benefits are converted to increase final compensation, on which a pension is 
based. The city has reached agreement with employee unions, except for 
firefighters, that ended the practice Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said Monday that the grand jury inquiry was not unexpected since the 
issue in recent months has received so much public attention and outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mello, director of the Citizens Bureau of Investigation, a group that has 
criticized pension spiking, said: "It's about time there's an investigation of 
this pension-spiking scandal because it's costing taxpayers many millions of 
dollars since 1984." DEBRA CANO

 What are residents looking for in the next leader of the Irvine Unified School 
District? That's the question an executive search firm will be asking Irvine 
residents in a series of half-hour interviews that begin today and end at noon 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17,500-student school district is inviting all community members to take 
part.In addition to the half-hour group interviews, a public forum is scheduled 
at 7 p.m. Thursday, at Woodbridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews will be conducted by Management Analysis and Planning 
Associates, a Berkeley-based firm hired to develop a profile of the qualities 
community members want in a new superintendent. The firm also will survey 
community attitudes about the district. 
</P>
<P>
 David E. Brown, hired in 1987 to succeed A. Stanley Corey, spent a final 
morning at his district office Monday. He resigned to become superintendent of 
the Napa Valley Unified School District. Deputy Supt. Dean Waldfogel, one of 
three deputy superintendents in the district, is serving as interim 
superintendent. Waldfogel has said he is not a candidate.  
</P>
<P>
 Interview appointments may be scheduled by calling Donna Wilkerson at (714) 
651-0444, Ext. 201. Comments may be submitted in writing to Harry Weinberg at

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; DAY OF DEAD LESSON IS STEEPED IN TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four-year-old Karla Guadarrama stared wide-eyed at the colorful altar filled 
with pan dulce, calabaza with rice and corn, and skeleton-shaped sugar candy. 
</P>
<P>
 The altar, set up in the Maple Community Center as part of a lesson on the 
traditional Mexican holiday, Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), taught Karla 
and dozens of other children the meaning of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria de la Luz (Lucy Ruiz) Millan, one of about 25 parents of the center's 
mostly Latino preschoolers, erected the exhibit similar to those in the homes 
and at the grave sites of millions of Mexican families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We build altars with flowers and make offrendas (offerings) for our dead," 
she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes an arch made of yellow and orange crepe marigolds, 
special sweet bread, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, candles and other traditional 
items. It is on display in the center where Millan and other parents are 
teaching Dia de Los Muertos is celebrated on Nov. 1 and 2 in remembrance of 
deceased loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see death as the end of life," Millan said. "It may be the end 
physically but not spiritually. We believe that the spirit of our beloved 
deceased is still alive and still with us so, for us, death is a celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 She told dozens of students that the altars contain the favorite foods, 
clothes and toys of the dead so that when their spirits come to earth on Dia de 
los Muertos, they will know where to go. "And we use candles to light the 
path," Millan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dead are alive," said Karla, who listened intently to Millan's 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 George Carrillo, Maple's PTA president, said: "The majority of the students 
here are (Mexican American) and we're just trying to let them know about this 
age-old custom that is so representative of the culture that there's no reason 
to deny it. This is a very important tradition that should be remembered and 
practiced with love." MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; JUDGE BARS PHRASE IN HEADLANDS CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Tuesday ordered backers of a $500-million 
development plan for the Dana Point Headlands to stop using "Save the 
Headlands" and similar phrases in their campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard W. Luesebrink also barred the proponents from using "Save the 
Dana Point Headlands" and "Save Dana Point Headlands" in literature asking 
voters to approve Measure C and Measure D on the Nov. 8 city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures would allow a 400-room hotel and a maximum of 370 homes to be 
built on the 121-acre Headlands promontory near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents organized under a committee called Save the Headlands had 
filed suit arguing that proponents were confusing the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They confused the voters because they knew they couldn't win on the plan's 
merits," said Elinor R. Orlandella, an attorney and member of Save the 
Headlands. "The only way they can win is to confuse people into thinking that 
they can save the Headlands by voting 'yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Headlands Fair Plan Committee, which supports the 
development, said that the judge's order violates First Amendment rights and 
that an appeal will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely dumbfounded," said Jeff Adler, a committee spokesman. "A 
judge is sitting in Santa Ana telling me I can't say the words 'save the 
Headlands.' I think it's my right." 
</P>
<P>
 A "yes" vote on measures C and D will approve the plan as passed by the City 
Council in April. A "no" vote will stop the project, but it could go back 
before the council for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands have been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. and 
Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial 
holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder of Times Mirror Co., 
publisher of the Los Angeles Times. LEN HALL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; BED TAX HIKED TO 15%, THIRD HIGHEST IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave final approval Tuesday to a hotel bed tax increase that 
will help finance a $172.5-million revitalization project around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-0 vote, the council authorized raising the bed tax by 2 percentage 
points, effective July 1.At the new rate of 15%, Anaheim's bed tax will rank 
third highest in the nation, after Columbus, Ohio, and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to reinvest to stay competitive," said Mayor Tom Daly. "One thing is 
clear to me is the area around Disneyland must be revitalized and this bed tax 
will help us do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Bob D. Simpson and Fred Hunter were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, city officials argued during the public hearing, is critical in 
helping to pay for a massive overhaul of 550 acres around Disneyland and the 
Anaheim Convention Center. Federal, state and regional transportation money 
will fund two-thirds of the so-called Anaheim resort plan, and city officials 
say the bed tax revenue will help generate the remaining one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 The beautification program, which has already begun with overhead utility 
lines being buried along major streets, is seen as a vital accompaniment to 
Walt Disney Co.'s $3-billion expansion project. As proposed, the project would 
include 1,800 new hotel rooms, a 5,000-seat amphitheater, landscaped walkways 
and a new theme park next to Disneyland, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed tax, which has risen 63% since 1983, is expected to generate $5 
million in annual revenue. All hotels in Anaheim are affected. MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; TEEN CENTER TO OFFER MUSIC, REFRESHMENTS

<P>
 Local residents have some good news for teen-agers bored with staying home and 
watching movies or driving out of town for fun on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to open a "teen center" on Saturdays from 8 p.m. to midnight that 
would offer refreshments and live music in a coffeehouse atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The free teen parties -- which organizers hope to begin this Saturday -- will 
be held at Shepherd of the Hills Church, 30121 Niguel Road. The center's 
advisory group is still seeking donations of tables, sound and lighting 
equipment and refreshment supplies to get the gatherings started. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need here. There's nothing available in terms of a teen hangout of 
any kind," said the church's pastor, Huw Anwyl. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths between the ages of 12 and 17 are invited to participate. Organizers 
are looking for young local bands that would like to provide the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids have athletics they can be part of, but a lot of kids don't," 
said the Rev. Jack Hennings of Faith Community Episcopal Church, who helped 
organize the Saturday night get-togethers. "I have a teen-ager myself, and I 
realize it's important for there to be a place where they can go. I appreciate 
that they go to the malls and hang out, but that only gives so much to 
developing themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Hennings said that local service groups such as the Rotary Club have pledged 
their support. The events will be chaperoned, and sheriff's deputies have 
promised to patrol the area. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY SEEKING COVETED 'TREE U.S.A.' STATUS 
</P>

<P>
 The city has applied for "Tree U.S.A." status and should hear back from the 
National Arbor Foundation by early December, said David Alkema, superintendent 
of parks and parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkema applied for the designation last spring.The city has more than 20,000 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tree U.S.A. status is a designation that is given out to cities that have 
taken an aggressive approach to either improving or maintaining their urban 
forest," Alkema said. "It's a philosophical standing. It has nothing to do with 
whether you have the most amount of trees in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city applied for the prestigious designation last year but failed 
to meet one of the requirements: holding an Arbor Day celebration in 
conjunction with a tree-planting program. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the city will do just that, with the help of ReLeaf Costa Mesa, 
which recently received $8,500 in tree-planting grants from the California 
Department of Forestry, the Little Garden Club of Newport Beach, the Tree 
Society of Orange County, Job's Daughters-Masonic Order and private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Various trees grow within the city -- Canary Island pines, American sweet 
gums, Australian willows, magnolias and Aristocrat pear trees among them. The 
city also wants to add palm trees along Newport Boulevard, to mirror those 
planted near Triangle Square, Alkema said.  
</P>
<P>
 But the palm trees will be planted only if the city qualifies for a $160,000 
state grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The city tries to preserve as many trees as possible, even when it is forced 
to take them out, Alkema said. Under the parkways improvement program three 
trees must be planted for every one cut down, Alkema said. TOM RAGAN

2 GET EARFUL FOR PROPERTY APPEALS FOUL-UP; REAL ESTATE: COUNTY SUPERVISORS 
QUESTION ASSESSOR AND CLERK ABOUT MISHANDLING OF CASES AND SUGGEST REVAMPING 
PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday grilled the county assessor and clerk of 
the board over the mishandling of more than 200 property assessment appeals and 
suggested that the appeals process be completely revamped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing has to be solved," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton told the two 
department officials. "Let's be blunt. . . . There was a screw-up here 
somewhere. You have to sit down and iron it out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the appeals controversy erupted two weeks ago, the 
supervisors had an opportunity to question both Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs and 
Phyllis A. Henderson, clerk of the board, face-to-face about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, who is an elected official, continued to blame Henderson for allowing 
the appeals to exceed a two-year deadline before being scheduled for hearings. 
Henderson said she has never seen the files on the bungled cases and questioned 
whether Jacobs ever sent them to her office. By state law, residential and 
business property owners who appeal their tax bills must receive a hearing 
before a two-year deadline expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid sharp questioning from both Stanton and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
Jacobs and Henderson acknowledged that they had no formal process of tracking 
the files between the two offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm stunned," Vasquez said. "I think this is a 
serious flaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Orange County's unusual appeals process, taxpayers send their property 
appeals directly to the assessor. After reviewing the applications, the 
assessor transfers the challenges to the assessment appeals board office. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her job as clerk of the Board of Supervisors, Henderson also is 
clerk of the appeals board and responsible for maintaining the appeals files 
and scheduling hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said the county's 17-year-old appeals procedure has become "informal" 
over the years. In response to the recent foul-ups, Henderson said she 
implemented a system in which the files will be logged when they are sent to 
her office and tracked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's appeals process has also come under fire from state officials, 
who say that it is the only county in the state that requires residential and 
business owners to file appeals directly to the assessor instead of the clerk 
of the board.  
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Tuesday that he is still 
investigating the county's practice and intends to make recommendations to the 
board within three weeks to improve the system so assessment appeals will be 
heard before deadlines expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Because 201 appeals expired before being scheduled for a hearing, the county 
assessor is forced to accept the owners' estimated value of the property 
instead of his own. The discrepancy between the assessor's value and the 
property owners' value is about $430 million. According to county officials, 
the mistake may cost the county, schools and other governmental agencies as 
much as $10 million in lost tax revenues over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's board meeting, Jacobs defended his office, but said he wanted to 
get past the issue of blame and focus on preventing the appeals problem from 
occurring again. He said he intends to re-establish the practice informing the 
clerk when deadlines on appeals are approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said he stopped sending those expiration notices in July at the clerk's 
request. Henderson said she made no such request. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs also told that board that 980 appeals will expire within the next three 
months, but said he thought all the cases could be scheduled for hearings 
within that time frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county officials say the problem is partly due to a tremendous backlog of 
appeals that were filed over the past several years, when the state's real 
estate market dropped and many property owners sought to lower their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of their discussion, some supervisors proposed centralizing the 
appeals process, possibly with Henderson, instead of dividing it between the 
two departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's probably the way to go," Supervisor William G. Steiner said 
after the meeting.

MATERIALS FOR MAKING DRUGS SEIZED NEAR HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>

 Three propane tanks containing ingredients for drugs, two of them potentially 
explosive, were seized Tuesday in a house across the street from Valley High 
School, state and local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personnel from the school said kids were hanging out there," said Gary B. 
Hudson, an investigator with the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said that 400 pounds of what police believe was ephedrin, used in 
making methamphetamine, was seized at the house in the 2200 block of West 
Harvard Street. No arrests were made, and Hudson said police thought the 
material produced at the house was taken to laboratories elsewhere to complete 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand for the seizure were Santa Ana hazardous materials and fire units. 
</P>
<P>
 According to fire officials, one of the propane tanks seized was leaking and 
two others were in potentially explosive condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said that if the tanks, which had no valves or regulators, had tipped 
over "they would have exploded and taken the roof off the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the investigation is continuing.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' TAB FOR EMERGENCY CARE: $61 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A total of $61 million in state and federal money was spent last year in 
Orange County on emergency health care for illegal immigrants, according to a 
state report released Tuesday by Gov. Pete Wilson's Health and Welfare 
Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration measure on next 
Tuesday's ballot, specifically excludes emergency health care, the release of 
the report drew criticism from opponents of the initiative who said it was 
intended to inflame anti-illegal immigrant passions one week before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County ranked second highest among California's major urban counties in 
the amount of state and federal funds spent on emergency health care for 
illegal immigrants, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report lists the 10 counties that account for nearly 70% of the $800 
million in government funds used for emergency health care for illegal 
immigrants in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list was Los Angeles County, which last year spent $340.8 
million in emergency health care for illegal immigrants, followed by Orange 
County, which spent $61 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 -- which has been strongly endorsed by Wilson -- would deny 
non-emergency health care, education and other welfare benefits to illegal 
immigrants. Emergency services, which account for the costs highlighted in the 
report, still would be provided if the proposition passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state report also said that another $7.3 million was spent in Orange 
County in 1993 for prenatal health care. The average monthly caseload for 
emergency and prenatal health care in Orange County totaled 26,907 cases, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when the state has been forced to reduce or freeze spending on 
programs for the most vulnerable Californians, it is wrong that we are spending 
hundreds of millions of dollars for illegal immigrants living in 10 California 
counties," said a statement released by Sandra R. Smoley, Wilson's health and 
welfare secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report -- and its release a week before the election -- was criticized 
by John Palacio, the Orange County head of the Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor is using the government agencies to assist him in his political 
campaign to polarize voters about undocumented immigrants," Palacio said. "What 
he's not telling you is that there's no system in place that can correctly 
determine what the costs are in terms of serving undocumented immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 H.D. Palmer, a Wilson campaign spokesman disagreed, saying the report is "not 
a political issue, it's more of a policy issue."

RAMS FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS ON ST. LOUIS DEAL; PRO FOOTBALL: SHAW UPDATES MOVE 
SITUATION, SAYING BALTIMORE AND ANAHEIM ARE NOT OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR TEAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Ram President John Shaw said Tuesday night that St. Louis is being given every 
opportunity to complete a deal to have the Rams play there beginning with the 
1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the ones that we are most aggressively pursuing at this point, 
because we feel we know the limitations of the other two situations," Shaw 
said. "They are the ones who are most capable of immediately giving us what 
we're looking for, which is a facility to play in right away. That's not to say 
we will ever complete a deal with St. Louis; we still have unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying they're the leader, but I'm saying they're in a position where 
a larger amount of our efforts are being spent in seeing how far they can come 
in their deal. I'm optimistic they will do the best they can, and when you make 
wish lists, you don't expect they are all going to be met. That's what a 
negotiation is." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis has asked Shaw for a final decision by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would like to know by Dec. 1 so they could accelerate the completion of 
their stadium," Shaw said. "It could be done as early as Dec. 1, but it's 
possible it won't happen until after the season. It's also possible it will 
never be done." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first extensive update on the Ram situation in several months, Shaw 
addressed a number of issues, including the efforts by Save the Rams, 
Baltimore's insistence on majority ownership, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's 
proposal to build a stadium in Los Angeles and the NFL's stance on the 
prospects of the Rams moving. Shaw also responded to a television report 
suggesting the Rams had to move because of team owner Georgia Frontiere's 
financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league's (line of credit) was at $35 million and was then increased to 
$40 million and I can tell you there are 10 clubs presently at the $40 million 
limit," Shaw said. "We were roughly at $24 million coming into this season, and 
we anticipate losing $6 or $7 million this year, so we will probably be around 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that if we continue to operate at a $6 (million) to $7 million 
deficit that we would at some point in the next few years reach the league debt 
limit. Nobody likes to lose money, and if we're to be competitive, we have to 
be profitable. That situation is really not unique to the Rams, but we 
obviously have to cut our losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue suggested recently that the league might be willing to build a 
stadium in the Los Angeles area, but Shaw said "that's four or five years 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bowlen, Denver's owner, said such a proposal was too late in coming for 
the Rams, and he said he won't be surprised if Al Davis signs a one-year deal 
for the Raiders to use Anaheim Stadium to improve his situation in Los Angeles 
if the Rams leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Angelos, Baltimore Orioles' majority owner, has advised Shaw that he 
will be in Los Angeles Friday with his checkbook to aggressively pursue the 
team, but Angelos' demand to acquire majority ownership and the political 
uncertainty surrounding Baltimore's pledge to build a stadium has allowed St. 
Louis to gain the Rams' undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect Angelos to be aggressive," Shaw said. "The governor's term is up at 
the end of the year and he would like to get a deal done before the governor 
leaves office. I'm sensitive to that demand, and if we did a deal with 
Baltimore, we would do it before the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer has put away a $160-million bond for the 
construction of a stadium, but once Schaefer leaves office there is no 
guarantee how that money will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you go to a temporary facility?" Shaw said. "There have been situations in 
this league where people have gone into temporary facilities and have not 
gotten a new facility built. It looks like the bonding is in place, but there's 
always a risk and that's why we're playing out the St. Louis situation. That 
risk has been eliminated in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has insisted on obtaining the majority ownership in the team at some 
point. However, Frontiere has been adamant in maintaining controlling interest. 
Shaw said if Angelos changes his stance, then Baltimore will be measured 
equally with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore has made its pitch for the Rams and St. Louis is now getting its 
chance. But what about Save the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there is a sense of frustration with Save The Rams that we haven't 
said this is what it takes," Shaw said, "but that isn't how the whole process 
began. They began talk with a new facility, couldn't do it financially and got 
off that. Our history of negotiations with the city of Anaheim has been such 
that I have never asked the city for anything. I felt the city made it clear to 
us a number of years ago that if we ever left, they would be able to get 
another club. That was the reason they gave us the buyout clause. I've been 
cautious about not asking anything from Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything Save The Rams can do presently to improve its hopes of 
keeping the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very good question," Shaw said. "I don't know how aggressive they 
can be. I feel they (Anaheim) misassesed four years ago the competitiveness of 
keeping franchises or what other cities were doing to attract franchises. That 
misassessment really put them at a competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we stay in Anaheim it's not going to be because that facility is better 
than the other two facilities we're looking at, because it clearly wouldn't be. 
There are other issues besides profitability; there are a number of emotional 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who was attending the NFL owners' meetings here, expects a legal fight 
if the team moves, although he said he will follow league guidelines if such a 
decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would obviously like to do a move that would be acceptable to ownership," 
Shaw said. "I've read a number of quotes from owners where they have already 
prejudged the move and said they would vote against it. I don't see how they 
really could make those statements without knowing exactly where we are going 
to move and how it impacts the league."

CONTINENTAL MAY MOVE 1,400 JOBS FROM LAX; AIRLINES: THE SHIFT OF JET 
MAINTENANCE WORK WOULD INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND TRIM COSTS, A SPOKESMAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continental Airlines is mulling whether to move most of its jet maintenance 
now done by 1,400 workers at Los Angeles International Airport to the carrier's 
facilities in Florida or other states, a Continental spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing final has been decided, but Continental's recent opening of a new 
maintenance base in Orlando, Fla., "will have consequences for LAX" operations, 
said spokesman David Messing at the airline's Houston headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of the LAX work is being considered as a way for Continental -- 
which emerged from its second reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in April, 
1993 -- to increase its efficiency and reduce costs, Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the work is shifted, it would further reduce what once was Continental's 
significant presence in Los Angeles. The city formerly was Continental's home 
before the carrier moved to Texas in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline by passengers flown, employs 
3,300 at LAX, including terminal agents and pilots and flight attendants that 
are based at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft-maintenance work is performed at a 60-acre hangar facility at the 
west end of LAX behind the international terminal, on property leased from the 
city's Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Messing said the "higher costs of doing business" in California relative 
to many other states "are not the driving force" behind the possible move. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Continental during the past year has substantially increased its 
presence in the eastern United States with its fledgling low-fare service 
called Continental Lite, or CALite. The airline thus is looking to shift its 
maintenance work closer to the majority of routes it serves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental wants "to have our maintenance support conveniently located to 
where our airplanes are flying," Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the threat of Continental's departure comes only three weeks after 
airport officials and Delta Air Lines worked out a plan to keep Delta from 
closing its LAX operations, where about 900 employees are involved in 
reservations and other customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 A key issue in Delta's case was that Delta, which is undergoing a massive 
cost-cutting effort, faced the prospect of a rent increase at LAX. Delta 
decided to stay after the parties agreed to try to sublease some of Delta's 
space and effectively cut Delta's rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Department of Airports vehemently denied that rent is a factor in 
Continental's possible cutbacks at LAX, even though Continental currently is in 
negotiations with the city on how much, if any, its rent would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got nothing to do with our rates and charges," said Philip Depoian, 
deputy executive director of the Department of Airports. "We've been told . . . 
this is a strategic corporate decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Continental serves LAX, Orange County and San Diego, much of the 
carrier's recent emphasis has been on CALite, which is trying to garner market 
share in short-haul Eastern markets from rivals USAir and Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But in announcing only a modest third-quarter profit last week, Continental 
conceded that CALite has yet to break even. And on the same day, CALite's main 
backer, Robert R. Ferguson III, resigned as Continental's chief executive amid 
reports he was forced to leave because of the airline's displeasure with its 
results.

U.S. INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT SURGES DURING OCTOBER; ECONOMY: PURCHASING MANAGERS 
REPORT IS BETTER THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED. STOCKS AND BONDS TAKE A HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. manufacturing sector and overall economy surged during October, a 
widely followed survey showed Tuesday, sparking renewed inflation fears that 
fueled a broad decline in stocks and a sharp increase in long-term bond 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.75 points and the 30-year Treasury 
bond yield surged to 8.06% from Monday's 7.97% following the release of the 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management report saying that U.S. manufacturing 
expanded in October for the 14th consecutive month, to the best level in nearly 
seven years. But prices also rose, bottlenecks grew and shortages surfaced for 
supplies ranging from wood chips to truck axles, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly appraisal of American industrial health was stronger than many 
economists had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 It reinforced their view that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest 
rates later this month for the sixth time this year, in order to slow the 
economy's growth by making borrowing costs more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the report would show little change and might drift back down," 
said Michael Moran, chief economist for Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New 
York. "I think it's signaling that the manufacturing sector is expanding from 
what already was a brisk rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, based on a survey of purchasing executives at more than 300 
companies nationwide, is among the most widely followed non-governmental 
assessments of the economy because it offers some of the freshest evidence on 
how manufacturers are faring. 
</P>
<P>
 An index based on survey results rose to 59.7% in October from 58.2% the 
previous month. It was the highest level in the index since a 61.0% reading in 
December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 When the index exceeds 50%, it indicates a manufacturing expansion. 
Conversely, when the index falls below 50%, it indicates a manufacturing 
slowdown. This was the 14th straight month the index has exceeded 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the purchasing group's business survey committee, 
said the October report reflects high demand for a wide range of products from 
the nation's factories. 
</P>
<P>
 The production component of the survey showed the strongest performance since 
December, 1987, with surging output of leather, apparel, paper, transportation 
equipment, furniture, plastics, rubber and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kauffman also acknowledged some troubling elements in the report. Seventy 
percent of purchasing managers surveyed reported paying higher prices in 
October, matching a level last seen in April, 1988. For the second straight 
month, 19 of 20 industries reported higher prices in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further vexing sign of inflation, the number of managers reporting slower 
supply deliveries rose for the 15th straight month. The resulting bottlenecks 
could force prices up if factories must scramble to urgently procure supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kauffman, who is procurement manager at Oryx Energy Co., said, "Our 
members are saying they're having a hard time passing through the price 
increases" to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of competition on the sales end of their business," he said, 
noting that modest increases in the government's producer price index are 
evidence that manufacturers are absorbing higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, more dated, sign of economic strength, the Commerce Department 
reported that construction spending surged 1.6% in September, the biggest gain 
in six months, as private building staged a sharp turnaround. The report 
suggests that home buyers and home builders haven't been significantly 
discouraged by the rise in interest rates. Purchasing Index 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers index tracks business activity at more than 300 
industrial companies A reading above 50% indicates a manufacturing expansion.

THE CUTTING EDGE; THE DIGITAL SOAPBOX; CANDIDATES AND GROUPS GO ON LINE TO GET 
MESSAGE OUT

 When Zeb Rice's mother, Kathleen Brown, decided to run for governor, the 
23-year-old college student wrote a memo to the campaign explaining why it 
needed an Internet account. Cheap propaganda outlet. Direct access. Hip, 
future-looking image. The student vote.  
</P>
<P>
 It sounded good, but nobody could figure out what he was talking about. So he 
ended up doing it himself, "telnet-ing" into campaign headquarters from school 
in Maine, and later coming to Los Angeles to answer e-mail -- a task he finds 
far preferable to dealing with "snail mail" or the phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's early on-line excursions -- her economic plan, the texts of her 
speeches and her bumper sticker are all accessible from her site on the Net -- 
helped shape what has become California's first election year in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trend that political activists say could vastly increase the amount of 
information available to voters and even democratize its distribution, dozens 
of candidates and nonprofit political organizations across the country have set 
up podiums on the electronic frontier over the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton and George Bush may have made brief appearances on commercial 
on-line services two years ago -- and Ross Perot used electronic bulletin 
boards to get his message out -- but this year's political offerings are far 
more extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 True-believing on-line activists see in the electronic revolution the 
potential to transform the very nature of political debate. They like to point 
out that the form of communication provided by the medium is "many to many," as 
opposed to the telephone's "point to point" or the "point to many" of mass 
media such as radio, television and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previous technologies kept power in the hands of the candidates," says Mark 
Bonchek, a graduate student at Harvard University who is writing his 
dissertation on how interactive media can be used to facilitate political 
participation. "In this context, you put all the information on line, and 
people get to browse and choose what they want to see. That's a shift in power 
as measured by control of information away from the campaign and toward the 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 California, home to Silicon Valley and an estimated 1 million Internet users, 
is at the forefront of the on-line electoral activity. Last week, the 
California secretary of state's office said it has teamed up with Digital 
Equipment Corp. to provide the first real-time election returns on the World 
Wide Web, a portion of the Internet that can display pictures and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The full text of the California ballot pamphlet, which the state spends about 
$5 million printing and sending out to voters, is stored on the DEC computer, 
along with additional information on each candidate. Acting Secretary of State 
Tony Miller said 21,000 computer users logged on to the site last week in one 
day alone.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 prospective voters have logged on to the nonprofit California 
Voter Foundation's Online Voter Guide, which offers candidate information on 
each of the nine statewide races, job descriptions of statewide offices and 
California Journal magazine reviews of propositions 181 through 188. It cost 
$20,000 -- half supplied by Pacific Bell -- to put thousands of pages of 
information on line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be the beginning of a revolution in the way campaigns are 
conducted," says Kim Alexander of the California Voter Foundation. "California 
has 14 million registered voters. To get a message out to voters, you have to 
raise a huge amount of money to use the mediums candidates traditionally use. 
My thought was, let's come up with an alternate way for candidates to 
disseminate information." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Senate candidate Dianne Feinstein as well as Libertarians Richard Boddie 
and Richard Rider each have a presence on the Internet, and e-mail can be sent 
to Gov. Pete Wilson at petewilson@delphi.com. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, only a small fraction of California's voters now have access to 
commercial on-line services such as Prodigy or the global network of computers 
known as the Internet. And those who do tend to be college students -- most of 
whom are provided with free Internet accounts -- or from high-income brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 And not all candidates are enamored with the Internet. Senate candidate 
Michael Huffington spent millions of his personal fortune on his campaign but 
has no significant presence on line. Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur said the 
governor felt an e-mail address was enough: "We've generally found that if 
people are interested in specific information they'll ask for it, and then 
we're happy to provide it by the regular means." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But with the number of personal computers in homes expected to double over the 
next three years, the importance of on-line political activity can only grow. 
Political debate has traditionally been a mainstay of the techie set that has 
until recently dominated the on-line world. 
</P>
<P>
 Political forums on the Internet include "alt.radical-left," 
"alt.revolution.counter," "alt.rush-limbaugh" and "alt.politics.correct." 
Libertarians and the Net's own political creation, "cypherpunks," are hard to 
miss. Organizations on the far left and right ends of the political spectrum 
that are largely cut out of the mainstream media have found the on-line world a 
fertile recruiting ground and an inexpensive way to get their message out. 
</P>
<P>
 During the genesis of the Zapatista rebellion in Mexico, for example, 
communiques from the group's leaders were quickly disseminated by anarchist and 
other leftist groups via the Internet. And the Simon Wiesenthal Center is 
conducting a study on the increasing activity by white supremacist hate groups 
on the Internet.

 But as more Americans gain access, mainstream politics may come to dominate 
the on-line world as well.

<P>
 At the Brown campaign, Rice sticks to the "ca.politics" forum, where debates 
rage on everything from immigration to "Why do we have such repulsive 
candidates?" He judges the impact of his mother's on-line efforts as "mostly 
symbolic," but he looks forward to the day when all voters are on line.

 "Snail mail is a nightmare. We get all these letters -- it's an incredibly 
complex process which requires tons and tons of steps. It's expensive -- you 
have to print out the paper, she has to sign them, read them, categorize them. 
We wish everyone would communicate via e-mail with us. It's infinitely easier." 
Political Technology, High and Low 
</P>
<P>
 Politics are on the information highway this election, with candidates putting 
up pages on the Internet and on-line services such as America Online and 
Prodigy offering special election sections. Even President Clinton has an 
e-mail address. But politicians have always jumped on new technology. Some 
highlights from history: * The printed ballot: This modern convenience was 
first authorized by Pennsylvania in 1799. Voters delivered their "vest pocket 
ticket," which was printed by a political party and bore only the name of its 
candidate. * Negative advertising: Muckraking is said to have started with 
Thomas Jefferson, but organized efforts at character assassination began in 
1828, when Andrew Jackson ran against John Quincy Adams. Among other things, 
"coffin handbills" accused Jackson of murdering six soldiers in the War of 
1812. * The electric vote recorder: Patented by Thomas Edison in 1869, this 
device was first used by a legislative body on Jan. 11, 1917, in the Wisconsin 
Assembly Chamber. * The radio campaign: By the early 1900s, presidential 
candidates had come to rely on crisscrossing the country by train. But in 1932, 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was very unpopular with the newspapers, boosted his 
cause substantially with radio and later mastered the medium with his "Fireside 
Chats." * The rise of television: John F. Kennedy, in 1960, was the first 
presidential candidate truly at home with the medium. He clinched the election 
by looking better than Richard M. Nixon in a televised debate. * The electronic 
voting machine: On Nov. 3, 1964, the Coleman Vote Tally System counted 600 
ballots a minute in Hamilton County, Ohio, and in Orange and Contra Costa 
counties in California. Sources: The Economist; Smithsonian Institution; Famous

POLICYHOLDERS' COMPLAINTS FALL IN STATE IN 1993; INSURANCE: THE BIGGEST DROP 
WAS IN AUTO COVERAGE. GARAMENDI SAYS THE SURVEY ITSELF AND REGULATION ARE 
RESPONSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Policyholders' complaints against insurance companies fell significantly last 
year, according to the California Department of Insurance's annual consumer 
complaint survey released Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest drop was with auto insurance providers, where justified complaints 
dropped from 2,801 in 1992 to 1,564 last year among the state's 50 largest 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Indemnity Co. was ranked as having the highest ratio of complaints among 
automobile insurance providers, while American Bankers Insurance of Florida was 
ranked as having the highest among homeowners insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio-based United Services Automobile Assn. ranked the best among auto 
insurers, while Vigilant Insurance, Pennsylvania General Insurance, Insurance 
of North America and Assurance Co. of America ranked at the top of homeowner 
insurers, with no justified complaints reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Most complaints involve insurance companies that do not pay claims in a timely 
manner, arbitrary contract cancellations, disputes on amounts owed, surprise 
rate increases and misrepresentation of the type of coverage purchased, 
department spokeswoman Candysse Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 A justified complaint involves a violation of insurance laws or one in which 
the consumer could not get the insurer to respond to the claim or questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said the widely publicized annual 
report, along with new regulations, have prompted insurers to clean up their 
act.  
</P>
<P>
 "After four years of reporting the good, bad and ugly of California insurance, 
we are finally hearing fewer consumer horror stories," Garamendi said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But some insurers suggest that the decline in complaints has more to do with 
the fact that the department will have to start providing companies with 
details of its complaints next year in accordance with a bill recently signed 
by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of complaints this year is getting closer to reality," said John 
Millen, director of media relations for Farmers Insurance Group, parent of 
Farmers Insurance Exchange and Fire Insurance Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason why our company should have been labeled the way it was for 
the last couple of years," Millen said. Farmers Insurance Exchange had been 
ranked the worst homeowners insurer for three years in a row but climbed 17 
slots in the latest survey. "If we agreed with (Garamendi's) premise that it is 
his pressure that makes our companies work better for their customers, we would 
have done that years ago. I think the change is coming from the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurance companies also disagree with the way the Insurance Department 
determines if a complaint is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have a tough time accepting their definition of a justifiable 
complaint," said Steve Toth, vice president of Ohio Indemnity Co., which was 
ranked the worst auto insurer in the latest survey. "We respond to every single 
question (from customers). The department does not even notify us about these 
so-called complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 That criticism was echoed by Bruce Camacho, vice president of investor 
relations at American Bankers Insurance of Florida, which was ranked the worst 
homeowners insurer. He said the company had no statistics demonstrating 
specific problems in California and had recently been audited by the California 
Insurance Department with no negative comments. California Insurance Complaints 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Department's annual consumer complaint survey ranked auto and 
homeowners insurance companies based on the number of complaints that were 
ruled justified in 1993. Companies were ranked according to the ratio of 
justified companies per 100,000 policies. For instance, a complaint ratio of 
169.9 means that for every 100,000 policies, there were 169.9 justified 
complaints in 1993.

 Discount Tire Parent Makes Offer for Rival: AKH Co. of Anaheim said it has 
made an offer for Big O tires, a consolidation that would create a chain with 
500 outlets across the West and Midwest.The offering price was not disclosed. 
Big O officials said they don't know enough yet about the suitor to comment on 
the offer. In particular, they said, they want to know more about AKH's 
financial condition, which the privately held company so far has declined to 
disclose. The offer was the latest development since Big O's directors decided 
in June to seek bids.

 Hughes and IBM Plan Joint Venture for Satellite Software Delivery: The 
aerospace company and the computer firm said they plan to use Hughes' DirectTV 
satellite system to deliver computer programs directly to retail stores 
beginning sometime next year.Customers will be able to scan hundreds of 
programs via a touch screen and have their choices beamed to a local store by 
satellite, cutting down on inventory while expanding selection. The system 
could also be used to update software for corporate customers. But Hughes and 
IBM have not yet signed up any retailers or software vendors.

 Time Running Out on Glass Trade Pact, U.S. Warns Japan: Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor warned Japanese officials that they have only "a limited period" 
in which to strike a deal on glass, and Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto told the White House not to hold its breath awaiting new terms on 
automobiles, indicating that he is in no hurry to restart the stalled talks. In 
the partial transpacific pact adopted one month ago, the two sides pledged to 
come up with an agreement on glass by Oct. 31, but marathon discussions in 
Tokyo were fruitless. The United States takes the position that Japan operates 
its vast glass-pane industry as a cartel.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STRONG GROWTH, INFLATION FEARS HAMMER STOCKS 
</P>

<P>
 Blue-chip stocks closed sharply lower for the second straight session Tuesday, 
while bond yields surged back above the 8% level as new signs of inflation 
rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil prices rallied to the highest levels in three months as traders 
worried that new rules governing oil tanker owners might crimp crude supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average tumbled 44.75 points to 3,863.37, extending a 
22.54-point slide Monday that more than erased its 55-point gain on Friday. The 
broader market also fell sharply, with declining issues outnumbering advances 
by about 13 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the yield on the bellwether 30-year 
issue shot up to 8.06%, to the 2 1/2-year high reached last week, from 7.97% on 
Monday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, plunged 7/8 point, or 
$8.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Roiling the markets was the National Assn. of Purchasing Management's 
announcement that its index of economic activity rose sharply. Further fueling 
inflation fears, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending in 
September posted the biggest gain in six months, as private building staged a 
sharp turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of weeks ago, people thought inflation had died. It was just taking 
a nap," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report spooked the market," said Bill Allyn, managing director at 
Jefferies & Co. "They worry that sooner or later investors will see that bonds 
are too attractive and will jump out of stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Canelo said the data virtually eliminated any chance that the Fed will hold 
off raising interest rates at a Nov. 15 meeting of the policy-setting Federal 
Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the experts said, the question is how much more tightening will be needed 
to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question really is not what they do on the 15th, but how much they do on 
the 15th, and more importantly, is it having an effect on slowing the economic 
momentum," said Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency markets, the dollar tumbled to touch an all-time low against 
the Japanese yen and fell against other currencies following the release of the 
manufacturing report. In New York, the dollar traded as low as 96.50 Japanese 
yen, matching its all-time intra-day low set Oct. 25. It closed at 96.65 yen, 
down from 96.85 on Monday. That was still an all-time closing low in New York. 
The greenback fell to 1.496 German marks, down from 1.504. 
</P>
<P>
 December crude jumped 49 cents to $18.68 a barrel amid concerns that tanker 
availability and refiners' accessibility to crude oil supplies will be 
pressured by new U.S. rules taking effect at the end of the year. The rules 
require tanker owners to prove their ability to compensate pollution victims in 
the event of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also fell abroad. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average lost 73.12 points to 
end at 19,916.48. In Frankfurt, the DAX average closed at 2,069.73, off 1.90 
points, while London's FTSE 100 average closed 1.1 points down at 3,096.3. 
Mexico's market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader market indexes, the NYSE's composite index fell 1.95 points to 
256.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.93 points to 468.42. 
The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 5.30 points to 
772.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume came to 314.95 million shares, up from 302.82 million on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Biogen fell 9 to 40 on news that it will not seek marketing approval for its 
Hirulog anti-clotting drug. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential Securities downgraded five major oil stocks, saying the shares 
were overvalued after a recent rally. Among them, Mobil dropped 2 1/8 to 83, 
Atlantic Richfield fell 1 1/4 to 107 1/8 and Texaco fell 1 3/8 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell rose 1 1/2 to 20 in heavy trading on rumors of a possible takeover of 
Novell by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow Chemical dropped 3 3/4 to 69 3/4 due to an unfavorable Texas court 
ruling on silicone-gel breast implants and general stock market weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Filter gained 1 1/2 to 21 3/4 after posting strong quarterly earnings. 
Alex. Brown upgraded the stock to "strong buy" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors fell 3/4 to 38 3/4 following negative comments in the Wall 
Street Journal about the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bergen Brunswig gained 1 3/8 to 17 7/8 a day after the distributor of 
products sold by pharmacies reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 43 cents 
a share, compared to 21 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris fell 3/4 to 60 1/2 two days after a Florida state court judge 
certified a class-action lawsuit against cigarette makers that broadly 
encompasses all smokers who allegedly became addicted to nicotine and 
contracted illnesses.

U.S. WANTS AIRLINE RULES EASED GLOBALLY; TRANSPORTATION: REVISED REGULATIONS 
WOULD ALLOW CARRIERS TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL HUB-AND-SPOKE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In the first major attempt to change international aviation policy since the 
late 1970s, the Clinton Administration announced plans Tuesday to begin talks 
with nine European nations in an effort to remove obstacles to development of a 
truly global air transport system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena announced an agreement 
between the United States, Canada and Australia that will ban smoking on 
flights operated by their airlines among the three countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the talks, as outlined by Pena, is to allow commercial airlines to 
establish international "hub-and-spoke" systems much like those adopted by many 
U.S. carriers after the industry was deregulated. It would allow U.S. carriers 
to use these destinations as stopping points to other cities worldwide, a 
practice currently discouraged in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting current barriers would allow U.S. airlines to offer more competitive 
prices, fly to more cities and increase the frequency of flights, according to 
a report released on the policy aims. The Administration did not release the 
names of the nine countries but included are nations within and outside of the 
European Union, said Patrick Murphy, acting assistant secretary for aviation 
and international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taken together, the accords we seek with this group of European partners will 
provide important benefits for travelers, cities, airlines and their employees, 
both in the U.S. and in Europe," Pena said Tuesday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that some countries might be hesitant to swiftly relax 
restrictions on U.S. air traffic, the policy statement allows for transitional 
agreements that would ultimately result in completely open airline markets. It 
would also consider agreements that would eliminate restrictions in several 
exclusive areas, such as air cargo or charter services. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of progress can be made incrementally," said Stephen Kaplan, general 
counsel for the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries that refuse to participate in the effort, however, may face a less 
flexible United States. The report suggests limiting access to the U.S. market 
for those countries' airlines and restricting the airlines' commercial 
relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also intends to encourage other countries to turn over 
state-owned airlines to private owners. The policy statement also warns 
countries that protect their airlines from competitive pressures that they will 
be left behind in the expanding global economy, depriving consumers of greater 
cost efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cites intentions to make air trade agreements with other countries 
as well, including those in Asia, South America and Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it says, the Administration wishes to further free up air trade 
with Canada and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking ban, which is part of Pena's goal of making all American public 
travel smoke-free, will affect nonstop flights and will become effective in 
early March. Pena said that the agreement is part of a U.S.-supported effort by 
the International Civil Aviation Organization to ban smoking on international 
flights by July 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban applies to flights operated for paying passengers, not flights 
chartered by a person, company or organization.

PEOPLE; TIMES MIRROR APPOINTS NEW PUBLISHER AT NEWSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times Mirror Co. on Tuesday announced the resignation of Robert M. Johnson as 
publisher, president and chief executive of Long Island-based Newsday, citing 
"differences in business philosophy" between Johnson and senior management of 
Times Mirror, the parent of Newsday and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 49, is succeeded by Raymond A. Jansen, 55, publisher and chief 
executive since 1990 of the Hartford Courant, another Times Mirror paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven L. Isenberg, currently deputy publisher of Newsday/New York Newsday, 
has been promoted to assume the additional responsibilities of publisher of New 
York Newsday, Times Mirror said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael E. Waller, editor and vice president of the Hartford Courant since 
1990, has been named publisher and chief executive there. Waller joined the 
newspaper in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fortunate to have someone with Ray Jansen's experience and leadership 
ability to succeed Bob at Newsday and are equally pleased that Mike Waller, who 
has functioned splendidly as editor of the Courant, will succeed Ray as 
publisher," Donald F. Wright, senior vice president for Times Mirror's Eastern 
newspapers, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, a Long Island native, worked 22 years at Newsday in advertising and 
sales management before moving to the Courant in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen said in an interview Tuesday night from his office in Hartford, Conn., 
that Times Mirror would "absolutely not" retreat from its support of New York 
Newsday, which since its 1985 founding has been engaged in a struggle against 
entrenched competition in New York City. Backing away from New York "is not 
even open for discussion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure in Hartford, Jansen "reduced operating costs significantly 
during an economic downturn, without layoffs, and the Courant won its first 
Pulitzer Prize," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. A Newsday spokeswoman 
said that a confidentiality agreement between him and Times Mirror would bar 
his discussing the circumstances of his departure.

 * Warner Bros. Records officially named Danny Goldberg to replace Mo Ostin as 
its chairman and chief executive, effective Jan. 1, with Val Azzoli assuming 
Goldberg's former job as president of Atlantic Records. The moves are part of 
an ongoing shake-up at Time Warner's music operations. Ostin's deputy Lenny 
Waronker was originally designated to be the next chairman but last week turned 
down the job. (A Q & A with Goldberg appears in today's Calendar section.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Edward S. Contant, a former managing director of the Los Angeles office of 
the Marsh & McLennan insurance brokerage, has relocated to New York to become 
executive vice president of North American retail operations for Minet Group, 
the huge London-based international insurance and reinsurance brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exxon Corp. announced the appointment of Ansel L. Condray as president of 
its Exxon Co. U.S.A. division effective Jan. 1. Condray, currently executive 
vice president of that company, succeeds Harry J. Longwell, who was appointed 
senior vice president of Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Condray is also expected to be elected a vice president of the parent company. 
Exxon U.S.A. is responsible for Irving, Tex.-based Exxon's oil and gas 
operations, other than exploration, in the United States.

SCHOOLS REACH $200-MILLION ASBESTOS DEAL; LIABILITY: THE CASE WAS ONE OF THE 
LARGEST IN THE U.S. INVOLVING THE INSULATION MATERIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 An asbestos property damage settlement totaling more than $200 million has 
been reached in lawsuits affecting thousands of school districts across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 companies involved in the settlement announced Tuesday included some of 
the most prominent manufacturers in the country, ranging from construction 
materials leaders such as U.S. Gypsum Co. and Georgia Pacific Corp. to chemical 
conglomerates W.R. Grace Co. and Union Carbide Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David Berger, the lead lawyer in the case, said his firm is 
continuing negotiations with other firms who haven't yet settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The class action, one of the biggest and most complex among the asbestos civil 
cases still before the federal courts, was filed in 1983 against more than 50 
companies on behalf of more than 30,000 school districts seeking reimbursement 
for the cost of removing asbestos from school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos, a fiber-like insulation material, causes cancer and respiratory 
diseases. It was once widely used in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge James Giles, who is 
handling the case, and the plaintiffs in the class action. 
</P>
<P>
 Other asbestos property damage cases still pending, besides the school case, 
involve colleges and universities, government buildings and commercial 
buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 Berger called the settlement "an important step toward ultimate resolution of 
the school asbestos litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it wasn't clear how far the settlement money would go in compensating 
the schools for the costs of ridding buildings of asbestos, which is an 
enormously expensive process. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen Gregory, deputy general counsel for the National School Boards Assn., 
which wasn't directly involved in the case, said, "We were hoping the school 
districts would obtain a settlement that would give them sufficient funds to 
make the necessary repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Gypsum also announced a separate settlement involving 333 school 
districts in Michigan that had elected to sue separately. That case too is now 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
 USG indicated both agreements would cost the firm $30 million in cash and $50 
million in discount coupons that the school districts can use to purchase U.S. 
Gypsum plaster products.

BIDDERS FOR FCC WIRELESS AUCTION NAMED; TELECOM: AS FIRMS RACE TO WIN LICENSES 
FOR ADVANCED MOBILE SERVICES, SOME WARN THAT THERE ARE STILL 'MULTIPLE 
HURDLES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators Tuesday disclosed the names of the 74 firms seeking to bid 
on lucrative licenses to provide advanced mobile phone services. But a key 
industry group has told regulators they must eliminate "multiple hurdles" 
before the technology is available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred by fears of unfair competition and concerns that local zoning 
officials could delay construction of wireless transmission towers, many of 
telecommunications' biggest names met the Federal Communications Commission's 
deadline to register for a Dec. 5 auction of wireless licenses for so-called 
broad-band personal communications services, or PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants included all of the Baby Bell telephone companies, the General 
Motors Corp. subsidiary Electronic Data Systems Corp., long-distance carrier 
AT&T Corp., cellular telephone mogul Craig O. McCaw, and cable operators 
Continental Cablevision, Cox Cable Communications and Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of lesser-knowns, such as Solana Beach, Calif., parking lot operator 
Excelsior Parking Corp. and a partnership headed by black attorneys Curtis 
White and Thomas Hart Jr., threw their hats in the PCS ring as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The auctions are aimed at launching a new generation of go-anywhere wireless 
devices that will enable people to send and receive phone calls, computer data 
and perhaps even video through portable devices as small as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of licenses will be bid in each of 51 regional markets, except New 
York, Los Angeles and Washington. Only one license will be auctioned in those 
three cities because the FCC has already awarded the second license under a 
program designed to recognize technical innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an average of 27 bidders for each license. The most, 34, seek to 
provide service to American Samoa, said Regina Keeney, head of the FCC's 
wireless telecommunications bureau. Southern California attracted the fewest 
contestants -- just 20 firms, including GTE and McCaw's new company, ALAACR 
Communications. McCaw, who recently sold his cellular empire to AT&T, is now 
poised to build a new mobile phone business. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyant FCC officials said the number of applicants for the auction is in line 
with the number that applied in each of three previous auctions for wireless 
paging services. Those auctions began last summer and have attracted about $1 
billion in bids. FCC officials said they have similarly high expectations for 
the December event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Estimates are (that) the winning bidder will invest as much as $30 billion to 
$50 billion dollars, in addition to their bids, to build the competing wireless 
networks," said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the FCC. "This investment will add 
an additional 300,000 . . . jobs in the wireless industry and may contribute as 
many as 700,000" related jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter sent to Hundt last week, Thomas E. Wheeler, president of the 
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn., expressed concern about zoning 
rules and said wireless operators could be at a competitive disadvantage 
because Bellcore, the research arm of the Baby Bells, controls the assignment 
of telephone numbers.

 Gas Co. Parent Reports Earnings Decline: Pacific Enterprises had a 
third-quarter profit of $42 million, or 47 cents a common-stock share, compared 
to $54 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.This amounts to a decline 
in earnings even if a one-time, $8-million consolidated tax benefit in the 1993 
third quarter is factored out. Willis B. Wood Jr., Pacific Enterprises chairman 
and chief executive, blamed the lower return on equity allowed in 1994 by the 
California Public Utilities Commission on Southern California Gas Co., its 
principal subsidiary.

 U.S. Savings Bond Interest Rate Rises: The rate for the next six months will 
be 5.92%, up from 4.7%.The figure, adjusted twice a year for market conditions, 
will be in effect through April 30 for Series EE bonds, the Treasury Department 
said. Bonds purchased since Nov. 1, 1982, and held at least five years earn 
either the average of semiannual rates during the holding period or the minimum 
rate in effect at the time they were purchased, whichever is higher. Bonds 
issued since March, 1993, have a minimum rate of 4%.

 Let Courts Decide on Pickups, GM Asks: The auto maker asked the Transportation 
Department to cancel a planned public meeting on the safety record of its 
full-size trucks and have the matter settled by the courts.General Motors Corp. 
Senior Vice President Thomas Gottschalk made the request in a letter to Stephen 
Kaplan, the department's general counsel. The company estimates there are 6 
million trucks with so-called side-saddle fuel tanks still on the road. Critics 
say the tanks are likely to explode in side-impact crashes. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena has said the 1973-87 model trucks pose an "unreasonable 
risk" to drivers and passengers. He scheduled a public meeting for Dec. 6 to 
discuss whether the pickups should be recalled.

SONY, MTV SIGN MUSIC VIDEO LICENSING PACT; ENTERTAINMENT: DEAL GIVES NETWORK 
RIGHT TO AIR WORK BY SONY ARTISTS, RAISES QUESTIONS ON RIVAL-CHANNEL PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sony Music Entertainment Inc. said Tuesday that it signed a contract giving 
MTV Network worldwide rights to air the music videos of Sony's recording 
artists. News of the deal raised doubts about Sony's participation with other 
recording companies in a proposed rival music channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's announcement read like something of a peace treaty between Sony and 
MTV. Thomas D. Mottola, Sony's music chief, hailed the first global music video 
licensing agreement with MTV as "one example of the strong spirit of 
cooperation existing between our two companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side would elaborate on the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for an MTV rival involving Sony, Time Warner, PolyGram, EMI and 
Ticketmaster were unveiled in January, but that venture has reportedly been 
moved to the back burner, in part because recent federal cable legislation that 
would make such a channel more costly to launch. A Justice Department antitrust 
inquiry has also unnerved some of the music companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources said Tuesday's announcement suggests that Sony's involvement 
in the new channel, and perhaps the venture itself, is in doubt. One source 
said that since the initial announcement, little progress has been made toward 
starting the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a similar venture involving Germany's Bertelsmann Music Group and 
cable company Tele-Communications Inc. collapsed due to what they called 
"changing market conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for Sony and others to compete with MTV caused hard feelings between 
MTV parent Viacom and the music companies. Last month, Viacom Chairman Sumner 
Redstone, speaking at a conference in France, said he was considering going 
into the recording business himself, because the major music companies "have 
already taken a shot at us" by trying to develop a rival channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Sony venture stemmed from some music executives' frustration with 
MTV. They said MTV was not devoting enough air time to their music videos -- 
which are important promotional tools for selling compact discs and 
audiocassettes -- as it shifted to more original programming.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the music industry has reacted favorably to the recent restructuring 
of MTV sister channel VH1, which has become more current and music-driven.

YOUR MONEY; SWEDISH DRUG COMPANY ASTRA FORMS VENTURE WITH MERCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astra, a big Swedish pharmaceuticals company, and U.S. drug manufacturer Merck 
& Co. are solidifying a 12-year partnership by forming a joint-venture company 
that will sell drugs and health care services in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Astra said Tuesday that it has paid $820 million to Merck for a 50% stake in 
the new company, Astra Merck Inc., which will replace a Merck subsidiary with 
the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 The new venture, similar to many mergers and business alliances now 
proliferating in the health care industry, guarantees Merck access to new drugs 
and gives Astra access to Merck's U.S. marketing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, Merck has had a license to manufacture and market Astra products 
in the United States. The most successful is Prilosec, an ulcer drug with sales 
of $684 million in the first nine months of this year. Others include Plendil, 
a drug for high blood pressure, and Tonocard, for irregular heartbeats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Merck subsidiary that produced and sold the drugs is headquartered in 
Wayne, Pa., and employs 900 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1982 agreement, once sales of Astra drugs reached a certain point, 
Merck would create a separate entity. Astra's decision to invest the money in 
the company triggered the creation of the new Astra Merck Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Astra, with $2.8 billion in sales last year, is one of Sweden's largest 
companies, but it is dwarfed by Merck, which had sales of $10.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne P. Yetter, the Merck executive who has run the Astra Merck subsidiary, 
will become president and chief executive of the new company. A separate board 
will be made up of eight members, four from Merck and four from Astra. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Astra Merck said that, in addition to drugs, it will 
concentrate on information, education and services to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Astra Merck recently licensed Ambicin from Applied Microbiology Inc. The drug 
is designed to kill a bacteria believed to cause some ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 Astra will continue to run a separate 350-employee U.S. division, selling 
products and drugs not covered in the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck shares closed up 12.5 cents at $35.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

YOUR MONEY; PRUDENTIAL PAY-BACK FUND GROWS, BUT CLAIMS ARE FEW AS DEADLINE 
NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 The pot of money for paying off wronged investors has just gotten another 
$300-million infusion. But state securities regulators say that as a Jan. 10 
deadline approaches, fewer than 38% of 339,000 eligible Prudential Securities 
customers nationwide who lost money from limited-partnership investments have 
filed claims. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials said only 35% of 42,000 eligible investors in the state 
have put in claims, despite a campaign by the Department of Corporations to let 
customers know they should apply for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a substantial number of people who have not participated -- and 
should -- and just don't understand what's going on," said G.W. (Bill) 
McDonald, head of the department's enforcement division. 
</P>
<P>
 The open-ended fund was established with $330 million after Prudential, in 
October, 1993, settled civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. The agency alleged massive fraud in the brokerage firm's aggressive 
marketing of limited partnerships to small investors throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Prudential agreed to immediately pay another $300 million into the 
fund as part of the settlement of a federal criminal investigation. Under the 
settlement, charges will not be pressed if the firm does not violate federal 
laws over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 State securities regulators said payments to investors who have filed claims 
have been relatively high, with many getting back all of their out-of-pocket 
losses plus interest. Nationwide, 130,442 claims had been filed as of Oct. 19; 
the 55,581 that had reached a final resolution resulted in payments totaling 
$312.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message today is a simple one: If you are one of the investors who was 
affected by the misconduct of Prudential and who has not yet participated in 
the settlement process, your time to do so is running out," said Wayne Klein, 
chief of the Idaho Securities Bureau who headed a task force of state 
regulators that investigated Prudential.

 Under the settlement program, investors send in claim forms to an independent 
administrator in Washington. Under the administrator's supervision, Prudential 
evaluates the claims and makes an offer on those it finds have merit. Investors 
can either accept the sum or appeal through an expedited arbitration process. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators and private lawyers offered several reasons for the relatively low 
rate of participation in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the investors -- many of whom were retirees -- have died, they noted. 
Others may have lost their claim forms or been so embittered by their 
experience that they gave up hope of recovering their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other investors are continuing to pursue private lawsuits or arbitration 
cases instead of going through the SEC procedure; private actions leave open 
the prospect of obtaining punitive damages and attorney's fees, which are not 
available under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who need claim forms can call the Prudential Claims Processing 
Center at (800) 774-0700. California residents who have had problems with the 
claims procedure can contact the Department of Corporations' Prudential 
"outreach coordinator" at (800) 589-4678.

IF SOMEONE SAYING 'PLEASE' ANSWERS, HANG UP

 If you've dialed 411 in California recently, you might have noticed something 
new in the operator's greeting: the word hi . 
</P>
<P>
 In what Pacific Bell called an effort to create a consistent statewide 
message, the company's 4,500 directory assistance operators have begun 
answering calls with their prerecorded salutation, such as "Hi, this is Mary; 
what city?" or "Hi, I'm Dave; what city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bradley, the company's vice president of operator services, said the idea 
was to make the greeting "friendly, engaging and brief." He said callers in 
Southern California and parts of Northern California had been put off in the 
past when operators greeted them with an impersonal identification number 
rather than a name. 
</P>
<P>
 The scripts, according to spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen, were developed with the 
help of 2,500 customers and 200 operators. The company maintained that 
stepped-up telephone competition makes it important that customers be able to 
recognize a Pacific Bell operator when they hear one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it's costing the company time and money. In Southern California, the 
average directory assistance call is now 19.35 seconds, 1.3 seconds longer than 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
 For the many operators who had incorporated "please" into their greetings -- 
as in what city, please? -- the new phrasing means eliminating a nicety. 
</P>
<P>
 Punting the "P-word" caused some hand-wringing here in Pacific Bell's 
headquarters city, which prides itself on being more genteel than the average 
burg. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors at the San Francisco Chronicle even wrote an editorial bemoaning the 
loss, calling the decision a "myopic corporate dictum." 
</P>
<P>
 One 411 veteran reached in San Bruno, Calif., said she had some initial 
concerns about dropping the please. But she added that operators can convey 
good manners with their tone and attitude -- and besides, now they don't risk 
customers mistaking them for the "puh-lice."

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; SOLVING THE HUMAN JIGSAW PUZZLE

 Anthropologists trying to trace the evolution of mankind are faced with two 
major problems: finding fossil fragments and reconstructing them into human 
form. Vertebrate fossils are rarely found complete and undamaged, and putting 
the pieces together is rather like trying to make a model airplane by using a 
few broken pieces from several different kits. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the help of a new visualization software package developed by IBM 
researchers, anthropologists can now use advanced computer graphics and 
visualization techniques to electronically rebuild human fossils. Starting with 
a number of 400,000-year-old fossilized skull fragments discovered in Morocco 
several years ago, researchers digitized, analyzed and assembled five fossils. 
</P>
<P>
 The discoverer of some of the fossil pieces provided a blueprint for the 
composite electronic reconstruction. Then Alan Kalvin, a member of the 
computer-assisted surgery group at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and 
David Dean of the New York University Medical Center Institute of 
Reconstructive Plastic Surgery took over. First they shrunk two larger 
fragments to match the size of the other pieces. Then they used mirror-imaging 
to accurately create three additional pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the pieces were assembled with sub-millimeter precision. Not only can 
these electronic jigsaw puzzle pieces be moved around more easily, but the 
reconstruction can be easily modified when further fossils are found or 
theories developed. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Battlefield to the Nursery: Neonatal intensive care at your local 
hospital might not be a place you would expect to find military technology, but 
as part of an initiative to transfer defense technology to commercial 
applications, a team of researchers at Hershey (Pa.) Medical Center and the 
Penn State Applied Research Laboratory are developing an automated system for 
the care of premature infants based on battlefield techniques for integrating 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 On the battlefield, real-time information from radar, optical sensors and 
soldiers is integrated via methods known as data fusion technologies. The same 
technologies can be used to monitor the oxygen levels of babies who have 
respiratory distress syndrome and automatically deliver the right amount of 
oxygen to each infant. Too little oxygen and a baby could suffocate; too much 
could cause blindness. The planned system would also recognize sensor failures 
and other dangerous situations and alert doctors or nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of companies already manufacture monitors of this type, the 
systems currently in use process information from a single sensor. It is up to 
the attending doctor or nurse to relate the information coming from individual 
sensors, often in a high-stress situation. A data fusion module to merge and 
interpret the information from a variety of sensors could greatly improve 
patient care. Researchers hope to develop and test a prototype in partnership 
with a medical equipment maker over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 True Blue Solution: Nature seems to have no trouble providing us with 
brilliant blue skies, blue lakes and bluebirds. Scientists have a more 
difficult task when it comes to flat-panel displays. That's because blue is at 
the high-energy end of the light spectrum. In current displays, that means 
getting true blues requires using much higher voltage than is needed for red or 
orange. 
</P>
<P>
 If flat panels are to be used for wristwatch computers, flat home television 
screens or stadium-size TV screens -- as many computer soothsayers hope and 
expect -- they must be able to show sharp pictures in full colors, including 
blue. Enter Los Alamos National Laboratory and Planar Systems of Beaverton, 
Ore., which are working on the blue problem with funds from the Energy 
Department's Small Business Technology Transfer Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers are concentrating on a kind of flat panel called the 
electroluminescent display, in which a light emitter, or phosphor, is 
sandwiched between two insulating layers. When electricity is applied and 
exceeds a specific threshold, the insulating layer breaks down and electrons 
pass from one side of the sandwich to the other. On the way, the electrons 
excite ions of the phosphor, which in turn give off light. The color is 
determined by the properties of the phosphor and how much voltage is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Alamos researchers found that cerium-doped phosphors composed of 
calcium gallium sulfide, when deposited onto a thin film by a special vapor 
deposition process, will yield a true blue light at low voltage. The group 
recently received a $30-million grant from the federal government's Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, which will be used to build a production line for the 
new displays.

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / 
TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SIDE ROADS LEADING TO THE INTERNET 
</P>

<P>
 Are you a horseplayer? A Buddhist? A fiend for needlework? An emigre pining 
for Seoul? There's a place for you in cyberspace, but it may not be the place 
you think. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is always talking about the Internet, and sign-up forms for America 
Online seem to flutter out of every magazine. But in all the hubbub about the 
burgeoning information highway, it's easy to overlook one of the richest 
resources available by modem: your friendly neighborhood computer bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a BBS, as they are popularly known, for almost everyone, yet even 
many experienced users of such services as Prodigy and CompuServe never venture 
far enough afield to see what a good BBS has to offer. That's a shame, because 
in terms of sheer value, it's hard to beat a good BBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Many systems offer multiplayer games, movie and TV listings, USA Today news, 
vast stores of software free for the downloading, and the chance to "chat" 
onscreen with other users who have a little too much time on their hands. 
Perhaps best of all, many BBSs offer unlimited electronic mail, including 
e-mail to the Internet and the various commercial services. In fact, users who 
just want e-mail from an on-line service should seriously consider adopting a 
BBS as their main post office. 
</P>
<P>
 BBSs are especially good for serving far-flung individuals who share a common 
interest. There are BBSs for Zen Buddhists, outdoor enthusiasts, horseplayers, 
entrepreneurs and just about everybody else. With an estimated 50,000 to 
100,000 BBSs in America, there is a general or specialized BBS for almost every 
conceivable lifestyle, interest or taste. 
</P>
<P>
 BBSs are also increasingly popular as a way for organizations to disseminate 
information. Government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and 
Small Business Administration have their own BBSs, and software companies such 
as Microsoft have BBSs that carry product information, programming patches and 
other useful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 BBSs are often cheap -- from $30 to $75 a year -- and sometimes free. Using a 
BBS is especially cost-effective when it isn't a long-distance call away, but 
even then it can be worthwhile if the BBS has something you want (and you dial 
during off-peak hours). Experienced BBS users adopt what are known as off-line 
mail readers, which squeeze all your new messages and forum postings into a 
compressed packet for fast downloading. The software then organizes the 
information for easy reading or responding off-line, compressing responses into 
a reply packet that can usually be uploaded in no time at all. 
</P>
<P>
 BBSs are also, it must be said, a font of pornography. Not all, of course, but 
a good many BBSs -- often the biggest and most expensive -- are 
"adult-oriented," specializing in sexually explicit material of all kinds. 
These boards tend to disclose their nature upfront, so beware. Even the tamer 
boards often offer personal ads, and in the heavily male world of cyberspace, 
women sooner or later seem to get hit on, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 BBSs have come a long way since the earliest ones functioned simply as 
electronic cork boards for a handful of users. Various networks -- FidoNet is 
perhaps the most famous -- tie local boards together, so that a local BBS forum 
on golf might be part of a much larger discussion encompassing golfers from all 
over North America and even the world. There are networks of specialty boards 
too; many gay and lesbian BBSs, for instance, are connected by GayCom. 
</P>
<P>
 A great way to get started exploring the world of BBSs is to dial a free one 
close to home; a favorite of mine is the Los Angeles Valley College BBS. All 
you need for this is your modem and whatever telecommunications program it no 
doubt came with. You can tap into this particular BBS by dialing it with your 
computer at (818) 985-7150, at modem speeds of up to 14,400 bps. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, you'll find a wealth of offerings, including free Internet e-mail; 
your address will become mary.jones@support.com, assuming your name is Mary 
Jones. Thus equipped, you can send and receive mail to anyone on CompuServe, 
America Online and so forth. To message someone on CompuServe, replace the 
comma in his ID number with a period and append @compuserve.com. For America 
Online, it's just username@aol.com. (Fill in the recipient's actual username.) 
You can also use your address to subscribe to any Internet mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley College BBS carries more than 900 Internet and FidoNet 
special-interest forums. And, of course, you can download shareware files, 
including off-line readers. You get access to almost everything on this 
easy-to-use system for free, but a payment of at least $15 annually gets you 
complete access and the feeling that you've paid your share for using this 
worthy enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get the hang of using BBSs, your biggest problem, aside from finding 
time for your children, may be finding new systems to dial. A number of 
publications carry BBS lists, and there are lists all over in cyberspace, 
especially on many BBSs. On America Online, use the keyword BBS. On CompuServe, 
hit the IBM BBS Forum. On the Internet, check into any of the BBS newsgroups. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, you'll find a BBS you're comfortable with. Horseplayers might 
try the Handicapper's Log (modem to (213) 934-6026). Searchers for satori can 
download some koans from the Tiger Team Buddhist Information Network at (510) 
268-0102. Korean speakers (or English speakers interested in matters Korean) 
can try Korea America Online at (213) 962-3634. Local Boards 
</P>
<P>
 Some local BBSs that are either free for newcomers or free for everyone: 
</P>
<P>
 * LA Online: (310) 372-4050; what's happening in Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>

THE CUTTING EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; FROM SIX-PACK PACKAGING 
TO NEW HOMES; RECYCLING: PROCESS ALLOWS GRIDCORE TO CONVERT TRASH INTO 
PLYWOOD-LIKE SUBSTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Mahoney, design fabrication manager for Gridcore Systems International, 
recently took some six-pack containers and shredded newspapers and made a 
podium for his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday in Long Beach, Gridcore President Robert Noble stood at that podium 
to dedicate a factory for the production of a new building panel called 
Gridcore, which is made entirely from consumer waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Gridcore says its new panels are inexpensive and environmentally safe, 
stronger and lighter than plywood -- and sure to promote recycling efforts. 
They are being used in furniture, movie sets and stage displays, and Noble says 
they could fundamentally alter the way buildings are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future (for the panels) is in residential building construction," Noble 
said. His company is spending $5 million over the next three years to develop 
Gridcore houses, in which everything, including the furniture and cabinets, 
will be made with Gridcore panels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire building will end up being less expensive than comparable building 
methods," Noble said, and thus could eventually help provide families with 
adequate low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels are made in a four-step process. First, old corrugated cardboard, 
six-pack containers, newsprint and wood waste are mixed with water in a 
20-foot-high machine akin to a blender. This creates a pulp that is 99% water 
and 1% fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-inch-thick layer of the pulp is then poured onto a 4-by-10-foot 
honeycomb mold, where the water is sucked out from underneath. This leaves a 
wet mat similar to that produced in paper making. 
</P>
<P>
 The mat is then pressed under intense heat to form hydrogen bonds between the 
fibers, which makes it stronger. One side of the mat is flat and the other side 
has sturdy ridges from the honeycomb mold. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 4-by-10 sheets are then glued together and pressed for 45 minutes 
with the ridges facing each other to further strengthen the panel, creating 
what looks like a honeycomb sandwich. The panel is then ready for manufacturing 
use, and can be painted and laminated just like wood, according to Mahoney. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsbad, Calif.-based Gridcore has contracts with the Ikea furniture chain, 
Gap clothing stores and nearly 100 other companies. Noble said customers are 
enthusiastic about using a product that will reduce the amount of waste sent to 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels, originally called "spaceboard," were developed by the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's Forest Products Laboratory, and Gridcore and two other 
companies bought the rights to the technology.  
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach factory, which opened in April, is projected to reach full 
capacity in March and produce 10 times the amount of panels it is producing 
now, said David Saltman, Gridcore's vice president of marketing and sales. 
There are already plans to expand the site, which now employs 21 people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neal, whose office pushed aggressively 
for Gridcore to build a factory there, was awarded a light-green key to the 
Gridcore world -- one made of a panel produced from tattered paper currency 
supplied by the Federal Reserve System.

 RYAN'S HOPE: The American Red Cross is holding a special donor drive for a 
young Anaheim boy. Five-year-old Ryan Pierson, who was born with a rare bone 
disease, needs a bone marrow match. The Red Cross is testing potential donors 
from 1 to 6 p.m. Sunday at the Cypress Evangelical Church. . . . His mother, 
Laura, has been through the search for a matching donor before. "But I'll never

 MARIO'S DREAM: Those who live in Tucson and follow the Triple-A Toros baseball 
team probably know Mario Impemba's voice like he was part of the family. But 
Impemba, as one might expect, dreamed of making the bigs. After four years in 
Tucson, his time has come: Impemba, 31, will join Bob Starr next season on 
California Angels radio broadcasts. . . . Says Mike Feder, general manager of 
the Toros: "Mario has a promising future ahead of him in major-league 
baseball."

 NEW KING: If someone gave you a mountain lion, what would you name it? State 
officials recently donated a 12-week-old mountain lion found near Lake Tahoe to 
the county zoo at Irvine Regional Park. About 900 visitors participated in a 
naming contest. The winner may not be original, but it was by far the most 
popular response: Simba. . . . Simba is the title character in "The Lion King," 
a Disney movie. Disney officials were so impressed that they've agreed to 
"adopt" Simba, meaning that they will help pay for his keep.

WHITHER THE DIGNITY OF TODAY'S ROYALTY?; BOOKS: BRITISH SCHOLAR ROSALIND MILES 
CRINGES AT THE PUBLIC WHINING OF CHARLES AND DIANA. BOTH, SHE SAYS, WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER OFF FOLLOWING ELIZABETH I'S DIGNIFIED EXAMPLE.

<P>
 If Elizabeth I had been faced with the likes of the wayward Princess Diana, 
she'd have thrown the witless woman into the Tower of London and launched a 
smear campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 So asserts British literary scholar Rosalind Miles, Oxford-educated author of 
15 nonfiction and fiction works -- including two bestsellers in England. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not Diana's alleged adultery that would have irked the so-called 
Virgin Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that Diana broke the aristocracy's centuries-old code of honor by leaving 
her husband and publicly whining -- moves to rock the royal barge that she 
learned from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's bleated, whined and leaked like a sieve," says Miles, relaxing with 
coffee in her Times Square hotel room at the end of a three-week U.S. book 
tour, soon to return to her 16th-Century farmhouse in Warwickshire. "In 
Elizabeth's day, she would've been silenced and saved from these embarrassing 
affairs . . . with chinless wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles, 43, is accustomed to speaking for the 16th-Century monarch. Her latest 
tome -- a 595-page novel called "I, Elizabeth" (Doubleday, 1994) -- is written 
entirely in the first person and took five years to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elizabeth I's own voice was so distinctive, in the end I could almost hear 
her talking to me," Miles says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she wrote the book because she respects the woman who juggled a 
problem-plagued childhood, religious tempests, breathless bedchamber secrets, 
the Spanish Armada and her nemesis Mary, Queen of Scots, all without losing her 
royal image. 
</P>
<P>
 "What an amazing woman," Miles says. 
</P>
<P>
 She can't say the same for Diana, whom she calls "unbelievably 
narcissistically involved." 
</P>
<P>
 And she's not too keen on Prince Charles, either, for having followed Diana's 
example of "girlie blabbering." 
</P>
<P>
 Again she harks to the glory days of Elizabeth I. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would've sent Charles off to conquer new worlds -- heroic action is 
always good. Give him a whiff of grapeshot and he would've had plenty to do. 
Today, he's just a man without a function." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's a modern-day Royal Mom to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Queen couldn't have done anything more," Miles says. "She has put up and 
shut up all her life. She's staggered by this betrayal of privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Miles: "I follow this with great concern. It's not a soap opera, it's a 
Greek tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Miles details in her book, randy royalty is nothing new. In fact, she says, 
Elizabeth I was a sexy and passionate woman who likely had several romantic 
liaisons with members of her court, remaining single only to retain 
independence and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were not faithful in the Old World. . . . It was a virile, 
full-blooded age," she says, adding that there is still today much more random 
and adulterous sex in England than ever in America. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difference between then and now and here and there is the way 
infidelities are handled by spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Miles of those centuries-old English ways: "Edwardian girls were 
brought up to believe lovers were flowers and husbands trees. Divorce was not 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, for men, "There's a solidly established tradition of having a wife 
and mistress. You treat your wife decently, don't bring your mistress to the 
dinner table and turn a blind eye to your wife's boyfriends." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Miles: "It's a stark code but it's clear. You live by it and die by it." 
</P>
<P>
 So what went wrong with Charles and Di? The answer is simple, says Miles: 
Their calculated merger was a royal matchmaking mistake right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (royal family) wanted a wife for Charles who was blue-blooded, a virgin, 
and she had to be tall," Miles says. "The physical pedigree dominated their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 But had they taken Diana's "psychological pedigree" into account, the royals 
would have thought twice, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the child of the worst divorce that's rocked British aristocracy 
since the 18th Century," Miles says, detailing the history of Diana's mother, 
who left her husband for her lover. "Her mother broke the code of carrying on 
the affair and remaining in the marriage. She ran away with the bloke." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Diana grew up with a series of "horrible nannies" and a 
"hysterical obsession to build a family life -- to make things right this 
time," Miles says. That's why she wouldn't "put up and shut up" about Charles' 
infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Miles, who calls herself a feminist: "Charles was brought up by the code 
and taught that adultery is OK. But Diana wasn't, so she blew (the code) out of 
the water. She's a selfish and hysterical mother who puts her own unhappiness 
above her children. If she loved her children, she would've stayed with their 
father." 
</P>
<P>
 But doesn't she sympathize with Diana's plight? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, she was used, but she's deeply ignorant," Miles says. "The cruel truth 
is she was redundant the minute she produced the heir and the spare." 
</P>
<P>
 She sniffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damaged people are damaging," she says. "She's dragged British aristocracy 
into the era of tabloid confessionals, which are low class. That's why people 
there hate her to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when pressed, she does express a bit of hedged pity for the princess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel terribly sorry for her, but she 100% contributed to everything," 
Miles says. "She's a player in this Greek tragedy. Given an option at every 
stage, she's picked the stupid one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miles' impatience with Diana perhaps stems from the plucky way the author has 
handled her own life's travails. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 10, after getting a scholarship, Miles was plucked from her 
"very ordinary family -- poor as church mice" (her father was a baker) who 
lived in a wild-flowered rural paradise. She was sent to a "hothouse girls' 
school with daughters of bishops and things." 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I'm climbing trees in the countryside and the next day I'm learning 
Greek in a repressed girls' school atmosphere," she recalls. "I was to be 
bitterly unhappy for the next 7 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she was a good student, and "cottoned onto the fact that if I hung in, 
I'd get to Oxford. It came to me that this was the price, so you bite the 
bullet and you get there." 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, her father, who suffered throughout her childhood with what 
was diagnosed as tuberculosis but really was cancer, had a lung removed and was 
in a convalescent home for two years. Her mother developed cancer and died when 
Miles was 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miles didn't break down, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to be British, to put up and shut up. You don't talk about your 
feelings -- no bleating, no whining. You're magnanimous in victory, dignified 
in defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to study English at Oxford, where she won prizes; earned master's 
and doctoral degrees at Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute, and then another 
master's at the Centre for Mass Communication Research at the University of 
Leicester. She also married and had two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her marriage is happy, she says, but even if it weren't, she'd never leave her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I had children, divorce was off the agenda," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She describes her studies as her "secular religion." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always found my comfort in it," she says. "Every crisis we face, someone 
has been there before us and written about it beautifully. That's our solace." 
</P>
<P>
 She notes that in America, the religion is "spilling your own guts" in 
everything from 12-step meetings to talk shows. Asks Miles: "Why not see if 
someone's done it before and done it better?" 
</P>
<P>
 But despite her disdain, she admits to fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glued to the TV here where grown-up people are spilling everything," she 
says, segueing into the subject of a talk show she saw here on her tour. The 
subject: sexual incompatibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here this dorky-looking guy is saying his wife's sex demands are insatiable," 
she says. "And in bounces this woman -- his wife -- just oozing sexuality. The 
defeated-looking nerd was all over her like cheap after-shave." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs. "I couldn't tear myself away even though I had important 
appointments to get to," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, will British aristocracy go the way of Diana and undignified, 
spill-your-guts America? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely not, Miles says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is seen as a big dramatic thing but it's not, really. People 
underestimate the phlegmatic nature of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bit of logistical juggling, of twiddling knobs to adjust the 
reception, but things go on and things don't change."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A LESSON IN EMPATHY, TAUGHT BY THE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is a good reminder that, among other things, you can't fool 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the qualities possessed by children, which reaches its peak in 
adolescence and incipient adulthood, is the ability to detect hypocrisy and the 
willingness to call it like it is. Some people use a vulgarity with the word 
detector to describe this phenomenon. No surprise, in other words, that a child 
nailed the emperor and his so-called new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Children have a luxurious liberation that is wrung out of them as time goes 
by. It is not a matter of simple naivete, but social position: A child 
generally does not have to worry about what the boss thinks, or whether an 
action will affect property values or even what the neighbors will say. A child 
does not have to stand for reelection in a lousy economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the emotions of children -- even ones on the cusp of adulthood -- are 
often more pure, more raw and more heartfelt than those of adults. The opposite 
of an adolescent, in this sense, is a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why people such as Pete Wilson and Mike ("Everyone at some stage has 
broken the law") Huffington should pay attention to the kids who poured out of 
their middle schools and high schools by the thousands last week -- and who 
have threatened to do so on an even grander scale today -- to protest the most 
mean-spirited proposition to come down the pike in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 may do in moments what years of well-intentioned lessons never 
could: Give this generation of schoolchildren a sense that they have a stake in 
this time and place after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the narrow minds behind Proposition 187, we may be witnessing the 
politicization of a new generation of Californians. They are not likely to grow 
up and vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Last Friday was not an especially pleasant day for some school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham High School Principal Jerry Kleinman followed the 800 to 1,000 of 
his students who left the Van Nuys school about 10:30 a.m. They marched from 
Birmingham to several other schools, before winding up at Van Nuys Civic 
Center, thousands strong. Kleinman did not return to campus until about 2:45 
p.m., when students were returned aboard school buses ordered up by district 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Kleinman received phone calls from angry parents demanding 
to know why he had been "marching with the students." 
</P>
<P>
 " I beg your pardon? " was his testy response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel responsible to the youngsters," he explained. "I needed to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance on Friday, he found himself defusing an angry motorist after 
students who were a little too stoked on adrenaline for their own good banged 
the man's bumper with their fists as they crossed in front of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got between the adult and the youngsters so there would be no 
confrontation," Kleinman said. "I just tried to indicate to the man that we had 
a walkout . . . and you have some kids that are gonna act very immature and I 
hoped he would understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinman said he was planning an "open forum" today on Proposition 187. He 
hoped it would encourage students to stay on campus, but he wasn't making any 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to have a positive civics lesson out of this. I don't approve of 
what they did, but if . . . they can grow from it, then I think there is 
something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Would that the adults could grow from it too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud the students who walked out for showing conviction, even as I 
acknowledge some of them surely looked upon the walkout as nothing more than a 
glorified ditch day. For the most part, the demonstrations, which took place 
from Oxnard to San Diego, were peaceful. And the point has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope students stay in school today and use their energies constructively. 
Taking to the streets is an invitation for violence and Lord knows, the 
children of this city have seen enough of that. 
</P>
<P>
 But acts of conscience committed by schoolchildren can offer something 
valuable to adults, particularly those adults who support the child-punishing 
Proposition 187 out of the misguided sense they will be "sending a message" 
about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not beatifying these kids. Children are not saints. And they are quite 
capable of the baser human behaviors. Eventually, one hopes, self-centeredness 
makes room for generosity and empathy, and from such tender sprouts of 
conscience does a healthy, humane society grow. 
</P>
<P>
 These young protesters have taught us something about compassion and humanity 
and the kind of rage that flows from being treated like dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 As I look around and note which of our so-called leaders and would-be leaders 
are supporting Proposition 187, it occurs to me that not all our adult citizens 
have internalized those important values. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they should go back to school. There's a lot they could learn. 
</P>
<P>
 From the kids.

THE QUIET MAN; ALL EYES ARE ON LARRY ECHOHAWK, WHO HAS SUPPORTERS FROM 
HOLLYWOOD TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT THE SHY NATIVE AMERICAN ONLY HAS EYES FOR 
IDAHO -- AND THAT'S WHY HE WANTS TO BE ITS GOVERNOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many came here stalking a stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 The BBC. Paris match. An Italian magazine and Japanese television. They led an 
insistent trickle of overseas media searching for a man they presumed to be a 
noble savage tamed by the white eyes -- and now poised to become the nation's 
first Native American governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably a disappointment to some people," says Larry EchoHawk. The name 
is proud Pawnee and as romantic as great-grandfather Echo Hawk, the U.S. 
cavalry scout. "Maybe they do want to see me in an Indian shirt, or beads, with 
a headdress on. But as you can see, I wear a business suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Also button-down shirts, power ties and sensible shoes. He speaks carefully 
like the attorney he is, and campaigns with a huge dignity that has brought 
this Democrat from county prosecutor and state legislator to Idaho attorney 
general in just over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the unsolicited support of Hollywood money, the expensive advice of 
Washington spin doctors, and the endorsement of jogging partner Bill Clinton -- 
albeit a dubious asset in conservative, gun totin' Idaho -- most polls give 
EchoHawk a double-digit leg-up for a place in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be known as a leader, a person in public office who stands for 
things they believe in, and values they were raised with," he insists. "I have 
some strong feelings and positions . . . most evolved from how I was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly, my Native American roots influence how I look at things." 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk is at the wheel of a Nissan Maxima rental, cutting across the Idaho 
Panhandle. If this is 8 a.m. it must be Moscow. It's also the first of 10 legs 
of another 14-hour day; to shake hands in Orofino, Kamiah, Nezperce and 
innocent villages where school signs warn about cigarettes, not guns, on 
campus. Where the hottest race in town is Kaufman for Coroner and surely Twin 
Peaks is around the next bend. 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk drives to unwind. He likes it best on night roads, says an aide, 
talking out the day and chewing sunflower seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 When talking about his life, it is an unbeatable story. He is the fifth of six 
children born to Ernest EchoHawk, an itinerant oil field surveyor who chased 
his trade from Wyoming to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7, Larry EchoHawk was holding Dad's surveying poles. It wasn't an unhappy, 
hungry, dirt-floor childhood, he remembers. But there were three brothers to a 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessedly, it also was a time of civil stirrings in America. The Kennedys were 
speaking inspirations. Martin Luther King was on the march. The Office of 
Economic Opportunity had funds for minority educations -- so six children went 
to college and OEO bought law degrees for the brothers EchoHawk. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mormon by family conversion -- part of his father's recovery from alcohol -- 
Larry EchoHawk won a football scholarship to Brigham Young University, as 
defensive back. Law studies at the University of Utah. Then counsel for the 
Shoshone-Bannock tribe, state representative, county prosecutor and attorney 
general in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It has left him a grateful, unblinking idealist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think visionary about what we can become," he says. Black. Latino. Asian. 
Native American or white. "There is a lot of goodness and opportunity in 
America and I have realized it with my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I spoke at the Democratic Convention . . . I made a statement that says 
a lot about who I am. 'I have seen what was, but I see very clearly what we all 
can become.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like parents, like son: Larry EchoHawk, 46, and wife Terry also have six 
children. Of course they are answering campaign phones, distributing stickers 
and wearing buttons for Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are learning his philosophy of giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is Indian tradition," EchoHawk explains. "Something called 'giveaway.' In 
times of celebration, in times of mourning, you show strength and character by 
giving what you have to other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that's the great thing about public office . . . the chance to give 
something you have to bless the lives of others. That's the way I was raised as 
an Indian." 
</P>
<P>
 Indian? What of Native American? Or American Indian? EchoHawk says he isn't 
concerned by the political subscription of terms. He interchanges them. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's heard all the slurs, is neither bothered nor amused by labels, and 
even laughs off one cruel pejorative: Radical Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ran for attorney general, there was a presentation packet that my 
opponent handed out to some business leaders," he recalls. "There was a page . 
. . about the campaign in terms of 'beads and blankets and braids' and my 
contributions as 'wampum.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this gubernatorial race, EchoHawk knows opposing pollsters are trying 
to weight voter opinions with "questions about the Native American identity of 
Larry EchoHawk and was this a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I believe that people . . . in Idaho are very much aware of my ethnic 
background," he says. "What I don't know, is how much of a factor that is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Native American factor of Larry EchoHawk can be split many ways with a 
variety of consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho, frankly, nobody gives a damn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boise-based and influential Idaho Statesman has not raised EchoHawk's 
ethnic background in its editorials. It isn't an issue wherever the candidate 
meets the press, public audiences or editorial endorsement boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minds of the voting public, his being Native American is just a nice 
little asterisk," says Doug Nilson, professor of politics at Idaho State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more important, say other observers, is EchoHawk's membership in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- in a state with the largest 
Mormon population outside of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, it would not influence the outcome of Tuesday's election if every 
Coeur d'Alene, Kootenai, Shoshone or Nez Perce in Idaho voted for their Native 
American son. Or against him. For the state's six tribes represent only 10,000 
persons -- less than 1% of Idaho's 1 million population. 
</P>
<P>
 Three tribes have endorsed EchoHawk; three have not. Some Native Americans are 
openly speaking against his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 For as attorney general he drafted legislation banning casino-style gambling 
on Idaho reservations. Says Douglas McConaughey, advocate for the 
Shoshone-Paiute tribe: "The Shoshone-Bannock tribe, which was $1 million in the 
hole at the time, were among those who felt betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Pawnee father and German mother, EchoHawk isn't fully Native American. 
Pawnee are non-Idahoan. Then there is that matter of great-grandfather's career 
and the cavalry's indelicate contribution to the Indian Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our differences with Larry EchoHawk," says Charles Hayes, chairman of 
the Nez Perce tribal council. "There is a sense of honor and pride that he 
might be elected. But also real frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 And EchoHawk accepts that in rural Idaho with populations of redneck 
lumberjacks and white supremacists, "any kind of plus vote that I would get 
from the Native American community would be offset by some people . . . who 
have anti-Indian sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its fuzzy focus, world and national attention on EchoHawk's Native 
American heritage certainly has stirred unexpected benefits to the campaign and 
its $1-million war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Steven Spielberg has contributed $2,000. A check from Robert Redford 
is expected. Dustin Hoffman has given $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 (Campaign comedians have interpreted Hoffman's donation as redemption money. 
For it was Hoffman, in the title role of the movie "Little Big Man," who 
growled, "It was a band of Pawnee what attacked us . . . I ain't had no use for 
Pawnee ever since.") 
</P>
<P>
 A downside to the international spotlight: Opponents claim EchoHawk, a 
recognized Friend of Bill now endorsed by Hollywood, might be more interested 
in a federal future. Even a vice presidency. Ergo, to hell with Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk denies it. He says his ambitions are here, now and for as long as 
Idaho voters want him. He does not apologize for ties to the President -- who 
once placed him on a short list for Secretary of the Interior -- and notes his 
disagreement with Clinton on the disposal of nuclear waste and the deep federal 
thirst for Idaho water. 
</P>
<P>
 Of benefit to all Idahoans, he adds, is that Clinton returns his phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 An upside to global fascination: It has almost buried EchoHawk's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Phil Batt says he has started to feel like Whatsisname, the second 
man to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "People certainly don't come to see this farmer from Wilder," he complained 
before a recent debate. "If it hadn't been for all this attention, all this 
notoriety, I'd have had (EchoHawk) on the floor by now." 
</P>
<P>
 EchoHawk, by his own analysis, wears no party collar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out of step with the party line on a number of things," he explains. "One 
that always comes up is the abortion issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are typically pro-choice. EchoHawk supports abortion only in cases 
of rape, incest or when a mother's life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the primary that was a major issue," he says. "But I got 74% of the vote 
in a three-way race . . . there are many Democrats that are pretty conservative 
in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reared as a Mormon, he is opposing an anti-gay rights measure on the 
November ballot on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I teach my family, what I teach my children, (is) that the homosexual 
lifestyle is not appropriate for us," he says. "But if one of my children ever 
adopted that lifestyle, I would not want anyone to treat them in a hateful 
manner. I am very sensitive to discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady Bill and bans on military-style assault rifles were birthed by 
Democrats -- but EchoHawk the fly fisherman and elk hunter insists that "gun 
control is not an effective deterrent to crime. . . . I don't think the Brady 
Bill is going to have a significant impact on efforts to curb criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Landon Curry, professor of political science at the University of Idaho, 
applauds the novelty of this mix. And its maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a Native American who doesn't look like a Native American," Curry says. 
"He's a Democrat who doesn't sound like a Democrat . . . and being Mormon is 
going to attract a lot of Republican crossover votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's clean. He stays aloof from nit-picking. He won't lead with his ego . . . 
and so what comes out of his mouth seems to be deeply believed, very personal 
convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course he is not a candidate without flaws. EchoHawk admits that he needs 
to bring more smiles and animation to his public appearances -- especially on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Public debates, he says, still build flutters worse than fears felt before the 
first hit of a football game. He is shy when working Main Street. He is 
intelligent without being an intellectual, and some campaign minders softly 
criticize him for ignoring the professional advice he pays for. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's simply not a candidate," says one counsel. "In this age of cynical 
politicians he is neither cynical nor a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a decent person, he makes the mistake of thinking everybody else 
is. He thinks a campaign should be about issues, not personal attacks. So when 
attacked, he doesn't quite know how to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 One such assault describes three strikes and you're out, EchoHawk style. It 
holds that he will fail in Idaho because he's Mormon, a Democrat and Native 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate, for once, knows how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 He says being an underdog in Idaho has historic advantage. After all, voters 
chose Moses Alexander in 1914 when Idaho became the first state to elect a Jew 
as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Maxima and Highway 12 are following wooded curves of the Clearwater River. 
Fishermen in dories cast for steelheads. EchoHawk wishes he was among them. An 
eagle at 9 o'clock surfs river thermals and hunts with its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 It all gives EchoHawk an easy segue into his sense of nature, yet another 
cultural carry-over to his politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a spiritual respect for land and free-flowing rivers, forests and 
wildlife, and knows that preserving their sanctity defends the future of any 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially outdoors Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the issue of endangered salmon," he says. "I sense from listening to my 
opponents that it is more an economic issue to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seem to be the only candidate that says these are magnificent animals. They 
swim a thousand miles from the oceans to the spawning areas of Idaho. And they 
are a creation that ought to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 From his parents, from his family and its religious faith, comes a belief in 
the social strength instilled by united homes. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes children are every community's most precious resource. To be 
protected against sexual abuse. To deserve more in beginning years than drugs, 
single parents, gangs and latchkey lives. In fact, to be given the educational 
opportunities he received. 
</P>
<P>
 As a law enforcer, EchoHawk was touched by his prosecution of an 18-year-old 
jailed for life for raping, beating, strangling and burning a woman. By a 
14-year-old cop killer. By witnessing the final breath of a murderer executed 
in Idaho by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went there out of a strong sense of duty," he says. The always-quiet voice 
is down to a whisper. "The people elected me to this position of attorney 
general and I wouldn't have felt right if I'd just sent a deputy attorney 
general in that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 His impression of that moment will be lifelong. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time he was a young man that showed some promise in his life," 
EchoHawk relates. "He was loved by his parents. But he'd gotten off track, 
fallen prey to drugs and lost control of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he started to go astray, family, friends and society failed to get him 
back. And then he commits society's ultimate crime and brutally murders two 
people. It's a very sad situation . . . not only what happens to the victims, 
but in the waste of other lives." 
</P>
<P>
 So he supports the death penalty. At least, for murders with special, violent, 
premeditated circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, EchoHawk predicts an expansion of familiar pressures. It's the 
baggage of being Native American and has haunted him since becoming attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a lot of eyes were on me," he remembers. "So I couldn't fail . . 
. because if I got into the job and fell flat on my face, it would be more 
difficult for the next Native American. Or the next minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very important to do a good job so that next time, if an Hispanic ran 
for attorney general, people would say: 'Hey, EchoHawk did a good job, let's 
elect this guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Excessive scrutiny, he says, is a price he willingly pays for the satisfaction 
of being a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, there were very few role models for my generation to 
look to," he says. "As attorney general, I've tried to take the opportunity to 
speak to young people and minority populations and give them a positive message 
about what they can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is more to Idaho than unserved minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti and gangs have begun. Crack dealers recently arrested in Boise had 
moved from Los Angeles. The Air Force wants to build an air-to-ground gunnery 
range in the state. An eight-year drought has produced dry, cracked reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 So wherever the EchoHawk Express pauses, from a canoe camp on the Clearwater 
to a University of Idaho alumni breakfast, the candidate thumps a platform only 
for Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 debates to date, opponents and campaign reporters smile wearily as 
EchoHawk encores his psalm for the state. But they can only add an amen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Idaho is what America once was . . . and what America wants to be," he 
preaches. "Idaho is, simply, the last best place in America to live and raise a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep it that way."

WOMEN BEHIND BARS; REFLECTING A NATIONAL TREND, INCARCERATIONS AT THREE O.C. 
FACILITIES ARE RISING DRAMATICALLY. EXPLANATIONS RANGE FROM AN INCREASE IN DRUG 
USE, VIOLENT AND WHITE COLLAR CRIMES, TO THE ECONOMY, TO A LESS TOLERANT 
SOCIETY. THE ACCELERATING FIGURES ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL ON THE SYSTEM.

 It's jarring at first, but they say you get used to it. At the entrance to the 
Orange County Women's Jail, a pair of heavy cell doors slam shut with a sound 
that rings through the facility like an empty metal box. 
</P>
<P>
 But as you approach the first cellblock, it's clear that this is not an empty 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the large, blue-gray cell are several woman wearing jumpsuits. They are 
reading, chatting and putting on makeup, bunking in barred dorm rooms while 
they wait to see a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 They're invisible to most. Yet the many female inmates who crowd the cell are 
vivid reminders that the Orange County Women's Jail in the downtown Civic 
Center is not as empty as its echo suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of complex reasons, the number of women incarcerated in Orange 
County has risen dramatically in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The average daily population in the three county facilities housing women is 
up by well over a third, recording an average of 569 women incarcerated each 
day. Before the increase, the number stayed fairly constant, hovering around 
the 420 mark from 1988 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, prosecutors and correction officials offer a number of explanations 
for the recent surge: drugs, increased violence, the economy or even the 
possibility that society doesn't excuse women anymore because of their sex. 
Statistics show they're all partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you can point to any one thing that's causing it," says 
Huntington Beach Police patrol Sgt. Bill Peterson, a 25-year law enforcement 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the economy and lack of viable employment have something to do with 
it. What we're seeing on patrol is a lot more women doing shoplifting-type 
crimes, and just a lot more theft involving women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson says he and the officers he supervises on patrol have noticed more 
drug use and violent crime involving women. He added that he's also noted in 
the past two years an increase in women involved in white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something recent," Peterson said. "But they're doing those crimes too, 
especially with credit cards." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase here is in line with state and national trends, which indicate 
that women everywhere are committing more crime. They begin their time in 
temporary jails, many of them moving on to permanent prison facilities to serve 
sentences for more serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all talked it over here, because the increase is very interesting," 
said Orange County Asst. Dist. Atty. John D. Conley. "We don't have a simple 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While men still dominate the jail and prison system here and throughout the 
United States, national figures show that total arrests of men have increased 
only 5.2% from 1988 to 1992, while the total for women jumped 14.4% during the 
same period.  
</P>
<P>
 Sue Alvis, inmate records manager for the Orange County Jail, calls the recent 
increase here a "horrendous jump" that continues to push the number of female 
inmates way over the rate of capacity. The Orange County Women's Jail is 
supposed to hold 265 inmates, but so far this year the jail has averaged 329 
women per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvis says the accelerating figures take their toll on the system, while 
fueling the already controversial topic of jail crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We constantly have people waiting for a bed," Alvis said. "You just do what 
you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing what they can often means putting additional bunks in the already 
crowded dorm cells and giving well-behaved inmates an "early kick" by 
automatically releasing them three days before their sentences are completed, 
Alvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the women's jail facilities in Orange County have become so crowded in 
the past few years, jail officials twice a month automatically subtract five 
days from the sentences of all female inmates, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, the number of women in the three California Department of 
Correction prisons has quadrupled in the past decade and increased tenfold from 
1971 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A new women's prison is scheduled for completion in 1995 near the Central 
California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, at the cost of $152 million, says 
CDC spokesman Bill Gengler. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of the women's facilities are well over the designed rate of 
capacity," Gengler said. "We wouldn't build it if we didn't think we could fill 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department study involving 8,000 law enforcement agencies throughout 
the country reported 256% more women in state and federal prisons from 1980 to 
1990, compared with a 140% increase in the male prison population.  
</P>
<P>
 The study recorded that arrests of women on serious felony charges are also on 
the rise throughout America, climbing 32.5% from 1988 to 1992, reaching almost 
63,000. Spokeswoman Traci Snell said the figure is significant but still 
considerably lower than the 452,453 men placed behind bars for violent crimes 
in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Most law enforcement officials agree that the system has begun to crack down 
on female offenders during recent years. They say that today's national 
anti-crime climate has put a stop to any kind of preferential treatment based 
on sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the increase) shows the willingness and desire of judges and 
prosecutors to mete out equal justice for women," says Myron Orleans, a Cal 
State Fullerton sociology professor specializing in criminology. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg says the justice system in 
the county and throughout the United States is getting tougher on all 
criminals, women included. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crackdown on crime is extending to everything from shoplifting to the 
most heinous of crimes," she said. "With the law-and-order mentality, women are 
now going to jail for lesser crimes and doing time they wouldn't have done 10 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Orleans also speculated that illicit drug use may be related to the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have become more vulnerable to drugs, starting in the middle '80s," 
Orleans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter agrees, saying drugs are 
involved in the cases of many female defendants in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that women have gotten caught up in narcotics for whatever 
sociological reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says he has seen an increase in women charged with serious 
felonies during his 12 years on the bench, Carter says the majority of those 
cases involve the influence of a boyfriend or husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're usually with a male, driving a getaway car or assisting in some way," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say an increasingly violent society is also to blame for the 
swelling female jail population. And according to FBI statistical trends, 
violence is an attitude without gender. Records show that not only are more 
women being arrested, but they are getting more aggressive.  
</P>
<P>
 There were 32.5% more women arrested for crimes of violence (including murder, 
robbery and aggravated assault) from 1988 to 1992 in the United States; arrests 
of men for the same crimes were up 21.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county, 1992 figures show that the majority of women continue to be 
arrested for drug offenses, followed by burglary, theft and assault -- in 
approximately the same proportion that they were 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 3,685 female felony arrests in the county in 1992, one-third were for 
drug violations, 23% were for burglary, 17% were for theft and 8% for assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics also show that Orange County men continue to be the more violent of 
the sexes, with an 88.5% increase in the number of them arrested for violent 
crime here from 1988 to 1992. But violent crime arrests for Orange County women 
were also up during that period, soaring 66.2%, according to Charlotte Rhea, 
research analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are more women involved in gangs these days, they still account 
for only 1% of gang members in Orange County. But the aggressive attitude has 
apparently rubbed off on women in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more assaults (in custody) than a decade ago; there's no doubt 
about it," said Deputy Ann Gorczyca, who has worked at the Orange County 
Women's Jail for 17 years. "(The inmates) are a lot more bold. When I first 
started, it was more drug-related," she said. "Now, there's more violent 
crime."  
</P>
<P>
 One thing that hasn't changed in the Orange County Women's Jail, the female 
portion of the James Music Center in Garden Grove and the Intake Relief Center 
in Santa Ana, is the return of repeat offenders -- familiar faces to the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me what they're going to do when they get out, and some of them try 
to turn their lives around," said Gorczyca, one of the 40 deputies, four 
special sheriff's officers and four correction services technicians at the 
central facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once they step out that door, it's a lot different. Sometimes it's only a 
week before they're back, and when they see me, they look the other way. 
They're embarrassed."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; STOP-GAP DRESSES UP DRAMATICALLY; COSTUMED GUESTS AT A 
GALA RAISE ABOUT $40,000 FOR THE THEATER GROUP, WHICH TAKES ORIGINAL WORKS TO

 Dressing in costume proved natural for those attending the 16th anniversary 
dinner for Stop-Gap, a theater company that uses drama to address social 
problems such as child abuse and racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 250 guests at the gala Friday at Le Meridien in Newport Beach 
sported costumes, capes or masks instead of the traditional black-tie attire. 
The $150-per-person gala raised about $40,000 for Stop-Gap. Black Cape 
Preferred 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Stop-Gap gala falls so close to Halloween, organizers decided to 
turn the event into a costume party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop-Gap is theater, and we wanted to play off that," said Ann Crane, gala 
co-chairwoman, dressed head-to-toe in black. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wood, gala co-chairman, showed up in a black-and-white striped shirt and 
whistle. "I'm refereeing the live auction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mad Hatter David Price wore a towering, multicolored top hat with his tux, 
while wife Alicia played the Queen of Hearts, sporting a cape and a headpiece 
adorned with red hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got married on Halloween night -- this is our 20th anniversary," David 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Sheldon, board president, came as Sherlock Holmes in a heavy wool cloak, 
while wife Debbie wore a long plaid dress and straw hat befitting a 
19th-Century English lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a 15-minute job. These were the first costumes we saw," said Sheldon, 
with pipe in hand. Act of Healing 
</P>
<P>
 After a silent auction, guests adjourned to the ballroom decorated in white 
with large crystal bowls filled with floating gardenias, where they enjoyed a 
dinner of roast sirloin and grilled salmon, herbed mash potatoes and a "death 
by chocolate" torte. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop-Gap's mission is twofold. First, the Santa Ana-based theater troupe 
performs original dramas in classrooms to educate young people about issues 
such as sexual assault, AIDS prevention and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also offers therapeutic drama programs, working with the elderly, 
abused children, battered women, recovering drug abusers, children with 
life-threatening illnesses and other groups to help them work through problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who have had power taken away from them," said Don Laffoon, 
executive director of Stop-Gap, who founded the group with Victoria Bryan. "We 
try to empower them by allowing them to act out in different roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the crowd were honorary co-chairmen Roger Embrey and H. Fred 
Mickelson; Mary Ann Schulte, Philip Luecht, Peter Fiek, Barbara Frost, Jay 
Gabriel, Grace Songolo, David and Susan Stary-Sheets, Sophie Hall, Mary 
Hendrickson, Marcia Jager and Lynne Vodra. KATHRYN BOLD

'90S FAMILY; DO COMPUTERS HAVE A PLACE IN NURSERY SCHOOLS?; EDUCATION: SOME SAY 
SOFTWARE STIMULATES YOUNG MINDS. OTHERS ARGUE IT'S A TIME FOR EXPLORING AND 
DEVELOPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Jeremy Rossmann enjoys a good book -- especially on the family computer where 
he can push a key to stop the story and play with the characters. So when his 
mother read "The Cat in the Hat" to him recently, the redheaded 2-year-old 
pressed his small finger repeatedly on the Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mommy, click on the character," he urged. "Why isn't he doing anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy's frustration concerned his mother, Joanna Hoffman, marketing vice 
president for a communications software company in Silicon Valley. "I agonized 
about this because I love books and I want to make sure computers don't 
distract him from reading," Hoffman said. "There is so much stimulation, you 
wonder how they are going to transition to books where no one is singing or 
dancing and characters aren't popping out at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulating, entertaining material helped propel the sale last year of $242 
million in educational programs, the fastest-growing segment of the software 
market. But many experts question whether the large investment in software -- 
as well as in hardware and computer classes -- is necessary or even helpful for 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we know about the very young child's brain is that it is very busy 
constructing meaning out of real-life experience," said Jane M. Healy, 
educational psychologist and author of "Your Child's Growing Mind" (Doubleday, 
1994). "Computers take that experience to an abstract, symbolic level, which is 
not the best way for preschoolers to learn. Too much computer replaces their 
real developmental task with an artificially engaging medium." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents mistakenly associate their tots' ability to boot up a computer 
with intelligence, Healy said. "What adults don't realize is that they too 
could have followed routines and recited isolated facts had computers been 
available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, computer-infatuated parents are requesting that nursery schools 
install terminals in the classroom, a trend that has preschool directors and 
teachers debating how much very young children gain from computer time in 
school. Not all early childhood educators are jumping on the high-tech 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not 100% convinced that computers are appropriate as a learning tool in 
nursery school," said Jane Farish, acting director of Stanford's Bing Nursery 
School, which has one classroom computer. "In nursery school, children need to 
discover and explore with clay, sand, water and paints . . . they need 
mind-engaging activities." 
</P>

 Proponents argue that computers engage the very youngest children far more 
than videos, television or traditional educational toys. "Of the various tools 
and techniques to introduce letters and numbers, including books and blocks, 
the computer is perhaps the most exciting and potentially adventurous," said 
Peter Markovitz, founder of Futurekids, which trains children in stores, homes 
and schools. About 20% of its students are 2- to 4-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts, like David Elkind, professor of Child Study at Tufts University 
and author of "Ties that Stress" (Harvard University Press, 1994), see no need 
to send preschoolers to separate computer schools. "When parents brag to 
friends about how much their kid uses the computer or they see (the) computer 
as a way to hurry kids and give them a special edge, it puts pressure on kids 
and can do harm," Elkind said.

'90S FAMILY; BY WORD OF MOUTH; EVERY FAMILY HAS A STORY TO TELL. BUT MEMORIES 
FADE. ONE SOLUTION: PRESERVE YOUR LEGACY WITH A TAPED OR WRITTEN RECORD OF YOUR 
HISTORY.

 David Weiss never knew. Never even guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day the question came up, innocently enough, as he interviewed his 
grandmother, his beloved "Omi," for a college oral history project. 
</P>
<P>
 How did his grandfather die? 
</P>
<P>
 As the tape quietly turned, Weiss' grandmother unfolded the story of a Jewish 
German immigrant who couldn't afford to send for his relatives before they were 
carted off to concentration camps. They perished there. He eventually thrived 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Koenigsberger never forgave himself his luck. On Dec. 29, 1945, he 
threw himself into the path of a speeding train and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty four years later, on Dec. 29, Weiss was born and named David Walter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was chilling," says Weiss, of Orange, about that moment with his 
grandmother. "I never knew." 
</P>
<P>
 What people don't know about their families for sheer lack of asking could 
fill volumes. And should, oral historians say. Put those stories down on paper 
-- or cassette or videotape -- and you've opened a personal window onto recent 
history, they say. But the greatest prizes are the little sagas the memories 
hold, the threads that come together and show us a bit of what we are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I understand who I am a whole lot better," says Weiss, 24.  
</P>
<P>
 With the holidays approaching, now may be a good time to compile oral 
histories to present as gifts. Or make plans with loved ones to set aside a 
couple of quiet hours during extended holiday visits for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't really when you do it -- just do it, says Wendy Elliott, an 
oral historian and author of several books on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you don't feel as comfortable with it as you'd like to, but just do 
it," Elliott says. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't assume you already know all there is to know, she says; even historians 
find surprises. Elliott's mother was orphaned as a child, but Elliott had never 
given it much thought until a family history interview captured the ripple 
effect it had had on her mother's life as well as on her own upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I interviewed her, some of the feelings she had about losing her sibling 
and parents came out and I was better able to understand how she is today. I 
understand the importance she places on family," Elliott says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Shumway, a history professor at Cal State Fullerton and founder of the 
Oral History Program there, says many people discover family patterns of 
behavior and personality. The good, the bad and -- in modern terms -- the 
dysfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one student interviewed his grandfather. This grandfather 
recounted how his father beat him almost daily. He could count on one hand the 
days when he was not beaten. He really poured out his heart on this. He said, 
'Maybe now you know why your father is the way he is.' It led one family to 
understand how long this trend had been going on," Shumway says. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatness can be uncovered too. Shumway's uncle had been left for dead in an 
Army "stiff room" during the great flu epidemic of 1918. He was saved by a 
friend who laid his head in grief upon the man's chest only to discover a 
whisper of a heartbeat. The friend went on to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The story nearly went to the grave with Shumway's aunt except that he thought 
to ask her about the epidemic, an event seared into the memory of anyone old 
enough to recall that deadly winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But family history can be haunting, too, even if the guilty ones are long 
dead. Glen Creason, a map historian at the Los Angeles Central Library, works 
with genealogists all the time. But an oral history interview with his mother 
added some unexpected flesh and blood to his forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most surprising things was that my mother's grandparents were 
first cousins. Their parents were slave owners and apparently not very 
compassionate, either. The wife felt sorry for them and bought them shoes and 
because she didn't ask the father for permission, he threw (the shoes) into the 
fire and burned up perfectly good shoes. It's upsetting. . . . Basically I grew 
up a suburban bleeding heart liberal. I felt ashamed of it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he grew to admire a grandfather he can barely remember as his 
grandmother and parents told stories of the robust, hard-working, loyal and 
kind railroad man -- even if he did wash and iron all his money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all their fascination, a family's best stories, quirks and human failings 
often don't come up in normal conversation, Elliott says. Or the details will 
be fragmented. Family members almost always must be interviewed in a relaxed 
setting that offers them time to talk. And talk. The result is a focus and 
rapport, Elliott says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really a sense of creating something together," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important key in the process is listening and not interrupting or 
jumping in with another question if the previous one seems difficult to answer, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times we're very uncomfortable when it's very quiet. They're thinking or 
trying to formulate the words," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare well for the interview, says Bill Zimmerman, author of "How to Tape 
Instant Oral Biographies" (Guarionex Press Ltd., 1979). 
</P>
<P>
 List several open-ended questions you want to ask that can't be answered with 
a simple yes or no, dates or places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about what you want to accomplish," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One starter question Zimmerman likes is what a person's name means or for whom 
they were named. 
</P>
<P>
 A few others include: 
</P>
<P>
 * If you could play again with an old, old friend, whom would you pick and 
why? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a story, song, saying or joke that you were told as a child that 
you would like to share? 
</P>
<P>
 * What do you think your strengths are? 
</P>
<P>
 * What do you think was the turning point in you life? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, personal reflections on the Great Depression and World War II will 
be important in many interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joseph Macceca, a student of Shumway's, interviewed his paternal 
grandfather, Victor Macceca, he was surprised to learn that he had never talked 
to anyone about his combat experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started to talk about World War II," Joseph Macceca says. "I still don't 
know exactly what happened. It was kind of touching too. He actually started to 
cry. All I know is that it only lasted three days and (virtually) the whole 
battalion was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 But remember other events, too, Shumway says. The next generation will be 
living many years from the days of the Cold War, polio epidemics, 
black-and-white television, the Kennedy assassination, the civil rights 
movement, the first moon walk and home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to ask about changes in fashion, food, morality, technology, diet, 
work and health practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumway likes the opportunity that videotaping offers to show someone doing 
something that endears them to the family -- such as knitting, cooking, playing 
the piano, painting or gardening. (He warns, though, that videotape has a life 
span of only 10 years, so plan to transfer them to CDs as soon as you can.) 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to prepare the interviewees too. Ask them to peruse scrapbooks, photo 
albums and old documents, such as birth and death certificates, passports, 
visas or other travel papers. That process jump-starts the memories and 
improves accuracy, which is especially important for those who use this as a 
starting point to more in-depth genealogical searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Be wary of misinformation handed down over the years or downright selective 
memories. They are the bane of oral history, experts say. There are several 
ways to deal with them, depending upon the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's a case of fuzzy memory, checking the record books can clear up 
questions, as can interviews with siblings or other contemporaries of the 
interviewee, Elliott says. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the interviewer can leave it to readers to decide. Elliott suggests 
attributing the information newspaper-style with an "according to" while 
noting, "but someone else said. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 People committed to giving an interview usually don't tell deliberate lies, 
Shumway says. Their perceptions of events, however inaccurate, can still offer 
insights because people tend to base their actions and life around what they 
believe to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they think is the truth can be very, very important," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you just have to let it go, Zimmerman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, it's kind of like life. You don't always know the full answer," he 
says. "There's no black-and-white. It's sort of normal. You have to be a little 
bit accepting. You learn a little bit about human nature."

R S V P; HONORING THOSE WHO HELP OUR LITTLEST

 Men were the honorees at the Great Beginnings for Black Babies fourth annual 
awards luncheon at the Los Angeles Hyatt Regency on Sunday. "It is critical 
that we recognize the role of African American men in supporting our families," 
said emcee Barbara Walden. 
</P>
<P>
 Honoree Herbert Carter, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Los 
Angeles, delivered the keynote address. The audience broke into spontaneous 
applause when Carter remarked: "It is refreshing to see an organization that 
recognizes that all African American men are not in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The others recognized by the group were USC basketball coach George H. 
Raveling, actor Dorian Harewood, Inglewood Police Chief Oliver Thompson and 
Col. Clark (Bill) Robinson, president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the 
Tuskegee Airmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was abundantly clear that African American men are a force to be reckoned 
with. They are also, it seems, the best-dressed demographic group in Los 
Angeles. Actor Dick Anthony Williams wore a black tuxedo embroidered with 
bright, abstract African designs, while luncheon committee chairman Ed 
Godineaux was swathed head to toe in orange and purple silk. The women were 
just as chic, whether in Chanel or traditional costume. And this was lunch. 
What would this crowd wear to dinner? 
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings' mission is to reduce infant mortality through community 
education, prenatal care and childhood immunization programs, among other 
activities. As actress Anna Maria Horsford put it, "We have to care for and 
love people who have not learned to care for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen additional awards were presented to health-care professionals, 
journalists and others who have contributed their time and effort to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Virginia Hunter, chairwoman of the Great Beginnings Task Force, read a 
letter of congratulations from Gov. Pete Wilson, and accepted commendations 
from the offices of Mayor Richard Riordan and Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Braithwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 When the scheduled entertainment, singer Carl Anderson, was unable to make it, 
Harewood gamely jumped in, accompanying himself on the piano. He was followed 
by singers Roy Galaway and Ramon Spice, while guests lunched on chicken and 
cheesecake.

<P>
 If the task of organizing and transcribing family history interviews is too 
daunting, you can try an easier, scripted approach with one of several memory 
books available in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure they actually get filled in, plan to make an afternoon or evening of 
it with your relatives.Here are a few to consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of memory books from HarperCollins, including "Grandfather 
Remembers" and "Dad Remembers." Includes such good topics as, "My worries about 
the future were. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * "From Grandma with Love: A Life Recalled for my Grandchild" (Little, Brown & 
Co., 1992). Includes thorough family tree and a page for family diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 * "My Family History" (Long Meadow Press, 1992). Includes forms to itemize 
family heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Grandmother's Album" (Viking Studio Books, 1992). A pretty book. Includes 
such topics as, "Things I never understood about teen-agers then. . . ." DAWN

R S V P; SNUBBING THIS AUCTION WOULDN'T BE CRICKET

 Joseph Marcell, best known for portraying the grand English butler on the 
"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," and Allan Lamb, famous in much of the world for the 
more than 5,000 runs he has scored in international matches while playing for 
England, were talking cricket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really sweating out there because I didn't want to be out for a duck," 
Marcell admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was, but luckily they called it a no ball," Lamb confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the game and others who had no notion that a "duck" means the batsman 
is out without scoring any runs gathered at Will Rogers State Park Polo field 
Saturday afternoon to watch Cricket Aid '94, a pro/celebrity match to benefit 
Tuesday's Child and the Sunlight Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a red London-style double-decker bus parked on the boundary line and 
a considerable amount of blue gin drunk in the VIP tent, where a lunch of 
chicken, rice and salad was catered by Victor Drai's Parties Plus. Many of the 
guests had emulated the players by wearing white.  
</P>
<P>
 The red, white and blue of the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes were being 
waved as the British tried to convince the Americans that cricket is a great 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like all quality things in life, it takes time to learn to appreciate it," 
said British pop star Adam Faith, while around him members of the Beverly Hills 
and Hollywood Cricket Club hastened to point out that actor C.E. Aubrey Smith 
established cricket in Los Angeles more than 50 years ago and that there are 48 
local teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Cheech Marin, who had never played before, found the game to his liking, 
managing to hit 10 runs before being bowled out. "You must have played some 
baseball," Lamb assessed correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Python alumnus Eric Ide wore his cricket whites but didn't play. "I last 
played 20 years ago and even then I knew I was too old," he said, happy to 
languish in the lunch tent with his son, Carey, comedy writers Ian La Frenais 
and Dick Clement, and comedian Charles Fleischer, who was stuck with the task 
of trying to bully an inattentive crowd to bid on various auction items such as 
signed cricket bats. 
</P>
<P>
 One signed by the Rolling Stones went for $575. The bat signed by the English 
professional team brought in only $200. That seemed to prove that in Hollywood, 
show biz is the only real game.

'STARGATE': THE CREATIVE SELLING OF A SURPRISE HIT; MARKETING: HOW TO ATTRACT 
MOVIEGOERS WITHOUT STAR POWER OR NAME RECOGNITION? HINT -- SCI-FI FANS HAVE 
COMPUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By last Saturday morning, "Stargate" was the talk of the Internet. Sci-fi fans 
were digitally discussing the heretofore unheralded film almost as if it was 
the latest installment in the "Star Trek" series. And that was just the way 
MGM/UA had planned it, according to studio marketing chief Gerry Rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything. And MGM/UA has the numbers to prove it. "Stargate," 
which the company acquired in February after production was completed, shocked 
the industry when it debuted to a stratospheric $16.7 million its first weekend 
-- the biggest fall opening ever and the long-troubled studio's best showing in 
almost 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certainly the best box-office news to come out of MGM/UA since the 
studio was revitalized under former Paramount Pictures Chairman Frank Mancuso, 
who came aboard in July, 1993. Since that time, the studio has released about 
half a dozen titles, and its first produced movie under the new regime, 
"Speechless," starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis, will hit theaters in 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Even MGM/UA executives were surprised at "Stargate's" impressive bow. They 
hadn't dared to hope for more than a $10-million to $12-million opening, 
especially because weekends close to Halloween are usually packed with costume 
parties and other seasonal distractions that traditionally lead to a lackluster 
box office. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kurt Russell and James Spader starring in the futuristic, 
special-effects-laden movie, "Stargate" was regarded in the industry largely as 
a footnote on the fall release schedule. It lacked not only box-office names, 
but also a pedigree, such as comic book, novel, TV or sequel recognition. So 
the $60-million French-financed production had been waging an uphill battle for 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich decided to turn proactive by going interactive. Besides a promotional 
tie-in with the computer service CompuServe, the marketing chief made the 
"Stargate" trailer available on-line, a strategy already in use in the 
recording industry, but less so in film marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a captive audience of 20 million home computer owners," Rich said. Many 
of those users are teen-age males, a primary target for the PG-13 movie, who 
are usually hard to reach because their TV viewing habits are erratic, he 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rich didn't stop there. To build word of mouth, there were 200 screenings 
for college students and radio promotions. While most studios produce five or 
six TV ads, "Stargate" had 15 -- all aimed at different demographic groups. The 
diverse spots emphasized the film's various elements: science-fiction, 
adventure, romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 28 was chosen as the launch date, said MGM/UA distribution head Larry 
Gleason, because it was the only fall weekend with no other big releases. Since 
fall of an election year is the most expensive time of year to buy advertising, 
the studio wanted to be certain that every dollar spent had impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stargate" is a crucial first step for MGM/UA to move out of the box-office 
cellar. The film's executive producer, Carolco Pictures' principal Mario 
Kassar, showed about 20 minutes of footage to studios last February in trying 
to secure a distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "To his credit, Frank Mancuso grabbed it," said Kassar, who helped the film's 
financiers, Studio Canal Plus, orchestrate a country-by-country advance sale on 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a film for fall," Gleason said, "to fill in until the new regime's 
first (produced) movie 'Speechless' opens at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA owns only domestic theatrical and cable/television rights for 
"Stargate," an investment that, according to one well-placed source, is in the 
range of $25 million to $30 million, including its print and advertising 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Live Entertainment bought the U.S. video rights, MGM/UA had no fall-back 
position if the film didn't work in theaters. "We wanted to separate the 
rights," Kassar explained, to ensure top dollar. For MGM/UA, it could turn out 
to be money well-spent, giving the studio a viable presence with theater owners 
for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the opening weekend results," Gleason said, "we could end up doing 
$60 million or more." The ultimate outcome will depend on how "Stargate" fares 
under the heated competition from two ballyhooed holiday releases: "Mary 
Shelley's Frankenstein" this weekend and "Interview With the Vampire" on Nov. 
11. Since those releases are R-rated, Gleason hopes to hold with $10 million to 
$12 million in the second weekend. And exit polls tell him that "Stargate" has 
done well with a wide demographic -- and there was already evidence of repeat 
business during the opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll keep checking in every Saturday morning," said Kassar, who is thrilled 
about the opening weekend results since domestic box office can only have a 
positive impact on "Stargate's" overseas openings starting in December.

Q & A WITH DANNY GOLDBERG; 'THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS TO NOT SCREW THIS JOB UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Danny Goldberg, who has agreed to head Warner Bros. Records after a week of 
turbulent in-fighting in Time Warner ranks, wants to assure employees at the 
label's Burbank office that he is not on a slash-and-burn mission.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason Goldberg's promotion is causing anxiety at Warner Bros. is that he 
is succeeding Mo Ostin, who over the last 25 years established the label as a 
stable, creative environment for both artists and employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Ostin, who will step down Jan. 1, reportedly resisted efforts by Time Warner 
brass in New York to "streamline" the Warner Bros. operation by making massive 
personnel and artist roster cuts. Lenny Waronker, Ostin's longtime protege, had 
initially agreed to succeed Ostin but decided last week to leave the company.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who was scheduled to take over as chairman of Time Warner's Atlantic 
Group in January, was offered the Warner Bros. post by Doug Morris on Thursday, 
moments after Morris won a showdown with Robert J. Morgado, Warner Music Group 
chairman, for control of the company's domestic music division . (The 
$5.4-billion firm is the world's biggest record conglomerate). It was Morgado's 
approach that caused a clash with Ostin, sources say.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, 44, was manager of such hit acts as Bonnie Raitt and Nirvana before 
joining Atlantic Records in 1992 as senior vice president. In his first 
interview after accepting the new position, Goldberg spoke about the anxiety at 
Warner Bros. and his goals for the label.

 Question: Before the battle at Warner Music last week, you were to take over 
the Atlantic Group. Was the Warner Bros. post something you wanted for a long 
time? Or did you accept it out of a sense of duty at Time Warner? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Mario Cuomo may have turned down an opportunity to get on the U.S. 
Supreme Court, but I wasn't about to turn down one of the best jobs in the 
record business. The way the job offer came about, however, was very 
unexpected. Until last week I was certain that Lenny was going to be chair of 
Warner Bros., so it was not something I ever even considered or thought about. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very difficult for me to leave Atlantic and all the artists and 
executives I've forged bonds with there. Accepting the job has been very 
destabilizing to my family, but my wife and I have discussed it, and this is 
the kind of opportunity that only comes along once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm reminded of the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. The biggest 
challenge for me is to not screw this job up. My biggest concern is to be 
respectful to the brilliant people that created this institution and to learn 
from them about their company's culture. . . . Mo Ostin's the greatest record 
executive of his generation. I think anyone who wasn't apprehensive about being 
able to fill his shoes should be disqualified from even being asked to step 
into them. But I am taking the challenge on with an inner belief that I can do 
a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you say to people at Warner Bros. who fear job and roster cuts 
and think you've been hired to execute a slash-and-burn mission at the label? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's simply not true. I need to visit and learn a lot before I do anything. 
My plan is to listen carefully to the people at Warner Bros. and absorb their 
experiences and thoughts before I make any decisions. . . . There are not going 
to be any immediate cuts. I am not coming in to cut people. I am not interested 
in that job. I'd rather stay in New York and do what I'm doing now. That's not 
what turns me on about it. That's not my purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it true that the battle between Robert Morgado and Doug Morris got so 
intense last week that you and several other top executives threatened to quit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are certain things I feel uncomfortable talking about without a 
lawyer present, but I can tell you that Doug Morris is the reason I joined 
Atlantic. He's my mentor. He's the reason I am in the record business, and he 
commands my loyalty and my friendship. When Doug was under attack last week, I 
felt like I was under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you learn about the corporate world during that crisis? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I learned the value of personal relationships. You see, I've formed very 
emotional and powerful bonds with Doug Morris and the rest of his team. And now 
more than ever, I'm convinced that the only way to be effective in the 
corporate world is to honor personal relationships and to work at them and take 
them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have a reputation for being sensitive to the needs of artists, whether 
it be the late Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love or Liz Phair. You have acted as a 
confidant for a number of artists who typically avoid executive types. Why do 
you think artists trust and relate to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My mother is a poet, and she trained me to respect the creative process. 
She taught me to appreciate the wavelength that artists are on. And they truly 
inspire me. My relationships with artists have motivated almost every good 
thing I've ever done in this business. The only reason I have a career is 
because of artists. I worked for 15 years as an artist manager, and the one 
thing you learn is that the artist is your boss. Every business decision should 
revolve around the music because the music is the only thing that matters in 
the end. It's the product that we sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There has been talk about a wholesale defection of Warner Bros. executives, 
including Mo Ostin and Lenny Waronker -- as well as top artists -- to David 
Geffen's new company. Do you have any fears that acts like R.E.M. will jump 
ship? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I guess anything is possible, but I have to concentrate on trying to be 
really positive. I had a good talk today with a representative for R.E.M. There 
are hundreds of brilliant people at Warner Bros. who have made that company 
what it is. And I think it will continue to be a very attractive company to 
artists.

STORY OF A CLAN NAMED BRADY, AGAIN; NEW FILM VERSION OF THE TV SERIES CASTS 
LOOK-ALIKES AND SOME OF THE ORIGINAL STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Betty Thomas calls for action from her perch behind the camera, and 
at her command shimmery silver curtains part, music begins to boom to a disco 
beat and six kids dressed in a rainbow's array of fringed polyester jumpsuits 
lope on stage at a high school auditorium in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids sing, perkily, "You've got to keep on dancin' all through the night," 
for the umpteenth take, flashing their white teeth and pumping their fists in 
the air with contagious energy. "Keep on doin' it riii-iiight!," they sing, 
inspiring Thomas to hop out of her director's chair to begin dancing with the 
script supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 It could only be the big-screen reincarnation of America's favorite family in 
bell-bottoms, the Brady Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirping the same sugary pop song that -- remember ? -- helped win the clan 
enough money for mom and dad's anniversary present, the Bradys are set, with 
the release next year of the Paramount film "The Brady Bunch," to become the 
latest in boomer culture recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film, based on the ABC show that ran in prime time from 1969-1974, began 
shooting in July in various locations around the Valley, staying true to the 
show's staunchly suburban roots. Even the outfits from this day's shoot are 
modeled on ones the Bradys wore when they took the road in February, 1973, for 
their concert tour (which was separate from the show). 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the story: A lovely lady (Shelley Long), a man named Brady (Gary Cole) 
and their six children (three girls -- hers, and three boys -- his) live in the 
'90s, while trying to keep both their '70s moral and aesthetic sensibilities 
intact. In the Brady world, mom and dad do know best, honesty is the best 
policy, and there's nothing a home-baked cookie can't cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike and Carol always had time for their kids and their problems," says Long 
of the Brady family values, "And there's such a bond between the parents, you 
begin to understand why they could be so supportive of their family." 
</P>
<P>
 To top it all off, the Bradys still dress '70s: Mike has a perm, Greg some 
far-out sideburns, and all the Bradys sport platform shoes. "Oh Lord, the 
clothes," groans Long, "they made me wear this polyester pant suit which I 
swore I'd burn. I put it on and thought, 'Oh no!' " 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to the Encino home refurbished to look like the Bradys' famous 
ranch-style is like stepping into a time warp: No bars on the windows or 
satellite dishes attached to the roof, a 1971 neon blue convertible Olds 
Cutlass parked in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's this very Brady bubble that's threatened by the reality of the '90s, 
for the house sits on land coveted by an evil real estate agent (Michael 
McKean), anxious to bulldoze it and build a mini-mall in its stead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all three of the original Brady boys and one Brady girl -- Barry 
Williams, Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen -- and original 
Alice Ann B. Davis make cameos, as do three of the Monkees and drag queen 
RuPaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, who played the youngest girl, Cindy, on the original Bradys, plays a 
disgruntled postal worker in the movie. "I thought the script was really 
funny," she says on why she agreed to take the part, "and I couldn't have read 
it with a worse attitude because I thought it was going to be awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of scenes I personally wanted to see. The Bradys were a 
bunch of dorks, lovable dorks, but still dorks. So having us in the '90s just 
as innocent and dorky was great. I always wanted to see someone go up to Cindy 
and say: 'Why don't you know how to talk?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most inspired casting was of the kids themselves, who all bear an 
uncanny resemblance to the original Bradys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of them as the 'real' Bradys," said Thomas, of the ideals she was 
looking for during casting. "We said they're going to have to walk in the room 
and look like the Bradys that we know and love." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Cox, 19, who plays Jan, the tormented middle sister, prepared for her 
audition by watching tapes of the show, dressing '70s and going to a 
hairdresser to achieve that perfect Eve Plumb/Jan look: long, straight 
white-blond hair, tightly pulled back, with a tiny curl on each side of her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I instantly felt like Jan," Cox said, "and my mom kept telling me, 'Just 
remember, you are Jan!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Barnes, 22, who plays Greg, got a chance to meet his counterpart 
when Barry Williams made his cameo appearance, as a record producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first day, the first shot," Barnes said, "and I didn't want to 
offend him, but I had to know how to play Greg, so I asked, 'How geeky would 
Greg be?' Barry was really helpful, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen describes her encounter with the movie Cindy -- played by Olivia Hack, 
11, as "surreal." 
</P>
<P>
 "It really threw me off when she went into character," Olsen said, "she was 
doing a very good Cindy. She had studied it, had gotten the lisp down, which 
for me unfortunately was real." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Christine Taylor, 21, she had a chance to perfect her Marcia Brady 
onstage at the Westwood Playhouse in 1992, where she played Marcia in "The Real 
Live Brady Bunch."  
</P>
<P>
 Once cast, the kids admitted to occasionally allowing the Brady personas to 
seep into their daily lives off the set. "I even scared myself," Barnes said. 
"I was in my trailer looking at my outfit for the next shoot -- flared plaid 
polyester pants with a floral shirt -- when all of a sudden I caught myself 
thinking, 'Yeah, that goes .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although played for humor, the Bradys do serve as a reminder that things 
indeed were glaringly different 20 years ago. James Berg, one of the writers 
brought on to polish the script, said the original show was "really about a 
family that no matter what, stayed together."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To capture just the right tone, Berg and his partner Stan Zimmerman watched 
countless episodes of "The Brady Bunch," an experience that Zimmerman likened 
to an "acid flashback."  
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't just make it campy," Berg said, "we had to make it believable and 
humorous for today's audience." 
</P>
<P>
 For many fans, who themselves may have grown up wearing flare pants or 
powder-blue eye shadow, the Bradys are the '70s, a point not lost on Thomas, 
who says that what drives the movie is nostalgia for an era gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps there's something we're missing that was there in the '70s," she 
said, "a way of life that we no longer support, because it's 'stupid' or 'not 
cool.' "

TV RATINGS; 'CHICAGO HOPE' IS REVIVED BY 'MURDER'S' GET-WELL SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 CBS' "Chicago Hope" got crushed by NBC's "ER" in the Thursday-night battle of 
medical dramas this fall, but it turns out that it was nothing personal. 
Millions of viewers were only too happy to take a look when CBS put the series 
on at a more convenient hour last Sunday--namely, into the slot normally 
occupied by "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed that "Chicago Hope," 
co-starring Adam Arkin, ranked No. 10 among the 93 network programs in prime 
time last week. Indeed, it was the most-watched medical drama of the week ("ER" 
wasn't on). CBS hopes the people who watched on Sunday will now stickwith the 
series in its regular time slot of Thursday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Home Improvement," after being displaced for a week, returned to 
its position atop the national ratings list. It was one of six ABC shows in the 
Top 10, a showing that helped propel the network well ahead of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Halloween episode of "The Simpsons" gave the cartoon series its 
best ratings since Fox moved it back to Sundays at 8 p.m. this fall (No. 27), 
and a "Simpsons" rerun at 8:30 did even better (No. 22). Southland Ratings 
</P>
<P>
 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area 
during the same week. Each rating point equals 50,064 households.

FEW CONFIDENT IN DNA USE KEPT FOR SIMPSON JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Potential jurors rejected from serving in the O. J. Simpson double murder 
trial tend to be better educated and more willing to believe in the reliability 
of DNA testing than those who have cleared initial questioning and are still 
eligible to hear the case, a computer analysis of questionnaires in the case 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 39% of those who were excused said they believed the process of genetic 
matching -- which forms the crux of the prosecution's case against the football 
great -- to be "somewhat" or "very" reliable for tracing blood and hair samples 
at a crime scene to an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to about 10% of the jurors who have passed the initial screening 
to serve on the panel that will consider charges that Simpson murdered his 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, outside her 
Brentwood condominium June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 With no known eyewitnesses to the crime, the prosecution's case against 
Simpson could rest heavily on results of DNA tests performed on blood found at 
the murder scene, in his white Ford Bronco and at his Rockingham Avenue home. 
Simpson's defense team has already attacked the DNA tests in pretrial motions, 
and is expected to try to raise more doubts about the scientific process during 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those excused from service have been removed because of their exposure 
to the media -- not because of their views on DNA. Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito and attorneys for both sides have winnowed the pool of potential jurors 
to 42. The last candidate is scheduled to be interviewed today. 
</P>
<P>
 Other differences between the jurors who were kept on the case and those let 
go: 
</P>
<P>
 * Whites made up nearly half of the jury rejects, compared to 26% of the 
jurors kept on the case. Those percentages were reversed for blacks -- they 
made up 26% of the jury rejects, but nearly 61% of the remaining pool. 
According to the 1990 census, Los Angeles County's population is 56% white and 
11% black. 
</P>
<P>
 * Less than half of the jury rejects said they had dated someone of a 
different race, while 56% of the current jury panel said they have. Attitudes 
toward interracial relationships may figure in the case because Simpson, who 
has pleaded not guilty to the murders, is black; his ex-wife was white, as was 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 31% of those excused said they had experienced domestic violence 
in their household as a child or adult, compared to 19% of those still in the 
running. And 81% of the rejected jurors said they have been crime victims -- 
including one woman who was raped -- compared to 48% of the current panel. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 31% of those excused had an opinion on whether Simpson is guilty 
or innocent, with eight of the 48 saying they believe he probably committed the 
murders and seven saying he probably did not. Fewer than 10% in the current 
jury pool -- four out of 42 -- expressed an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers today are expected to begin weeding out the panel further by using 
peremptory challenges, which allow them without explanation to remove jurors 
for any reason other than their race or sex. If a jury cannot be selected from 
among the 42, about 200 more panelists wait in the wings and could be summoned 
for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Bonora, president of the Oakland-based National Jury Project West, a jury 
consulting firm that usually works with defense attorneys, said the defense 
benefits when jurors who believe strongly in DNA evidence are removed. Such 
beliefs often grow out of media exposure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what you're doing is eliminating a lot of people who have a lot of media 
exposure, it is quite likely that you are eliminating people who have read more 
about DNA and have a basis to have an opinion," Bonora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect, she said, would be a "plus for the defense because there aren't 
people (in the pool) who have already made up their minds that it is 
irrefutable evidence. . . . If you have a large percentage of people who 
believe in the validity of it already, that means the defense would have more 
of an uphill battle in persuading people." 
</P>
<P>
 The question about DNA testing appears on Page 54 of a lengthy jury survey 
designed to determine whether jurors could be impartial. It asks: "What is your 
view concerning the reliability of DNA analysis to accurately identify a person 
as the possible source of blood or hair found at a crime scene (very reliable 
to unreliable)? Explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven of the 41 people who answered the DNA question and remain in the 
jury pool said they had no opinion about the reliability of such testing. One 
potential juror did not answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the responses was the answer given by a 52-year-old female clerk 
from South-Central Los Angeles. "Don't know," she wrote. "DNA very new to me. I 
have no views on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Only four people who remain in the pool said they believed DNA testing was 
somewhat or very reliable. Wrote a 42-year-old woman who lives in Ladera 
Heights and works as a supervisor at Los Angeles International Airport: "Very 
reliable -- from what I remember learning about DNA in college, DNA mapping is 
unique for every individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those 48 people excused, however, the percentage of DNA believers was 
higher. A solid majority of 29 people still said they were reserving opinions 
about the genetic testing, but 19 people said they believed it was somewhat or 
very reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very reliable, that's what I heard," wrote a 68-year-old unemployed woman 
from South Pasadena. Wrote a 56-year-old South Bay woman who makes graphic 
charts, "When a DNA analysis is sent to a lab, the information received back is 
very reliable, that's the reason for having it sent to the lab for testing." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those rejected was the only juror to say in a questionnaire that she had 
actually met Simpson. The 37-year-old Whittier woman, an assistant to an 
attorney for the Internal Revenue Service, said she met Simpson "very briefly" 
when he was "kind enough to say hello and give us his autograph." She said she 
has a "positive" opinion of Simpson overall, but doesn't know whether he is 
innocent or guilty -- although her friends believe he is "probably guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 As a group, the jurors who have been excused are also more educated than those 
who remain, with 29.5% having attended two or more years of college. Of the 
jurors who cleared screening, 12.5% attended college. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonora said it is not unusual to see more highly educated people and 
professionals excused from a case, many times at their request. 
</P>

 "You see what happens when you're in the courtroom, that the computer 
programmer who has a good job and promotional opportunity coming up, there's no 
way he's going to be missing from work," she said. "He finds a way to get off, 
whether it is through his opinions" or some other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Also significant to Simpson's defense team is the removal of potential jurors 
who have been crime victims, who may have unpredictable reactions to graphic 
testimony and exhibits, said Bonora. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may end up with a juror who has a deep emotional scar in connection with 
a violent crime that occurred," she said. "You have to wonder what is going to 
be turning around for a juror as they listen to the hard part of the testimony 
(and) they have to look at the photographs. . . . Sometimes as a defense 
attorney you say, 'God, is this person going to be able to handle this?' " The

STATE COUNSEL QUESTIONS PARTS OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Proposition 187 mandate that police question arrestees about their legal 
residence status would violate constitutional guarantees of privacy, according 
to a state advisory opinion released Tuesday, but provisions barring illegal 
immigrants from receiving social and health services generally conform with 
existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 While bestowing its legal stamp on cutting off such services to illegal 
immigrants, the nonpartisan office of the legislative counsel found that the 
initiative's reporting requirements for health, social service and educational 
programs may violate U.S. guidelines and threaten federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative counsel's mixed opinion, while lacking force of law, adds a 
new twist to the contentious debate about the legality of Proposition 187, the 
sweeping ballot initiative that would make illegal immigrants in California 
ineligible for most state-funded services. The proposition has galvanized 
debate on the issue of illegal immigration and become the central voter concern 
of Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The counsel, which acts as a kind of lawyer for the California Legislature, 
was asked by Assemblywoman Grace F. Napolitano (D-Norwalk) to study potential 
conflicts between Proposition 187 and federal law. The 43-page report is 
strictly a legal analysis, deliberately omitting mention of some of the more 
emotional possible impacts, such as the potential spread of communicable 
diseases among those lacking health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some of the counsel's findings come as no surprise, others add new 
dimensions to the swirling proposition debate while providing legal-brief 
ammunition to one side or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the legislative counsel found that denying illegal immigrant 
youngsters public school education not only runs counter to U.S. law -- as 
proposition backers have long conceded -- but also would fly in the face of the 
California Constitution. The state Supreme Court, the opinion noted, deemed 
education a "fundamental interest," entitling all children to primary and 
secondary schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, however, the opinion found that the initiative's 
prohibition against the enrollment and attendance of illegal immigrants at 
public colleges and universities did not violate federal law. The proposed 
post-secondary educational ban has not generated as much controversy as the 
measure's strictures on enrollment in the lower grades, but critics have vowed 
to fight the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, passage of Proposition 187 in Tuesday's elections would probably 
trigger a barrage of lawsuits seeking to invalidate the incendiary measure 
virtually section by section. Opponents have indicated their intention to 
battle under both U.S. and California law to retain the right of education for 
illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 The public debate about Proposition 187 has focused on schooling, health care 
and public services, but the counsel's report opened up a potentially broad new 
legal front: the measure's requirement that law enforcement authorities -- 
including local police, the California Highway Patrol and other officers 
statewide -- attempt to verify the status of arrestees suspected of being 
illegal immigrants. The names of apparent unlawful residents are to be reported 
to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The "intrusive nature" of such questioning, the report concluded, would 
violate constitutional privacy guarantees and create "the increased potential 
of harassment . . . (of) groups that might be discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
 A wide array of law enforcement figures, including Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, have expressed 
public opposition to Proposition 187, asserting that their already overburdened 
officers would become quasi-immigration agents. Provisions requiring that 
authorities question suspected illegal immigrant arrestees about their 
residence status, critics say, would also sow distrust among immigrants, 
prompting wary crime victims, witnesses and informants to shun police. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 proponents argue that such police questioning is necessary to 
ensure that illegal immigrants picked up by police are promptly turned over to 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization authorities and deported or otherwise 
returned to their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a person has been arrested for a crime, it is the obligation of the 
police agency involved to identify that person because you don't want them back 
out on the street committing more crimes," said Ron S. Prince, chairman of the 
Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince called the legislative counsel's opinion on the law enforcement 
provisions "bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 But anti-187 forces said the new report underlined the initiative's illegality 
and the confusion that would result if the ballot measure passed and was 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, called the legislative counsel's office "a conservative, 
cautious set of attorneys with a bent to uphold state legislation," adding: "If 
they're saying this is flawed . . . what does that say about the legal 
integrity of this measure?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the core issue of benefits, the legislative opinion found that Proposition 
187 provisions barring illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded social 
services and non-emergency health care do not conflict with federal law. That 
finding is significant, but it does not reflect the principal arguments posited 
against those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the crucial funding issue, the advisory opinion agreed that Proposition 187 
probably does clash with federal reporting and privacy guidelines, thus 
threatening U.S. aid to California for health, social and education services. 
Such conflicts could arise, for instance, on proposition requirements that the 
names of suspected illegal immigrants applying for welfare and Medi-Cal 
benefits be turned over to the INS, the legislative counsel's opinion stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the report, in essence, provides a legal underpinning for the assertion 
that California could lose billions of dollars in federal aid if Proposition 
187 is implemented -- a central dispute in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The official California ballot pamphlet says the measure places at risk up to 
$15 billion in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 supporters have disputed the figure as exaggerated, and 
contended, moreover, that Washington would never take such Draconian action 
against the nation's most populous state. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former U.S. Atty. Gen. William Barr waded into the debate Tuesday, 
accusing current Justice Department officials of undertaking an unprecedented 
politically partisan role by involving themselves in a state initiative 
process. President Clinton, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and other top Administration 
officials have gone on record against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real important policy issue and the people of California should be 
able to decide it on the merits," said Barr, who served as the nation's chief 
law enforcement officer under former President George Bush. "Trying to cut 
short the debate with that kind of rhetoric is doing a disservice to the people 
of California." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Taxpayers Against 187, a coalition of groups opposed 
to the ballot measure, asserted Tuesday that their overnight tracking polls 
show for the first time that Proposition 187 may be slightly trailing. Their 
latest poll, conducted by a Texas-based research organization Monday night, 
showed the measure behind by a 44%-41-% margin. The poll's margin of error was 
4.7%, a spokesman for the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, the Los Angeles Times Poll had the measure ahead among likely 
voters by a 51%-41% margin.

COLUMN ONE; TUNING OUT THE HYPE AND GORE; AFTER YEARS OF 'TABLOID' JOURNALISM, 
SOME TV STATIONS ARE MUTING THEIR COVERAGE OF CRIME. IS IT A RATINGS PLOY OR AN 
EFFORT TO REDUCE THE SENSATIONALISM THAT SOME BLAME FOR INFLAMING PUBLIC FEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Good evening, everyone. Tonight's top story is quite simply about fear." 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been the lead-in to any local newscast on any night in America, 
one more doom-laden account of urban butchery and its attendant body bags, 
blood-caked sidewalks and wailing survivors. But in late September, WCCO-TV, a 
CBS affiliate in Minneapolis, shook up the familiar formula of crime and 
violence that dominates local television news. 
</P>
<P>
 After a motorist had been dragged from his car in north Minneapolis and 
fatally shot by bicycle-mounted attackers, WCCO explained to its viewers why 
they should not feel afraid. Most of the region's residents, anchor Don Shelby 
intoned, were rarely exposed to the "clear but limited pattern" of random 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 For a medium that has spent two decades honing and expanding its relentless 
coverage of crime, WCCO's retreat was perhaps little more than a small step 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a year when Americans have singled out criminal violence as the most 
critical national concern, any rethinking of television's obsession with crime 
comes as startling news. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, when WCCO announced a policy to remove violent images from a 
dinner-hour broadcast easily viewed by children, at least two dozen stations 
around the country -- none in Southern California -- have begun tinkering with 
their old ways of covering crime. Adherents claim that they are responding to a 
public weary of hyped crime coverage, while many industry veterans belittle the 
moves as shallow attempts to attract attention and boost ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors at WCCO routinely erase tapes of bodies on gurneys, wounded gunshot 
victims and bloodied crime scenes from the 5 p.m. newscast -- although those 
images often appear on later broadcasts. WMAR in Baltimore edits out gory 
footage from all newscasts and has reduced the time it devotes to routine 
slayings. In Tyler, Tex., KETK-TV no longer airs stories about non-fatal 
shootings and stabbings, once a common feature of its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just tired of being afraid and tired of what we've been selling 
them," said John Lansing, a news executive who pioneered "family sensitive" 
news at WCCO and now manages a larger laboratory for his ideas at the Chicago 
CBS affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Television executives and consultants in most major markets remain suspicious, 
perceiving WCCO's experiments as "a marketing technique," said veteran 
consultant Eric Braun. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the experiments catch on elsewhere may well depend on how stations 
respond to an unresolved question about TV's impact: Does its emphasis on crime 
reflect or inflame the public's sense of insecurity? 
</P>
<P>
 Several recent studies have suggested that crime coverage does appear to 
influence fear. One report released this year by the Chicago Council on Urban 
Affairs found that the city's news stations devoted more than half their air 
time to violence. And preliminary evidence from a UC Berkeley psychiatric study 
of California and Utah children who watched coverage of the Polly Klaas murder 
reveals lingering effects ranging from loss of sleep to a shared sense of 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this research has come in an era dominated by the rise of "tabloid 
news," a style of lightning-paced, crime-dominated local coverage eagerly 
adopted over the past four years by big city stations trying to overtake rivals 
in the ceaseless ratings wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched at a Fox affiliate in Miami almost four years ago, tabloid-influenced 
local news still draws viewers there and in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, 
thriving on a steady diet of sensational murders, dramatic accident footage and 
helicopter-camera views of police car chases. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who analyze television's impact on viewers have repeatedly drawn a bead 
on local coverage as the most influential and pervasive of media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Both newspapers and television's new hybrids -- "Cops" and other police 
reality shows and tabloid programs like "Hard Copy" -- also have been 
criticized for their crime reporting. But local TV's impact is immediate and 
near, lacking the stylized distance of the programs that often cover celebrity 
cases or show police solving crimes. And local news reaches a much wider 
audience than newspapers, sometimes intensifying fears in rural communities 
remote from urban violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Local news outlets fixated on crime coverage rarely "make the attempt to draw 
isolated incidents into any context," said Robert Entman, a Northwestern 
University communications professor who headed the Chicago study. "They 
heighten the public's sense of urgency and danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the daily litany of urban horrors -- in Chicago, a numbing parade of 
murders committed this summer by 10- and 11-year-old children -- convinces 
others that such perceptions are justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of fear we've been seeing can't just be whipped up," said Roger L. 
Conner, executive director of the American Alliance for Rights and 
Responsibilities, a Washington-based public interest group. "People say it's a 
media creation, but it's grounded in our own real experience." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times Poll conducted on crime issues in January found that 68% 
of Americans watch TV news reports of violence almost every day. And 82% of 
respondents said they believed those images increase viewers' fears of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much of what we see on the nightly news is useless information," said 
Brian Baxter, a Minneapolis bookseller who watches local newscasts every night. 
"All you get out of it is anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a common complaint usually shrugged off by local stations. But last Jan. 
10 at WCCO, after hearing that message for months in viewer-complaint sessions, 
news director Lansing ordered his staff to produce a "family sensitive" 
newscast aimed at protecting children from graphic footage of death and 
violence in dinner-hour reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors were told to remove shots of bodies, blood and grieving families from 
the 5 p.m. newscast. That one hour was selected, Lansing explained later, 
because it was "the time our research determined that a lot of children have 
control of the TV set." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitizing a single newscast led critics like University of Miami 
communications professor Joseph Angotti to question "how you think you can do 
any good by cleaning up your act for one newscast and then going wild again an 
hour later?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing said he had "no control" over violence broadcast on the CBS national 
news at 5:30 p.m. -- and that later local newscasts had smaller "family" 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 WCCO's reporters, camera operators and video editors were equally suspicious 
of the sudden move. Those wielding the cameras were urged to shoot the same 
graphic footage they always had. But editors were told to abandon well-honed 
instincts to use the most startling images -- even for only one newscast each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we felt our hands were tied," said chief editor Brian Halliday. 
"This is a visually intensive media and there's not much to work with at a 
murder scene if all you can show are street lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, Halliday has adapted. Asked recently for old footage of the 
motorist's murder in north Minneapolis for the "family sensitive" newscast, 
Halliday used a photograph of the victim. "It's pretty boring stuff," he said. 
"But then, I ask myself, 'Would I want my 6-year-old getting a close-up of 
neighborhood kids wading in the poor guy's blood?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At WMAR in Baltimore, where crime coverage has been moderated, news director 
Jack Cahalan had to suppress "gut instincts" when a fatal shootout erupted at a 
suburban strip mall. Instead of "going live" to the shooting at the start of 
his late-night newscast as rival stations did, Cahalan placed the report lower 
in the show, giving it 45 seconds instead of the standard three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For awhile there, my stomach was churning, wondering whether I did the right 
thing," Cahalan recalled. "But then I realized: Did the world come to an end 
because these two clowns got into a fatal argument? Nope." 
</P>
<P>
 As a ratings tool, the "family sensitive" changes have not appeared to make 
much difference over the past nine months, said Braun, an executive at Frank 
Magid and Assoc., a top news ratings consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 24 affiliates have altered their crime coverage this year. Many were 
clients of the ratings consulting firm Audience Research and Development Inc., 
whose president, Ed Bewley, said: "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to 
see that the public is against the kind of overemphasis on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 When WCCO officials asked viewers in more than 100 informal meetings to 
elaborate on an unfinished sentence, "I hate TV news because. . .," they were 
stunned at the vehemence of the replies. One angry viewer told them "anybody 
can buy a scanner and run around shooting crime scenes." Another said he was 
afraid to leave his home to go to Twins baseball games because of what he saw 
on the news each night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us we weren't giving them perspective, 'You're scaring us, we don't 
understand what the real problem is,' " Lansing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers have been increasingly barraged with half-hour reports dominated by 
crime since the 1970s, when ABC affiliates in New York and Philadelphia 
unveiled the "Action News" format, a forerunner of today's tabloid-influenced 
news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by programmers as a strong lead-in to the network's evening news, 
Action News shows placed "a heavy emphasis on strong, moving visuals, 
rapid-paced reports -- usually 90 seconds or less -- and lots of crime," said 
John McManus, author of "Market Driven Journalism," a critique of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Successful in attracting audiences, the format became an industry staple. 
Consultants repeatedly told station executives that "if you wanted to grab an 
audience's attention, nothing worked like a screaming fire truck or a police 
car with blinking lights," said Jim Snyder, a former vice president for news at 
Post-Newsweek stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that audiences are being hypocritical," Braun said. "But there's a 
genuine interest in stories about crime. People want to know what's going on 
around them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the city that pioneered helicopter-cam coverage of police 
chases, that rationale has kept stations focused on crime. "Family sensitive" 
editing and second-guessing of crime stories has yet to gain a foothold, say 
local news managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to people who work at some of these 'family sensitive' stations 
and they say they spend an awful lot of time talking about a fuzzy yardstick," 
said Jose Rios, news director at KTTV-TV. "They're concentrating more on what's 
permissible than on what stories they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 John Lippman is an independent producer who was news director of Los Angeles' 
KCBS at the height of its tabloid format until he and the station parted 
company last year. He said he aimed his station's broadcasts at urban and 
lower-income viewers whose lives are most often imperiled by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stations that devote less time to crime coverage, he insisted, give a 
distorted portrait of the stark reality of violence in Los Angeles and other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed up drive-bys and other crimes and interrupted programming for 
helicopter chases for a reason," Lippman said. "We removed the middle man, the 
anchor, the white male expert who told people this is significant -- harrumph, 
harrumph. By personalizing crime, we got people stirred up about it and dealing 
with it as an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lippman insists he never heard complaints from minority community leaders. But 
television critics like Phyllis Kannis detect little altruism for minority 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put it bluntly, local stations are exploiting the horrors of the inner 
city to attract their audiences," said Kannis, a professor at the University of 
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities, tabloid formats have stirred considerable resentment. Earlier 
this year, Thomas F. Hewitt, president of the Continental Cos., owners of the 
Grand Bay Hotel and six other Miami hotels, pulled the cable plug on WSVN's 
tabloid-style news reports to its 2,000 rooms because the crime-dominated 
coverage "preyed on the fears of our guests." 
</P>
<P>
 In Minneapolis, black community leader Randolph Staten, a former state 
senator, has challenged stations to reduce excessive crime reports "because it 
makes our entire community look like killers." Three years ago in Chicago, a 
coalition of urban church groups boycotted CBS affiliate WBBM during its 
crucial rating "sweeps." Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest who led the 
boycott, charged that the station's preoccupation with crime left residents 
feeling hopeless, often dissuading them from taking stands against neighborhood 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfleger said he repeatedly tried to build support for anti-crime marches and 
other initiatives only to hear "people tell me 'What's the use? We can't do 
anything.' Time after time, I'd ask them if something happened to them that 
made them so dispirited. And it was always, 'No, it's what I see every night on 
TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Pfleger has seen little change on Chicago's stations. Learning 
that Lansing, the man behind "family sensitive" coverage, had taken over WBBM's 
news operation, he brightened. "There's always room for hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he left for Chicago, Lansing's co-workers decided to give him a 
memento. 
</P>
<P>
 At a going-away party, they handed Lansing a videotape of "family insensitive" 
footage, studded with unedited shots of some of Minneapolis' goriest car 
crashes, murder scenes and police chases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just so he remembers," one co-worker said, "where he came from."

CAN JUNIOR COLLEGES TRAIN WORK FORCE OF THE FUTURE?; EDUCATION: PASADENA CAMPUS 
IS A MICROCOSM OF STATE'S UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS. SOME THERE SUCCEED AGAINST LONG 
ODDS. 
</P>

 It is one of the scariest nightmares about California's future: A once-proud 
state sinks ever deeper into social chaos, millions of unskilled workers mired 
in poverty, a social fabric unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another, happier scenario: Imagine a California that bristles 
with renewed prosperity, its have-nots confident that they have a chance to 
move up, its labor force the envy of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Which vision will prove closer to the truth? 
</P>
<P>
 At Pasadena City College, a diverse array of 26,000 students takes courses 
ranging from remedial English to astrophysics. For a hard-to-track group that 
drifts in and out of school, the prognosis is murky. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite serious budget woes, however, the college still provides motivated 
students an enormous opportunity to move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother was in poverty. My mother was in poverty," says Linda Santana, 
one of the many striving for a place in the brighter picture. "I don't want to 
be like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, California's skilled work force was valued as one of the 
state's great assets, a potent lure for any employer contemplating a move to 
the Golden State. Indeed, California possessed more than a quality work force; 
it had faith that its vast system of higher education would guarantee an 
unending supply of young people qualified to compete in the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as voters prepare to choose their next governor, the certainties have 
been shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic population change is transforming the workplace. The state's public 
colleges and universities face an ongoing financial crunch. Southern 
California's economy has been slammed by recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In the governor's race, Gov. Pete Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown have 
jousted over university tuition and funding. But the issues of worker skill and 
training have been overshadowed by the hot-button issues of crime and illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, experts warn: Unless more people get better skills, the social 
chasm between rich and poor will only widen further, and a frustrated 
population of have-nots will remain stuck on the bottom. California's long-term 
strengths, such as its Pacific location and the presence of leading-edge 
technologies, do not erase the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything else, we've got to deal with that problem if we want to 
survive as a leading state," declares Donald Vial, senior adviser to the 
California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no better place to witness the challenge than on the 53 acres of 
Pasadena City College, a wide-open window into the future of California's labor 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 PCC's students, like the public, reflect a hodgepodge of economic backgrounds 
and educational needs. A few are qualified for elite universities. Others 
absorbed little in high school. Still others can barely voice simple sentences 
in English. Many are looking for a second chance in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 For instructors, it adds up to a bewildering set of demands: Prepare students 
for the university classroom. Prepare students for the shop floor. Teach 
students to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, budget realities are prompting cutbacks in courses and faculty: 
"It constantly amazes me how well we do," declares John Jacobs, a ceramics 
instructor who coordinates programs for teaching teachers on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a sense of PCC's heartbeat, meet a few of the students: "You try to go 
to school in the daytime. Then you hire a sitter at night so you can work to 
pay the sitter you had during the day," says Robin Owens, 25, a single mother 
of two who is studying to become a nurse. "It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Banks, whose course load includes botany, algebra and economics, 
concedes that she has dropped out of school several times. But this time will 
be different, she promises. "I'm not dropping out anymore," said Banks, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Kendall Warrick, 33, peers at a computer screen, recalling 
how an algebra tutor helped rescue his plans to become a radiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know something, they'll show you the resources," he says of PCC 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout California and the nation, many prospective employees do not know a 
lot of things once considered elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission after commission laments low student achievement levels. Millions 
do poorly on tests of simple reading. Employers gripe about the quality of job 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the U.S. Department of Education reported that 49% of Californians 
age 16 and older could not read or do math at levels demanded by contemporary 
society, about the same levels as for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier study, cited in January by the California Business Roundtable, 
found that nearly two-thirds of community college students did not meet college 
standards for reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless such trends are arrested, many maintain, the state is headed for 
trouble: "We cannot compete by following a low-skill, low-wage strategy, 
because the low-wage nations of the world can always make their products for 
less," warned the group, which represents major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others say the claim is overstated. Employers emphasize problems of red 
tape, crime and high costs more than a scarcity of know-how, particularly at a 
time when many Californians are out of work or underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 On this much, however, the experts agree: Fail to get a decent education, and 
you're at the end of the line for a decent income. Chances for a comfortable 
livelihood are dismal. Upward mobility? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 The more people in that fix, goes the thinking, the more anger and 
polarization society will be forced to cope with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger concern is the fragmentation of our state -- that we're going to 
have more division between haves and have-nots, good schools and bad schools, 
good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods," said Russell W. Rumberger, an 
economist and education professor at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 For Californians seeking a second chance in the workplace, community colleges 
are often the logical place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoors, on PCC's busy quad, a timeless scene is unfolding: Students hurry 
between buildings, others chat in little clusters. A group huddles around a 
card game outside the student center. There is the occasional strumming of a 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 But look closely. The student body is 31% Latino, 36% Asian or Pacific 
Islander, 24% white and 8.5% African American, according to records from last 
fall. PCC now offers 120 classes in English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 Other differences from the stereotypes of college life are less obvious. More 
than one-third of PCC's students may qualify for a program that waives 
virtually all fees for the financially needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they success stories-in-the-making? There is reason for hope as well as 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put them in a class where the teacher really cares -- and tells them that 
their future depends on what they do now -- and they will respond to that 
challenge," declares Sam Soghomonian, a political science instructor who 
retired last year after 30 years on campus. "At PCC we've done some marvelous 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students are highly motivated and see public education as their 
best shot at a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always dream that when you grow up you're going to be different," says 
Linda Santana, who still remembers wearing "the same clothes over and over 
again" in a childhood of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal: to transfer to a University of California campus and pursue a career 
in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the friendly, brown-haired Santana begins to cry as she talks about PCC 
and the help she received from a special program that provides mentors, a 
counselor, writing instruction and extra peer support for Latino students. 
"Somebody said: 'Knowledge is pain, but it's beautiful,' she recalls. "And it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 At the community colleges, knowledge also has been much less expensive than at 
universities. Fees have gone up in recent years to $13 a credit hour for most 
degree students, a rate that could mean tuition of as little as $156 a semester 
for a full-time student. 
</P>
<P>
 A definitive measure on how effective schools like PCC are at helping people 
move up -- sort of a batting average of upward mobility -- remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the state's 1.3 million community college students attend part 
time, often drifting in and out of school and never achieving a degree. Less 
than one-fourth manage to get a degree, even after several years, according to 
sketchy data. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the general public knows that less than one out of four community college 
students -- after six years -- gets a degree or certificate or transfers to a 
four-year college, I think the general public begins to wonder: What are we 
doing over there? What kind of education is happening?" asks Diana 
Fuentes-Michel, an official with the California Postsecondary Education 
Commission, a planning agency in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Community college officials respond that such statistics are to be expected, 
given the types of students they serve and the obstacles many face. Perhaps 
three out of four go to school without the goal of a degree, according to the 
chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our population is so different, that traditional measures are not 
appropriate" as ways to evaluate the schools' success, maintains Ernest R. 
Leach, deputy chancellor of the California community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 More worrisome, Leach said, is that the ongoing fiscal squeeze could 
jeopardize the schools' "open door" policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, community college enrollment fell by 132,000 students 
or 9%, due to fee increases and money-saving class reductions. Since 1991, 
15,000 classes, or about 10% of all offerings, have been cut, according to the 
chancellor's office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 PCC, for instance, has trimmed 31 teaching and administrative jobs in the last 
few years. "It's reaching the point where we can't just 'back and fill' 
anymore," said Jacobs, the ceramics instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as planners look for ways to meet students' needs with limited 
cash, Linda Banks is doing her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 By her own description, Banks, 38, graduated high school "functionally 
illiterate." Next came stints in the Army Reserve, a failed marriage, and a 
string of jobs such as manager of an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 As try after try at community college proved futile, she ultimately came to 
see herself as stupid. Then came a profound discovery: PCC counselors told her 
she had dyslexia, a reading disorder. They also showed her new ways to study, 
such as by reading along with books recorded on tape. They linked her up with a 
volunteer mentor on the counseling staff, "someone who takes the time to hear 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after all the false starts, a miracle seemingly beckons: Banks is on 
course to get her associate of arts degree next year and pursue her goal of 
studying hotel management at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 But her dreams don't end as a mere employee toiling for somebody else. At PCC 
she has had a glimpse into a new world of possibilities, and she is aiming 
high. The plan is not "to manage a hotel," Banks explains firmly. "It's to own 
one." State of the State

<P>
 SKILLS: About half of California adults lack the reading and mathematics 
skills demanded by modern society, according to a recent study by the U.S. 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION: Despite the budget squeeze, the state's system of higher education 
and training remains enormous, with 1.3 million students attending California's 
community colleges alone. 
</P>
<P>
 ECONOMY: The precise link between worker skills and economic growth remains in

NEW EVIDENCE HINTS GUNMAN TARGETED CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A note scrawled on a map and statements by a former co-worker have led 
investigators to believe that Francisco Martin Duran, the Colorado man accused 
of spraying bullets at the White House, may have come to Washington to try to 
assassinate President Clinton, federal sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the new evidence, federal prosecutors are considering a new and 
more serious charge of attempted assassination of the President, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is filed, the charge would be in addition to the four felony charges 
Duran already faces in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the new evidence surfaced, investigators had been reluctant to attribute 
a motive to Duran, who fired 20 to 30 rounds from a Chinese assault rifle at 
the White House on Saturday afternoon. Clinton was in the White House private 
residence watching a football game at the time and was never at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The note, scrawled on a map found inside Duran's pickup truck, appeared to say 
"kill the President" but the last word was unclear and may not be a reference 
to the President, a source close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second note to surface from Duran's truck. Federal sources on 
Sunday described the first one as a "semi-suicide" letter that did not contain 
specific threats toward Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The other new evidence Tuesday came from statements by David Millis, 20, who 
once worked with Duran at the Broadmoor resort hotel in Colorado Springs. 
Millis said in interviews Tuesday with the Associated Press and television's "A 
Current Affair" that he heard Duran say he planned to shoot the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran said he wanted "to take out the President," Millis said in a paid 
interview on the television show. Millis added that he had volunteered the 
information to the FBI after Saturday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Millis told the AP in a telephone interview that, when Duran made the threats, 
"I didn't think he was serious. I thought he was full of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to come over to my house and he used to talk a lot about the 
government, how it had screwed him over . . . and stuff like assassinating the 
President," Millis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, Eric H. Holder Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, 
designated the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the lead agency in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is significant because the FBI has jurisdiction in such matters only 
if they involve an attempted assassination. Otherwise, the Secret Service, 
which is responsible for protecting the President, would be the investigating 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A Clinton Administration official said late Tuesday that the Duran case is 
caught in a turf battle between the Secret Service and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Each agency is emphasizing evidence that would give it jurisdiction, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official went on to say that he believes the exact charges may matter 
little in the end because Duran appears to have mental problems and could be 
judged incompetent to stand trial. If so, he would be committed to a mental 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge has ordered Duran to undergo a mental evaluation to determine 
his competency. But the defendant refused to proceed with the evaluation 
Tuesday after his attorney began filing motions trying to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Kenny, Duran's public defender, asked U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson 
to delay the evaluation until after Duran's preliminary hearing. Robinson 
denied the motion. Kenny immediately appealed to Chief Judge John Garrett Penn 
of the U.S. District Court, who also denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing before Penn, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Facciola said that Duran 
had told a psychiatrist trying to conduct the evaluation that "in light of the 
action by his counsel he would not speak to her." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the case said that the preliminary competency exam is 
expected to take place today. The purpose of the examination is to determine if 
Duran is mentally capable of understanding the charges against him and of 
aiding in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 If Duran is convicted of the four counts already lodged against him, he would 
face a prison term of as much as 35 years and a fine of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, campaigning for Democratic candidates, said that he and his family 
plan no big changes in their lives. But he said: "We will be prudent. We will 
be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman "was obviously trying to do something to draw attention to himself, 
not trying to hurt us," Clinton said in a telephone interview with WPRO in 
Providence, R.I.

BRAZIL ORDERS IN MILITARY TO COMBAT CRIME IN RIO; LATIN AMERICA: ARMY WILL TRY 
TO STEM CRIPPLING VIOLENCE AND CORRUPTION. GOVERNMENT ADMITS THE MOVE IS RISKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Struggling to roll back a wave of crime and corruption that is crippling its 
economy and has citizens cowering in fear, the governor of Rio de Janeiro 
turned over control of state and local law enforcement agencies to the nation's 
army Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a two-month agreement between the state and federal governments, the 
army will coordinate all efforts to combat a collection of bandits and the 
estimated 1,800 drug traffickers who have spawned a wave of violence that has 
sent businesses and tourists scurrying from Brazil's most recognized city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 people a day are murdered in Rio de Janeiro, which has one of the 
highest murder rates in the world, twice that of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco, who will leave office Dec. 30, decreed the new 
arrangement Monday after a two-hour meeting with Rio de Janeiro Gov. Nilo 
Batista, who had originally opposed the plan. The decree went into effect 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I congratulate the president, who, with only two months until the end of his 
term, had the moral courage to address this problem," Batista said. 
</P>
<P>
 By going along with Franco's proposal, Batista avoided the president's threat 
to declare a state of emergency in Rio de Janeiro and send in troops against 
the governor's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The army took control of the city's 12,000 police Tuesday morning and began 
mapping out plans to monitor access roads and the city's ports and to initiate 
air surveillance to cut off weapons and drugs coming to the city. Its plans 
could also include occupying some of the city's 400 slums, many of which are 
controlled by heavily armed drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides agree that the use of troops for such activity is risky because 
soldiers are not trained for civilian law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has sent Rio on a downward slide in the last 10 years. More than four 
people are kidnaped daily, and gun battles regularly make slum neighborhoods so 
dangerous that schools are forced to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism revenue has dropped by $800 million annually since 1988. Of Brazil's 
35 largest banks, only one is still based in Rio. And hundreds of the nation's 
largest private businesses have left the state in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat said he hopes that the military's presence 
can begin to turn that around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action will promote generalized disarmament," he said. "It's not 
justifiable that people arm themselves to preserve their houses, their offices 
or their own lives. This is the obligation of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest show of force is not expected until the middle of this month, when 
the army will put up to 50,000 troops on the street to protect ballot boxes 
during a special election for state offices -- except governor -- called 
because of massive electoral fraud in last month's national election. Election 
officials threw out the earlier results. 
</P>
<P>
 The president turned to the military because the nation appears to have lost 
faith in state and local politicians and police, who are often corrupt and 
abusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a newspaper poll published Monday, 58% of city residents questioned said 
they believe that police and bandits are the same breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Army intelligence sources say they have compiled a list of state officials, 
judges, local tax officials and members of the state, civil and federal police 
forces connected to organized crime. The list is so extensive, one source said, 
that "if the names were published, it would destabilize the country." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 police officers are now awaiting trial on charges of murder or 
conspiracy to commit murder, stemming from separate incidents in which 
officers, for hire or revenge, gunned down innocent residents, some as young as 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 When police burst into the Rio de Janeiro home of an organized crime boss four 
months ago, they discovered a ledger that showed scores of police officers, 
judges and politicians -- including Batista and Rio's current mayor -- were 
receiving payoffs.

PANEL BLASTS CIA OVER AMES CASE; INTELLIGENCE: SENATORS SAY AGENCY WAS GROSSLY 
NEGLIGENT FOR ALLOWING ESPIONAGE TO GO ON. REPORT ASSAILS WOOLSEY'S RESPONSE, 
RECOMMENDS STEPS TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a scathing report Tuesday blaming the 
CIA for "gross negligence" that allowed confessed spy Aldrich H. Ames to 
operate freely and for a "seriously inadequate" response after the espionage 
disaster was uncovered last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, the most complete unclassified review of the Ames case to date, 
also generally describes a U.S. intelligence community in deep disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommended 23 steps to improve the CIA, from monitoring alcohol abuse to 
overhauling computer systems so that information cannot be downloaded to 
portable disks or transferred. If many of these steps are not adopted, the 
committee will institute oversight measures or enact legislation, the committee 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel directed the CIA to report annually, beginning Sept. 1, 1995, on the 
intelligence community's progress in responding to the report's recommendations 
and on security and counterintelligence challenges generally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee found a bureaucracy which was excessively tolerant of serious 
personal and professional misconduct among its employees, where security was 
lax and ineffective," the report charged. "And we found a system and a culture 
unwilling and unable to face, assess and investigate the catastrophic blow Ames 
had dealt to the core of its operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The negligence has been both individual and institutional, the report said. 
Virtually all of the institutional breakdowns predate current CIA Director R. 
James Woolsey. But the report specifically attacks Woolsey for the limited 
disciplinary actions that he took against agency employees responsible for 
allowing Ames to flourish and for not putting tougher counterintelligence 
measures in place over the eight months since the breech was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 23 current and former CIA officials held accountable for the Ames 
fiasco by the CIA's own inspector general has been fired, demoted, suspended or 
even reassigned. Instead, Woolsey issued letters of reprimand to 11 officials, 
seven of whom are retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has contended that the reprimands given to four of the officials would 
have amounted to dismissals if the employees had not already retired or been on 
the verge of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Senate report, the CIA issued a 10-page list of actions by 
Woolsey this year to tighten security procedures. "The overwhelming majority of 
recommendations in the report are reflected in the actions (Woolsey) has 
already undertaken or directed to be carried out," Kent M. Harrington, director 
of CIA public affairs, said in a letter accompanying the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate committee, countered 
in an interview Tuesday night on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour: "We have not seen 
these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames caused greater damage to U.S. intelligence than any spy in the CIA's 
history, the report concluded. During nine years of espionage for the Soviet 
Union and later Russia, 10 U.S. Soviet sources were executed, more than 100 
intelligence operations were compromised and several thousand documents were 
passed to the Soviet KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, Woolsey's response to "a disaster of unprecedented 
proportions" is a failure of accountability and a reaction "seriously 
inadequate and disproportionate to the magnitude of the problem," the report 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 More ominous, it warned that, unless a higher standard of accountability is 
established by the director of central intelligence, a repeat of the Ames 
tragedy becomes "all the more likely." 
</P>
<P>
 "Management accountability within the intelligence community should be no less 
than the highest levels found elsewhere in the executive branch," the committee 
wrote. "Director Woolsey's actions do not meet this standard." The report had 
unanimous support of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The report listed a series of serious intelligence flaws that it said have not 
been addressed: 
</P>
<P>
 * The CIA's counterintelligence program is "weak and inherently flawed." CIA 
officers view themselves as a "corporate elite," for example, and too readily 
dismiss the possibility that a spy might be among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Directorate of Operations, which runs covert espionage efforts, is too 
willing to dismiss or ignore problems among its officers, from drunkenness to 
disregard for security regulations. Ames' counseling for alcohol abuse was 
limited to a single session. Ames was let off when he told his superiors at the 
agency that his drinking was not serious compared to others in the CIA's covert 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 * The CIA has failed to fully monitor or evaluate its own operatives' contacts 
with rival or enemy officials. Ames' first contact with the Soviets was at 
their Washington embassy when he walked in the front door. He later failed to 
submit reports on other contacts, which should have raised suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. intelligence community's failure to investigate possible 
penetration by a Soviet agent is "the most puzzling deficiency," especially 
since virtually the entire U.S. stable of Soviet agents was executed or 
imprisoned within a matter of months because of Ames' spying. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, the report also criticized several former CIA chiefs -- 
including William J. Casey, William H. Webster and Robert M. Gates -- and 
directors of covert operations from 1986-1991 for inadequately investigating 
the massive 1985 loss of U.S. Soviet intelligence resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * The joint CIA-FBI investigation launched in 1991 took too much time and was 
plagued by inefficiency. Although Ames was at the top of the list of 29 CIA 
employees under scrutiny, the investigation did not ask for financial records 
for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * CIA procedures for dealing with assignments of employees under suspicion 
have glaring weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Serious flaws exist in CIA polygraph procedures, the agency's control over 
classified documents and its security coordination. Ames passed polygraph 
tests, despite responses that appeared deceptive. He also managed to take bags 
of classified documents out of CIA headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's recommendations called for more frequent polygraph exams with 
little or no notice and for variations in polygraph techniques; greater 
reliance on background investigations, psychological testing and financial 
reports to detect deceptions and reintroducing random searches of people and 
their possessions when leaving CIA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said that anyone promoted to a senior position should have 
served in the counterintelligence unit. It said that poor performers should be 
dismissed, that all personnel with access to compromised information should be 
systematically reviewed and that the CIA should coordinate more closely with 
the FBI in counterintelligence investigations.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEMOCRATS EYE RIPS IN GOP FABRIC AS OWN CLOTH SPLITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the tumultuous midterm election campaigns careen toward a close, Democrats 
are hoping that newly emerging fault lines in the Republican coalition will 
break the GOP momentum and save them from catastrophic losses in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democrats' own divisions may still prove to be the more powerful force 
in determining their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, divisions over abortion, immigration and the needs of 
cities have spurred a recent series of high-profile defections, including 
endorsements of Democrats by the Republican mayors of New York and Los Angeles, 
and opposition to the GOP-backed Proposition 187 in California by national 
conservative leaders Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Democrats have chortled over these public expressions of GOP 
disagreement, less dramatic -- but more endemic -- splits within Democratic 
ranks are casting a longer shadow. Once again, many Democrats are finding it 
almost impossible to craft a message that both appeals to moderate swing voters 
and maintains enthusiasm among their traditional base, especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 From Georgia Gov. Zell Miller to Michigan Senate hopeful Bob Carr, many 
Democrats have spent most of this year attempting to blunt Republican 
advantages among white swing voters by emphasizing tough stands on crime and 
welfare reform and calling for a restoration of family values. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are finding that agenda doing little to spur enthusiasm among 
minority voters they need to turn out in large numbers. To compound the 
problem, most Democrats in contested races still find themselves running poorly 
among white voters as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fair to say that on the one hand we have not expanded our base and on 
the other that our base is fraying," acknowledged Democratic pollster Mark 
Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tide already running toward the GOP, many of these Democrats find 
themselves caught between the need to stimulate that traditional base with 
liberal appeals and the fear that those same arguments will alienate moderate 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a universal problem for Democrats," said Merle Black, a political 
scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic splits are longstanding, unlike the Republican divisions that 
emerged suddenly from a party that displayed extraordinary unity in opposing 
Clinton over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani endorsed Democratic Gov. Mario 
M. Cuomo; Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan endorsed Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein; former First Lady Nancy Reagan joined a parade of Republicans who 
have criticized Virginia GOP Senate candidate Oliver L. North; Helen Milliken, 
the wife of a former Republican governor, appeared in an ad for Michigan 
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Howard Wolpe; and Teresa Heinz, the widow of 
former Republican Sen. John Heinz, denounced Rep. Rick Santorum, the party's 
nominee for the seat her husband once held. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent Republicans recently have crossed party lines to endorse 
Democrats in Iowa and Minnesota. On Tuesday, Ross Perot, an independent with 
many Republican followers, publicly endorsed Democratic Texas Gov. Ann 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 Personality conflicts explain some of these heresies. Giuliani, for instance, 
loathes Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), the patron of Cuomo opponent George 
Pataki. But the splits also highlight ideological divisions that are likely to 
become increasingly visible as the GOP presidential race commences next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsements of Democrats by Riordan and Giuliani suggest that the GOP's 
modest urban revival may produce conflicts with its suburban-oriented 
contemporary agenda. Kemp's and Bennett's opposition to Proposition 187, the 
California ballot measure that would deny some public services to illegal 
immigrants, anticipates battles over immigration and welfare reform at the 
national level. And Milliken's endorsement of Wolpe -- tied to his support of 
abortion rights -- foreshadows a potentially bitter Republican battle over the 
issue in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of these endorsements on this year's campaign, though, is uneven. 
While Giuliani's support has clearly helped Cuomo, North's core supporters 
appear impervious to criticism from other Republicans, and Milliken's backing 
has not revived Wolpe's lagging fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republicans are facing these episodic eruptions of dissent, Democrats 
are confronting more systemic divisions in their coalition. Over the last few 
years, several Democrats who have moved sharply toward the center -- such as 
former governors James J. Florio in New Jersey and James Blanchard in Michigan 
-- have been defeated, partly because their messages failed to generate 
sufficient turnout and support among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Georgia, many Democrats worry that Gov. Miller -- who has emphasized such 
issues as welfare reform and juvenile crime -- could fall victim to the same 
dynamic this year. Last week a group of Georgia blacks led by a Democratic 
state representative criticized Miller for pushing "punitive" welfare measures 
and "a very mean-spirited crime package," and endorsed his conservative 
Republican opponent, Guy Millner. 
</P>
<P>
 With such examples in mind, some Democrats who spent much of the year reaching 
out to moderates, especially whites, now are abruptly shifting their emphasis 
toward motivating dispirited liberal, minority and labor voters in the 
campaign's final days. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, many Democrats are returning to populist economic themes. At 
the national level, Democrats are running ads resurrecting the traditional 
charge that Republicans will cut Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking about values and crime for much of the campaign, Democrats like 
Michigan Senate hopeful Carr and Tennessee Sen. Jim Sasser are now accusing 
their opponents of favoring the rich and contemplating cuts in Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is old-fashioned Democratic class warfare," said GOP pollster Whit Ayres, 
who is working for Bill Frist, the millionaire Republican surgeon opposing 
Sasser. 
</P>
<P>
 In other states, Democrats belatedly have turned to themes intended to 
activate minority voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Gov. Richards late last week unveiled radio advertisements accusing 
George W. Bush, son of the former President and her Republican opponent, of 
insensitivity to minorities. Last weekend, on a campaign swing that took her 
from an NAACP civil rights march in Houston to black churches in Dallas to a 
Latino rally deep in the Rio Grande Valley, she aggressively sold her record of 
hiring minorities for state office and funneling state contracts to minority 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This return to traditional themes carries measurable risks for Democrats. 
Attacks on the rich can motivate base Democrats but repel independents, Ayres 
noted. And, especially in Southern states, overt appeals to minorities like 
Richards' carry the risk of alienating some white voters.

MORE WEALTHY CANDIDATES FILL OWN COFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) has grabbed the national spotlight by 
pouring more than $27 million of his own money into his bid for a U.S. Senate 
seat, but he is merely the most visible example of a phenomenon that is 
rewriting the rules of congressional campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, wealthy candidates are spending millions of dollars on 
their own races. Encouraged by widespread public distaste for incumbents and 
political insiders in general, at least 96 House and Senate candidates already 
have bankrolled their 1994 campaigns with $100,000 or more of their own funds 
-- a 35% increase since the last midterm election cycle in 1990. Nearly 
two-thirds of them are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, self-financed candidates are expected to set new records for the 
amount of money they inject into their campaigns, according to figures compiled 
by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks 
campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these well-heeled hopefuls -- many are entrepreneurs, lawyers or 
physicians -- are challengers who are digging into their pockets to help 
establish political credibility and jump-start campaigns through expensive 
television ads and other paid media. Many are political novices who maintain 
that they must spend lavishly to introduce themselves to voters and to attack 
the records and reputations of better-known opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of some political experts, these big spenders do not appear to 
be paying a price for seeking to "buy the election," in the words of some 
opponents. Even more striking, some appear to be reaping a windfall among 
voters for putting their money where their mouth is, political professionals 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is advantageous to put your money in because voters perceive you can't be 
bought," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who worked for billionaire 
Ross Perot's self-financed 1992 independent presidential bid. "If you're a 
millionaire, special interests can't touch you. You don't need anything from 
them. And if you're a rags-to-riches story, you're golden." 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side is that self-financed candidates who run without significant 
track records of public service can find their business backgrounds subject to 
unusually harsh attacks. Cases in point are Republican Huffington's campaign 
against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Republican neophyte Mitt Romney's 
bid to unseat 32-year Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of out-of-pocket candidacies reflects -- and reinforces -- 
another trend: the skyrocketing cost of running for office. Altogether, 
congressional candidates either loaned or contributed nearly $75 million to 
their own campaigns as of Sept. 30, a threefold increase over the entire 
election cycle a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon of candidates relying on personal wealth is as old as the 
Republic itself. And America has a storied tradition of political dynasties -- 
such as the Roosevelts, Kennedys and Rockefellers -- who have benefited 
financially from familial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, candidate contributions are constitutionally protected under a 
landmark 1976 Supreme Court decision, Buckley vs. Valeo. The court held that 
limiting the amount of private money spent in elections violates the right to 
free speech under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent proliferation of self-financed candidates is provoking concern 
among critics of escalating campaign spending. In 1992, victorious Senate 
candidates spent an average of $4 million each; the figure for House winners 
was $542,093. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly an indication of the plutocratic drift in American 
government," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive 
Politics. "Either you have to be wealthy or be beholden to wealthy interests to 
have a viable political campaign. Essentially, neither of them is responsive to 
the average American." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of millionaires in the House rose 13% in the current Congress to at 
least 72; the Senate figure is at least 28. Even if Congress is moving toward 
John Adams' ideal of "a portrait in miniature of the American people" in terms 
of women and minorities, it is going in the opposite direction when it comes to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The big jump in self-financed candidacies occurred during the 1992 campaign, 
when a combination of anti-incumbent fervor, a large number of congressional 
retirements and the once-a-decade redrawing of election districts created 
extraordinary opportunity for challengers -- including 77 open seats in the 
House and seven in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 122 candidates poured $100,000 or more into their campaigns two 
years ago, considerably more than in any of the previous three election cycles. 
The combined total of their personal donations was $76.5 million, more than 
double the previous figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the practice involves more than just the bottom line. By simply 
writing a check to his or her campaign, a candidate can avoid the considerable 
investment of precious time, energy and fund-raising costs required to prospect 
for contributions from others. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 27 Senate candidates had invested more than $100,000 of their own 
funds as of Sept. 30. The figure is certain to increase during the final five 
weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest self-financers include Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.), who loaned or 
donated $4 million to his campaign. Investor and developer Richard Fisher, a 
Texas Democrat waging a long-shot campaign against Republican Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, ponied up nearly $4 million. Venture capitalist Romney gave $2 
million, and surgeon Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican mounting a strong 
challenge to Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser, donated $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But these expenditures pale next to Huffington's self-financing tally, which 
hit nearly $25 million by Oct. 19. The figure represents all but $400,000 of 
his total campaign spending. He has already set a new standard for the nation's 
costliest Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The scion of an oil and gas fortune, Huffington stunned political 
professionals when he invested a record $5.2 million to win a House seat in 
1992. In both races, Huffington said it was necessary to spend large sums to 
introduce himself to voters -- an especially costly process in a state as vast 
as California -- and to offset the advantages of his well-known opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has attacked Feinstein for relying on powerful special interests to 
finance her campaign. But she in turn has alleged that his company "stiffed 
taxpayers for millions" -- charging that one bankrupt Huffington family 
business owes $6.7 million to California in back taxes, while another defaulted 
on a $6-million loan to a failing bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said Feinstein has misrepresented both matters. But recent surveys 
conducted by the Los Angeles Times Poll show that growing numbers of California 
voters have questions about Huffington's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, a multimillionaire herself, has endowed her $11-million campaign 
with loans totaling $1.5 million. She pumped $3 million of her own money into 
her hard-fought Democratic gubernatorial primary race in 1990, but eventually 
raised $17 million from other donors for her primary and general election 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's House races, 69 candidates topped $100,000 in loans and 
contributions to themselves by Sept. 30. The leaders include Gene Fontenot, a 
Republican hospital owner who has plowed $1.7 million into his bid for an open 
seat in Texas, and Bob Schuster, a Democratic attorney who has pumped $850,000 
into his campaign for an open seat in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, a Republican attorney and businessman opposing nine-term Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), expects to sink about $500,000 into 
his million-dollar campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're willing to put your own money into the race, it establishes you as 
a serious candidate," said Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. "I felt 
funny asking others to support me financially if I hadn't done so myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, self-financing a campaign by no means assures success. Only four of the 
34 Senate candidates who pumped six-figure sums into their 1992 races were 
victorious, and two of them were incumbents. In the House races, 18 of 88 such 
candidates won. Many of this year's big spenders have already lost primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Jamin B. Raskin, an associate professor of constitutional law at 
American University Law School, finds the infusion of individual wealth into 
elections alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process that has grown up drives the vast majority of citizens out of 
political participation," Raskin said. "The idea that a middle-class person, 
much less a working-class person, could run for the Senate in California today 
is almost comic. That's a very dangerous condition when the majority of 
citizens are turned into spectators in a media-driven game."

ICING PROBED AS POSSIBLE FACTOR IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hampered by ankle-deep mud and volatile pools of unburned jet fuel, federal 
aviation officials Tuesday combed the flattened remains of American Eagle 
Flight 4184, looking at icing as one possible factor in the crash that killed 
all 68 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and emergency teams clad in protective hazardous-material suits 
ranged over a mile-wide stretch of wreckage, its sprawl a clue that the 
French-built turboprop commuter plane may have broken up in midair before 
plunging into a rain-raked field of soybean stubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviation officials had not yet narrowed their probe of the crash -- still 
considering severe turbulence and other causes -- but the driving rain and 
freezing temperatures aloft on Monday raised the possibility of icing of the 
wings or fuselage as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service reported "light to moderate" turbulence and icing 
in the area -- with "no remarkable" weather phenomena -- at the time of the 
crash, Jim Hall, the National Transportation Safety Board chairman, told a news 
conference Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface temperature at the crash site was 42 degrees when the commuter 
flight plunged downward at a sharp angle, and was well below freezing at 8,000 
feet -- the altitude at which it disappeared from air traffic controllers' 
radar screen at 3:56 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR-72, a twin-engine craft used throughout the aviation world, does not 
have a known history of safety problems. But its precursor -- a smaller version 
of the same plane -- did, according to knowledgeable officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 42 had a well-known icing problem. When they built the 72, we don't know 
whether they fixed it or not," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Martell, a spokesman for American Eagle, a commuter arm of American 
Airlines, said that in 1987, an ATR-42 flown by a European airline developed 
icing problems and crashed in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 When temperatures approach freezing levels and humidity is high, ice can build 
up on the wings and fuselage of an aircraft in thicknesses that may be all but 
undetectable to the naked eye. The accumulating ice can distort the shape of a 
wing, reducing its ability to lift, and the added weight can overburden the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Icing, however, was only one of several factors considered Tuesday by NTSB 
investigators. Analysts also were intrigued by the spread of the plane's 
wreckage -- which hints at midair disintegration -- and reports of severe 
windstorms at about 9,000 feet, where the plane began its fatal plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schiff, a veteran airline pilot who has assisted in major crash 
investigations, said a combination of severe turbulence and the strains put on 
the plane by efforts to control the aircraft could have caused a breakup that 
scattered the plane over such a wide radius. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said that both of the plane's "black boxes" 
had been recovered and sent to Washington for analysis. One, the cockpit voice 
recorder, provides a readout of pilot conversations and other sounds in the 
half an hour before the crash. The flight data recorder is expected to provide 
information on 100 technical aspects of the flight, ranging from airspeed and 
altitude to the craft's course. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both devices were severely battered in the crash, the recording 
systems from both are in good condition and should provide important clues 
about what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 At the crash site Tuesday, the first examination of the wreckage proceeded 
slowly, as search teams took pains to avoid spilled jet fuel and other 
contaminants. The previous day's slanting rain was gone, replaced by sunny 
skies that provided little warmth to those trudging through the muddy field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going the way it should, but we've learned from recent crashes that we 
have to be careful every step of the way," said Jack Scott, an Indiana 
Emergency Management field coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Unburned fuel posed a hazard both because of its flammability and because of 
its noxious fumes, Scott said. Officials planned to use foam to render the fuel 
harmless, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators could only approach the cordoned-off crash site in blue and 
white hazard suits, wearing disposable masks and gloves. Crews were 
decontaminated in mobile antiseptic chambers before leaving the site to avoid 
infection by blood-borne diseases -- a practice pioneered after the September 
crash of a Boeing 737 near Pittsburgh, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Those returning from the Indiana crash scene said much of the remains was 
unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was shredded," said Les Smith, 49, who returned, shaken, from the 
crash site minutes after the plane fell with a thunderous boom. "There was a 
piece of a wing, a piece of the tail, a big round piece -- and other than that, 
just a hole in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The grim job of removing the mangled remains of the victims will begin today, 
Hall said. A makeshift morgue is being set up at an armory in the nearby town 
of Remington. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that specialists from the FBI will join local coroners' officials in 
the arduous task of identifying the fragmented bodies. The work will take 
weeks, officials said.

O.C. OFFICER DIES AFTER CRASH; DRIVER ARRESTED; ACCIDENT: POLICE SAY SUSPECT 
WAS DRUNK WHEN HE RAN A RED LIGHT AT 60 M.P.H. AND COLLIDED WITH PATROL CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A police officer on routine patrol was fatally injured when a drunk-driving 
suspect ran a red light and smashed into his cruiser, demolishing it and 
pinning the officer inside, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Osornio, 26, a former contractor who joined the La Habra 
Police Department 14 months ago and was recently engaged to be married, 
succumbed to internal injuries an hour after the collision at 9:22 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio became the first officer on the city's police force to be killed on 
duty. Thirty-two officers have been killed on duty in Orange County since 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to have known him. Being a policeman was one of his dreams," said 
Robert Skipper, father of Osornio's fiancee, Chartina Skipper. "He wanted to be 
a police officer so much, he would have done it for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Marco Villegas Ramirez, 51, of La Mirada on suspicion of 
murder, Capt. Terry Rammell said. Ramirez, who was in stable condition at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with facial injuries, was found to have a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.18% -- more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, 
Rammell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car that struck and killed Osornio was traveling at least 60 m.p.h. and 
weaving along Beach Boulevard, prompting a witness to telephone police even as 
the collision occurred, Rammell said. Police said witnesses reported seeing the 
vehicle bouncing off the curb as it sped north on Beach before colliding with 
Osornio's westbound cruiser at the intersection of Beach and La Habra 
Boulevard, Rammell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's co-workers described him as a quiet, fatherly figure who never 
joined colleagues for drinks after work and often warned them against drinking 
and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers, he never drank in excess. I only 
saw him drink two beers at the most," said Marc Maligalig, a co-worker at 
Lindblade Metalworks Inc. in La Mirada. "All of us are pretty devastated. But I 
feel worse for the family of the police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Police who received calls reporting the crash did not know at first that it 
involved one of their own. A dispatcher radioed Osornio to send him to the 
scene, but he did not respond, said police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp. Officer 
Kari Armstrong, the second officer sent to the accident, arrived to find her 
injured colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Mike, come on, wake up, wake up.' And the guy didn't respond or 
anything," said Victorio Toscano, a clerk at a nearby auto parts store who ran 
to the scene of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the spot had been turned into a memorial site as fellow officers 
and city residents stopped to place flowers and pay respects to Osornio, 
described as a hard-working cop gifted with keen instincts and a wry wit. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1986 graduate of Walnut High School in Walnut, Osornio made good on a 
longtime dream to become a police officer when he put himself through the 
police academy at Golden West College last year and was hired soon afterward 
for the 70-member force in La Habra. Around the station house, he was 
frequently consulted for his carpentry knowhow and renowned for a dry sense of 
humor, colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie officer, Osornio distinguished himself through his role in a team 
arrest of a rape suspect this year, Rammell said. Another time, Osornio chatted 
up a driver he had stopped long enough to find out the man was on parole. A 
search of the car turned up enough evidence to make an arrest for drugs and 
weapons possession, said Sgt. Jeff Love, Osornio's supervisor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio had moved with his family four years ago to Chino, where neighbors 
described him as helpful, outgoing and well-liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real nice, easygoing guy," said John Whiteman, 37, who lives across 
the street from Osornio's parents and had seen Osornio on Monday afternoon 
stopping on his way to work. "He would wave to you all the time and if he saw 
you working; he'd always stop and ask if you needed help." 
</P>
<P>
 Skilled with his hands like his father, a professional bricklayer, Osornio 
could often be seen helping out with family construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a really close family," Whiteman said. "Sunday was family day. You'd 
always see them out doing things together." 
</P>
<P>
 The young officer, a boating and water-skiing enthusiast who remodeled old 
houses, recently moved in with his high school sweetheart, Chartina Skipper, 
who owned a home in nearby Montclair. The two planned to marry soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddled in the front yard of Osornio's parents' sprawling, ranch-style home in 
Chino, clusters of the officer's longtime friends hugged his father, who at 
times was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Osornio wept when approached by a reporter outside the home. "What can 
I say?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Robledo, who grew up with Osornio, added: "Mike was one of my closest 
friends and I'm going to miss him. He died a hero in my eyes." At the time of 
the crash, Osornio was about an hour into his overnight shift patrolling the 
city's southwest corner. His evening had been uneventful until the collision, 
Rammell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators sought Tuesday to determine where Ramirez, a sheet-metal worker 
who they said had never been arrested for drunk driving, had been before the 
crash. Ramirez received two traffic tickets -- one for failure to signal in 
1992 and one for speeding in September -- and was involved in a car accident 
last year, according to court records and the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident alien who had been employed at the small metal-working plant for 
four years, Ramirez had a solid work record but had been beset by personal 
problems in recent months, said Marilyn Lindblade, owner of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-worker Maligalig said Ramirez was "trying to pull his life together, trying 
to build something, helping his son go to school and stay out of trouble. He 
was being a good father to his son. He lives for his children." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez told colleagues he had been evicted from a Monterey Park apartment 
about six months ago because of problems with his son's friends, who were 
considered troublemakers by the landlord, Lindblade said. Before that, 
Ramirez's wife and two grown sons returned to Hidalgo, Mexico, to take over the 
family business after her father died, Lindblade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ramirez had been sleeping on a couch in a vacant office at the 
company, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindblade said Ramirez took the afternoon off Monday to talk to his son. "He 
left at noon and came back in the afternoon. He wasn't drunk then, and didn't 
seem to be upset or in a bad mood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers said they did not know whether he left later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely an accident. It's totally out of character," Lindblade 
said. "He did not drink, smoke or do drugs. He didn't go in for that sort of 
thing. He was not a party-type person." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra police and residents spent much of Tuesday comforting each other. 
Officers wore narrow black bands across their badges in memory of their fallen 
comrade -- the second Southland officer to be mourned in a little more than a 
week after falling line of duty. Officers wore the same bands in memory of a 
Los Angeles police officer who was shot dead Oct. 21 while investigating 
possible drug dealing at a Hollywood motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've had to wear one for my own officer," Rammell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby at the city's police station, decorated with a photograph of 
Osornio, was decked with bouquets of flowers brought by residents. A memorial 
fund in Osornio's name was being established at a local bank, officials said. 
Donations may be sent to the Michaal Osornio Memorial Fund, Sanwa Bank, 2015 W. 
La Habra Blvd., La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. John Rees, one of a group of officers visiting Osornio's parents 
Tuesday, said a psychologist would be on hand Tuesday night to counsel officers 
who were at the scene. "The La Habra Police Department is a small, 
family-oriented police department," he said. "I know the names of all the 
people who work for me and I know the names of their wives. When a tragedy like 
this hits, it's a significant event in the life of the department. The officers 
will remember Mike for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Even strangers joined the mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of four Sanwa employees visited the crash site at lunch time Tuesday. 
Only one of them had ever met Osornio, but that seemed to matter little. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very small community," said one of the bank workers, Ada Gaughan. 
"Things that go on here affect everyone in the community -- a police officer 
particularly. They're friends here. They're not the enemy." 
</P>

 Times staff writers Anna Cekola, David Haldane, Rene Lynch, Susan Marquez Owen 
and Martin Miller contributed to this report.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON OUTSPENDS FEINSTEIN 3 TO 1 ON 
TELEVISION ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and DWIGHT MORRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outspending incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein by nearly 3 to 1 on television 
advertising, Republican Mike Huffington has poured a record $20 million into 
such commercials so far in his campaign for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 No candidate in the history of congressional elections has come close to 
spending even half as much as Huffington on TV ads, according to a review of 
federal election records. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington gave his campaign $2.5 million last week, bringing his total 
contributions to $27.3 million -- the most ever by a Senate candidate, 
according to documents made available by the Federal Election Commission on 
Tuesday. Adding in the $11 million spent by Feinstein, the California Senate 
race already ranks as the most expensive in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability of the Santa Barbara tycoon to tap his estimated $70-million oil 
fortune gives him a huge advantage over Feinstein, who is spending substantial 
sums of money to raise funds. This is especially critical, political experts 
say, now that Huffington is seeking to recover from recent disclosures that he 
hired an illegal immigrant to care for his two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the money to try to overcome it," said Herbert Alexander, a USC 
political scientist. "That is the point. It is not a situation where, if he was 
dependent on money from others and his campaign got into trouble, the money 
would dry up. The money hasn't dried up because it's his money." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Huffington has spent virtually nothing to raise money, he had sunk 
$20,016,562 into broadcast advertising through Oct. 19. That accounts for 
nearly 80% of his overall spending. Feinstein has invested $7 million in 
broadcast ads, or 63% of her overall expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money used for TV commercials in previous high-spending Senate 
races pales in comparison to Huffington's expenditures. Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) led all Senate candidates in outlays for broadcast advertising in 1990 
with $5 million, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) spent the most in 1992 with 
$5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Virginia Senate candidate Oliver North has raised the most money -- 
$17.6 million -- after Huffington. But because North has been forced to spend 
$9.2 million on direct-mail fund raising, his campaign has placed only $3.2 
million into developing and placing broadcast ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign official Ken Khachigian argues that the Santa Barbara 
congressman has spent less TV money per vote than other wealthy Senate 
candidates. Helms spent $2.47 on media for each of the 2 million votes cast in 
North Carolina in 1992. Assuming that the turnout in California approaches the 
9.9 million votes cast in 1992, Huffington so far has spent about $2.01 per 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In a normal year, Feinstein's $7 million in broadcast advertising expenses 
would be considered enormous. In knocking off incumbent Sen. John Seymour in 
1992, she spent only $3.3 million on television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no ordinary election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's broadcast advertising costs are nearly half as much as the $46.1 
million spent by all Senate incumbents in 1992. Moreover, many political 
experts predict that Huffington could surpass $30 million before the election 
is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's media blitz has included payments of $19.5 million to Farrell 
Media of New York for placing his television and radio spots. Gannon, McCarthy, 
Mason of Washington has billed Huffington $220,000 for creating the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also has spent $611,147 on polling, or more than four times the 
amount that Senate incumbents in hotly contested races spent in 1992. While 
large sums are used to measure Huffington's public standing, the polling money 
undoubtedly has allowed his campaign to test its advertising message with focus 
groups to a degree unmatched by any other candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented TV spending permitted Huffington to breeze to an easy 
primary victory in June over Republican William E. Dannemeyer and to catch up 
to Feinstein in statewide polls by establishing name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the edge that comes with having an open checkbook may be reduced during 
the final week of the campaign as political candidates in all statewide races 
compete to purchase prime-time advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing (Huffington) is going to run into is that the inventory stations 
have becomes very limited," said Edward Blakely, a Republican media consultant 
in Washington. "I don't care how much money you have. There's only so much time 
you can buy."

NEWS ANALYSIS / CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; CHARTING WILSON'S TRANSFORMATION ON 
IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Wilson is mad as hell about illegal immigration. Sound familiar? 
California voters can hardly avoid hearing that clear, simple message. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim-faced, doughty governor flays the federal government for failed 
immigration polices, he advocates a state ID card, he warns that the state is 
being crushed by the financial and social costs of millions of immigrants 
sweeping across the Mexican border. He also vigorously supports Proposition 
187, the November ballot measure to deny health and education benefits to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In election year 1994, there is no question where Gov. Wilson stands on 
illegal immigration. But back in the mid-1980s, U.S. Sen. Wilson stressed a 
different set of views. His words and deeds from that era stand in vivid 
contrast to the anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric that forms the central pillar 
of his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Wilson subscribed to the argument that California growers needed large 
numbers of temporary migrant workers to bring in the state's bountiful crops. 
With the perseverance he is known for, Wilson worked hard to ensure the steady 
flow of such cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders often shift and shade their platforms to adapt to changing 
moods in the electorate and to changing circumstances in society. But Wilson's 
current focus against illegal immigration leaves him vulnerable to charges from 
critics that he has undergone a recent conversion on the state's most emotional 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic gubernatorial challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, has 
been one ready critic: "Pete Wilson is the deadbeat dad of illegal immigration 
and we have the DNA to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has seized upon Wilson's well-marked trail of legislative efforts and 
charged him with hypocrisy -- flip-flopping on the immigration issue because it 
suits the California political environment in which he seeks reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson insists his record has remained steady over the years and that Brown is 
distorting it for her own desperate political needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "His position has not evolved," said Leslie Goodman, a Wilson immigration 
spokesman. "What has changed is an . . . increase in public anger (over the 
issue) that has strengthened his resolve. To suggest his position has changed 
is a phony charge." 
</P>
<P>
 The record shows that as senator, Wilson was a hero to California agricultural 
interests for his tough legislative fight to include a guest-worker program in 
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the pivotal reform 
legislation that instituted employer sanctions and offered amnesty to many 
undocumented workers already in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers had long fought employer sanctions as a threat to their cheap labor 
pool of undocumented workers. But in the 1980s the growers realized that 
Congress was warming to the concept. In a strategic shift, they focused on 
getting a guest worker provision inserted in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was their legislative spear carrier in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Wilson was a tireless and skillful champion (of the guest worker 
program) throughout the legislative process in the face of intense criticism," 
according to a December, 1986, newsletter of the Farm Labor Alliance, a 
coalition of agricultural groups. "In summary, agriculture owes Sen. Wilson its 
gratitude for protecting its interests. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson benefited from his relationship with agricultural interests. He had 
received nearly $520,000 from farm-related political action committees in the 
1980s, according to the National Library on Money and Politics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand Wilson's record on illegal immigration in the 1980s, it is 
necessary to understand how California has changed over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 California in the 1980s -- pre-recession, pre-base closings, pre-defense cuts 
-- was a different world economically. The state's reliance on undocumented 
workers to perform a wide variety of tasks -- many tied to the state's enormous 
agricultural enterprises -- was widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 When the economy was more robust, the benefits of hiring illegal immigrants 
seemed to outweigh the potential problems caused by a large influx of 
undocumented temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, while campaigning for the Republican nomination for his first term in 
the Senate, Wilson told a Costa Mesa real estate gathering: 
</P>
<P>
 "I deplore the (Immigration and Naturalization Service) raids on farms here in 
the roundup of illegal aliens. Our economy needs such workers, and I'm for a 
guest worker program to allow such farmhands to come in to do the work when 
Americans won't take the jobs." Wilson also criticized a Reagan Administration 
proposal to bring in only 50,000 Mexican guest workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the Senate, Wilson co-authored a 1983 provision that required the INS 
to get warrants from judges before checking fieldworkers' citizenship. The INS 
fought the move, saying it would all but end enforcement efforts. But Wilson 
said it was necessary to provide "timely harvests" and argued that agriculture 
was being singled out for such raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also made good on his campaign promise about the guest worker program, 
even though the Reagan Administration's INS commissioner, Alan Nelson, who is 
one of the sponsors of Proposition 187, viewed the growers' complaint about 
labor shortages with skepticism. "There's been some panic, which may or not be 
based on reality, and some hype," Nelson was quoted at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Wilson threatened to filibuster the immigration reform bill if the 
Senate refused to streamline procedures that growers had to follow in order to 
import such workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsor, Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), had long fought for 
restrictions on the numbers of immigrants allowed into the United States and 
strongly opposed including the guest worker plan in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Wilson, the freshman Republican senator from California, who led 
the floor fight to tack on some form of guest worker program. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushed for an amendment that would allow 350,000 temporary farm workers in 
the country. It was defeated 50-48 on Sept. 13, 1985. But five days later, 
after intense lobbying from Wilson and agricultural interests, the Senate 
reversed itself and approved the amendment 51 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, battle-scarred after years of pushing for immigration reforms, said 
the program would "repeat the most serious errors we have ever made in our 
immigration policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's plan faced strong opposition in the House because it required 
that the workers return home each year, withheld a portion of their wages until 
they did so and prohibited workers from obtaining public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats, fearing that the workers would be easily exploited under 
those rules, devised a more liberal plan -- the Special Agricultural Workers 
(SAW) program -- that offered more protection and legal residency to the 
workers. Today, Wilson blames the changes in the House for all the faults in 
the special workers program. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Wilson, according to the Farm Labor Alliance newsletter, had to 
head off a last-minute filibuster from Senate conservatives up in arms over the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration bill, including the special workers program, passed the Senate 
on Oct. 17, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But much went wrong with the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Ripe for 
fraud and abuse, the special workers program attracted more than 1 million 
seasonal workers, most locating in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who helped hammer out the compromise 
on the program, recalled Wilson's legislative pragmatism on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson as a senator wanted one primary thing out of the immigration law: that 
agriculture could get their foreign workers," Berman said. With the "Wilson 
amendment" facing strong opposition, he "signed on (to the special worker 
program), without ever uttering a word about (the economic effects) to counties 
and cities. What was done then helped create the problems that he lambastes 
now," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the immigration reform law was enacted, Wilson wrote to President Reagan 
in October, 1987, asking him to ease the eligibility for special worker 
program. The rules required the workers to present proof that they had worked a 
certain number of days harvesting perishable crops before entering the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wrote that the rules were "cumbersome" and urged that illegal workers 
be allowed entry if they make a "non-frivolous" application for the special 
status by agreeing to provide necessary documentation later. Wilson said 
relaxation of the rules was needed to "avoid the disaster of fruit rotting on 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may seem inconceivable in today's political atmosphere, Wilson, as 
a 1990 gubernatorial candidate, was eager to tout his Senate efforts on behalf 
of agricultural interests -- "a political coup," a campaign booklet proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Wilson became governor, his immigration stance began to harden. Faced 
with dire state budget realities, a faltering economy and an increasingly angry 
electorate, Wilson began to view the immigration as a major source of the 
state's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July, 1991, letter to members, the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform highlighted Wilson's change of heart. The federation, which advocates a 
moratorium on legal immigration, is one of the most conservative immigration 
reform groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, signed by Executive Director Dan Stein, praised Wilson for calling 
immigration a "prime contributor to California's and the nation's budget woes." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group also tweaked Wilson for his 1985 amendment, which the federation 
strongly opposed, "that allowed 1.3 million illegal alien seasonal agricultural 
workers to qualify for amnesty." 
</P>
<P>
 The federation said Wilson had "learned the hard way how federal inattention 
to immigration policy can cause havoc with state treasuries. . . . We wish he 
had listened to our warnings and predictions years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In early August, 1993, with his popularity at record lows and facing tough 
prospects for reelection, Gov. Wilson outlined a sweeping immigration reform 
plan that called for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to the 
U.S.-born children of illegal residents. He also called on the federal 
government to cut off health and education benefits for illegal immigrants and 
prepare a tamper-proof identification card. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's transformation was complete: He had emerged as one of the most 
vociferous foes of illegal immigration on the national stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, the Wilson spokesman, vigorously defends Wilson against the 
contention that his immigration views have shifted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important, the guest worker program Pete Wilson proposed was never voted 
on in the House and never became law. It was hijacked, liberalized and forced 
to the House floor for vote. Yes, he voted for the final IRCA (that contained 
the special worker program), but do you forgo (voting for) the entire package, 
when it has employer sanctions for the first time and INS budget increases? 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a hold-your-nose-and-vote situation. The suggestion that his pursuit 
of a temporary guest worker program (then) reflects a change in attitude (now) 
is simply untrue," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Berman's recollection? Goodman has called the liberal Democrat "part of 
the cabal that . . . cut a back-room deal to create the loophole which, 
ironically, Wilson is wrongly accused by his critics of having created." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Wilson is playing immigration hard ball, the federation's Stein takes 
a mellower view. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have a change of heart, he had a change of perspective. Once you 
preside over the financial health of a state like California, you recognize 
very quickly that you can't be a good governor without raising the 
(immigration) issue. To cast Wilson as flip-flopping on immigration is simply 
not fair."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN, WILSON SWAP ATTACKS ON PROP. 187, CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown and Republican Pete Wilson entered the final week of 
their campaign for governor with sniping assaults on each other, Brown once 
again setting her sights on the governor's support of the anti-illegal 
immigrant Proposition 187 and Wilson declaring his challenger a no-show in the 
longtime fight to toughen the state's criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied for part of the day by Vice President Al Gore, state Treasurer 
Brown decried Wilson as a bully who had taken aim at a vulnerable, politically 
unpopular segment of society in supporting the immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you tired of bullies? Aren't you tired of people who bash?" she asked 
supporters at a rally in San Bernardino. Brown dismissed the initiative, 
labeled SOS -- "Save Our State" -- by its proponents, as "Snoop or Snitch." 
</P>
<P>
 In angry tones, Gore added his voice to those of national leaders who have 
weighed into the statewide battle over the controversial proposition. He 
broadened his attack to include both Wilson and the Republican U.S. Senate 
candidate, Mike Huffington, who is battling incumbent Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout American history and throughout world history, you will find 
examples of people who are bereft of ideas, who have failed at governing . . . 
coming up with the strategy of scapegoating groups that they can characterize 
as different or outside the group they're appealing to," the vice president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not worthy of California. It is not worthy of the United States of 
America. It's a disgraceful campaign tactic, and it ought to be rejected by the 
people of California and the people of our country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What California needs," Gore added, "is not 'Nuevo apartheid.' California 
needs a good governor and a reelected senator, Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, as she traveled in a small private jet up California's 
Central Coast, Brown repeatedly demanded that Wilson explain -- before Election 
Day -- precisely how the measure would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need Pete Wilson to come clean," said Brown, talking with reporters after 
a San Bernardino breakfast with 350 Democrats. "What is Proposition 187 all 
about? Who is going to pay for documentation? Who is going to have to report? 
Who is going to implement? Who is going to pay for this?" 
</P>
<P>
 At his campaign stops, Wilson deflected questions about how he would implement 
the initiative if it is passed. He said he would defer those decisions until 
after the election. But he did vow that if officials charged with reporting 
illegal immigrants did not do so, he would seek a court order to enforce the 
new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a scofflaw," the governor said. "If the people of California pass 
it, then it is the law and it should be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was responding to comments by Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who said Monday 
that he would have no authority to prosecute teachers and others who failed to 
report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposition, educators, medical personnel and others are required to 
report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities. The proposition 
bars illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency state benefits, including 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, though responding to questions on 187 from reporters, steered 
clear of the controversial subject in his four campaign stops Tuesday. Instead 
he focused on crime, an issue of huge importance to California voters and one 
in which polls show voters siding with Wilson over Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Garden Grove Police Department, Wilson said Brown had been a "no-show" 
during the many recent fights to strengthen criminal penalties in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Brown has played no role in bringing about the reforms that will bring us 
the safer neighborhoods that Californians deserve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At each of his campaign appearances Tuesday -- in Riverside, at the Los 
Angeles County Jail, in Garden Grove and in San Diego -- Wilson was backed by 
more than a dozen officers clad in blue Windbreakers with the logo, "Law 
Enforcement for Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, a Field Poll published Tuesday gave Wilson a 48%-41% 
lead over Brown among registered voters. Wilson led by nine points, 50%-41%, 
among those considered likely to cast ballots.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; L.A. LEADERS BACK FEINSTEIN; HUFFINGTON ASSAILS DESERT 
ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Focusing on a region crucial to her reelection hopes, U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein campaigned in Los Angeles on Tuesday and was embraced by its 
political leadership, while Republican challenger Mike Huffington, appearing at 
a political rally in Victorville, denounced her environmental record and the 
Desert Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's endorsements from an array of Republican and Democratic leaders, 
including law enforcement officials, were aimed at countering Huffington's 
charge that she is a tax-and-spend liberal who is soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who released two new television commercials, returned to Los 
Angeles late Tuesday after two days of stumping for votes in rural counties 
such as Fresno, Tulare and Kern -- areas he must win by landslide margins to 
defeat Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 During those stops, as well as in a radio interview Tuesday morning, 
Huffington criticized news coverage of the campaign and suggested that he is 
running against the media as well as Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also sought to put behind him the disclosure that he and his wife 
had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny. The admission last Thursday rocked 
his campaign because the Republican congressman has endorsed Proposition 187, 
the ballot measure that seeks to bar illegal immigrants from receiving 
non-emergency services, including public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Other developments in the race Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * With another $2.5 million in spending, Huffington brought his campaign's 
total expense to $27.3 million compared to Feinstein's $11 million. Weeks ago, 
the race became the most costly congressional contest in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington's statement that Marisela Garcia, the illegal immigrant nanny he 
employed for more than four years, stopped working for the family in August, 
1993, was disputed Tuesday by a former associate of the congressman. John 
Diamond, a Santa Barbara attorney who worked on Huffington's congressional 
campaign, said he saw Garcia caring for the children in Los Angeles last May 
when Arianna Huffington was visiting a book sellers convention. Another source, 
who asked not to be identified, also told The Times that Garcia worked briefly 
for the couple this year. Arianna Huffington denied the report. "It's a lie," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * While Huffington said his campaign's polling showed a "dead heat," a new 
poll released Tuesday by KCAL-TV found Feinstein's lead at 7 points. She was 
supported by 45% of the likely voters compared to 38% for Huffington. A Field 
Poll on Monday showed Feinstein with a 6% lead over Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 * As he has done since admitting he and his wife hired the illegal immigrant 
as a nanny, Huffington attacked the media for its coverage of the incident and 
maintained that reporters were acting as agents of the Feinstein campaign. At a 
GOP dinner Tuesday night, Huffington repeated a charge that a Santa Barbara 
journalist, acting on behalf of his opponent's campaign, attempted to bribe the 
nanny and her husband into talking about the Huffingtons. "It's an outrage, and 
the press buried it," Huffington said, specifically mentioning The Times. "And 
Mrs. Feinstein does not deserve to be a senator if she is willing to bribe two 
illegal aliens to come out against her opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Santa Barbara newspaper and the Feinstein campaign called the 
assertion absurd. "When faced with the truth that he broke the law, he resorts 
to more and more lies," said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Since running for governor in 1990, Feinstein has worked hardest in Southern 
California, where she is less known than in her northern base, where she served 
18 years as an official in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein appeared on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday morning with a group 
of city officials including City Council members John Ferraro, Zev Yaroslavsky, 
Nate Holden and Republican Joel Wachs. Also speaking on her behalf were Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti, County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, City Atty. James 
Hahn and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
 The city support came two days after Republican Mayor Richard Riordan grabbed 
national headlines by backing Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials praised Feinstein on Tuesday for helping Los Angeles get its 
fair share of attention and resources from Washington -- especially during the 
fires and earthquake. They also said, unlike many politicians, she has proved 
herself capable of working with Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever our city has a problem, hers is the first number we call in 
Washington," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington wound up two days of stumping in the Central Valley and High Desert 
with a campaign stop in Los Angeles, the first visit to the city since his 
hiring of the illegal immigrant was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 He also released two new commercials amid word that his campaign would not -- 
as previously expected -- produce a commercial responding to the controversy 
over the nanny's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to some of the harsh images found in other commercials this 
campaign, Huffington's new ads -- filmed in Pacific Palisades -- show the 
congressman walking through the tree-lined outdoors accompanied by soft music. 
</P>
<P>
 The text of Huffington's message remains biting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Mike Huffington. Before you make your final decision in this Senate race, 
consider the clear choice you have," he says in one ad. "Mrs. Feinstein is a 
career politician who has never had a real job, has run for office 13 times, 
does favors for special interests and believes in higher taxes, bigger 
government and weak judges. Those are simple truths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an independent maverick who will shake up the cozy Establishment. No 
wonder they're scared. With your vote, we'll put California back on the right 
track," Huffington says. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign responded to Huffington's attack in kind: "I think there 
are clear choices and there are basic differences. . . . You have a choice 
between someone who has been fighting for California to get more policemen, to 
secure the borders versus somebody who has admitted to breaking the law and 
will not step up to the plate and take responsibility for his action," said 
Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In Victorville, Huffington criticized Feinstein for the desert bill and for 
her environmental views. "Mrs Feinstein puts the rights of rats and flies and 
fairy shrimp over people," he said, accepting petitions with 18,000 signatures 
denouncing Feinstein for her support of the bill and calling for her 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in Universal City, about 200 members of a San Fernando Valley coalition 
of Christian and Jewish congregations opposed to Proposition 187 held a 
candlelight prayer service outside a hotel where Huffington spoke at a 
Republican dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Thomas H. Rush, a leader of the coalition called Valley Organized in 
Community Efforts, said he wanted to call attention to the "hypocrisy" of 
Huffington's support of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was a simple one, Rush said: " 'You took Marisela in as one of 
your own. But what about the rest?' " said Rush, a priest at Mary Immaculate 
Church in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 During Huffington's recent campaign stops, he has increasingly attacked the 
media. Before a breakfast meeting in Delano on Tuesday, Huffington told radio 
station KFRC in San Francisco that the media coverage was not only slanted but 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Arianna Huffington accused the Santa Barbara News-Press of 
offering money for stories that are critical of the Huffingtons. Her proof, she 
said, would be in the form of a sworn affidavit by an employee. But the 
affidavit was never offered and the News-Press emphatically denied ever 
offering money for that story -- or any other. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the campaign did produce an affidavit, signed by the nanny's 
husband, accusing Nick Welsh of the Santa Barbara Independent of offering money 
and a green card in exchange for a story about the Huffingtons. That affidavit, 
the campaign claimed, also showed Welsh was an operative of the Feinstein 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 That claim has been emphatically denied by the campaign and Welsh, news editor 
of the weekly. "I have never represented myself as an agent of the Feinstein 
campaign. I have never offered anyone a green card. It's a big fat lie . . . 
and it is just an attempt to divert the media from the real story, which is his 
hiring of an illegal alien," Welsh said.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; AN ISOLATED, SLEEPY TOWN -- AND A SHOCKING ABERRATION;

<P>
 If a town is reflected by its police blotter, consider some of last Thursday's 
entries: 
</P>
<P>
 A cow sitting on the side of the road. A traffic stop -- warning, no ticket. A 
stolen welfare check. Kids throwing objects at passing cars. Someone trying to 
lift up a manhole cover. Several family disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 And one read, simply, "triple homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an unspeakable crime -- a 34-year-old woman who allegedly stabbed her 
three young children to death -- would seem an aberration for any community. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most of all, here. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by handsome dairies and sprawling horse ranches, this oldest of 
Riverside County's cities, population 23,000, embraces an ambience seemingly 
plucked out of the Midwest, something as close to Mayberry as you're apt to 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks sit on their front porches, facing avenues lined with weeping willows 
and magnolia trees. Downtown, with its mom-and-pop stores, is unencumbered by 
parking meters. A five-way intersection is governed only by stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story Virginia Lee Hotel, built in 1884, is now a weekend 
bed-and-breakfast inn, but available during the week for fashion shows and 
teas. Kids ride bicycles down the sidewalks and past the local Tastee-Freez and 
the high school homecoming parade is routed through the center of town for 
everyone to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no bowling alley here, no miniature golf, but there are five parks. 
Although a 12-screen movie complex is under construction, there hasn't been a 
theater in town for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 That old theater was where W. C. Fields sat in the back row and spat tobacco 
juice, back when Hollywood stars came here to indulge in the local hot springs, 
before Palm Springs -- on the other side of the mountains -- became the chic 
Angeleno resort. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's didn't even come to town until two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very definitely a quieter lifestyle than you'll find in, say, Orange 
County," says Mayor Henry Hafliger, a dairyman who has lived here 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops here like the lifestyle. Two came from the Los Angeles Police 
Department. Another left the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to work 
out here. The chief came here years ago from the city of Orange, and brought a 
couple of officers with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, they worked late into the night to try to figure out who killed the 
Buenrostro kids -- 4-year-old Deidra, 8-year-old Vicente and 9-year-old Susana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All day Thursday, police interviewed Dora Buenrostro, who that morning had 
stormed into the police station, seeking help because, she maintained, her 
estranged husband had shown up and she feared for her children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 When an officer returned to her apartment, he found the stabbed bodies of the 
two older children on a blood-soaked living room couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Buenrostro alleged her husband killed them. But he lived and worked in Los 
Angeles and had an ironclad alibi, police concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 They fed her lunch and they fed her dinner and they kept asking her if she 
knew where her youngest child was. Her answers were cool and evasive, said 
Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Bentley, who listened in. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, youngsters found Deidra's body, strapped in a car seat, 
inside an abandoned, rural post office building strewn with broken glass. She 
had been stabbed in the neck, like the others. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 a.m. Friday, police arrested the 34-year-old woman with wavy brown hair 
falling past her shoulders. Her statements to police were inconsistent, Bentley 
said. Her arraignment is scheduled Nov. 10. Bentley said he will prosecute her 
on three counts of murder, and he is thinking of asking for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the patio of the Buenrostro one-story garden apartment, two bicycles, a 
red-and-white trike, green roller skates, a doll and a football were still 
neatly arranged after the yellow crime tape had been removed from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors tried to make sense of the crime. Some just decided they couldn't.

 "We're just like family and we don't want to talk about it," said one woman. 
She broke into tears and excused herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think it was her," offered Manuela Villareal. "Maybe it was 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brudi said he used to fly kites with the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were always dressed nice, didn't sass anyone back, and their mom 
would take them to church twice a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velia Cabanila was more suspicious. She lived in the same four-unit building 
and could hear, she said, plenty of shouting and yelling through the wall. And 
she'd let the Buenrostro children use her bathroom when their mom was gone and 
they were locked out of their own place. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabanila said she didn't hear anything unusual the morning that police found 
the bodies. Just a thump, about 3 in the morning.

 At Hyatt Elementary School, where Vicente was a third-grader and Susana was in 
fourth grade, the office staff last week photocopied handouts, "Some Basic 
Guidelines to Help Children Deal With Death." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Principal Deborah DeForge was making tentative plans for an 
on-campus memorial service for the Buenrostro children, a catharsis for the 
other youngsters and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Susana was the shy, quiet one of the two, DeForge said. She hoped to become a 
dancer or singer. Vicente was the funny one, always laughing and teasing 
others. Both were athletic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday afternoon's Blast to the Past school dance was held as 
scheduled. "We want to keep the routine as much as possible," DeForge said. 
"The kids need something to rely on while they're dealing with the grief of 
this tragedy."

ON CALIFORNIA: LET'S MAKE A DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody knows the deal is rotten:  
</P>
<P>
 Old Black Joe's still picking cotton  
</P>
<P>
 For your ribbons and bows.  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Leonard Cohen 
</P>
<P>
 As they do every day, the men came to Villa Street on Tuesday morning to stand 
and wait. There were a hundred of them, maybe more. They arranged themselves in 
clumps of half a dozen or so along the sidewalk, conversing quietly in Spanish. 
They wore the stoical but determined expression of fishermen. Cars would drive 
by and the men would straighten their shoulders and stare searchingly at the 
driver. For a pickup that looked like it could belong to a contractor, the men 
would all but preen. 
</P>
<P>
 What the men were waiting for, of course, was work. Work is why they come to 
this country. Work is why they come to Villa Street. They do not come for 
tuberculosis checkups or public schools. They come to work, and every 
Californian with at least one eye open must know this. They come to work. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of work? "Anything," said Daniel Mendez, who is 33 years old and the 
father of two children. "Handyman. Painting. Gardening. Digging. Fences. Roofs. 
Drywall. We do any kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez crossed the border when he was a teen-ager. The Proposition 187 posse 
need not wake the hounds. He became a legal resident during the last amnesty 
program. He said many of the men who stood with him on Villa Street this 
morning were the same. People only assumed they were illegal -- because of 
their skin color and accents. One problem with Proposition 187 is that it would 
institutionalize these mistaken assumptions, transferring the burden of proof 
of legal status to people like Mendez. This is why four out of five Latinos 
oppose the measure. Who wants to walk through life a perpetual suspect? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you worried about Proposition 187? Mendez was asked. He waved a finger 
high over his head and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics," he said. "What I am worried about is work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez understands the deal. His part of the bargain is to keep quiet and 
work. On a good day, he might make $60. It is more than he could earn in Mexico 
and enough to feed his family. To those who employ undocumented workers, the 
deal means money and convenience. A dollar not spent on wages is a dollar kept 
in the wallet. And an employee with uncertain legal footing is an employee who 
won't make trouble. The INS is but a phone call away, as everybody in the deal 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, of course, are not the only ones who profit from the awkward 
mechanism that attracts immigrants, both legal and illegal, to the sweatier 
frontiers of the California economy. We all do. Just one example: Visit any 
supermarket when California produce is in season. Great fruit. Greater 
bargains. The prices do not reflect the beneficence of anyone named Ralph or 
Von. They are a byproduct of the wages paid to farm workers. Part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For purposes of politics, Pete Wilson now pretends he's onto something new and 
horrible with illegal immigration. They keep coming, he complains. Well, of 
course. This is a deal with a long history, written in part by Wilson himself. 
As a U.S. senator, he worked to make sure that field hands kept coming north 
and that the INS kept its nose out of the businesses of his friends. He knew 
back then what he chooses to forget now -- the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol agents always have known it. And it's been a morale-buster. The 
deal has made them Vietnam soldiers in miniature -- sent off to fight a war no 
one back home is committed to winning. This has been their implicit marching 
orders: Close the border a little, but never close it all the way; create an 
appearance of control, but not enough to discourage all the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fundamental way, the deal, as the poet suggests, is a rotten one. People 
like Daniel Mendez sacrifice a measure of their humanity when they come north. 
They enlist in an underclass, unable to retrieve wages deducted for Social 
Security payments they'll never receive, unqualified for most societal perks, 
uncertain even whether they can risk calling a cop when trouble comes. 
Powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 In this sense, what Proposition 187 does is take a rotten deal and make it a 
little more rotten. It is intended to cut off the medical care of these workers 
and to chase their children out of school. What it won't do is change the basic 
deal. Not one bit. Next Wednesday after Election Day, the men will be back on 
Villa Street, waiting for work and willing to accept the low pay employers 
love. Wilson insists the issue with Proposition 187 is fairness. Although his 
reasoning is wrong, he also has never been more right.

INDIA ACCUSES PAKISTAN OF ABETTING MUSLIM KIDNAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indian authorities, basking Tuesday in the liberation of one American and 
three British tourists who had been held hostage -- one for more than a month 
-- implicated enemy neighbor Pakistan in the abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim militants seized the Westerners in New Delhi after winning their 
confidence with bogus stories. They then threatened to behead them if fighters 
jailed for combatting Indian rule in the predominantly Muslim state of Jammu 
and Kashmir were not freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian authorities squarely blamed Pakistanis and Afghans for the 
hostage-taking and announced five arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people whose release were sought are foreign nationals," Home Secretary 
Kantipuri Padmanabhaiah said. "The people who have been picked up are foreign 
nationals. They have spread their nets to places like Delhi and Ghaziabad and 
Saharanpur. It shows how the tentacles have spread." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dramatic, and probably quite deliberate, Indian answer to Pakistan's 
intense diplomatic campaign to rally world support for its own position on 
Kashmir, which it claims is being subjected to brutal Indian repression and 
should by rights be Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushered to Padmanabhaiah's side at the news conference, the three Britons, who 
had been freed only about 15 hours earlier, and American Bela Josef Nuss of 
Walnut Creek, Calif., painted a frightening picture of their time in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 They were asked if they were dealt with well. 
</P>
<P>
 "As well as you can be treated when you're chained to a floor like animals," 
Rhys Partridge, 27, replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Britons were kept together in a single room, although they were well 
fed and had access to books, cards and a chess set. They were not physically 
harmed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Partridge was kidnaped Sept. 29, and Paul Ridout and Miles Croston, who had 
just set off on a long trip, fell into the abductors' trap Oct. 16. Police said 
Nuss was kidnaped Oct. 20 and held separately. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters Monday to the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America, 
the kidnapers identified themselves as a previously unknown group called Al 
Hadid and demanded the release of 10 people. Padmanabhaiah disclosed that the 
government had received a similar letter Friday demanding the release of six 
people, including Pakistani nationals and Afghans implicated in the Kashmiri 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether foreigners were involved in the kidnapings is important, because India 
maintains that the separatist insurrection, which has led to at least 10,000 
deaths in the past four years, has been kept alive only because of the 
involvement of Pakistan's government and of mercenaries or volunteers from 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan acknowledges giving moral support to fellow Muslims fighting Indian 
rule in Kashmir, but it claims that the separatist struggle is spontaneous and 
has not been encouraged by Pakistani arms shipments or logistics support.

SALINAS' LAST MAJOR SPEECH NOTES UPHEAVAL IN MEXICO; POLITICS: OUTGOING 
PRESIDENT REFLECTS UPON VIOLENCE, ECONOMIC REFORMS IN FINAL 'STATE OF THE 
NATION' ADDRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari delivered his final "state of the nation" 
speech Tuesday, summarizing six years of dramatic economic reforms that have 
ended in a year of political upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to the Congress that was elected Aug. 21, Salinas reflected on 
the violence of 1994 -- the assassinations of two close allies, an Indian 
uprising and a rash of kidnapings-for-profit -- and the profound effect it has 
had on this country. 
</P>
<P>
 He also spoke of his administration's accomplishments, which have included 
balancing the federal budget, bringing triple-digit inflation down to 7% this 
year and making Mexico a member of the world's foremost economic organizations, 
notably the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have . . . been confronted this year with unprecedented events that caused 
us moments of confusion, concern and grief," he said. "Our republican 
institutions suffered grave attacks, and Mexicans' deepest beliefs were put to 
the test. Nevertheless, because of the reforms that have been carried out and 
the calm response of the population, the commitment to change was affirmed, and 
the country's institutional life emerged stronger than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's address was Salinas' last major speech before he turns over 
authority Dec. 1 to Ernesto Zedillo, his former budget minister who was elected 
president in the August vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey released Tuesday by the independent pollster MORI de Mexico shows 
that Salinas remains tremendously popular, with a 66% approval rating, even 
though three-fourths of those questioned believe that the condition of the 
country is grave. The survey was based on 442 telephone interviews and has a 
margin of error of 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 People lining the streets Tuesday showered Salinas with confetti in red, white 
and green -- the colors of the Mexican flag -- on his route from the 
Legislative Palace, where he spoke, to his offices in the National Palace a 
dozen blocks away. He rode in an open convertible, defying increased concerns 
about security after two political assassinations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the three-hour speech, members of Salinas' Institutional 
Revolutionary Party -- the congressional majority -- interrupted him with 
cheers, while the opposition parties broke in with jeers. 
</P>
<P>
 Applause was loudest when Salinas praised the Mexican army, mentioned 
increases in government spending on education and criticized California's 
treatment of Mexican immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters also applauded to drown out opposition chants of "Who was it?" when 
Salinas mentioned the murders of his party's presidential candidate in March 
and a high-ranking party official in September -- a reference to public 
skepticism about the investigations of those slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The triggerman in the March 23 assassination of presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio was sentenced Monday to 42 years in prison, but polls show that 
many Mexicans believe that there was a mastermind who is still free. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas also defended his administration's record in Chiapas, the impoverished 
southern state where armed Indians calling themselves the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army took control of four county seats Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the state's age-old inequities, Salinas noted that it is 
the state that has received the most federal aid throughout his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these major efforts gave hope to the state, but they were not enough," 
he said. "On one hand, expectations for change grew. And on the other, 
deficiencies, inflexibility and division persisted." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents shouted, "Zapata lives, the struggle continues," referring to the 
1910 revolutionary leader from whom the guerrillas took their name. The rebels 
have suspended peace talks, although a fragile truce continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the interruptions appeared to come from the center-left Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, which polled third in the last federal election.

ELECTIONS; HANDGUN OWNERSHIP GOES ON TRIAL IN MILWAUKEE AS VOTERS WEIGH BAN; 
BALLOT MEASURE GOES BEYOND OTHER CITIES' PROHIBITIONS. REFERENDUM SEEKS TO 
OUTLAW POSSESSION, NOT JUST SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the immaculate display cases lined with pistols to the neat stacks of 
National Rifle Assn. pamphlets piled near the front entrance of the Badger Guns 
& Ammo store, there is no doubt where owner Mickey Beatovic stands. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt, either, where the store itself stands, and that is what 
riles Beatovic as Milwaukee girds for a showdown over a referendum to ban 
possession of handguns within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Batovic's gun store lies in suburban West Milwaukee. But the end of Badger's 
long driveway crosses the city line into Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you my nightmare," said Beatovic, one of the store's three 
co-owners. "They pass this thing and you know there's gonna be Milwaukee cops 
sitting out there, waiting for every car with Milwaukee licenses. Don't think 
it won't happen, my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no certainty about the future here because no U.S. city has ever 
adopted such a strict gun-control measure. Chicago and Washington outlaw the 
sale of handguns, but neither has tried to eliminate the hundreds of thousands 
of pistols residents already own. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the handgun ban proposal, nearly 300 federally licensed gun dealers 
(there are no gun shops in Milwaukee -- most dealers sell out of their homes) 
would be restricted to selling only shotguns, rifles and the few pistols that 
have barrels longer than 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who own handguns would be urged to turn them over to city police, 
who would catalogue and then destroy the weapons. When handguns turn up during 
arrests, traffic stops and other police contacts, residents could face 
misdemeanor convictions punishable by $100 fines and $200 for repeat 
convictions. All firearms would be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential sweep of Milwaukee's proposed handgun ban has made it the 
central issue of the city's fall election, pitting a coalition of crime-weary 
neighborhood groups and social activists against the state's well-moneyed gun 
rights movement. Both sides agree only that the vote's outcome may tell whether 
such radical gun control remedies can thrive elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to start popping like popcorn throughout Wisconsin and, 
hopefully, throughout the rest of the U.S.," said Peter Guyon Earle, a 
Milwaukee lawyer who drafted the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our opponents say Milwaukee is a 'bellwether city,' and they're right," said 
James Fendry, a former city policeman who heads the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement, 
a gun rights advocacy group affiliated with the NRA. "We want to stop this here 
before it spreads." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, gun lobbyists have armed a political action group with a campaign 
reserve of more than $500,000 to defeat the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Fendry said that over the final week of the campaign, the Wisconsin Citizens 
Against Crime expects to spend at least $350,000 in a television advertising 
blitz stressing the rights of gun ownership and warning that police may conduct 
house searches and monitor traffic at gun shops to seize handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fendry points to Chicago and Washington as examples of cities that have 
handgun sales freezes and remain "murder capitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun rights activists warn of a court backlog of gun ban cases and soaring 
costs for the destruction of seized guns. And a handgun ban "could require 
police to perform search and seizures without a warrant, roadblocks and spot 
checks of vehicles," wrote Harold A. Breier, a retired chief of Milwaukee's 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun ban's organizers say there will be no administrative costs and only a 
minor increase in court cases. And, they insist, police will not be obligated 
to search. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, organizer Michael Trokan said, some city residents, perhaps as many 
as 30%, according to surveys, indicate a willingness to turn in their guns, 
which would "certainly have a beneficial effect on the rate of violence and on 
the numbers of suicide and accidental deaths caused by handgun use." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun ban supporters have amassed only enough funds to launch limited radio 
spots. Relying on 3-month-old newspaper polls showing that 65% of Milwaukeeans 
back a handgun ban, they were happy to get even $2,500 from the National 
Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much but we don't think Milwaukee residents will be swayed by scare 
tactics," said Jeffrey Muchnick, vice president of the national group. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun ban started out in June, 1993, as a minor petition drive, one of 
hundreds attempted every year by civic gadflies. The originator was Verdell 
DeYarman, 75, a neighborhood activist who gathered 3,500 signatures for a 
vaguely worded gun ban after a relative was gunned down by a tavern patron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it was high time to do something about all these guns," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeYarman found allies among a group of former anti-war activists at the Peace 
Action Center, where she worked as a volunteer. Earle broadened the concept 
into a legal document and organizers gathered 23,000 valid signatures on their 
petitions -- allowing the measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 As Election Day approaches, business has boomed for gun dealers like Beatovic. 
Striding through a shop filled with gun browsers, he says: "We've been seeing a 
lot more handgun buyers. Some of it has to be from people who want to get their 
guns before the election." 
</P>
<P>
 He is doing well now, but Beatovic worries about what a handgun ban would do 
to his income. At least half his customers, Beatovic estimated, live in 
Milwaukee. And at least 75% of his business comes from handgun sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all could live without it, my friend," he said. "The people behind this 
law have good intentions. I understand their frustrations about violence. But 
this law doesn't help. People need to protect themselves -- and I sell what 
they need. If they didn't want guns, I'd already be out of business."

RUSSIAN ULTRANATIONALIST GETS U.S. VISA; POLITICS: VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY IS 
EXPECTED TO ARRIVE FRIDAY. SEVERAL GROUPS URGE HE BE KEPT OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration granted a visa Tuesday to Russian ultranationalist 
legislator Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky for a visit to the United States, rejecting 
arguments that doing so will indirectly help give him political respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky is expected to visit the United States for 14 days beginning 
Friday. He is scheduled to speak in San Francisco on Monday and is also 
expected to stop in Los Angeles, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said Zhirinovsky will not meet with any member of the 
Clinton Administration during his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman David Johnson emphasized that, in granting the 
visa, the United States "neither endorses his views nor supports his 
ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy in Moscow also said in a statement, "The U.S. government 
finds many of Mr. Zhirinovsky's views anathema." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, Zhirinovsky has aired some openly racist and 
extremist views of the United States. He has written that some time in the next 
century, America's white population will perish, swamped by blacks and Latinos, 
and that the United States will go the way of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not gloat when California joins Mexico, when a Negro republic is 
created in Miami and when the Russians take back Alaska, or when America 
dissolves into a Commonwealth of New States," he wrote. "The factories will 
close down. There will be no medicine, no food, and you Americans will emigrate 
to Europe, to Japan and to Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, a number of European countries -- including France, 
Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia, Norway and Spain -- have denied Zhirinovsky 
visas because of his demagogic and inflammatory rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials said they granted a visa because there are no 
solid legal grounds for turning him down. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. immigration law "does not favor excluding persons on the basis of 
beliefs, statements or associations," Johnson said at a briefing. "We have a 
long and respected tradition of allowing freedom of speech to all persons." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also apparently decided that turning down the visa might help 
Zhirinovsky portray himself as a martyr. 
</P>
<P>
 He bragged recently that if the United States refused to let him on American 
soil, it would boost his personal popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greater the resistance we meet, the more popularity we will have," said 
Zhirinovsky, who was elected in December to the Russian Duma, or lower house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian polls have shown that Zhirinovsky has a core of support of between 5% 
and 20% of the Russian population -- not enough to win the presidency in the 
1996 elections, but enough to give him a continuing political role. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. groups had urged the Clinton Administration to keep Zhirinovsky 
out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not his ideas we fear so much as the respectability that Zhirinovsky 
would gain back home from a U.S.-sanctioned visit," the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
of Los Angeles said in a recent letter to Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. The center noted that in July, Zhirinovsky met in Moscow with 
Canada's leading neo-Nazi, Ernst Zundel. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Conference on Soviet Jewry also criticized the Clinton 
Administration's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be noted that in addition to the pejorative and denigrating 
comments he has made concerning Jews, Mr. Zhirinovsky has disparaged other 
religious and ethnic minorities living in Russia and other states of the former 
Soviet Union," the conference said in a statement.

N. KOREA SAYS IT'S COMPLYING

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea announced Tuesday that it has halted work on two nuclear reactors 
in compliance with an accord signed with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the same report, it condemned U.S. and South Korean troops for 
beginning their first major field exercises of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the joint maneuvers will "hinder (the accord's) 
implementation" and "further aggravate the North-South relations and drive the 
situation . . . back to the brink of war." 
</P>
<P>
 In the agreement, signed in Geneva on Oct. 21, the North agreed to freeze and 
then dismantle a nuclear system suspected of building atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The North also promised to eventually open its nuclear installations to full 
international inspections in return for technology, aid and eventual diplomatic 
ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Because reclusive, Communist North Korea is closed to the outside world, there 
was no way to confirm the North's claim.

A SPIRIT OF CHANGE SWEEPS ACROSS HAITI; CARIBBEAN: POLITICS, CHRISTIANITY AND 
VOODOO MINGLE AS CELEBRANTS MARK THE DAY OF THE DEAD.

 As Haiti mourned its dead Tuesday in the heart of Port-au-Prince's main 
cemetery, voodoo worshipers offered rum, food and flowers at the skull-topped 
cross of Baron Samedi, leader of the spirits that rule Haiti's Day of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Christians held candles in one hand and trowels in the other, offering 
blessings and promising repairs for hundreds of desecrated tombs, the work of 
impoverished grave robbers, that stand as silent and grim testimony to Haiti's 
prolonged despair. 
</P>
<P>
 And relatives of the missing and dead during three years of brutal military 
rule rapped their knuckles on the Universal Tomb, awakening and greeting their 
loved ones' spirits on the dawn of what most now expect will be Haiti's first 
enduring era of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the backdrop as the city's recently reinstalled mayor, Evans Paul -- 
a pro-democracy leader who was hunted and in hiding for the last three years -- 
strode proudly to the Universal Tomb. There, he laid a wreath of marigolds and 
zinnias bearing a sash with the dedication, "To the heroes against tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for the first time since he was overwhelmingly elected to his post four 
long years ago, Paul opened Haiti's traditional two-day celebration of the dead 
-- Tuesday's All Saints Day and today's All Souls Day that, in voodooism and 
Christianity alike, are among Haiti's most sacred days of remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here today thanks to God! We are here today thanks to democracy!" Paul 
declared in Haiti's native Creole. "We are here today to remember those who 
died during the last three years at the hands of the zenglendos (military 
home-invading murderers), the attaches and the FRAPH (civilian thugs). Their 
blood was spilled so that democracy could flower in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a requiem for the pro-democracy movement's martyrs, the more than 3,000 
Haitians killed during the military's 1991 coup and its ensuing reign of 
terror, which ended when 20,000 U.S. troops landed in Haiti under an agreement 
that eased the military rulers into exile. It was also a political call to arms 
at a time when, under the continuing protection of a U.S. force that now 
numbers 16,000, Paul and Haiti's recently returned president, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, are struggling to lay the foundations of a new era. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's cemetery speech, like the holiday itself, clearly underscored Haiti's 
traditional blurring of religion and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in God?" he asked, shouting to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" they cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ceremony refocused attention of many on the role of religion in a 
nation now governed by a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Haitians or longtime residents here see any serious problems in Aristide's 
clerical past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old saying here," according to one analyst, "is Haitians are 70% 
Catholic, 30% Protestant and 100% voodooist." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the purest voodoo worshipers believe that Aristide is possessed with 
great powers. Voodoo experts said many Haitians believe that their president, a 
deeply spiritual leader who has escaped at least five assassination attempts, 
is gifted with the spiritual power to become invisible to one's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 During past regimes, though, voodoo and the nationwide network of priests who 
practice the religion brought here by African slaves have been used by 
dictators to enforce their rule. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no bloodletting within the voodoo community since Aristide 
returned with a continuing message of "reconciliation, not revenge." And not 
even the voodoo priests themselves expect any. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voodoo is not politics. There is no political dimension to voodoo. But bad 
people use voodoo as a cloak, a smoke screen, for bad acts," said Thermyl 
Selem, a voodoo priest in the Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil who also 
served 11 years in the Haitian army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide is someone who loves everybody. He favors none over another. And he 
will not discriminate between who he loves or between religions." 
</P>
<P>
 The same feeling filled the cemetery throughout the day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sauveur Dormevil came to the cemetery neither to hear Paul's speech nor to 
pray to Baron Samedi. He came to repair his brother's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 During the desperate final months of the military regime and the punishing 
international economic embargo, grave robbers had bashed in the front of his 
and hundreds of other tombs. They pulled out the coffin, tore off the brass 
handles to sell and left the bones to rot in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's economic. It's desperation. Things have gotten so bad, they'll do even 
this to survive," Dormevil said.

ONLY ONE DRUNK DRIVER IN 500 IS CAUGHT; ENFORCEMENT: EVEN WITH TOUGH HIGHWAY 
PATROL POLICY, PROBABILITY OF ARREST IN CALIFORNIA IS SMALL. BUT IN OTHER 
STATES, THE ODDS AGAINST MAY BE 2,000 TO ONE. 
</P>

 The odds of being caught driving drunk are surprisingly low, but still higher 
in California than in most other states, according to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The probability of being arrested while driving under the influence is 
estimated at one in 500 in California, where efforts to keep intoxicated 
drivers off the roads are comparatively aggressive, said Paul Snodgrass, a 
spokesman for the federal agency's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a state with a high drunk-driving arrest rate such as California, where 
you have an aggressive police force such as the California Highway Patrol, you 
may get away with it 500 times before you get caught," Snodgrass said. "That 
is, you may get caught the first time driving drunk, or maybe the 
five-hundredth." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is as much as one in 2,000 . . . in other states," Snodgrass said. The 
estimates are based on the number of licensed drivers in a state compared to 
the number of drunk-driving arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 A 210-pound man such as Marco Villegas Ramirez, suspect in the death Monday of 
a La Habra police officer, could consume as many as 12 drinks within three 
hours to raise his blood-alcohol content to the 0.18% level at which 
authorities said Ramirez tested, according to Bill Madison of the Department of 
Motor Vehicles. Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of murder after his car 
allegedly ran a red light and collided with Officer Michael Osornio's patrol 
car, fatally injuring Osornio. 
</P>
<P>
 That 0.18% level -- more than twice the legal limit of 0.08 -- could be 
reached by drinking a dozen 12-ounce beers, or 12 four-ounce glasses of wine or 
12 one-ounce shots of whiskey within three hours, Madison said. Food 
consumption can also affect blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators were not certain Tuesday how much alcohol Ramirez had 
consumed or how long he had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Reidel Post, executive director of the Orange County chapter of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, said Tuesday's tragedy highlights the vulnerability of 
all motorists and pedestrians to drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a police officer . . . gets hit and killed, then I say we're all 
vulnerable," Post said. "It's just very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Post said, many people in California still believe that "it's 
never going to happen to them." Many still view drunk driving as if it's "the 
least violent of all violent crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you have a piece of machinery weighing as much as a car slamming 
into a body or a car, that is violent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, drunk-driving fatalities decreased by 43% from 1988 to 1993. 
The number of injuries from drunk-driving accidents decreased by 43% in the 
same period, according to CHP figures. 
</P>
<P>
 More stringent laws, aggressive enforcement, sobriety checkpoints and 
publicity have combined to help reduce casualties in the county, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, adults in Orange County admitted to drinking and driving more than 
twice as often as residents of the rest of the state, according to a survey 
released in May by the county's Health Care Agency. In that study, 7% of Orange 
County residents who responded to the survey admitted to drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Before MADD and other high-profile groups became established, society viewed 
drunk drivers as something comical, said Steve Kohler, a CHP spokesman in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm talking 10 to 12 years ago," Kohler said. "Teen-agers especially thought 
that driving drunk was a joke. But the increasing awareness and tragedy to 
people's lives have changed attitudes. It's not funny anymore, and it's 
expensive." Drunk Driving Trend 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly totals of deaths and injuries related to drunk driving each declined 
43% in Orange County in 1993 as compared to 1988: 03,06,08,10 Year Deaths

RUST BELT DEMOCRATS GET A CLINTON WAKE-UP CALL; ELECTIONS: PRESIDENT VISITS 
STATES WITH LACKLUSTER SENATE RACES TO STEM APATHY AMONG PARTY FAITHFUL. TRYING 
TO WIN CONVERTS IS SEEN AS FUTILE.

 Detroit's unions, churches and the local Democratic machine assembled a large 
and raucous crowd for a political pep rally here Tuesday designed to inject 
some enthusiasm into the party's desperate effort to retain a key U.S. Senate 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 With interest in the race waning among Michigan Democrats, President Clinton 
arrived in hopes that his presence would give political impetus to the faithful 
and lure the apathetic to the polls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, he went on a similar mission to Cleveland, where he implored 
an audience at a packed African American church to shed their torpor, show up 
at the polls and bring all their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in control," he told listeners at the Antioch Baptist Church on 
Cleveland's east side. "You will be in control whether you vote or don't 
because, if you don't vote, that's a decision too." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic analysts said the party's best hope of averting electoral disaster 
nationwide Tuesday is to assure that reliable Democratic voters show up at the 
polls. Trying to win over moderate Republicans and independents appears futile 
at this point, most analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton has spent the last two days preaching to the Democratic choir in 
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan on Tuesday, Clinton tried to tip the balance in favor of 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bob Carr, who is locked in a tight contest with Republican 
Spencer Abraham for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Donald 
W. Riegle Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show Carr trailing by a margin of from 2 to 12 percentage points and 
Democratic officials here said the race likely will hinge on turnout among 
Democrats and liberal-leaning independents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio, Clinton was hoping to lend a hand to Democratic Senate candidate Joel 
Hyatt, who is badly trailing Ohio Lt. Gov. Michael DeWine. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Democrats consider Hyatt a lost cause and are conceding the Senate seat 
now held by his father-in-law, Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum, to the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's appearances in Cleveland and Detroit were not really about Carr 
or Hyatt or the other Democratic candidates who shared platforms with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton scheduled his appearances Tuesday with a broader purpose in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 After visits to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on Monday, Clinton's pilgrimages 
to Rust Belt Democratic strongholds signal that the President believes his most 
useful role at this late date is to motivate the Democratic base, rather than 
trying to expand the party's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in his rhetoric, Clinton has returned to a more traditional Democratic 
appeal, stressing the pain that Republican economic policies caused in the 
early 1980s and promoting middle-class entitlements like his student loan 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's message this week, as he stumps in nearly a dozen critical 
states before Election Day, is that the country is on the right track and that 
the Republicans are spreading despair and trying to fool voters with phony 
numbers and false promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their program, my fellow Americans, is to keep everybody shouting, keep the 
country in a turmoil, keep the people upset," Clinton told 2,000 cheering party 
regulars jammed into a room at the Cobo Convention Center in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the country is in better shape than it was 21 months ago," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let them sucker you. Keep going where we're going. Show up on Election 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley B. Greenberg, his pollster and political adviser, said Tuesday that 
Clinton is now presenting an image of a more confident and capable leader, 
after foreign policy successes in Haiti and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's prayer, Greenberg said, is that this new self-confidence "will 
lead to voters having more faith in the ability of Democrats to govern."

HOT LINE SET UP TO STEM MINORITY VOTER THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to prevent efforts to intimidate minority voters from casting ballots 
in next week's midterm elections, a coalition of civil rights organizations 
Tuesday announced a new information hot line to field questions and complaints 
about poll issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past 13 years, harassment and intimidation have followed minority 
voters to the polls, especially when close races are predicted," said Wade 
Henderson, Washington director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People, which is supervising the hot line. "We are concerned once again 
that these issues will have to be addressed in 1994 for this expected close 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line -- 1-800-775-VOTE -- opened for calls late Tuesday and will 
remain active until Election Day. It is an attempt by voting rights activists 
and civil rights organizations to combat "dirty tricks," which they claim have 
been used by the GOP to inhibit minorities from voting. The GOP vigorously 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Democrats have charged GOP activists with sending minority 
voters bogus warnings about voter credentials immediately before close 
elections. Some civil libertarians charged that such targeted warnings were 
designed to scare off minority voters, who tend to vote for Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Members representing the coalition -- including the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 
Rainbow Coalition, National Council of La Raza, Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund, National Political Congress of Black Women, Coalition of 
Black Trade Unionists and other organizations -- have agreed to encourage their 
supporters to watch for pre-election and vote-day activities that might prevent 
minorities from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the creation of the hot line, the Justice Department announced 
that it would send more than 200 federal observers to monitor polling places in 
11 states covered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The specific sites will be 
announced next week. The department has had such monitors for many years.

VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS ON RISE ACROSS U.S., REPORT FINDS; EDUCATION: NATIONAL 
SURVEY SAYS FEW CAMPUSES ARE IMMUNE TO CRIME. TO MANY, CONCERN ABOUT THE ISSUE 
IS AS IMPORTANT AS ACADEMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Violence now rivals academics as the top concern of the nation's public 
schools, with shootings, stabbings and other serious assaults increasing in 
number and spreading from urban districts to suburbs and small towns, the 
National League of Cities reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of 700 communities surveyed by the league said that violence is 
a serious problem in classrooms, hallways and playgrounds and nearly 40% 
reported that the problem has increased noticeably over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Education officials said they realized nearly two years ago that 
violence and the fear of violence had become such a huge issue that the federal 
government would have to help schools create safe environments as a 
prerequisite to academic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The protective aura around schools has been shattered," Deputy Secretary of 
Education Madeleine M. Kunin said in an interview. "It's a big concern for 
parents and students. Children really can't learn well in an environment where 
there's fear and intimidation or even the suspicion of violence." Suburban and 
rural communities, she added "are not immune" from school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 While school violence is particularly prevalent in large cities, 30% of 
suburban and rural districts said they have experienced significant increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is so pervasive, the report's authors said, that concern about 
violence has become "as prominent an issue as academic performance or 
curriculum choices in many schools." 
</P>
<P>
 One-fourth of all the schools participating in the survey reported that in the 
previous year students had died or suffered injuries requiring hospitalization 
as a result of violence. The percentage was even higher for big-city schools, 
with 41% of them reporting deaths or serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 To fight back, police forces are beefing up patrols of schools and nearly 20% 
of surveyed communities now use metal detectors regularly to keep weapons out 
of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth gangs have become almost as ubiquitous as violence itself in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In both medium and large cities, gangs were blamed for having a "serious 
influence" on violence in classrooms, playgrounds and hallways. But the impact 
of gangs was not restricted to large urban centers. Forty percent of the 
suburban communities and non-metropolitan towns and cities said gangs were a 
factor in violence in their schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that violent behavior learned on the street is not abandoned 
when youngsters cross their schools' thresholds, according to Randy Arndt, a 
spokesman for the league. The violence creeping into school campuses reflects 
the general rise in youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was released just two weeks after the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reported that the homicide rate among young men 15 to 19 nearly 
tripled between 1985 and 1991, surpassing the rates for men older than 25. That 
increase was attributed to recruitment of teens into drug markets and the gangs 
that run them and a more frequent use of guns to settle disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicating the political resonance of the issue campus violence, President 
Clinton signed last month an order that would withhold federal funds from 
school districts that fail to expel students who bring guns to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The $13 billion education bill also provides new monies to help schools deal 
with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the vast majority of schools, where there have been no serious 
incidents of violence, Kunin said, "the potential is there" for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The best remedies are crafted mutually by parents, teachers and administrators 
who work together to foster discipline in schools and teach children nonviolent 
ways to resolve conflicts, she said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 188; ADS SHOULD STATE TOBACCO INDUSTRY ROLE, 
FCC URGES; COMMISSION STAFF ADVISE RADIO, TV STATIONS TO CLEAR UP CONFUSION 
OVER THE CHIEF SPONSORS OF BALLOT INITIATIVE. OPPONENTS SAY COMMERCIALS MASK 
FIRMS' INVOLVEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 The Federal Communication Commission, trying to clear up confusion over the 
backers of Proposition 188, urged California radio and television broadcasters 
on Tuesday to inform voters that the tobacco industry is a chief sponsor of the 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-binding staff advisory suggests that broadcasters use the full name of 
the ballot measure's sponsoring group, rather than a shortened version that 
opponents say masks the tobacco industry's strong involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Proposition 188 campaign said the group was aware of the 
advisory and would issue new advertisements and announcements with the longer 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcements about the proposition had been running with the tag line 
"Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions, Yes on 188," the so-called 
corporate name. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new request, stations are being asked to tack on the phrase "a 
Committee of California Hotels, Restaurants, Philip Morris Inc. and other 
tobacco companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris tobacco company is the initiative's primary sponsor, having 
spent more than $5 million to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of 188 contend that the shorter, corporate name misleads voters by 
suggesting that the proposition is a tough anti-smoking measure. In fact, the 
proposition would roll back local smoking bans and prevent cities from 
regulating tobacco use in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A Berkeley anti-smoking group, Americans for Non-Smokers Rights, complained to 
the FCC after an effort at voluntary compliance met with incomplete results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rules say the sponsor's name must fully and fairly disclose the true 
identification of the person or persons or group" backing such ballot measures, 
said Milton Gross, chief of the commission's political broadcasting branch. 
Because so little time remains before next Tuesday's election, the FCC staff 
decided to issue the informal ruling and seek a final determination from the 
commission later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found no case law on the issue. Rather than be cautious and wait to have 
the commission issue a final ruling, we decided to let the stations know 
informally," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Nielsen, counsel for the Yes on 188 group, said: "I sent out a two-page 
memo (to backers) saying, 'This is what's going on, what do you want to do?' . 
. . I then drafted a letter (to broadcasters) that explains new (TV and radio) 
spots will be sent out immediately. That's the one thing that guarantees no 
hassle by any station. This is not a setback. It's a staff verbal position one 
week before the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen said the Proposition 188 group complied with the statutory 
requirements, which say that the full sponsorship name must be used on official 
campaign disclosure reports and direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (broadcasting issue) is a unique question. The FCC staff cannot answer 
it, and it needs to go the commission," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yes on 188 group will contest the staff ruling when it goes before the 
full commission, which almost certainly will happen after the election, Nielsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such informal rulings are fairly commonplace, said Abbie Baynes, an FCC 
special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Carol, director of the Americans for Non-Smokers Rights, on Oct. 21 
asked 20 radio stations to voluntarily use the longer sponsorship name, and 
about half complied. (Major TV spots had not begun then, Carol said, but FCC 
rulings generally apply to radio and television stations.) 
</P>
<P>
 After a station reneged on its decision, Carol filed the FCC complaint Oct. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Tuesday's advisory, Carol said that lawyers for the ABC, CBS and 
Westinghouse networks had agreed to use the sponsorship name.

 6 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Democrat Kathleen Brown held a rally in San 
Bernardino, where she was accompanied by Vice President Al Gore, and then made 
stops in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria and Oxnard. She blasted 
Gov. Pete Wilson as a bully for his support of Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration initiative. Wilson held a "law enforcement bus tour" 
with stops in Riverside, Los Angeles, Garden Grove and San Diego, where he 
hammered Brown as a "no-show" on past efforts to strengthen criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown was scheduled to set off on a 29-hour bus and plane tour 
of California that will take her from Sacramento south to San Diego, then north 
through the Central Valley and into San Francisco. Wilson was to tape a public 
affairs television show in San Francisco, then speak to Asian American leaders 
in the city's Chinatown district. While there, he also planned to telephone 
voters on behalf of the state Republican ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: GOP candidate Mike Huffington held a rally in 
Victorville to protest the desert protection bill signed into law Monday by 
President Clinton and pushed through Congress by Huffington's Democratic 
opponent, Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein received the endorsements of Los Angeles 
city officials at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Huffington will speak to Town Hall in Los Angeles. Feinstein 
is scheduled to appear at events in Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked to read that you have refused to tell the people of California 
how you would implement Proposition 187 until after the election. Not only is 
this cowardly, it is irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kathleen Brown, in a letter sent to Pete Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 "To accuse people of cowardice is simply name-calling."

<P>
 -- Wilson, in a spoken response

DEEPLY IN DEBT, NAACP FURLOUGHS BULK OF STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that its finances are in critical condition, the NAACP temporarily 
laid off most of its 100 employees last weekend after outside auditors 
determined that the civil rights organization no longer can afford its staff 
and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 During a conference call on Saturday, the officers of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People reached agreement to order most of its 
employees to stay home for two weeks without pay, one source familiar with the 
decision said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision affects nearly all of the NAACP's activities, including 
operations at its national headquarters in Baltimore and its regional offices 
in Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The source, who asked not to be identified, said that even membership and 
fund-raising programs necessary to generate income have come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision came about because the board finally, finally got the message: 
They don't have any money to meet (the organization's) payroll," the source 
said. "Every month, they've been scraping up nickels to pay the staff and they 
just discovered -- thanks to the auditors -- that they were getting deeper and 
deeper in debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Some staff members have agreed to work without pay, including some in the 
Washington office, where officials called a news conference Tuesday to announce 
an NAACP-sponsored hot line to monitor polls at next week's midterm elections. 
The news conference occurred before reporters learned about the furloughs and 
proceeded without any mention that the group's financial troubles had shut down 
its other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to furlough its staff is the latest financial setback for the 
beleaguered civil rights organization and is likely to fuel demands for greater 
changes in NAACP leadership, possibly including the ouster of Board Chairman 
William F. Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a former employee's charges of sexual harassment and 
discrimination against former Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. led to 
his ouster after disclosures that he had promised to settle her claim with more 
than $332,000 in NAACP money. Since then, the NAACP has been buffeted by 
charges that Gibson, an early Chavis supporter, misused his corporate American 
Express card and attempted to "double dip" on his expense account, charging 
personal expenses both to his company and to the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent investigations have pointed to $3 million in NAACP debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson escaped a vote of no confidence at the board's October meeting, but 
agreed to allow independent auditors to review all executive spending and to 
make recommendations for resolving the organization's financial troubles. The 
review apparently spurred the layoff decision, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls last night to the NAACP's national headquarters in Baltimore and to 
Gibson at his home in Greenville, S.C., were not answered. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joseph Madison, a Washington board member who has been critical of 
Gibson and Chavis, called the temporary layoffs "a mess" and complained that 
board members had not been told that the financial situation would require such 
a Draconian move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, never was there any indication that there would be the necessity to 
take such a drastic step as this," Madison said, adding that he learned about 
the layoffs early Sunday morning. "We don't have a choice now but to call an 
emergency board meeting and to take a vote of no confidence on (Gibson). That's 
the only way to restore confidence and credibility in the organization and to 
shore up our efforts to raise money."

BLUSTERY BALTIMORE STORM RIPS OFF ROOFS, SMASHES CARS, TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A thunderstorm with winds up to 60 m.p.h. smashed cars, downed trees and tore 
the roofs off scores of row houses in two urban neighborhoods Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman said her daughter was struck by flying glass, but no other injuries 
were reported. About 150 homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they spotted a funnel cloud. "It was twirling," said Brenda 
Hillard. The National Weather Service did not confirm that a tornado had 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like a big explosion -- like the end of the world," said Angela 
Jones, who was in her kitchen with friends when the roof blew off their 
apartment building. They took refuge in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 homes were damaged, including at least 50 that lost their roofs, 
said city Housing Authority spokesman Zack Germroth. Eighty to 100 people were 
left homeless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people were temporarily sheltered in a bus while authorities tried to 
find a place for them to stay. The Red Cross opened several shelters in 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-block area west of downtown, roofs were blown off, walls collapsed 
and windows were broken in scores of houses, many of them vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the few times when we are fortunate that we have quite a few 
vacant homes here," Mayor Kurt Schmoke said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-block area north of downtown, at least 25 row houses lost their 
roofs. Streets were littered with tar paper, wood and bricks as well as glass 
from houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials concerned about looting assigned extra police patrols to the areas, 
and firefighters searched through the rubble to make sure no one was trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 James Milton Roberts, who was driving an empty school bus when the sky turned 
black, said debris shattered his windshield and he took refuge behind empty 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm also downed trees and power lines and damaged several buildings in 
Anne Arundel and Carroll counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard County reported snow and golf ball-sized hail. Wicomico County reported 
small hail and 40-m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
 About 64,000 Baltimore Gas & Electric customers lost power, and about 18,000 
were still without service Tuesday night, spokesman Charlie Franklin said.

U.S. TOURISTS AMONG 14 DEAD IN COZUMEL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A helicopter with 14 people on board, mostly U.S. tourists, crashed Tuesday in 
the Caribbean off the island of Cozumel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police duty Sgt. Juan Bautist Huitzil said the helicopter crashed into the sea 
about three miles from the airport with two crew members and 12 passengers on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue crews retrieved 11 bodies, and three people were still missing, he 
said. Officials did not expect to find survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the dead were not immediately available, and officials said it 
was too early to determine if all the passengers were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Desmond, an American whose husband is a U.S. consular officer in 
Cozumel, said the helicopter was from the cruise ship Costa Romantica, and it 
crashed after the pilot radioed that he was having engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Huitzil said the helicopter was rented by Pegaso, a travel agency in Cancun, 
the capital of Quintana Roo. It was returning from a daylong excursion to the 
Mayan Indian ruins of Chichen Itza, on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cozumel, which is off the Yucatan peninsula, is popular with tourists.

GRIEVING RELATIVES AND COLLEAGUES SAY O.C. VICTIM OF CRASH 'HAD IT ALL'; 
EULOGIES: BY ALL ACCOUNTS, JAY GANONG WAS A SUCCESS IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE AND HIS 
PROFESSIONAL LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John F. (Jay) Ganong, who died aboard flight 4184, spent about half his time 
on business trips but still found time to be a gourmet cook, an avid beach 
volleyball player and a devoted husband and father, his family and friends said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a saint," said Ganong's mother, Marion Culpepper. "He was very 
successful in business, had great taste, dressed beautifully and was very 
good-looking. He always made quite an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay had it all and I'm just sick about this," she said from her home in Palm 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganong, 52, had boarded Flight 4184 in Indianapolis on his way to a trade show 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Eileen, 43, had been married for 14 years and have a 
12-year-old daughter, Meredith. He also has a 25-year-old daughter, Shannon 
Ganong, from a previous marriage, said neighbor Brooke Van Gilder, a close 
friend who was asked to speak on behalf of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good family man," Van Gilder said. "He was one of those men who took 
care of everything. He even turned all the clocks back an hour before he left 
on Thursday so his wife wouldn't have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganong traveled at least two weeks out of every month as national sales and 
marketing manager for Western Graphtec, an Irvine-based Japanese subsidiary 
that distributes graphics equipment, said Steve Krause, president of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on his last scheduled business trip of the year and was due home at the 
end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous shock to everyone here," Krause said. "They don't come any 
better than Jay. He was a hard driver and was good at what he did. Everyone in 
the industry respected him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganong was responsible for distribution of cutter plotters, a machine used to 
cut letters for vinyl signs or clothing patterns. He traveled frequently to 
trade shows throughout the United States and Canada distributing the company's 
products and had established a distribution network in South America, Krause 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay was on a roll," Krause said. "His distribution network had doubled in the 
last two years. There's not a lot of loyalty in this business, but he had a lot 
of loyalty earned through face-to-face contact. He also knew the names of all 
of his competitors. He had a memory like an elephant." 
</P>
<P>
 At home, Ganong was an avid beach volleyball player who played in recreational 
leagues. He also played on the company softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Culpepper said her son was born in San Francisco and grew up in Lexington, Va. 
He attended Washington Lee University before joining the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I traded a house in Virginia last year just so I could be closer to him," 
Culpepper said. "He would come and cook for me. He had the patience of Job and 
a brain that went with it. He would just amaze me with all the things he could 
do and all the awards he would win." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his cooking skills, Ganong was a wine connoisseur who 
entertained often with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an impeccable host," said neighbor Bonnue Mikoleit. "We would have 
block parties and neighborhood progressive dinners and he always cooked the 
main course. Something really special like rack of lamb or prime rib. You 
always knew their parties were going to be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikoleit said Ganong "was always there with a smile and a wave. He was real 
friendly. I would see him puttering around in his yard or washing his car when 
he wasn't traveling to different countries. You could always hear them in the 
pool or having barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard about the crash but you never think something so far away is going 
to touch your street. We all feel so sad for his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Adilia Serrano, 79, who has lived across the street from Ganong for eight 
years, broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible," she said. "He was a very nice person. They are a very nice 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gilder said Halloween was Ganong's favorite occasion and that his wife had 
been disappointed that he would not be home to help her hand out candy this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the couple hosted a Halloween party the weekend before he left. Black 
and orange crepe paper from the party still hung on a staircase inside their 
home Tuesday, and a talking Halloween doormat remained outside the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really into decorating for Halloween," Van Gilder said. "He loved 
handing out candy. Eileen couldn't believe he wasn't going to be home for 
Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours after the trick-or-treaters subsided Monday night, Eileen Ganong 
received a call from one of her husband's co-workers, who told her about the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had been waiting for Jay to call," Van Gilder said. "When she got the 
other call, she immediately knew that it was true because Jay hadn't called her 
yet. They were always in contact. She always knew where he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Ganong last spoke to her husband while he was still in St. Louis and 
was about to attend a football game. She had often worried about the amount of 
time he spent in airplanes, Van Gilder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always in the back of her mind," she said. "But, she knew it was a 
part of his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Ganong are pending. He also is survived by a brother, 
Stuart of Texas.

MAN, 23, ARRESTED IN BLUDGEONING OF O.C. WOMAN

 Sheriff's investigators arrested a San Diego County man on suspicion of 
killing Marie Evans Powell, whose bludgeoned body was discovered in her Laguna 
Hills townhouse on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wayne Bennett, 23, was arrested at 5:45 p.m. Monday at his parents' 
Fallbrook home on a warrant for murder with special circumstances, which could 
result in the death penalty, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is being held without bail at the Vista County Jail complex in San 
Diego County, awaiting transfer to the Orange County Jail, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that Bennett, who installs floor coverings for a living, 
had been contracted by Powell, 50, to install linoleum flooring at her 
townhouse in the 22400 block of Caminito Tecate. Martini said that Bennett made 
two visits to the house, where Powell had lived for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information and scientific evidence that police would not detail, 
investigators asked the district attorney's office to issue a warrant for 
Bennett on Monday.

COURT REJECTS TOUGHER PROOF OF DRUG CONSPIRACY; JUDICIARY: PROSECUTORS ONLY 
HAVE TO SHOW NARCOTIC BOSSES HAD AGREEMENT TO FOSTER ILLEGALITY. JUSTICES SAY 
EVIDENCE OF OVERT ACTION IN THE PLOT IS NOT REQUIRED. 
</P>

<P>
 Drug kingpins can be convicted of conspiring to sell drugs even if they did 
nothing specific to further the conspiracy, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as prosecutors can show that several drug defendants had "an agreement 
(among themselves) to commit an unlawful act," they can be convicted of 
violating the federal drug conspiracy act, the justices said in a unanimous 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling overturns a decision of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
California, which, standing alone, had insisted that prosecutors prove a 
defendant had committed an "overt act" to further the drug conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress did not include this requirement in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 
Justice Department lawyers noted, and the high court wasted no time in 
reversing the appeals court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ruling, the first of the new term, is consistent with the court's 
tendency to support the government's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspiracies almost by their nature are hard to define. In some statutes, 
Congress has said that persons violate the conspiracy act only if they 
undertake "an act to effect" the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of the war on drugs in the 1980s, Congress defined the violations 
broadly and the high court regularly has upheld those broad statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 law says that "any person who attempts or conspires to commit any 
offense," such as selling drugs, is guilty of violating the anti-drug law just 
as though he had sold drugs directly. For prosecutors, this conspiracy 
provision is especially useful for convicting the leaders of a drug ring who 
may not be involved in day-to-day drug running. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors in Anchorage charged Resat Shabani in 1990 with conspiring 
with his woman friend and several others to ship cocaine from California to 
Alaska, where it was sold. FBI investigators infiltrated the ring and purchased 
drugs from the woman. She testified for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on this evidence, Shabani was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 13 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court threw out his 
conviction on the grounds that prosecutors had not proved that Shabani 
performed an "overt act" to further the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the court in the case (Shabani vs. United States, 93-981), 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that Congress did not include this requirement 
in the law "and we have not inferred such a requirement." Thus, "the government 
need not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the 
conspiracy," she said.

 Meanwhile, the court heard arguments Tuesday on whether the airlines may 
unilaterally change the terms of their frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing the 4 million frequent fliers on American Airlines filed 
suit in Chicago contesting proposed changes in the program and the Illinois 
Supreme Court cleared the case for a trial on the theory that the changes may 
violate a contract under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the airlines are asking the justices to throw out the lawsuit 
on grounds that the federal law deregulating the nation's airlines preempts 
interference by state courts. A ruling in the case (American Airlines vs. 
Wolens, 93-1286) is likely in a few months.

CNN FOUND GUILTY IN AIRING OF NORIEGA TAPES; MEDIA: THE NETWORK BROADCAST 
PRIVATE JAILHOUSE TALKS, WHICH U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD SECRETLY RECORDED. COURT 
SAYS ACTION DEFIED GAG ORDER. 
</P>

 The Cable News Network was found guilty Tuesday of criminal contempt for 
disregarding a judge's orders four years ago and broadcasting secretly recorded 
jailhouse conversations between deposed Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega and 
his lawyers, his children and his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasts, over two days in November, 1990, came as the military 
strongman sat in a federal prison in Miami awaiting trial on drug trafficking 
and money laundering charges. Noriega was convicted on eight of those charges 
in April, 1992, and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over Noriega's 
seven-month trial, said that CNN willfully violated his gag order by 
broadcasting parts of several government tapes on which Noriega was heard 
talking in Spanish to an aide in the office of his attorneys, his three 
daughters in the Dominican Republic and his mistress in Panama. Hoeveler later 
found that the broadcasts did not infringe on Noriega's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in the verdict issued Tuesday, Hoeveler said: "I am ever mindful 
of an essentially unfettered press and the mandates of the First Amendment, but 
I must also be mindful of the vital importance of compliance with orders of the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN could be fined $100,000. The punishment phase is scheduled for Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said that officials of the 
Atlanta-based network are "disappointed in the court's ruling." He added: "We 
continue to believe that we acted properly. We are reviewing the decision to 
determine whether to appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 During a four-day trial before Hoeveler in September, CNN lawyers argued that 
the network was entitled to broadcast the tapes out of a journalistic 
responsibility to show government misconduct for taping Noriega's calls. CNN 
President Tom Johnson testified that he made the decision to defy the judge's 
order after conferring with company lawyers and the news staff. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN has never disclosed how it obtained the tapes, which were filled with 
profane and unintelligible talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega attorney Jon May said that the CNN conviction has no bearing on 
Noriega's appeal of his conviction, since the conversations broadcast had 
nothing to do with the preparation of his defense and were not prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
 But May added: "Many news organizations accept this as part of the price they 
have to pay (to uphold rights granted under the First Amendment). But this 
decision makes it clear that there is a price for disobeying a court order." 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega -- who was seized in Panama during a December, 1990, U.S. military 
invasion and remains confined in a federal prison south of Miami -- "is very 
optimistic" that his conviction will be overturned on appeal, according to May. 
Oral arguments before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta are expected 
early next year.

FIRM WILL MOVE MANUFACTURING JOBS FROM O.C.; TECHNOLOGY: COMPUTER CIRCUITS 
MAKER SILICON SYSTEMS WILL TRANSFER ABOUT 150 PEOPLE TO A NEW PLANT, BUT IT 
PLANS TO KEEP ITS HEADQUARTERS AND ABOUT 800 WORKERS IN TUSTIN. 
</P>

 Silicon Systems, a fast-growing Tustin company that makes computer circuits, 
confirmed Tuesday that it is moving its manufacturing operations out of Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based TDK Corp., said it 
plans to keep its corporate headquarters, main design center and about 800 
workers in Tustin. It will move its remaining 150 manufacturing workers to a 
new plant, the site for which has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Systems, which makes computer microchips found in many disk drives, 
has about 2,000 workers worldwide, most of them in Orange County, Santa Cruz or 
Singapore. About four years ago, the company moved its major manufacturing 
operations from Orange County to Santa Cruz, where it now employs 450. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Tuesday it is looking in Oregon, Nevada and the Sacramento 
area for manufacturing sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans to move our corporate headquarters, but our manufacturing 
will be phased out of Tustin by 1995," said Mark Jorgensen, spokesman for the 
company. "We will not be a major Orange County manufacturer anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is projecting sales of about $320 million this year, a 30% 
increase from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorgensen described the move as a "technology shift." The company's 
manufacturing operation in Santa Cruz is not only bigger than its Orange County 
facility, he said, but also newer and more high-tech. Because of that, he said, 
expanding there is more cost-effective than at sites such as the 
22,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Orange County, which was built in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The 150 workers affected by the move will probably be transferred rather than 
laid off, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, the company said it has replaced Alan V. King as president 
and chief executive officer. Yutaka Mori, 53, became president and chief 
executive officer effective Tuesday. Mori, a 24-year veteran of parent company 
TDK, joined Silicon Systems in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Goerner, 46, is the new chief operating officer and Bill Bendush, 45, the 
chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 59, will remain with the company as vice chairman of the board of 
directors.

BRIEFLY: AIRLINES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 U.S. Wants Airline Rules Eased Globally: The Clinton Administration announced 
plans Tuesday to begin talks with nine European nations in an effort to remove 
obstacles to establishment of international "hub-and-spoke" systems much like 
those adopted by many U.S. carriers after the industry was deregulated. The aim 
of the talks, as outlined by U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, is to 
allow U.S. carriers to use these hub destinations as stopping points to other 
cities worldwide, a practice discouraged in some countries. Lifting current 
barriers would allow U.S. airlines to offer more competitive prices, fly to 
more cities and increase the frequency of flights, according to a policy 
report.

DISCOUNT TIRE CENTERS' PARENT MAKES OFFER FOR RIVAL BIG O 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent company of Discount Tire Centers said Tuesday that it has made an 
offer to buy rival Big O Tires, a consolidation that would create a chain with 
500 outlets across the West and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Big O officials said they don't know enough yet about the suitor, AKH Co. of 
Anaheim, to comment on the offer. In particular, they said, they want to know 
more about AKH's financial condition, which the privately held company so far 
has declined to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer is the latest development since Big O's directors decided in June to 
seek bids. The board did so at the urging of Balboa Investment Group LP in 
Newport Beach, which controls about 10% of Big O's stock and is its 
second-largest investor behind the company's own employee stock ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In AKH, Big O would have a partner that operates 130 stores in California, 
Oregon, Washington and Utah under the names Discount Tire Centers and Evans 
Tire & Service Centers. Big O, based in Englewood, Colo., has 370 stores in 18 
states, mostly in the West and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release Tuesday, AKH President Andy Andonian said that the 
consolidation of the two companies would create the nation's largest 
independent tire chain. He said the AKH offer is for an "unspecified cash 
consideration" and that the deal would be subject to certain contingencies, 
such as obtaining financing. 
</P>
<P>
 AKH is owned and operated by three brothers: Andy, Hratch and John Andonian. 
</P>
<P>
 The company submitted its offer for Big O "several days ago," said Beth Hayne, 
Big O's investment relations manager. The board appointed a consultant and an 
outside director, she said, to seek more information about AKH. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement by AKH caught Big O officials by surprise, Hayne said, 
adding:. "We're still trying to figure out what it means." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Investment's managing partner, Kenneth Pavia Sr., said Tuesday that he 
is pleased with AKH's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that it would be in the best interests of the shareholders to 
enter into a strategic combination of some sort, and I felt Big O lacked the 
critical mass it needs to compete effectively in the tire business in the 
'90s," Pavia said. "So any alliance that solves those concerns should be fully 
explored." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Pavia said, Big O "wants to fully explore not only the level of the 
offer, but negotiate to additional levels and make sure that . . . AKH can 
perform under terms of the contract." Pavie said he is familiar with AKH's 
offer but could not disclose the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, Big O's stock closed at $17 a share, up 50 cents.

NUOASIS UNIT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 NuOasis Gaming Inc., an Orange County company that owns five bingo operations 
in Louisiana, said its BA-MAK Gaming International subsidiary there has filed 
for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that BA-MAK has filed in New Orleans under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code followed the parent company's previous disclosure that the 
division's president had resigned, its corporate secretary had been dismissed, 
and that lawsuits had been filed against both. 
</P>
<P>
 NuOasis, based in Irvine, said it plans to reorganize New Orleans-based BA-MAK 
and settle with its principal creditor and equipment supplier, neither of which 
it would identify. 
</P>
<P>
 NuOasis was formerly E.N. Phillips Co. The company changed its name earlier 
this month and said it plans to develop casino properties.

EX-AMERICAN HONDA OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY IN KICKBACK CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former American Honda Motor Co. executive has pleaded guilty and three other 
former officials face further charges in a bribery and kickback scam, U.S. 
Atty. Paul Gagnon announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They are charged with participation in a nationwide scheme in which former 
company officials received about $10 million in kickbacks, Gagnon said. In 
exchange for the kickbacks, the defendants were said to have funneled Honda 
cars to dealers at a time when the vehicles were in high demand and short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 John Conway, a former eastern regional sales manager of American Honda and a 
former part-owner of several Honda and Acura dealerships, pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and to bribing American Honda salespeople from 
1986 to 1990 while he was a dealer, Gagnon said. He faces five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cardiges of Laguna Hills; John Billmyer of Raleigh, N.C.; and Dennis 
Josleyn of Penn Valley, Calif., are the only three of 18 executives who haven't 
pleaded guilty, Gagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the three have been charged with receiving about $1.5 million in 
kickbacks and setting up fake Honda and Acura dealerships to conceal the scheme 
and the names of people who bribed them, Gagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges is accused of receiving gifts including Rolex wristwatches, $1,000 
business suits, $24,000 worth of furniture and a one-year lease on a Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 people have been charged with crimes including racketeering, mail 
fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges and Josleyn are charged with racketeering, mail fraud and conspiracy 
to commit mail fraud. The new indictment alleges Cardiges tried to get 
witnesses to lie to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Billmyer is charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He faces five years 
in prison if convicted, Cardiges 40 years and Josleyn 30 years, Gagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda and prosecutors say the company, based in Torrance, was a 
victim in the case and has been cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The illicit activities uncovered by the U.S. attorney's investigation 
represent a betrayal of trust that has resulted in the theft of millions of 
dollars from American Honda," the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date should be set by the end of the month.

Capistrano medical testing company, through fraud and deceit, held her earnings 
down while giving at least one male executive at her level a stock option bonus 
valued at $230,000 more than she received. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Paul D. Copenbarger of Santa Ana, said the suit, filed Friday in 
Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, should come as no surprise to the 
company. "We've had discussions about the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Copenbarger said, "I have reason to believe that there will be 
additional lawsuits from other female employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate executives were unavailable for comment. Kathryn Littleton, a 
spokeswoman for Nichols' parent company, Corning Inc., would not comment. The 
Corning, N.Y., glass and housewares maker acquired Nichols last month and 
renamed it Corning Nichols Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn's suit accuses the company of lying to her three separate times about the 
pay of a male colleague working at her level. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asserts that Paul Bellamy, Nichols Institute's acting chief 
executive, told Kahn in June and October last year and in February this year 
that her compensation "and that of a particular male co-worker were equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kahn contends, the co-worker participated in a bonus program that 
could have doubled his salary. That "supposedly equal" male co-worker received 
stock options of 30,000 shares, or a 50% bonus, for achieving goals set for 
him, the suit asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn didn't know that such a bonus program existed, the suit contends. She did 
receive stock options of 7,500 shares as a bonus, however, for achieving all 
goals set for her. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Kahn filed a discrimination claim with the California Department of 
Fair Employment and Housing. Copenbarger said the agency sent the complaint to 
Nichols Institute, and the company responded. The agency, though, did not take 
any other action except to notify her last month that she had a right to file a 
civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, who was hired in 1987, became an assistant treasurer in 1988, and was 
acting treasurer from 1991 through the end of January. She was promoted to 
treasurer in February and is paid an annual salary of $100,000.

COSTA MESA'S ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, 3 AFFILIATES APPROVE MERGER PLAN 
</P>

 Creating a corporation with $500 million in annual sales, shareholders of ICN 
Pharmaceuticals and three affiliates on Tuesday approved a merger of the four 
into a single company. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN said it expects federal regulators to give their approval next week for 
its combination with Viratek Inc., SPI Pharmaceuticals and ICN Biomedicals. The 
new company will operate under the name ICN Pharmaceuticals, and its stock will 
be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, said Milan Panic, chairman of all four companies, will save at 
least $30 million a year by streamlining management, reducing accounting and 
auditing fees, and lowering income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even critics of the company's current management conceded Tuesday that the 
deal makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, I think the merger is a good plan because it will reduce the tax 
rate and lower expenses," said Rafi Khan, a dissident investor who waged a 
proxy battle earlier this year for control of ICN. "It looks like ICN's 
management is getting shareholder-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the news, Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its ratings of ICN's 
unsecured and subordinated debt based on the expectation of savings and, thus, 
improved profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals is the holding company for SPI, Viratek and ICN 
Biomedicals. Viratek is the research and development arm of the organization. 
SPI provides manufacturing, marketing and distribution services for the 
company's pharmaceuticals. And ICN Biomedicals provides goods and services to 
the biomedical technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger plan, ICN and Viratek stockholders would receive one share of 
the new company for about two of their current shares. SPI stockholders would 
receive one new share for each old share, and ICN Biomedicals investors would 
get one new share for five existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and shareholders applauded the merger, saying increased operating 
efficiencies might snap ICN out of a slump. For the first nine months of this 
year, ICN reported a loss of $14.2 million on revenue of $48.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic has blamed the company's losses on the poor performance of its 
Yugoslavia venture, drug manufacturer ICN Galenika. Since 1992, ICN Galenika 
has broken even or reported only small profits. ICN Galenika sales represent 
35% of ICN's worldwide revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts pointed out Tuesday that the merger would be only one step toward 
profitability for ICN. The company, they said, needs a bigger boost, such as 
winning federal approval to sell Ribavirin, a drug that it is hoping to market 
as a treatment for chronic hepatitis C.  
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Roth, an analyst with Northeast Securities in Westbury, N.Y., said 
Ribavirin has good market potential, but the company has lost its edge because 
its clinical-testing phase lasted too long. Also, in its clinical trials the 
company has yet to find the results it was seeking, Roth said. "So far, it has 
not succeeded in getting patients into remission," he said, "and that is really 
what they are looking for. And for that to happen, they will have to test it in 
combination with another drug."  
</P>
<P>
 ICN spokesman David Calef said the drug was submitted for FDA approval on June 
1 and is under review. ICN has no plans now to conduct further tests in 
combination with other drugs, he said.
