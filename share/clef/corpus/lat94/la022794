<P>
 In September, 1991, Zlata Filipovic, a fifth-grade girl living in Sarajevo, 
Bosnia, began a journal, a bouncy record of the daily doings of her bright, 
energetic, wholly extroverted self. She did not dream, as she began to write, 
that eight months later, in May, 1992, Serbian forces would move artillery into 
position on the hills surrounding her city and commence the slow slaughter of 
the population. Even when the shelling began, Zlata had no idea why it had 
begun and therefore none of whether it would ever end. 
</P>
<P>
 The words Serb, Croat and Muslim barely occur in her diary. An American 
reading it cannot tell her ethnicity. Her family celebrates Christmas, but two 
Muslim holidays are also mentioned. All she knows, once the shelling starts, is 
that she can no longer go to school or play outdoors or even sleep on the side 
of her house that is exposed to the man she calls " 'our' sniper." 
</P>
<P>
 Zlata did not begin her diary in imitation of Anne Frank. When she first 
thought of Anne, the Serbian onslaught had yet to begin. The war was happening 
in Dubrovnik on the Adriatic Coast. The Filipovic family watched reports of it 
on television; and if Zlata's parents had a premonition, Zlata herself did not. 
No, what brought Anne to Zlata's mind was just the memory of a detail of style: 
Anne's diary takes the form of letters to an imaginary correspondent. For fun, 
Zlata decided to imitate her in that one regard and, after playing with several 
fancy names, settled on "Mimmy," an echo of Anne's "Kitty." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in 1993, Zlata's diary came to the attention of French journalists in 
Sarajevo. By that time, the genocidal intent of the Serbian, more recently 
Serbo-Croatian, war against Bosnia had become apparent. The journalists 
inevitably compared Zlata to Anne, but the comparison dismayed the Bosnian girl 
herself. What upset her was no literary presumption but something a good deal 
more basic: Anne had been killed; Zlata wanted to live: 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday, 2/VIII/1993 
</P>
<P>
 " Dear Mimmy,  
</P>
<P>
 "More journalists, photo-reporters and cameramen. They write, take 
photographs, film, and it all goes to France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Spain, 
America. But you and I, Mimmy, we stay where we are, we stay and we wait, and, 
of course, keep each other company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people compare me with Anne Frank. That frightens me, Mimmy. I don't 
want to suffer her fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zlata." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Diary of Anne Frank" is a fascinating work of literature, quite apart 
from its unique importance as testimony from deep inside a 
genocide-in-progress. It elegantly demonstrates a key thesis of contemporary 
literary theory; namely, that the reader completes what the writer only begins. 
Kitty, Anne's imaginary reader, is addressed on nearly every page of the diary, 
and the frequency serves as a recurring reminder to the real reader that he is 
a reader. Addressed with such frequency, he is drawn in, made to feel intimate 
with Anne; he becomes her correspondent, her secret collaborator, the completer 
of what she began. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Diary of Anne Frank" is, of course, incomplete in another, even more 
powerful way. On Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1944, the diary simply stops. Anne does not 
tell us why. It is we who must provide the reason; and providing it, we are 
left with the uncanny feeling that having been intimate with this child, we are 
now intimate with her destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The instinct to recoil from the sick, the dying, the accused or abused can 
never be entirely stilled in the mind. "The Diary of Anne Frank" escapes the 
working of that instinct by never showing us Anne at Bergen-Belsen, naked, 
sick, perhaps molested by sadistic guards, and in the end soiled, ugly, dying. 
If it did that, then, whatever our wishes, we would recoil from her. Instead, 
Anne's last letter to Kitty before the unrecorded, unimaginable scene of her 
arrest is a girl's meditation about being a "little bundle of contradictions." 
It bespeaks nothing more than the instantly recognizable growing pains of a 
girl who wants to stay a girl and yet wants to be taken seriously as a young 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anne wrote her little meditation, the Nazi beast was only hours, perhaps 
only minutes, away from her door. By talking as she does, she slips past our 
natural instinct to shun a victim. And then, when the sudden interruption of 
her diary forces us to imagine on our own what it was like when the beast burst 
through the door, it is too late for us to escape. We feel trapped almost as 
she was, and the emotional impact becomes overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 On this count and others, "The Diary of Zlata Filipovic" may be interestingly 
compared to "The Diary of Anne Frank." And yet when I came upon the particular 
comparison that Zlata herself had spontaneously made -- "I don't want to suffer 
her fate" -- I felt ashamed. A genocide is taking place before the watching 
eyes of the Western world, and that world is looking on as if indeed it were 
just something to watch, a segment on the evening news, a strange species of 
entertainment. I abhor the underlying attitude, and yet here I was, treating a 
dispatch from this genocide-in-progress as if it were one more text for 
aesthetic analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zlata Filipovic, the siege of Sarajevo was what a two-year-long series of 
earthquakes might be for a little girl in Los Angeles. She sees it more as a 
natural than as a political event. Aftershock follows aftershock, month after 
month. She keeps hoping it will end, but it doesn't; and before her own 
defenses quite give way, she sees those of her parents failing. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, cruelly, the Serbs wear the Bosnians down. A Filipovic friend is 
killed in his back yard by a sniper. The stately trees of the elegant old city 
disappear, cut down for cooking and heating. Zlata's father suffers a hernia 
carrying a heavy log home; later he suffers serious frostbite in the cellar 
attempting to chop another log to size for their little stove. The bird dies. 
The cat dies. Friend after friend, relative after relative dies or flees. As 
one convoy leaves with many old friends on board, Zlata says more than she 
knows; more, perhaps, than she can bear to know, when she writes: "Everyone 
kept saying: 'We'll see each other again, somewhere, sometime.' It was sad. Sad 
and upsetting. It reminded me of the movies I saw about the Jews in the Second 
World War." 
</P>
<P>
 The indomitable homing toward the ordinary that so astonishes every drop-in 
visitor to disaster shines from every page of this book, but so does the 
disaster itself: 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday, 9/I/1993 
</P>
<P>
 " Dear Mimmy,  
</P>
<P>
 "They killed Vice-Premier Hakija Turajlic, my workshop teacher's husband. 
Everybody says he was a wonderful man. What a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "My math lesson at my teacher's was a success. We learned three new lessons. 
The arithmetic mean, ratios and percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 "No electricity, no water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zlata." 
</P>
<P>
 Children always seem so resilient, playing amid the rubble in a way that 
humbles and heartens their elders. But children's despairs can be as sudden as 
their delights. As the war continues with no end in sight, Zlata begins to 
speak of her own death in sudden, uncharacteristic eruptions. One of these is 
precipitated by the news that "Seka is beside herself. It looks as though she's 
going to be evicted from Bokica's flat." In April, 1993, Sarajevo was choked 
with refugees from elsewhere in Bosnia, but the city also had flats vacated by 
its own departed refugees. The government evidently was trying to match 
resource to need, and somehow poor Seka, apartment-sitting for the absent 
Bokica, had been ruled a squatter. It was all too confusing for Zlata: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're replacing one tragedy with another. How awful it all is. Sometimes I 
don't understand a thing. Actually, I don't understand this war. I know it's 
stupid, and since it's stupid so is everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not eloquent writing. When critics write, as they may, "Zlata 
Filipovic is no Anne Frank," they will be right. And yet the voice heard here, 
impotently and angrily repeating the word stupid , is the recognizable voice of 
a little girl pushed past her limit and about to burst into tears. In the 
sentences that follow, Zlata imagines that the war will never end. She'll turn 
20, even 30 . . . and "Gone will be my childhood, gone my youth, gone my life. 
And I'll die and this war still won't be over. And when Mummy says to me: 
'We'll go away, Zlata,' again I feel like killing myself. Sure. All they're 
waiting for out there is for some Alica, Malik and Zlata to come along." 
</P>
<P>
 As I write, the pretense of civil war has been all but wholly abandoned in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The regular armies of Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro) and 
Croatia are openly operating on Bosnian soil. The two invader nations recently 
added a public agreement to the secret agreement they reportedly made in Graz, 
Austria, two years ago for the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Meanwhile, the 
voices of reason urge evenhandedness as if Bosnian artillery were ringing 
Belgrade and Zagreb, as if little girls in those Serbian and Croatian capitals 
were cowering in their frozen cellars to escape Bosnian mortar, as if the 
repelling of aggression were morally equivalent to aggression itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Filipovic family has fled Sarajevo and is living in Paris. Zlata's diary, 
its last entry dated Oct. 17, 1993, has been translated into French and is a 
bestseller in Paris. American rights were sold to Viking Penguin last month for 
a reported $565,000, a figure that will doubtless be used by some to discredit 
the work and its author. Excerpts appear in the current Newsweek. The book 
itself will officially be published March 7 with an introduction by British 
journalist Janine di Giovanni. 
</P>
<P>
 The diary as a publishing phenomenon is refuted, in a way, by the diary as 
testimony. We are told until we are numb with the hearing of it that ours is an 
era in which image has triumphed over substance. But Bosnia may yet prove a 
triumph of substance over image. Try as they may, the political image-managers 
of Europe and America cannot quite conceal the fact that they have 
re-legitimized the revision of borders by force. Surely if little Serbia cannot 
be denied its piece of Bosnia, then great Russia cannot be denied its piece of 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic drew the right moral when she wrote 
recently in the New Republic: 
</P>
<P>
 "If attention and understanding alone could save Sarajevo, then it would have 
been saved long ago. As I sit at my table on a quiet ordinary winter day, I 
feel helpless for the first time. My words -- any words -- have no real 
meaning. I am sick and tired of them. Finally all we have achieved with words 
is to establish Sarajevo as a metaphor for tragedy. So what? Will it help them 
survive, if they get 150 grams of bread? I doubt it, and this doubt, like an 
acid, is eating me from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavenka Drakulic and Zlata Filipovic belong together as elder and younger 
sister in the same doomed family, for the younger sister ends her last letter 
to Mimmy on the very same note. She is delighted, naturally, that her diary is 
going into the world, grateful for the solicitude of journalists, but also 
confused and saddened that the killing and the attention go on simultaneously. 
The diary's last entry records a day of ferocious shelling, six dead, 56 
wounded, long, grim hours in the frozen cellar, and then a visit by journalist 
friends, checking to see how they had come through: 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep thinking that we're alone in this hell, that nobody is thinking of us, 
nobody is offering us a helping hand. But there are people who are thinking and 
worrying about us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday the Canadian TV crew and Janine came to see how we had survived the 
mad shelling. That was nice of them. Humane. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when we saw that Janine was holding an armful of food, we got so sad we 
cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears of joy? Not really. Tears from a child's inarticulate understanding of 
what Drakulic puts so well. It is not that no one has noticed. It is not that 
no one cares. But noticing, caring, talking don't still the Serbian guns. 
Substance triumphs over image: 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done anything," Zlata concludes, "We're innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "But helpless!"

SISTERS IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM; TWO BILINGUAL BOOKS OFFER A PRACTICAL 
AND POETIC LOOK AT LATINA LIFE; A YOUNG ADULT NOVEL SHOWS THAT SISTERHOOD UNDER 
THE SKIN CAN BRIDGE ANY CULTURAL DIFFERENCE; SISTERS/HERMANAS, BY GARY PAULSEN

<P>
 It is often said that each of us has an identical twin somewhere on this 
planet. Building on this premise, three-time Newbery Honor recipient Gary 
Paulsen introduces us to Rosa and Traci, 14-year-olds who are unrelated -- but 
"sisters" nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Packaged compactly and handsomely and told in English and Spanish (the Spanish 
translation is by Gloria de Aragon Andujar), "Sisters/Hermanas" tells Rosa and 
Traci's individual stories and dramatically concludes when these two young 
lives intersect at a nearby mall where they experience a sudden and terrifying 
moment of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa and Traci have profound differences. The dark-haired Rosa is an illegal 
immigrant from Mexico City. Blond-haired, American-born Traci lives "as if her 
whole life was written as a fairy tale." Raised to believe nothing is ever bad, 
nothing is ever impossible, nothing is ever ugly, Traci has occasional glimmers 
of reality when she realizes "somewhere it isn't perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa has made her way into "the strange country, the new country" and finally 
into a Texas city, catching a car ride with a stranger that lasts "a day and 
most of the night." After attempting to obtain work that Jesus would approve 
of, Rosa begins to sell herself on the busy streets of Texas. The privileged 
Traci is in the final stage of preparing for a cheerleading tryout at her high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa lives at the Prairie Deluxe Motor Hotel. There, her most cherished 
possession is a plastic statue of "Mary in a blue robe and the Baby Jesus all 
pink wrapped in a white cloth." And each morning Rosa prays to the statue: 
"Blessed Virgin bring my mother peace and great riches" ( "Santisima Virgen 
traele paz a mi madre y grandes riquezas" ) . . . . "Blessed Virgin see me and 
forgive me and help me to be a model in the glamour magazines" (" Santisima 
Virgen mirame y perdoname y ayudame a ser modelo en las revistas de glamour" ) 
. Unlike Rosa, who is geographically separated from her mother, Traci is 
dominated by an overbearing mother whose first husband left "a smudge every 
time he touched her" and who drives Traci hard "To marry money. To have a 
wonderful, successful life with a fancy home and drive a Mercedes and have 
servants and travel all over the world -- to the clean places, of course, not 
the dirty ones, none of the messy places like India or Africa or China or South 
America." Unable to achieve her own youthful dreams, Traci's mother is 
determined to fulfill those dreams through her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But both young women are driven by American dreams: success, youth, beauty, 
wealth, frame, perfection. Thus, "Sisters/Hermanas" emerges as a modern 
mythological tale about two young women on the verge of fully accepting the 
responsibility of living in an imperfect world where broken dreams are 
indigenous to the landscape. Although from different cultures and social 
standing, Rosa and Traci are ensnared by dreams of living lives deemed socially 
sanctioned for women and trapped in lives in which beauty and youth are pricey 
commodities, "according to the book's cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Brief, ambitious and told quite poetically, Andujar's Spanish translation is 
as equally powerful as Paulsen's English text. Intended for readers ages 12 and 
up, however, the ambiguity of the climax may prove to be a challenge to some 
readers, for the story intensifies only to leave the reader to decide the 
eventual destinies of Rosa and Traci, two women, two sisters, "dos hermanas."  
</P>
<P>
 It is an imperfect world indeed.

 Bettina Flores, author of "Chiquita's Cocoon: the Latina Woman's Guide to 
Greater Power, Love, Money, Status and Happiness," has been called the Betty 
Friedan of the Hispanic world. Her progressive, "liberated Latina" book has 
been stirring the feminist soul of the Latina community since it was first 
published in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores has proved herself to be a brilliant marketing person as well. After 
self-publishing the book in 1990, she managed to sell a hefty 20,000 copies, 
hawking the book wherever possible, from "baby showers to book conventions." 
Now Villard, a division of the publishing giant Random House, is reissuing the 
book with a confident 75,000-copy first printing and a 16-city author tour. As 
Flores herself puts it, "Adelante mujer!" -- You go , girl! 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Chiquita's Cocoon" was originally intended as an autobiography, 
Flores ended up interviewing almost 200 Latina women of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again, the women shared confessions of anger, frustration and 
hopelessness. Education, Flores explains, "is our biggest stumbling block." 
According to "Intercambio Feminiles," a national Latina newsletter from 
Berkeley, California, in 1982 only 44% of the Latinas 25 years and older had a 
high school diploma and only 6% had a college diploma (comparable national 
figures -- from 1990 -- are 30% and 26.5%). In California, where the Latina 
population numbers 2.24 million, Latinas have a 50% high school dropout rate, 
more than twice the national figure. 
</P>
<P>
 While statistics are interspersed throughout the book, Flores is nobody's 
number-cruncher. She writes in plain, sister-to-sister English. Topics range 
from the delicate, "Getting Smart With Planned Parenthood" to the feisty, "Tell 
Your Old Man to Get His Own Beer." Flores advises young Latina women -- who 
overwhelmingly marry at an early age -- that reasons for marriage should not 
include: "I want to get out of the house," "I'm pregnant," "I'm getting older" 
or "Everybody else is." Similarly the author points out that the traditional 
large Latino family not only makes it more difficult to succeed economically, 
but takes the biggest toll on the women of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores calls the truths as she sees them and only a member of the Latina 
community could speak so boldly without being intrusive or condescending. She 
is adamant that Latina women should no longer accept the Spanish maxim "Si Dios 
Quiere" ("If God Wills It") and replace it with "It's Up to Me." The career 
planning in the back of the book is sketchy, but Flores' purpose is not to 
outline 10 Easy Steps to Success, but to inspire Latina woman to break from 
tradition and to put their own self-interests first. She, of all people, knows 
that while this is not easy, by no means is it impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Flores' self-publishing effort is strong evidence of an 
untapped market. Unfortunately, despite the prominence of writers such as Laura 
Esquivel ("Like Water for Chocolate") and Isabel Allende (most recently "The 
Infinite Plan"), there is a mistaken assumption that Hispanics (like blacks and 
every other ethnic minority) don't read. By setting a large first printing, by 
publishing in both English and Spanish, and by pricing "Chiquita's Cocoon" at 
an unusually affordable hardcover price, Villard has given this valuable book 
the kind of push it needs and deserves.

WHY 'PRIVACY' MAY HINDER 'EQUALITY'; LIBERTY & SEXUALITY: THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 
AND THE MAKING OF ROE V. WADE, BY DAVID J. GARROW (MACMILLAN: $28; 981 PP.)  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was in college around 1960, there was a great deal of borrowing and 
lending of a plain gold ring. Its purpose was to disguise its wearer as married 
so that she could get contraception -- a diaphragm, the only reliable thing 
available then -- from a New York physician whose name and address were also 
shared (he was an understanding Viennese who didn't believe the gold ring for a 
minute). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us did not have the nerve or money for these visits to an expensive 
New York doctor, and others did not use these diaphragms consistently or 
carefully, which was hardly surprising given the makeshift conditions under 
which we had sex: men could only stay in women's dorm rooms with the door ajar 
and a foot on the floor; women could not be out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 So several of my acquaintances got pregnant and visited a certain Dr. Spencer, 
later to gain public recognition as a brave and principled abortionist in 
Pennsylvania. We did this very discreetly, of course, because a known pregnancy 
(or any other evidence of immorality) would get a girl expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a decade later, the terms on which young people conducted their sexual 
lives had shifted dramatically. In 1965 the Supreme Court held that bans on 
contraception were unconstitutional; in 1973, the court extended that ruling to 
abortion. A powerful women's movement had taught us a new vocabulary, new 
aspirations and rendered intolerable the idea that government could try to 
enforce a puritanical morality upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a transformation of world-historical importance, and David Garrow's 
massive book, while marred by an inattention to historical patterns and 
constitutional issues, offers important new evidence about its legal 
development, particularly of the constitutional principles created in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow's main originality lies in showing the direct line connecting the 
struggles to legalize contraception and abortion. He shows us how the right to 
privacy, first enunciated in Griswold as an entitlement of a married couple, 
could not be limited to the married. And he concludes with the struggle to 
extend this still-fragile privacy right to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow's evidence dispenses with the charge that the Supreme Court overreached 
itself in the Roe v. Wade decision. He identifies the considerable number of 
cases that would have reached the Supreme Court even if it had avoided a 
Constitutional finding in Roe, and reviews the abortion reform movements state 
by state to show how many legislatures had already moved to permit legal 
abortion before Roe. While Griswold was necessary to overturn a state law that 
was virtually a relic of an old order, Roe federalized an abortion reform 
movement already sweeping through the states. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow's research is prodigious, even breathtaking. He conducted more than 200 
interviews with former activists and collected personal letters, memos, 
multiple drafts of opinions from both personal and archival collections. His 
reconstructions of Supreme Court private sessions and individual justices' 
conversations with clerks are particularly vivid and enlightening, showing the 
dickering necessary to form majorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronicling the birth controllers' attempts to pass bills, open clinics, and 
press lawsuits, Garrow shows the long, hard labor that lies behind successful 
social reform. The best moments of "Liberty and Sexuality" come from Garrow's 
commitment to crediting the uncelebrated litigators, abortion providers and 
activists whose guts and energy gave us a legal right, however contested, to 
what has come to be called "choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Spencer, the savior of several of my friends, is here, as is "Jane," the 
Chicago women's liberation collective that first arranged and then performed 
3,500 illegal but safe abortions a year in the late 1960s. Even among those who 
know the significance of Griswold vs. Connecticut, few know who Estelle 
Griswold was -- the Catholic-born executive director of Connecticut Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow's interesting individuals and their relationships, their 
competitiveness as well as their cooperation, reveal important historical 
connections: Who knew, for example, that the originators of Roe vs. Wade were 
women in the University of Texas SDS chapter, rebelling against sexist 
treatment by male leaders? These activists permanently changed the sexual rules 
of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Garrow's tight focus on legal maneuvers does not allow him 
paint the social backdrop to our grand domestic conflict about sex, 
reproduction and women's rights. About 150 years ago, reproduction control 
practices were legal by custom in the U.S. and in Europe, including abortion 
when performed before "quickening." (Quickening was the moment when a pregnant 
woman felt the movements of the fetus, and its onset, of course, varied in 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of highly effective contraception, abortion was often the main 
birth control technique. The birth rate was falling, primarily because new 
conditions of life and work -- notably urbanization -- made large families more 
costly and less productive. At the same time, the cities were making sexual 
"immorality" more visible. Ironically, the growing women's rights movement was 
almost universally opposed to contraception and abortion, believing along with 
conservatives that motherhood was the primary source of women's dignity and 
defense against sexual exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, conservatives blaming feminists for the falling birthrate began 
a campaign to criminalize birth control. Their most common refrain was not that 
fetuses had a right to life but rather that selfish women were trying to avoid 
their maternal destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteenth-Century Americans did not often distinguish between abortion and 
contraception, considering both as part of a spectrum of reproduction-control 
techniques. The conservative campaign, however, sought to end all birth-control 
practices. And it succeeded: Between about 1840 and 1880, most states in the 
U.S. prohibited birth control and abortion and a federal law of 1873 prohibited 
interstate transportation of obscene material, specifically including anything 
pertaining to birth control (scientific medical literature not excepted). 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1910 and 1920, a national movement to decriminalize birth control was 
started by feminists who saw reproductive choice as fundamental to women's 
rights. Less romantic about motherhood, more positive about women's employment, 
this generation was influenced by a growing socialist movement to focus 
particularly on poor women who were often very eager for birth control. The 
movement created a legal compromise that has shaped our century of conflict 
about reproduction control: The continued prohibition of abortion was accepted 
in return for the legalization of contraception under the control of 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise had a sexual double standard: Men could buy condoms cheaply at 
any drug store, but women could get diaphragms only through private physicians 
and at costs inflated by the pharmaceutical companies who controlled their 
manufacture. It also had a class double standard: Women with private physicians 
(a prosperous minority in the early 20th Century) could get not only diaphragms 
but also "therapeutic" abortions, while the poor, who used hospital clinics or 
doctors during emergencies only, had no access to anything except illegal 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 The class double standard was fundamental to the Connecticut situation. The 
burden of its law fell on the poor only. But American legal traditions being 
what they were then, such inequalities did not yet create a constitutional 
violation. What did provide such a claim was the extremism of Connecticut's 
law, which banned not just the distribution but also the use of contraceptives, 
even by a married couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow takes up the story at this point and chronicles the legal battles as if 
in "real time," so that the great moments of this heroic and passionate journey 
are dimmed. Reading the book is like riding a local train across the country, 
with stops of identical length in small towns, great cities and monuments. I 
imagined that Garrow had entered every anecdote, committee meeting and phone 
conversation into a computer programmed to release them in strict chronological 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 One can agree with Garrow's pro-reproductive rights, pro-privacy-doctrine 
perspective but nevertheless resent being written to as if there were no 
interpretation involved. While assuming the voice of an objective, omniscient 
narrator, he constructs a narrative that vindicates certain individuals and 
legal strategies. He may be right, but it would be nice to hear a full 
discussion of what is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 One major example of an issue not developed: Contraception advocates have 
differed since early in the century about whether to advocate repealing or 
reforming abortion laws. It is worth entertaining the possibility that a clean 
rejection of government regulation would in the long run have produced a 
quicker peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Roe decision allowed anti-abortionists continually to propose 
new legal limitations -- parental consent, spousal consent, waiting periods, 
mandatory antiabortion instruction, and above all bans on public funding of 
abortion -- which then continually renewed conflict. In the Roe period, 
Garrow's evidence shows, even some of the Catholic hierarchy were prepared to 
accept decriminalization and to battle for pregnant women's souls and fetuses 
through persuasion, not law. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow's research raises a fundamental question: Is the legal concept of 
"privacy" a reliable ground on which to build reproductive freedom? Perhaps 
not, for "choice" requires access which in turn necessitates clinics, funding 
and public provision of information. Traditionally the privacy of marriage and 
the home has not always been beneficial to women and children, who have been 
left unprotected from domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrow himself seems to suggest, through his title and several indirect 
remarks, that liberty provides a more basic and durable basis for reproductive 
right, a promising distinction but one which he does not explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scholars, however, such as Rosalind Petchesky, have suggested that a 
legal focus on sexual equality might better legitimate reproductive rights. 
Many briefs and opinions made clear that women's privacy, women's liberty, was 
at issue, but no successful litigation has relied primarily on an equal-rights 
orientation. Why? Would this change if there were an equal-rights amendment? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another reason the Constitution might be invoked to protect reproductive 
rights is that they are basic to citizenship. Democratic citizenship not only 
bestows rights but also requires active participation in government. 
Traditionally, the economic pressure on women to bear many children and the 
social pressure to serve as these children's exclusive caretakers constituted 
both a cause and a justification for women's exclusion from citizenship. Still 
today, involuntary parenthood creates an obstacle to citizenship. Could 
unimpeded access to reproduction control constitute a citizenship entitlement? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest victories of the antiabortion movement has been in forcing 
abortion-rights advocates onto the defensive, and Garrow's legal history 
contributes to that defense, showing the development of constitutional bases 
and popular support for the right to "choice." But Garrow's erudition makes me 
wish he would extend his ambition to help us expand our historical 
understanding of the modern struggle for reproduction control and envision for 
it a more fertile ground than privacy alone.

<P>
 Junichiro Tanizaki, one of three great Japanese writers who emerged along with 
Kobo Abe and Yasunari Kawabata in the first half of this century, wrote what 
seem to be two very different kinds of fiction. Both at the beginning of his 
career in the 1920s and later, in the 1950s and 1960s, he produced sinuous and 
complex tales of sexual obsession in contemporary settings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his middle period, he turned to the traditions of "The Tale of Genji" and 
other court works of the 10th and 11th centuries. His stories begin ostensibly 
as classical tales of noble figures, richly embroidered with literary accounts 
and poetry of the time. Unmistakably, though, Tanizaki's obsessive themes are 
woven in. They are erotic, at least in part, but for Tanizaki sex is the great 
metaphor for humanity's immortal longings and mortal abasement. It is a 
personal striving that works its way, crooked as trapped ground-water, through 
the monumental structures and rituals of a formal and ritualized society. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of each style has just been published by Alfred A. Knopf. 
"Quicksand," set in the 1920s, is a novel of erotic shifts, deceptions and and 
transformations among four people or, if you include the author -- as in a way 
you must -- five. "The Reed Cutters" and "Captain Shigemoto's Mother" are two 
novellas, the latter set at the imperial court many centuries ago, the former 
set in more modern times but told in a classical tradition. They are 
translated, respectively, by Howard Hibbett and Anthony H. Chambers, who 
between them have put into English the main body of Tanizaki's work. To a non- 
Japanese reader the translations seem both excellent and quite different. 
Hibbett's is fluent and polished; Chambers', seemingly rougher and more 
"foreign" sounding, evokes the distance of centuries as well as cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quicksand" is related by Sanoko Kakiuchi, a woman who has been married to a 
not-very-hard-working lawyer. "Has been" because her husband, Kakiuchi, is 
recently dead. So is Mitsuko, a beautiful young student who was Sanoko's lover 
and, at the end, Kakiuchi's as well. The two died taking sleeping pills in what 
was to have been a triple suicide pact. Sanoko's dosage, for reasons that the 
book's artful geometry points in various directions, was insufficient. There is 
a fourth personage as well: Watanaki, a seductive, androgynous young man who 
was also Mitsuko's lover, and who recedes from the scene -- Kakiuchi bribes him 
to recede, in fact -- before the denouement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanoko's story is a shadow ballet of shifting pairs and triangles, of 
seductions, betrayals and inventions that leave us wonderfully unsure who is 
the seducer and who the seduced, who the betrayer and who the betrayed, and 
which if any of the many tearful confessions is true. The characters conceal 
from each other what they are up to -- even Kakiuchi, the bewildered man of 
good will, joins in -- while telling each other what they are up to. Tanizaki's 
achievement in this beautifully and mysteriously contrived game is to make 
whole-hearted confession the ultimate deception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanoko, bored with her idle and meticulous husband, meets Mitsuko at art 
school. A rumor instantly starts that they are lovers. The rumor is untrue and 
they defy it to become friends; before long they are lovers. Who planted the 
rumor? Perhaps it is the school director, bribed to ruin Mitsuko's reputation 
by a family that wants to snag one of her rich suitors for their own daughter. 
Or did Mitsuko start the rumor to get rid of the young man? Or did she start it 
so that it would come true? 
</P>
<P>
 The book is a chain of contradictory versions that sway suspended from 
Tanizaki's prestidigitating grasp. They drop into farce and lift back into 
mystery. Mitsuko and Watanaki get Sanoko to extricate them from a rendezvous 
gone bad. Their clothes have been stolen, or so they claim, and Sanoko is to 
bring one of her kimonos for Mitsuko and one of her husband's for Watanaki. 
There is a slapstick account of the laborious logistics involved in a 
preliminary faked suicide -- we learn a lot about Osaka bus and train service 
in the 1920s. Toward the end Mitsuko seems to be holding both Sonoko and her 
husband in comic thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is all "seems." Tanizaki's dance of erotic triangles and quadrangles is 
really a dance about power. Who among the four characters controls reality; 
whose fabulation will prevail? We may dimly suspect the answer from the start. 
Sanoko's narrative is told not to us but to the author. (Mitsuko is 
tremendously impressed to learn that Sanoko knows Tanizaki.) In this Japanese 
version of what in many ways resembles Jean Renoir's masterpiece "The Rules of 
the Game" it is the creator of the game who wins it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the novellas we move to a classical style of narration. "The Reed Cutters," 
is relatively slight, with its evocations of the landscape and its citations of 
poets. Each beautiful view in Japan, seemingly, not only is many centuries old 
but has a many-centuries-old poem that describes it. The brief story concerns 
love bent into fanciful shape by social etiquette and ceremonial idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 A man falls desperately in love with a high-born woman. She loves him too but 
they cannot marry, so he marries her younger sister. It would be a betrayal of 
the older sister and of love itself to have sex, the bride insists, and so the 
love affair finds its poetic consummation through sororal and marital 
abstinence. The tone is faintly ironic, but the poetry is genuine. Tanizaki 
writes in and apart from tradition. His irony is simply one more brushstroke on 
a literary artifact 1,000 years in the making. The same is true of the longer 
and more substantial "Captain Shigemoto's Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Its detailed account of court figures centuries ago can be dry. It wanders, 
perhaps deliberately and in the manner of an old chronicle. But the principal 
story that emerges is dazzling. It tells of a powerful and lecherous lord who 
decides to deprive his uncle, a man of lower rank, of his beautiful wife. He 
woos the uncle with gifts and above all with his condescension in paying a 
visit. Great preparations are made; hills and trees are moved to make the 
garden more beautiful. The honored guest is showered with attentions but at the 
end of the festivities he demands one last present. 
</P>
<P>
 It is told gorgeously; there is no other word. Tanizaki transforms the page 
into the ritual of the Kabuki theater in an extraordinary scene where the lord 
leads his uncle's wife to his carriage in tiny stop-time movements. And he has 
created a breath-taking portrait of power and hierarchy. The lord, with his 
ruthlessness and laughter is a terrifying figure. More extraordinary is the 
uncle's intoxicated eagerness to offer up his wife. The lord is next to the 
emperor; it is as if a god had shown himself. And afterward there is the long 
heartbreak. The uncle wastes away and to his little son -- the future Captain 
Shigemoto -- he recites a poem about a white crane: "Lost, she has turned to 
snow in my garden."

THE MAGIC IN GRUMPY RAMBLING; THE ART OF THE PERSONAL ESSAY, EDITED BY PHILLIP 
LOPATE (ANCHOR BOOKS/DOUBLEDAY: $30; 768 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Krusoe, Jim Krusoe teaches writing at Santa Monica College, where he 
edits the Santa Monica Review, and has been known to attempt an essay or two 
himself. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something a lot more human in trying to succeed than in success 
itself, and the origin of the word essay bears this out. It comes from the 
French essai, meaning an attempt or trial, and ultimately, it's this fumbling, 
this mustering of what shaky information we possess, gaps and all, that gives 
the form its absolute charm. All this is beautifully reflected in "The Art of 
the Personal Essay," a recent and suddenly indispensable book edited, with an 
introduction, by Phillip Lopate. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal essay, according to Lopate's incisive and informative preface, is 
the literary form of middle age -- that time of our lives where we have lost 
the confidence of youth, but are not yet convinced of our wisdom. The personal 
essay is concerned with smallness, crankiness and idiosyncrasy. It is 
conversational, not oracular in tone. 
</P>
<P>
 All this makes the collection, which spans 2,000 years, far more than a 
literary artifact or the study of some arcane form. Instead it is a chain 
created out of the human mind and spirit, which reaches across the centuries to 
convey the wonder and confusion, the fussiness and ecstasy of what it is to be 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 From Seneca, who writes from a health club in the first century AD, "Here I am 
with a babel of noise going on all around me," to Plutarch's creepily 
sanctimonious attempt to console his wife over the death of a daughter, to good 
advice from a 14th-Century Japanese monk ("You should never put the new antlers 
of a deer to your nose and smell them. They have little insects that crawl into 
the nose and devour the brain."), to Menchen's comments on a presidential 
election ("Would it be possible to imagine anything more stupendously grotesque 
-- a deafening, nerve-racking battle to the death between Tweedledum and 
Tweedledee -- the impossible, with fearful snorts, gradually swallowing the 
inconceivable?"), to the 20th-Century novelist Tanazaki's hymn to Japanese 
culture in general and Japanese toilets in particular, to Lopate's own 
magically grumpy ramble titled, "Against Joie de Vivre," ("I am an ingrate."), 
these "attempts" all have the feel of real flesh and real blood pressing back 
at us. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the personal essay is a different animal than its cousin, the formal 
one, that object of well-meant punishment by generations of kindly English 
teachers. Where the logic of the latter is meant to be airtight and its 
structure rigid and unshakable, the structure of the personal is far loopier, 
more like a poem's (Lopate is a poet as well as a fiction writer and essayist). 
It is a playful tweak on the nose of those awful, earnest authors of 
news-magazine opinions, which have names like "Speaking Out" and "My Turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopate's selection is a fine balance of less-known work by some warhorses -- 
he chooses Orwell's "Such, Such Were the Joys" -- and a reassuring string of 
necessary delights. Included are Sei Shonagon's list of "Hateful Things," 
Barthes' "Leaving the Movie Theater," Borges' "Blindness," Woolf's 
ever-upsetting "The Death of the Moth," and Natalia Ginzburg's "He and I," only 
eight pages long but which catches everything of love, time passing and the 
mystery of another human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly then, "The Art of the Personal Essay" is a long overdue, 
ground-breaking anthology, and yet, as a friend of mine once observed, "to put 
together an anthology is to satisfy no one completely." Accordingly, to my 
tastes I wish Lopate had been slightly less respectful to the origins of the 
English essay -- Addision and Steele, Hazlitt, even Johnson and Stevenson might 
have had fewer examples. There are only two French, one Austrian, one Italian, 
two Latin Americans, two Africans, one Russian and no Germans, Spanish or for 
that matter, Australians. The traditional American writers are right enough 
(Thoreau and E. B. White) but among contemporaries there are at least a dozen I 
might have wanted instead of Seymour Krim and Mary McCarthy, whose selections 
seem topical and dated, and Scott Russell Sanders, whose moving account of his 
father's alcoholism didn't move me. But this is boorish, ill-bred carping, and 
besides, the best reason for any anthology is to suggest others to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that this collection is well-printed on good opaque paper. 
After you have picked up a copy for yourself, think about one for a friend who 
can laugh, is curious, appreciates a well-turned phrase and who won't see 40 
again. It will do more for the both of you than running with wolves, swimming 
with dolphins or even just hanging out in the back yard, building anthills with 
us other ants.

 THE AUTHOR, ART, AND THE MARKET: Rereading the History of Aesthetics by Martha 
Woodmansee (University of Columbia Press: $29.50; 200 pp.). "Freely have I 
received, freely given, and I want nothing in return" -- so wrote Martin 
Luther, explaining why he required no compensation for his translation of the 
Bible. Today, few people would be so generous with their creative work, for 
capitalism has taken hold in the intervening centuries, turning the 
individual's work and time into bought-and-sold commodities. And that brings up 
the question lying at the heart of this volume: Where do the so-called fine 
arts, on which it is inherently difficult to place a value, fit into the 
capitalist scheme? Martha Woodmansee, a professor of English at Case Western 
Reserve, argues in part in "The Author, Art, and the Market" that the idea of 
"fine" arts, and the discipline of aesthetics, were born in reaction to the 
commercialization of art -- that when market forces proved better at spreading 
simpler, more accessible art than difficult art, creators of the latter turned 
rejection into virtue by regarding market failure as a sign of esthetic 
superiority. That seems to be Woodmansee's view, at least, but it's hard to say 
with certainty, for although generally intelligible, "The Author, Art, and the 
Marketplace" is full of lit-crit jargon that sharpens points for a handful of 
readers and obscures it for hundreds more. And that's too bad, because 
Woodmansee underlines some interesting ideas, most prominently that creative 
people must actively create the taste for their work."

 THE LIVES OF MICHEL FOUCAULT by David Macey (Pantheon: $30; 599 pp.). In 
reviewing "Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison" in 1978, 
anthropologist Clifford Geertz remarked that Michel Foucault's work resembled 
"an Escher drawing" -- its tone "imperious and doubt-ridden at the same time," 
its method supporting "sweeping summary with eccentric detail," its author 
showing himself to be "a nonhistorical historian, an anti-humanistic human 
scientist." There's probably no better thumbnail description of Foucault, but 
for those who want to know more about the controversial French philosopher, 
"The Lives of Michel Foucault" is the place to start. David Macey, an 
unaffiliated British scholar, has written an exemplary biography, charting 
Foucault's life ("lives," here, for Macey sees distinct stages and divisions) 
and work -- regarding madness, sexuality, prisons and philosophy itself -- with 
unexpected lucidity. Although Foucault is often lumped together with Jacques 
Lacan, Roland Barthes and Claude Levi-Strauss as part of the structuralist 
"Gang of Four," Macey (also author of "Lacan in Contexts") quickly makes clear 
the uniqueness and significance of Foucault's contributions. Foucault, an 
overnight sensation in 1966 when "The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the 
Human Sciences" became a bestseller in France, once said, "I sell tools," and 
that seems about right: what he neglected to add was that his tools were 
intended to dismantle conventional ways of seeing, or in Macey's paraphrase, 
"to ensure that certain 'obvious truths' and cliches about madness or 
criminality become more and more difficult to use."Foucault, as most any 
college student will tell you, is not an easy philosopher to read or grasp, but 
that's not generally true of "The Lives of Michel Foucault," Macey being 
well-versed in, yet not co-opted by, the radical thought informing his 
subject's writings. Macey notes in closing this volume that Foucault, who died 
of AIDS in 1984, disliked the thought of being the subject of a biography, but 
of the many already published, Foucault would probably hate this one least, for 
it furthers his ambition -- as stated in "The History of Sexuality" -- of 
helping readers "to know how and to what extent it is possible to think 
differently."

 PAUL R. WILLIAMS, ARCHITECT: A Legacy of Style by Karen E. Hudson, 
introduction by David Gebhard (Rizzoli: $50; 240 pp.) As a fledgling architect 
in the 1920s, Paul Williams learned to sketch houses upside-down because his 
clients -- who later included Fanny Brice, Cary Grant, Lucille Ball, auto 
magnate E.L. Cord, and merely rich Angelenos -- might have felt uncomfortable 
sitting next to an African American. In her affectionate, often astonishing 
tribute, his granddaughter reveals a man who struggled, proudly but silently, 
to surmount the handicap of race. He was born in 1894 to parents who had moved 
to Los Angeles from Tennessee and died while he was still a small child. At 
polytechnic school, an instructor tried to deter him -- "Whoever heard of a 
Negro being an architect?" -- but he was determined to prove he could. He 
studied, apprenticed and opened his own practice by designing a house that, 
today, would cost a million dollars -- a parting commission from his last 
employer. In his 50-year career, he designed over 500 residential, commercial 
and public buildings -- including the Theme Building at LAX, Saks Fifth Avenue 
on Wilshire, the first government-sponsored housing available to African 
Americans and the Los Angeles County Courthouse downtown. Hudson describes the 
writing of this book as a "treasure hunt" that was spurred by the response from 
satisfied owners, and a stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Williams 
designed the Polo Lounge and signage. But, given the richness of the subject, 
her essay is tantalizingly brief, and most of the book is devoted to 
photographs and captions of Williams' houses.They show him to be a master of 
style, from Tudor to moderne, and especially for graceful variations on the 
colonial tradition. Williams was as successful as many of his clients, but he 
never forgot -- nor was allowed to forget -- his color. Michael Webb

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<P>
 Tootsie (KCOP Sunday at 5 p.m.), made in 1982, became an instant comedy 
classic. What a joy is Dustin Hoffman's performance as a dedicated but 
unemployed New York actor driven to disguise himself as an actress, winding up 
as a soap opera star (which raises his male consciousness, for sure). Hoffman's 
perplexed colleagues and friends are played by Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, 
Charles Durning and Bill Murray. Larry Gelbart wrote the inspired script, 
directed flawlessly by Sydney Pollack, who also plays Hoffman's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The lively 1984 Runaway (KTLA Sunday 6 p.m.), a Michael Crichton 
"science-fact" adventure, stars Tom Selleck and imagines the worst possible 
handgun, one that shoots microelectronic bullets that are all but impossible to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 As in most cop vs. psycho movies, there is the sense that in the 1991 Out for 
Justice (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), starring Steven Seagal, the antagonists are but 
opposite sides of the same coin. This is the usual ultraviolent vendetta saga, 
but there's more verbal energy, atmosphere and humor than in Seagal's first 
three pictures. He plays a hipster cop at war with a childhood friend (William 
Forsythe), now a free-basing, trigger-happy crook. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface 
(KTLA Monday at 8 p.m., concluding Tuesday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from 
Chicago of the '20s to Miami's '80s Cuban community. For all its operatic 
razzle-dazzle, it becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has 
the title role as a doomed drug kingpin. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Altman's 1970 MASH (KTLA Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) has been superseded in 
many minds by the TV show it inspired, but it was an epochal, black-comedy 
eye-opener for its time -- and ours as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his life as a 1945 Army recruit in Mississippi in the winning, 
bittersweet 1988 Biloxi Blues (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.), Neil Simon has come up 
with some marvelous moments. And director Mike Nichols turns the sentimental 
story into something darker, richer, more underplayed: nostalgia with pinpricks 
of pain, in a mood of hard-edged reverie. With Matthew Broderick re-creating 
his Broadway role as Simon's alter-ego. 
</P>
<P>
 In Never Say Never Again (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.), director Irvin Kershner and 
writer Lorenzo Semple Jr. have put the emphasis back where it belongs in this 
1983 James Bond adventure: wit, intelligence and style. Sean Connery embodies 
all this and more, and for his return he's got some adversaries worth his 
mettle: Barbara Carrera as the gorgeous, outrageous Fatima Blush and Klaus 
Maria Brandauer, who manages to be worldly boyish and quite demented all at 
once. What's at stake here are some stolen nuclear warheads.

CBS' GAMES AREN'T OLYMPIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS' coverage of the Winter Olympic Games? I don't think so. It's coverage of 
a conversation between (announcers) Jim Nantz and Andrea Joyce, occasionally 
interrupted by short segments of the actual Games.I am bitterly disgusted and 
will try cable channel TNT. And this is only the first day.

 Eva Garnier, Glendale Kennedy Is the Remedy 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to MTV veejay Kennedy for denouncing President Clinton and his national 
health insurance plan (TV Times, Feb. 13). How ironic that the network run by 
baby boomers in ponytails -- the one that gives us "Beavis and Butthead" and 
Clinton campaign commercials -- has its brightest star challenging the PC 
establishment at its core. Like many of us in the 21-year-old Kennedy's 
"Generation X," I watch MTV for the videos, and that's it. Perhaps I can also 
watch an entertaining veejay share my disdain for Clinton's assault on 
individual liberty; when will MTV give Kennedy a forum for her views? Here's a 
Kennedy I might vote for.

 CUTTING FOR SIGN by William Langewiesche (Pantheon: $23; 247 pp.). "Cutting 
for sign," as the phrase is used by trackers, describes the act of following 
quarry -- searching the land for footprints, tire treads, unsettled vegetation 
and other spoor left by the pursued. William Langewiesche, a correspondent for 
the Atlantic, in this skillfully written book, cuts for sign along the 
U.S.-Mexican border, looking to understand how it affects those who live along 
it. The volume is dominated by immigration, jobs and drug-smuggling, issues 
that highlight and in many ways define the uneasy and unequal relationship 
between the U.S. and Mexico. In San Ysidro, California, Langewiesche spends an 
evening with a Border Patrol supervisor -- like the author, the son of 
immigrants -- who says, "If you want action, this job's better than the E 
ticket at Disneyland"; more than a million people are apprehended crossing the 
border illegally every year, swamping every conceivable effort to stop them. In 
Fort Huachuca, Ariz., Langewiesche (a pilot himself) flies with the U.S. 
Customs Service and learns similar things about the drug trade: A series of 
enormous tethered surveillance balloons helps Customs spot suspicious aircraft, 
but most of the smugglers get through nonetheless -- with those that don't 
occasionally mooning the agency's pilots, knowing that even caught red-handed 
they can fly unimpeded back to Mexico. In Matamoros and Nogales, the Mexican 
cities twinning Brownsville, Tex., and Nogales, Ariz., respectively, 
Langewiesche explores the maquiladoras , the assembly factories set up by 
non-Mexican companies to take advantage not only of low wages but unenforced 
environmental standards and uncomplaining, uneducated workers; the Mexicans 
often can't read warning signs written in English."Cutting for Sign" is 
difficult to define, being travelogue, memoir, reportage and analysis rolled 
into one, but that ultimately proves to be a major strength -- that the book is 
as unpredictable and elusive as its subject.

 TELLING: Confessions, Concessions, and Other Flashes of Light by Marion Winik 
(Villard Books: $18; 224 pp.). Marion Winik, as she tells us early on in this 
collection of essays, is an exhibitionist: in reckless youth she read publicly 
her poetry about one-night stands, loved to take hard drugs and go to trendy 
nightclubs, one time even auditioned to be a topless dancer.As a married mother 
of two living in Texas, Winik now leads a distinctly more sedate life -- but 
still makes good use of her exhibitionistic tendencies, by channeling it into 
prose. Despite the title, however, "Telling" is no confessions of a mad 
housewife, full of sublimated anger, double-edged one-liners, redeeming 
triumphs; it's much better than that, Winik -- a columnist for the Austin 
Chronicle and a commentator for National Public Radio -- being too smart, and 
too experienced, to write according to formula. In the title essay, for 
example, she makes the consummate distinction between honesty and telling -- 
"Where honesty is pure, telling expects results" -- yet her own telling, 
paradoxically, feels honest, emotionally if not literally true. In "This Is Not 
My Beautiful House," she surveys in amazement her transformation from "feminist 
vegetarian prodigal daughter" into married, mothering homeowner; in "How Do I 
Look?", a description of childhood battles with fat and other physical 
ailments, she finds that "I'm stuck with the past I believe in, even if it's 
wrong. . . . Even if the woman I am now looks all right, the girl I was then 
never will." As the essays just mentioned make clear, Winik often writes about 
familiar subjects, but her voice is so true and clear and compassionate we're 
happy to listen to any story she wants to tell.

 EATING ON THE STREET: Teaching Literacy in a Multicultural Society by David 
Schaafsma (University of Pittsburgh Press: $35; 229 pp.). In 1989, David 
Schaafsma and six other teachers initiated a three-week, summer writing program 
in Detroit for disadvantaged, African American preteens in which they explored 
the life of their own community.The children, to judge by their work, found the 
enterprise engaging: one ended up writing a recipe for "Life Stew" that 
included "4 cups of hope in the human spirit," "3 days in jail, eating green 
bologna," and "A dash of curiosity"; another composed a poem that reads, in its 
entirety, "I am a cat so soft and cute./I'm a rose with sharp thorns./I'm a 
Limo, so long and black./I'm Dora, so cute and so nice./but don't mess with 
me/or I'll dice you to pieces." Schaafsma, a professor of English education at 
the University of Wisconsin, relishes his students' work, but his emphasis in 
"Eating on the Street" is more scholarly: How do you teach children to write, 
and think, and judge, without imposing your own values upon them? If this book 
-- whose title derives from the African American teachers' belief that African 
American students shouldn't eat on the street -- is any indication, writing 
programs are a good way.

THE MORNING PAPER: A LOVE-HATE AFFAIR; BEHIND THE TIMES, BY EDWIN DIAMOND 
(VILLARD BOOKS: $24; 394 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Plate, Thomas Plate, editor of the editorial pages of The Times, held 
the same position at New York Newsday from 1986-1989. He teaches journalism and 
politics at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who love newspapers -- the rough, real feel of them, the zaniness of 
them, the at times appalling thickheadedness of them -- will like "Behind the 
Times." It's an affectionate and also sometimes unfair, an endearing and also 
sometimes coruscatingly mean portrait of the modern New York Times -- a daily 
print product that readers seem to care about far more passionately than any 
other 50-75 commodity they buy. In fact, for a good proportion of those readers 
-- as for readers of Corriera della Serra or Le Monde or Yomiuri Shimbun or the 
Los Angeles Times, let's say -- the newspaper, as intimate and constant a part 
of daily life as breakfast, is held to a very special, very personal standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is precisely because that high standard is not always met that 
newspapers become, in effect, daily portraits of imperfection. For, as everyone 
in the business fully understands, if editors held back in order to attain what 
they judged to be the perfect newspaper before publishing, the next issue would 
never come out. And the whole point of newspapers, of course, is their 
appearance every single day. 
</P>
<P>
 New York resident Edwin Diamond, a regular contributor to New York Magazine 
and former senior editor at Newsweek, is one of those readers of the New York 
Times who does care passionately about his local newspaper and who indeed 
desires to hold it to the highest standard. Alas, it is his view that under 
today's management, the standards and taste of the New York Times are being 
eroded and that the paper is going off in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 As he puts it, at the end of the book, in his final word on Arthur Ochs 
Sulzberger Jr. (who formally succeeded his father as publisher of the New York 
Times in 1992): "Unfortunately, the high-profile objectives that (the new 
publisher) has pursued . . . seem limp banners for rallying the forces of 
sustained, serious journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Sulzberger Jr., in his opinion, may indeed have a brain the size of Times 
Square, but he has no compass, and thus wanderingly pursues "downtown chic" and 
"skin-deep diversity" while imposing bizarre academic reforms on his besieged 
and bewildered business-side team. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Diamond right? The methodology of this provocative study is to examine not 
so much the content of the Times' reporting or the soundness of its editorial 
judgments as the logic of its internal editing processes and the personalities, 
proclivities, incivilities and indigestions of its star editors, foreign 
correspondents and reporters. Inevitably the resulting snapshot sometimes seems 
more like a Geraldo Rivera forced-entry videocam job at a state mental 
institution than a stately portrait of a major journalistic paradigm. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is precisely this methodology, perhaps even more than Diamond's 
conclusions, that have made this book the target of considerable controversy 
and howling calumny back East -- especially on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, 
the head bunker of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But the upside to this rather downbeat look at an institution that takes 
itself very seriously indeed is that "Behind the Times" is never dull reading. 
It never strays too far from the Big Question that's on the mind of every 
newspaper editor in America, which is: Since newspapers inevitably come in 
second to TV and radio in the timeliness department -- indeed, even before the 
paper's 5:45 a.m. thud on your front step, Ted Koppel may have already put the 
biggest story of the day into some perspective -- what exactly do we need 
newspapers for? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what for? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question Diamond feels is not being properly answered at the New 
York Times, and he organizes his book in part around the efforts of the paper's 
editors to address it. The management of the New York Times, like management at 
papers elsewhere, is deeply aware that they may be the proprietors of a 
choo-choo train in the age of the jetliner. Younger people do not read much, or 
if they do, prefer not to read newspapers; and without new, younger readers 
coming on board, as the old ones die, so will the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times' response, in part, has been to graft onto its 
institutional skin transplants from other, younger, hipper publications, 
whether Clay Felker's New York Magazine of the 1970s or the contemporarily 
trendy but now departed 7 Days, whose founding (and closing) editor landed at 
West 43rd Street as a much-touted editorial consultant. Diamond's view is that 
all this "boutique-ification," all the streaking after trendy, youthful, 
up-market readers, all the unseemly contorting of the classically operatic old 
Gray Lady into something more akin to a cabaret singer at a downstairs club 
smoker, inevitably comes at the expense of serious, traditional-values 
journalistic coverage. And that, asserts Diamond, is little short of a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the absence of some kind of quantitative analysis, the assertion that 
serious coverage is the loser is unproven. It may, in fact, be incorrect. 
Moreover, Diamond gives little sign of understanding that the Big Question is 
just not an Easy Question. My God, it's a frightening one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a question whose every conceivable answer is likely to upset some 
readers. For however much change may be needed at daily papers, all editors 
find that change -- in its specifics -- is the one thing readers don't want. 
Just as it's the one thing most journalists (whose profession, after all, is to 
identify and explain change) cheerfully welcome and sometimes even demand just 
about everywhere else -- but not at their newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 A daily newspaper, it has been said, is like an old bathrobe, with its torn 
pockets, catsup stains and wandering belt strap. Now, should you surprise your 
mate by throwing that robe out and buying a new one, quite a shock may await 
you: Your better half may well evince unexpected affection and fierce longing 
for the more comfortable old rag of a robe. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this massive challenge, the editors of the New York Times (just like 
the rest of us mortals) will continue to stumble forward in an effort to revamp 
the bathrobe while its owner wears it. Diamond has very entertainingly, if 
often unflatteringly, chronicled the tumult, Angst, triumphs and tragedies of 
one major newspaper that, to its credit, is trying hard to adapt itself to 
changing times. And trying hard, while putting out a complex, difficult product 
-- that study in imperfection called a newspaper. And doing that every day. No 
simple trick.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; IT'S HIGH 'PIE NOON' IN 
'WONDERLAND' AFTER A BULLY ENTERS TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bullies are mean and hateful people," declares comedian Gilbert Gottfried, 
who plays one in this week's Adventures in Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pie Noon" episode of "Wonderland" -- in which Gottfried guests as Mike 
McNasty -- is a takeoff of the Gary Cooper-Grace Kelly Western classic "High 
Noon," where Cooper stands alone and faces a gang of gunfighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The show "depicts how bullies, no matter how mean, are basically cowards," 
Gottfried says. In this version, the March Hare (Reece Holland) runs scared at 
the prospect of the arrival of McNasty, a pie-throwing bully from Hare's high 
school days. The frightened Hare tries to rally his friends around, but when 
they refuse to become his posse the Hare realizes he must face McNasty alone. 
McNasty forces the Hare into a showdown, during which the rabbit's pals join in 
to give the bully a taste of his own medicine. 
</P>

 Gottfried, who even manages to inject some humor into the proceedings, also 
sings. "I do a song about being a bully called 'I'm a Bully.' For me to play a 
bully doesn't take too much imagination. I think they wanted to get someone the 
kid audience would hate and they instantly thought of me," he says with a 
smile. "It's also basically further proof that I am obnoxious in whatever they 
put me in."

 In a rare moment of seriousness, Gottfried notes that "bullies are a real 
issue for kids. How to handle them is dealt with in this show. This guy, this 
talking rabbit, stands up to him. It's a difficult subject nowadays, especially 
if your particular bully is carrying a .45! But this show handles the topic 
very well."

A NEW LANGUAGE; THE INVENTION OF THE ZERO, BY RICHARD KENNEY (ALFRED A. KNOPF: 
$20; 152 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Merrill, Christopher Merrill is a poet and the author, most 
recently, of The Grass of Another Country: Journey Through the World of Soccer 
(Henry Holt). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genuine poetic innovation is rare. In an age dedicated to an ideal of 
ceaseless change it may be more difficult to determine who possesses the true 
coin of originality, since bona fide renewers of the language often receive 
less attention than their boisterous colleagues. Reinventing poetic discourse 
is a solitary occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 One such innovator is Richard Kenney, whose work demonstrates that the way 
forward may depend as much on a profound look into the past as on one's grasp 
of the present. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first collection of poems, "The Evolution of the Flightless Bird," 
winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, Kenney revitalized the 
unfashionable form of the extended sonnet sequence, roughening his meters, 
playing fast and loose with his rhymes, all in an effort to answer or 
articulate the dimensions of a single question: "Who knows what ark we've come 
to build?" 
</P>
<P>
 In "Orrery" he used the lyric particulars of a Vermont cider-milling farm -- 
Robert Frost's literary terrain -- to study the art and physics of love, the 
watchworks of the title furnishing the volume's controlling metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in "The Invention of the Zero," Kenney's third and most ambitious book, 
"the Golden Anniversary of certain heavy elements" -- i.e. of the Atomic Age -- 
is the ground (or ground zero?) for his exploration of our changing world. 
</P>
<P>
 If the governing myths of modernity derive to some extent from the scientific 
revolution, then poets interested in creating wisdom literature will not duck 
the challenge of fashioning music for the discoveries of Charles Darwin, Albert 
Einstein and the other scientific giants still shaping our vision. "Poems of 
Science?" James Merrill asks in "The Changing Light at Sandover," which 
shimmers in the background of "The Invention of the Zero." (Kenney has 
dedicated his book to Merrill, and in several passages one can hear the older 
poet's voice sing out, though this in no way diminishes his originality.) The 
answer is clearly yes. 
</P>
<P>
 What first impresses is Kenney's language, which is at once gorgeous, exact 
and difficult to penetrate. Some readers will be put off by its archaisms, and 
the poet's description of his methods in the "Notes and Acknowledgments" only 
reinforces the radical nature of his project: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm recalling what Auden in his own work called 'curious prosodic fauna'; 
here, sired by Darwin on Celtic consonance, an undescribed subspecies of 
mutating end-rhyme brachiating down the ragged margin of an hexameter (common, 
sprung, or truncate) understory, camouflaged and hard to spot in low light, 
maybe, audible still above such marsupial yelps and jungle cheeps and vocative 
tectonic splinterings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The best approach to the four narratives and short colloquies included in "The 
Invention of the Zero" is to read them in the same spirit that T.S. Eliot 
invoked in his preface to St. John Perse's "Anabase": "It is to be expected 
that the reader of a poem should take at least as much trouble as a barrister 
reading an important decision on a complicated case." Readers who take such 
trouble will be delighted by the range and quickness of Kenney's mind: 
</P>
<P>
 What industry our species show! What strange and mad anathemas  
</P>
<P>
 We've uttered on ourselves here in this smoky maze  
</P>
<P>
 We've made our home, unraveling the single plume  
</P>
<P>
 Of orange flame whose wick braids up from some dry wadi  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in East Africa, to thread the gloom  
</P>
<P>
 Of Quattrocento caves, though Attic  
</P>
<P>
 Lime-kilns, lit cathedrals -- each illuminated  
</P>
<P>
 Mass we've cupped in mind since Quaternary  
</P>
<P>
 Time began --  
</P>
<P>
 These lines come from the title poem, which is a meditation on an early atomic 
explosion in the New Mexico desert. It ends on a haunting note: 
</P>
<P>
 And what's ahead? Night's end, a windshield touched to shards  
</P>
<P>
 And sifted into sky again? A sleep? A silence  
</P>
<P>
 Sliced clean at the closing iris, shuttered  
</P>
<P>
 Down like a blue garrote across the lens and burst  
</P>
<P>
 Zero of the instant, here, where the watchface lends  
</P>
<P>
 Its own light, by the numbers, green and cool, where I first  
</P>
<P>
 Witnessed -- what? -- their afterbirth? -- their avatar? --  
</P>
<P>
 Beginnings, say, or ends, rehearsed? -- the day they lanced  
</P>
<P>
 The surfaces of things, and bled from a fist  
</P>
<P>
 Of warm earth the quick inhuman light of stars.  
</P>
<P>
 Kenney's narratives depend on digression, which makes them more interesting 
than the recent ruck of American narrative poems. It is true that a story is 
buried in each of these long poems -- a cross-country drive by a witness to 
that early atomic test, a chess match officers played at a forgotten military 
outpost in the Galapagos Islands. But the story is little more than scaffolding 
on which the poet hangs his music. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Invention of the Zero" is an astonishing book, one that with each reading 
yields more pleasure. "What change can I recall, or work?" the poet asks. "I'm 
doomed to overstatement, last as first: / a sun's reintroduction, new forms of 
worship, fustian / as ever: air, earth, water, fire ." What Richard Kenney 
writes and ritualizes in these poems are those very forms of worship.

CLOUDED HINDSIGHT; CROSSING THE BORDER: AN EROTIC JOURNEY, BY KIM CHERNIN 
(FAWCETT/COLUMBINE: $22; 328 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lillian Faderman, Lillian Faderman's Scotch Verdict, a study of the early 
19th-Century trial on which Lillian Hellman based The Children's Hour, has just 
been reissued by Columbia University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the space of a few short months in 1971, Kim Chernin deserted her 
8-year-old child and devoted husband in order to traipse off on a foreign 
adventure; she led another man on until his frustrated love for her turned him 
into a basket case, and she permanently disillusioned still another man, a 
21-year-old Israeli soldier 10 years her junior, with whom she had a heavy 
affair. In those same few short months Kim Chernin ruined the marriage of a 
woman who had fallen in love with her, almost caused that woman's husband to 
commit murder because he was so distraught over their lesbian affair, then 
abandoned her woman lover as she had abandoned the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did she? In her autobiographical "Crossing the Border: An Erotic Journey," 
Chernin, looking back from the vantage point of middle age on events that 
occurred -- or perhaps did not occur -- two decades ago, explores the 
trickiness of memory, the unruliness of young appetites and the desire of the 
mature self to make sense of and forgive one's often-puzzling, often-silly 
younger self. The young Kim Chernin she depicts is amoral, self-absorbed and 
outrageous in her egotism. Or is it that the 51-year-old Chernin, conquered now 
by the stifling, tyrannical superego she had so valiantly fought two decades 
ago, places the worst possible construction on the 31-year-old Kim Chernin's 
tortured struggle toward self-knowledge? And what construction are we, the 
readers, to place on it? 
</P>
<P>
 Chernin's memoir begins as Kim arrives on a kibbutz near the northern border 
of Israel. For young American Jews, Israel in 1971 was still a country of 
idealism and high energy, a land that could call forth the best in one. Has Kim 
come frivolously, looking for excitement, hoping to be "seized by the hair," to 
fall madly in love, as Chernin of the 1990s suggests at one point? Or has she 
come, as the writer speculates at another point, because, having left husband 
and child, she felt desperately alienated everywhere else, felt that her name 
was inscribed in the Book of the Dead and that only in Israel would she find 
redemption? 
</P>
<P>
 Under kibbutz rules, guests are permitted only to visit for a few days. But 
the simplest kibbutz tasks, such as washing the dishes, bring Kim unaccustomed 
rapture. She knows she must stay. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not enough for the egotistical Kim, as the 1990s Chernin suggests with 
some degree of shamefacedness: "She wanted to be loved, chosen, have rules 
broken for her." She did not want to be permitted to stay out of "abstract 
justice." The reader is becoming as impatient with 31-year-old Kim as the 
writer is. 
</P>
<P>
 Impatience grows. Simon, who loves her so tenderly that he cannot make love to 
her, sings to her instead: "I watch over your sleep . . . my little one . . . I 
watch over you." He reminds her of the husband she left back home who gave her 
money to travel and who is taking care of her child. She tells Simon: "You're 
wasting your time. . . . I don't want love. I told you a thousand times I don't 
want love. You want me to break your heart, that's what you want from me." And 
she obliges. Simon wanders the cold fields barefooted, with a haunted look. But 
is it she who has destroyed him? Or was he destroyed long before Kim crossed 
his path? 
</P>
<P>
 Dov is next. He is the handsome soldier, two-thirds her age, who, she dreams, 
will help her explore woman's "preordained, capacious, multiorgasmic 
sexuality." He is not only willing to assist, he is crazy about her. Dov "is 
the sort of man who loves once in his life," Kim thinks. "This is the time, it 
won't happen again." Is he real or invented? She leaves him for another lover, 
a woman. Or does he leave her? For a reason as mundane as the fact that he is 
21 and it is time for him to go off to the university? 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's lesbian relationship begins while Dov is away at the university. Sena is 
a sabra. She has always lived on a kibbutz and is married to a young kibbutznik 
and leader in the community. But she falls in love with Kim. Neither women has 
loved another woman before. Their sexual relationship reveals to Kim the 
primordial experience that men have tried to keep for themselves, the return 
through eros to a place like that from which they first entered the world: "I 
now can want, touch, take to myself, the original body of love," Kim exults. 
</P>
<P>
 So why does Kim leave this bestower of primordial bliss? Is it because, as Kim 
crassly says at one point, "love is not a sublime glue that sticks you forever 
to this one, to no other. Love is not an enduring attachment, why should it 
be?" Or is it because Kim realizes that Sena, having spent her entire life on 
kibbutzim, cannot simply go off to a big city where they might live as lesbian 
lovers -- and that there is no city in the Israel of 1971 big enough for 
lesbians? Kim runs off to Scotland; Sena returns to her husband, has a child 
with him, divorces, remarries, has many children and works as a kibbutz 
librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 In Scotland a more mature Chernin suddenly emerges and decides that Kim is a 
hopeless reprobate who must be killed off. In her place is born the Chernin 
who, two decades later, recollects her sins -- which may or may not have been 
horrendous. But what of Kim's desertion of her 8-year-old daughter? Can one 
forgive that? The daughter can. Larissa is now 28, grew up in one piece, went 
to Harvard, insists to her mother, who blames herself for the actions of that 
selfish Kim who never thought of her little daughter: "She must have been 
thinking (of me). How else could she have sent you to take her place?" 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter forgives Kim, but can Chernin? Can we? Her self-absorption is 
often boring. She makes a tedious tally of the hearts piled up at her feet. Yet 
it becomes clear that her tally is born out of a desperation to be assured that 
she is cherishable. She manages to force a modicum of sympathy from us, making 
us remember our own youthful insecurities and peccadilloes. And then there is 
the question, with which Chernin herself struggles, of what really happened. 
Was Kim so dashingly culpable in fact, or was it only in childish wishful 
thinking that she was a femme fatale ? Chernin, now a psychotherapist in 
Berkeley, finally looks for Kim's good points, lets herself be charmed by the 
vitality and imagination that have disappeared in staid middle age, and ends in 
a healthy reconciliation with her younger self. The reader, having not so much 
emotional investment in Kim and exhausted by her tally, is somewhat less 
charmed.

 I lived in Silver Lake from 1991 to 1993, and though I would rather forget the 
experience of being held up one night as I left my car to shop for groceries, I 
now miss the area's vibrant cultural eclecticism and laid-back acceptance of 
diversity ("East-side, Westside," by Jill Stewart, Jan. 23). I recently 
returned to my native Northern California, but in a way things haven't changed 
too much. Just as I used to defend the Silver Lake-Los Feliz area to my 
Westside friends, I now find myself speaking defensively of L.A. as a whole. 
Whether in Palo Alto or Palos Verdes, white fright sounds the same.

 Perhaps because of the concentration of wealth on the Westside, a lopsided 
view of its importance is perpetuated by the press, politicians and economists. 
I was born and grew up there, so I know what a beautiful place it is. But after 
living in other parts of L.A. County and experiencing their amazing diversity, 
I realize that the Westside is only a small part of what L.A. is all about. 
Perhaps the earthquake, which was shared by both sides, will make us aware that 
we are not so far apart.

 One thing about the article's assumptions troubles me. The "gracious docents" 
at Pasadena's Gamble House are described as handing down their legacy to 
"mostly ethnic" art trainees. So what does that make these "gracious docents" 
ethnically? Purely human? Extraterrestrial? Or did your article, designed to 
damage ethnic stereotyping, commit one of the worst: the depiction of 
Anglo-European ancestry as non-ethnic and, by association, normative.

 The booming wartime economy soon made it possible for renters in the flats to 
begin to realize their dreams of moving up -- literally and figuratively. (We 
even took Canter's Delicatessen with us.)

 I still dream of the beautiful home we lived in, the very last house on Stone

from the East were always impressed. And I remember when strangers were objects

 People all over Los Angeles decline to travel outside of their own economic 
settings. Why? Because when we attempt to travel to "the other side," we are 
treated as foreigners. I've been to Santa Monica a few times, and people give 
me the "What are you doing here?" look. It hurts to be looked down upon, but it 
makes me, a taxpayer, fight harder to keep from being boxed in. I want to

 What Eastsiders and Westsiders share is a need to live in whatever peace we

 Duncan's piece, if a touch belletristic and politically correct for my taste, 
was lucid and well reasoned, maybe brilliant. The vexation of it, of course, is 
that it accurately predicts its own inevitable failure as an instrument of 
enlightenment. No fundamentalist will possess the "divine" sanction, the 
inclination or the comprehension to read and understand it.

 Being Guatemalan-born (though raised in the United States since the age of 5), 
I was impressed with the time, effort and consideration given to Rigoberta 
Menchu, her goals and admirable quest ("Rigoberta Menchu and the New Mayan 
Pride," by Hector Tobar, Jan. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 I have been to Guatemala several times and can attest to the blatant abuse, 
verbal and physical, of these poor people, even by my own family (we are 
middle-class Ladinos).I have read Menchu's book and believe all she says about 
the atrocities heaped upon the Guatemalan Indians. I pray for world compassion 
and understanding but realize that perhaps one must be an Indian who was born 
and raised in Guatemala to fully understand.

CENSOR-TIVITY

 Thank you for David James Duncan's balanced, lucid and thoughtful essay on 
fundamentalist censorship ("Toxins in the Mother Tongue," Jan. 23). His 
experience highlights the need to protect our educational system from 
demagogues of all stripes. Our schools and communities must not be persecuted 
for "thought crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, along with national standards designed to raise the academic levels 
of all students, regardless of background, we need a national policy of 
inclusion for all cultural traditions and political viewpoints. Rather than 
relegating the study of our fellow beings to a few optional humanities credits, 
let understanding of all shades of the human condition be our schools' 
overriding covenant.

 I was reared in the Virginia Bible Belt as a Southern Baptist, and my parents 
rammed Christian fundamentalism down my throat, starting with grace before my 
first bottle. When I was 20, my father and I heard a radio newscast of an 
anti-abortion demonstration at a clinic. He asked me if I agreed with the 
protesters. I said no, that I believed in choice, and he flew into a rage, 
screaming: "We didn't raise you to believe in abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 My parents automatically label all knowledge as either "Christian" or 
"non-Christian." As most literature falls into the latter category, 
fundamentalists will always censor in the name of God. Perhaps it's a sign of 
progress that Duncan's young readers were allowed to actually read his book 
(albeit censored); my parents had offending titles removed from my elementary 
school library.

point. The battle over his work did not take place in public libraries or 
bookstores but in public schools, where freedom of expression is not always 
welcome (i.e. the recent PC squabble on college campuses). Fundamentalists are 
not ogres. Parents only want to avoid adult language being forced upon their 
children. Yes, literature should be experienced by everyone -- but not all 
literature by every age group.

 Reading Duncan's scathing literary essay, I could not help but think: What if 
he is wrong? What if the God of the Bible is the Lord, God and creator of the 
universe? What if there is a moral standard where right and wrong exist, and 
that information has been made available to all people -- a user's manual of 
sorts? How impish and self-righteous then become Duncan's accusations and 
slanderous statements of "cult," "pollution," "Christofascism" and the like.

 While the mainstream press in the United States has, of late, frequently been 
criticized for its tabloid inclinations and sleaze, the real tragedy has been 
the spinelessness that has characterized it for so long. Those who say you have 
been too easy on Bill Clinton should remember the eight-year honeymoon Ronald 
Reagan enjoyed. If you had pressed harder on Iran-Contra, for example, you 
could have changed the course of American history: George Bush would not have 
been elected President, and Oliver North would surely not be campaigning to 
become a senator from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 So you are, I suppose, to be applauded for allowing Duncan to take on the 
American fundamentalists, a target worthy of such a witty, damaging attack. One 
wonders, however, if you would have printed so effective an attack against that 
other group of fascistic censors, those who would also take away the right of 
creative (though perhaps sometimes threatening) expression and thought -- those 
arguing for speech and behavior codes as well as politically correct curricula 
on college campuses.

 Fundamentalist Christians are not interested in being censors. They are, in 
fact, finding themselves in a desperate fight to keep works of fiction or 
nonfiction that have even a slight reference to Christian thinking from being 
removed from the shelves and reading lists of schools and libraries. This has 
even included the Bible itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, those responsible members of our culture, regardless of 
political or religious persuasion, who would hope that we can improve the moral 
and ethical climate in the United States seem to be coming to a point of 
agreement. Freedom of any kind must be accompanied by responsibility and 
accountability.

 On reading Duncan's article, Joe Sixpack exclaimed "Wha?" and the rest of us 
giggled with relief in the realization that educated common sense still exists 
-- even with a poetic twist. Now, how do we get our public schools to produce 
and nurture more Duncans?

 A common error resulted in a confusing headline in Palm Latitudes ("Towing the 
Orthodox Hemline," Jan. 27).You mean toeing, not towing. Human toes are 
involved, not trucks. 19th-Century classrooms had cracks in the floor. Teachers 
would have their pupils place their toes along the cracks during spelling 
competitions. This method of lining up students became so prevalent that the 
expressions toe the line, toe the mark and even toe the crack have now become 
honorable parts of the American language.

 THE WORST OF TIMES by Patricia G. Miller (HarperPerennial: $12; 328 pp.). 
Miller spent more than two years compiling these oral histories about abortion 
in America between 1929 and 1940, speaking to women who had abortions, children 
who watched their mothers die from botched operations, doctors who performed 
the surgery and police officers who arrested them.In grim, intimate accounts, 
the subjects recall the suffering of desperate women who risked arrest, 
ostracism and even death. A Pennsylvania coroner who examined the bodies of 
women who died of septicemia, hemorrhage, peritonitis, etc., concludes, "The 
deaths stopped overnight in 1973, and I never saw another abortion death in all 
the 18 years after that until I retired. That ought to tell people something 
about keeping abortion legal."

 WINTER EYES by Lev Raphael (St. Martin's Press: $8.95; 245 pp.). Lev Raphael's 
gracefully written first novel continues his exploration of themes that 
appeared in his notable collection of short stories, "Dancing on Tish 
B'Av."Stefan, the central character and sometimes narrator, drifts through his 
New York boyhood, not knowing who he is, ethnically, religiously or sexually. 
His parents are so determined to bury the memories of the horrors they endured 
during the Holocaust, they deny their son all sense of a past. Stefan is 
rescued from this oppressive vacuum by his gentle, melancholy uncle, a piano 
teacher who shares his love of music. As he struggles to establish an identity, 
Stefan inadvertently breaches his parents' carefully maintained barriers in a 
series of bitter epiphanies.

 THE OTHER CALIFORNIA: The Great Central Valley in Life and Letters by Gerald 
Haslam (University of Nevada Press: $11.95; 221 pps.). For many Californians, 
the state consists of the cities of the Southern Coast and San Francisco Bay. 
But the vast Central Valley contains some of the most fertile farmland in the 
world: The value of its annual agricultural yield exceeds the total value of 
all the gold mined in the state since 1848. Haslam's low-key essays explore a 
variety of topics, from the pleasures of growing up in Oildale to the threats 
posed by the depletion of the water table. In one striking piece, he shows that 
the same pejorative terms used to describe foreign immigrants today were 
applied to the Midwesterners who arrived during the Dust Bowl.

 EASY RECYCLING HANDBOOK by Dee McVicker (Grassroots Books: $8.95; 128 pp., 
paperback original) and WHAT WORKS: Local Solutions to Toxic Pollution by 
Kristin Schafer with Sarah Blust, Brian Lipsett, Penny Newman and Richard Wiles 
(Public Interest Publications, P.O. Box 229, Arlington, Va.: $17, plus $2 
postage; 157 pp., illustrated, paperback original). As the title suggests, 
"Easy Recycling" offers basic instructions on how to prepare material to be 
recycled, how to recognize the symbols for different types of plastic, 
etc."Local Solutions" focuses on questions of environmental justice, citing 
instances of citizens rallying to defeat ill-planned projects, remove health 
threats and force companies to install pollution controls. At a time when 
members of poor and/or minority communities are objecting to being stuck with 
disproportionate numbers of waste sites, the authors hope to convert readers 
into activists by demonstrating that they can successfully oppose powerful 
corporate interests.

 SPINE by Jud Fine & Harry Reese (Los Angeles Library Assn.: $25, until April 
1, $35 thereafter; 127 pp., illustrated, paperback original.) The Maguire 
Gardens of the renovated Central Library offer one of the most pleasant 
environments in metropolitan L.A. In this handsome book, the creators of the 
"art plan" installed there in 1993 explain their work, although a facility 
designed for all citizens shouldn't need this elaborate exegesis.Fine and Reese 
seem to have been guided by a fuzzy-minded notion of political correctness, 
rather than an aesthetic vision: They wouldn't quote the Declaration of 
Independence because it was written by Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves. 
Although obviously well-intentioned, "Spine" leaves readers hoping the Library 
chooses books more carefully than art.

 HOW I GOT CULTURED: A Nevada Memoir by Phyllis Barber (University of Nevada 
Press: $12.95; 189 pp., illustrated). Barber's merry memoir describes the 
conflicts she experienced as a child, torn between the narrowly regimented 
world of her parents' Mormonism and her desire to learn more about the world. 
The author, who longed to join her high school spirit group, was forced to 
endure lectures where young women were compared to roses, guarding their petals 
for their future husbands. Barber never mocks her parents or their beliefs, she 
merely expresses her own doubts and uncertainties in a humorous coming-of-age 
story.

 LADY DAY: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday by Robert O'Meally (Arcade: $17.95; 
207 pp.). Instead of recounting Holiday's troubled (and often misrepresented) 
life, O'Meally concentrates on her development as an artist.Dividing her work 
into three periods (1933-1938, 1939-1949, 1950- 1959), he stresses the unique 
qualities of her voice, which she used the way other jazz musicians used 
instruments. Although the tone seems a bit worshipful at times, O'Meally's text 
and extraordinary trove of photographs offer insights into the woman who 
declared, "I can't stand to sing the same song the same way for two nights in 
succession, let alone two years or 10 years. If you can, then it ain't music, 
it's close-order drill or exercise or yodeling or something, not music."

THREE ON THE TOWN: RUBBLE-ROUSING; HE MAY HAVE MISSED THE BIG EVENT, BUT HE'S 
SENSITIVE TO THE NUANCES OF POST-QUAKE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 I have lived my entire life in Los Angeles County. And like almost everybody 
else in Los Angeles, I have measured out my life in cataclysms: the Sylmar and 
Whittier quakes, the riots of '65 and '92 and the annual Malibu fires. And I 
relate events to them the way the old geezers in Ma and Pa Kettle movies 
wheezed about the winter of nineteen-ought-six. As the narrative of Europe is 
written in its wars, L.A.'s is written in its calamities, and their rhythms say 
as much as anything about what it means to be an Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the Northridge earthquake, I was standing just behind the slam pit 
at a rock 'n' roll show in Australia, and my biggest worry at the time was 
whether the drunk guy sloshing beside me was planning to turn his head away 
when he heaved. I found out about the quake soon enough; it seemed as though 
half the people in the hotel left me messages about the thing. I spent eight or 
so hours trying to get a line out of the country so I could call my wife (she 
was all right), but it seemed like an abstract event, even as I watched 
television pictures of collapsed roads I had driven often, almost daily. There 
is limited information one can glean from watching German newscasts in 
Australia. For the rest of the trip, all I could think of was getting back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as people tell me I am lucky to have been out of town, I'm sorry I 
wasn't around. And I know nobody wants to hear that, any more than they wanted 
to hear all the newly conservative '60s guys a few years ago when they 
regretted not having served in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I'm particularly bummed about missing the quake itself, the 
jolt, the overturned bookshelves, the stoves that suddenly took terrible 
flight. I don't like earthquakes any better than anyone else. And it doesn't, I 
think, have that much to do with survivor guilt; that would probably be shared 
by the people in Venice whose sustained damage amounted to a single shattered 
champagne flute and a dented can of peas. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I came back three or four days after the event, it seemed as though I 
had come back to a different city -- one with different traffic patterns, a 
different personality, even a slightly different language -- than the one I had 
left just a week before. A careful reading of a week's worth of newspapers 
eventually provided plenty of information, but I missed the context, the shared 
experience, the camaraderie of fear, the compulsive 27 hours of television 
watching -- the initial misguided newsguy chatter, the calm authority of Dr. 
Kate Hutton, the helicopter shots of the San Fernando fires and the shattered 
freeway overpasses -- that everyone seemed to share. 
</P>
<P>
 I blanked on allusions to the guy trapped in the Northridge parking structure. 
Among my friends, I, alone, seem optimistic about the jobs that several billion 
dollars in federal disaster relief will temporarily pump into the region. I 
have noticed differences between me and many of those friends: They are jumpy 
when a large truck rumbles by, because they have bonded in catastrophe.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, even though I missed the quake, I live in a city changed by its 
history. I inch down Adams instead of soaring over it on the 10 (taking in the 
splendid '30s Art Deco commercial strip that I'd only sped through before), and 
I lament all the crazily leaning ziggurats, the sagging Moderne facades that 
will have to come down. My cross-town freeway routes sometimes mirror the ones 
my father used to take before the Santa Monica Freeway was built in the early 
'60s -- up the San Diego to Encino, back down the Hollywood to Downtown -- and 
though the car-pool detour on the eastbound 10 isn't bad, I sometimes think a 
long time these days before accepting a dinner invitation in Venice. People I 
run into sometimes make a point of telling me that the South-Central 
neighborhoods they now detour through have splendid lawns, beautiful Craftsman 
houses and prosperous commercial areas, that the vast expanse of 
African-American Los Angeles doesn't necessarily remind them of "Boyz N the 
Hood" anymore. Ummm . . . welcome to the new L.A.!

CHATEAU ECLECTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Dorion

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Sunday afternoon, under wood beam ceilings and arched windows looking out 
to a courtyard at the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, the 100 seats and 
sofas in the main lobby were filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ontkean (in his other life, the sheriff on "Twin Peaks") read a 
selection of poems by Sharon Olds, Amy Gerstler and Dylan Thomas, then read his 
own work, much of which focuses on his Canadian childhood. This reading opened 
the third season of the New York-based Poetry Society of America's L.A. 
chapter, where actors such as Tim Curry, Joe Spano and John Lithgow have read 
their work and the work of such well-known poets as Galway Kinnell and David 
St. John. 
</P>
<P>
 After 45 minutes, Sherod Santos stepped to the podium. He began with two poems 
meant to symbolize good and evil, the second of which is a stirring account of 
a rabbi and the rabbi's friend, held in a Nazi concentration camp. The 
prose-like poem details the demands put upon these men to jump over a pit 
filled with corpses, where failure to clear the precipice will result in 
certain execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos then read from his latest collection, "The City of Women," pointing out 
the Parisian, Algerian and Midwest landscapes from which the book evolves. He 
read calmly, carefully. The lobby was silent. "At first," Santos explains, "I 
thought the forum of this sort of reading was intimidating. But the actors are 
a good medium for expanding poetry and injecting it into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is true. A poetry reading has the power to make one sketch down free 
verse or iambic pentameter. That's good enough entertainment for poets. But 
whom do the actors draw in? According to Elena Byrne, regional director of 
PSALA: "Everyone else."

MANIFESTO OF THE LEAD PENCIL CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By We received a missive, written in pencil, from Bill Henderson, editor of The 
Pushcart Press, inviting the technologically disgruntled to join The Lead 
Pencil Club's mission to be A Pothole on the Information Highway. The club's 
statement (in part) follows. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The god of our godless age is speed. Driven by our obsession to compete, we 
have embraced this electronic god with a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, blessed with Fax, Voice and E-mail, computer hookups and TVs with 
hundreds of channels, we won't have to leave our lonely rooms -- not to write a 
check, work, visit, shop, exercise, or make love (virtual reality will serve). 
</P>
<P>
 We won't write letters to friends because we won't have friends -- just 
electronic anachronisms. Next century, nobody will know the meaning of "love," 
though "self-love " may survive. 
</P>
<P>
 We will have raced at incredible speeds on the information superhighway to 
reach our final destination -- Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Director Emeritus, Henry David Thoreau, said it first in 1844: "We are in 
great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas, but Maine 
and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Henry David Thoreau, our club is cranky. We honor provocation. We want to 
start an argument in the broad flapping American ear. 
</P>
<P>
 With Founding Director Doris Grumbach, we like to imagine that computers had 
"contracted a fatal illness for which there was no cure." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore predicts that his Information Superhighway will bring 
people closer together, but the Club asks: Now that voice mail answers our 
telephone calls, are we more in touch or are we drifting further apart? Our 
pledges: We will avoid fax and hang up on Voice Mail. We will receive no E-Mail 
and send none. If our computers develop a virus, we will seek no cure. Our 
communications will be face to face. If direct human contact is not possible, 
we will write letters in our own handwriting because that handwriting is a mark 
of our personality. 
</P>
<P>
 What's your hurry, Al Gore? Speed Kills. Where's the Fire? Haste Makes Waste. 
Back To Basics. Not So Fast! 
</P>
<P>
 As Henry David Thoreau said, "Simplify, simplify, simplify."

PALM LATITUDES: SCENE OF THE CRIME; YOUR MERLIN OR YOUR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conceived of as idyllic, care-free avenues of recreation, local bicycle paths 
are becoming just another place where Angelenos have to watch their backs. 
Bike-jackings, city officials say, are a new urban anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bike paths are becoming notorious, including the Los Angeles and San 
Gabriel River trails, which start in Maywood and El Monte, as well as parts of 
the beach path in the South Bay. Along the San Gabriel River Trail, thieves 
have placed wires and broken glass to slow cyclists riding along isolated 
stretches. Parts of the trail are out of sight of roads or houses and some 
routes have gates that trap riders in dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thieves will hide out next to bathrooms along beach paths and then push 
riders off their bikes," says Sean Collinsworth, a team leader of the L.A. 
County sheriff's bicycle patrol unit. "Sometimes they'll just stand there with 
baseball bats and whack people in the head or torso as they speed by. But 
they're discerning. They'll scrutinize the value of a bike before making a 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Bike thefts have become more lucrative as the number of expensive bikes on the 
paths increases. Many bikes are worth $3,000 or more. Titanium bicycles, such 
as Merlins or Litespeeds, can be resold for large sums. As for a bike with an 
aluminum frame, "it's like an aluminum can to them; they'll just take the bikes 
to recycling centers," says Paul Tay, Los Angeles' Bicycle Program Coordinator. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles last year, about 6,300 bikes were stolen, but 
police keep no separate statistics on how many are bike-jacked. (Countywide 
statistics are quake victims; they're stuck in a red-tagged county facility.) 
Many cyclists prefer to ride in packs to avoid confrontations. Even then, 
showdowns happen. "Four of us were riding on the San Gabriel Trail when three 
guys on mountain bikes chased one of us down to the river bottom," says Bud 
Plochere, a member of the L.A. Wheelmen bicycle club. "They blocked the ramp 
and circled him, but he rode up the side of the bank -- almost impossible to do 
-- and got away. It happens all the time. When you're alone or get separated 
from the group, it's dangerous." R. Daniel Foster

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; THE KARAOKE KRONICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kit Roane 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karaoke seems more popular than Prozac in Southern California these days. And 
that may not be a coincidence: "It's therapeutic," declares Dennis G. Snyder, a 
KJ -- karaoke jockey -- and publisher of the 11-month-old newsletter California 
Karaoke Scene. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many folks taking advantage of the carthartic effects of pretending to 
be Frank or Barry or Liza, Snyder says his publication is proof of the boom. In 
the first issue eight months ago, only 60 karaoke clubs were listed; the 
newsletter now includes more than 200. Snyder says he distributes 25,000 copies 
of his bimonthly newsletter at clubs and other outlets throughout Los Angeles 
and the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's newsletter offers more than just listings. It recently reported on 
two scalawags who had gone to great lengths to win their respective big-buck 
sing-along contests (Karaoke croon-offs now offer prizes as high as $1,000): 
One told his competitors that the night of the contest had been changed. 
Another used his universal remote control to change the key of some of his 
competitor's songs. Both were apprehended and reprimanded. We can only hope 
they were forced to listen to each other sing "Feelings." Kit Roane

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE 'SCHINDLER' EVERYONE 
FORGOT ABOUT -- UNTIL NOW; A DECADE AGO, JON BLAIR'S DOCUMENTARY WON A BRITISH 
ACADEMY AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRITTEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the Oscar hype surrounding "Schindler's List," it has nearly been 
forgotten that Steven Spielberg's epic isn't the first film to have been made 
about the legendary Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,100 Jews from Nazi death 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, filmmaker Jon Blair made "Schindler," an 80-minute documentary 
for Britain's Thames Television about Schindler's life. It won a British 
Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Owing to the renewed interest in Schindler's story, Blair's film has 
resurfaced. It is airing on BBC television here tonight -- and Blair believes 
Universal, which owns rights to his film outside Britain, may release 
"Schindler" on video to coincide with the video release of Spielberg's film. 
The film also will be shown in Los Angeles on March 19 on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain differences between (novelist) Thomas Keneally's account of 
Schindler's life and mine," said Blair, a South African-born producer, 
playwright and former war correspondent based in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read his book, spoke to Tom at length and made use of some of his contacts. 
But I started again, using my own sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Blair landed a few coups. He interviewed Schindler's widow, 
Emilie, on camera; she reflected on her late husband's seductive appeal, 
claiming she "could fight against one woman, but 10 or 100. . . ." Blair also 
talked to Schindler's mistress Ewa Kisza, who attests in "Schindler" to Oskar's 
impulsive nature and his craving for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Most remarkably, Blair tracked down Ruth Kalder, known as Majola, the mistress 
of concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth (played in Spielberg's film by 
Ralph Fiennes). The footage of Majola is harrowing; she is suffering from 
emphysema, and wheezes alarmingly. The day after Blair interviewed her on 
camera, he heard from Monica, her daughter by Amon Goeth, that Majola had taken 
a drug overdose and died. (In a remarkable introduction to his interview with 
Spielberg in the current British edition of Esquire, Blair, who is Jewish, 
admits to fantasies of seducing Monica for revenge, then telling her afterward 
of his ethnicity.) 
</P>
<P>
 On camera, Majola says she never saw Jewish children or old people at the 
camps with Goeth. She adds that he "was not a brutal killer . . . he didn't 
kill Jews just for the fun of it." When Blair questions her about Schindler, 
she turns the question back on him: "You think Schindler liked Jews? He was a 
lovable opportunist. He needed them so he worked with them. But he didn't take 
them to his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 This statement contrasts strongly with the views of many Schindlerjuden who 
tell Blair they regard Schindler as an angel who delivered them from certain 
death. But one of them, Joachim Kinstlinger, dissents: "I don't believe 
(Schindler) was a Jew lover. He was a German, a Nazi, a guy who made money." 
</P>
<P>
 "I included (Kinstlinger) as a representative of the few people who are more 
skeptical about Schindler," said Blair. "But it was hard to find anyone who had 
a bad word to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair persuaded Dirk Bogarde, the English actor who was present at the 
liberation of the Belsen death camp, to narrate the voice-over for his film. 
After it had aired on British TV, he donated his transcripts for the 
documentary to London's Imperial War Museum. He was flattered to learn the 
British actors in "Schindler's List" had used the transcripts as research for 
their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of "Schindler's List," Blair says: "It's an extremely powerful fiction, true 
to the essence of Schindler's story. If Spielberg and (screenwriter Steven) 
Zaillian had altered any critical factual elements, there might be some debate, 
but it's a faithful representation of Keneally's book." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Blair now looks back on his own work in "Schindler" and sees 
flaws: "I think I got one thing substantially wrong, which was the relationship 
between Schindler and Stern (played in "Schindler's List" by Ben Kingsley). 
Zaillian was right to have concentrated on it, and seems to have got much 
closer to the truth. I never got good enough material from other people about 
Stern, and I misjudged it. It shows how TV style determines content." 
</P>
<P>
 But Blair is also concerned whether his film or Spielberg's portrays the 
relationship between Schindler and Goeth accurately. "I feel they were much 
more meshed together than either of us have made it. If that's true, it puts 
Schindler into the opportunist camp. He and Goeth were locked together in a 
fraud. It did Goeth no harm to keep going with Schindler's charade, and I think 
he knew it was a charade." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's film also includes archive footage of Schindler from a 1973 German TV 
documentary; he is seen strolling around the streets of Frankfurt. At that time 
he said he saved all the Jews he could because he couldn't stand all the 
killing; he gradually came to feel he must do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to accept that's what he felt," Blair says now. "But I always felt it 
was a weakness in my film that I couldn't explain Schindler's motivation, and 
Spielberg told me the same about his -- it seems impossible to crack that 
enigma."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE MANY FACES OF RUSSELL 
MEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russell Means, the fiery, controversial Indian activist, is planning to relive 
the violent Wounded Knee siege -- this time on film, starring, he says, his 
former "The Last of the Mohicans" co-star Daniel Day-Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaging of the violent 1973 71-day standoff on the Pine Ridge Sioux 
reservation in South Dakota is only one of the many film projects Means, 54, 
has in the fire. Among his other efforts:  
</P>
<P>
 * A documentary about 20th-Century Indian women. 
</P>
<P>
 * A hefty co-starring role in Oliver Stone's prison drama, "Natural Born 
Killers," due later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A co-starring role opposite John Candy in Carolco Pictures' "Wagons East," 
currently filming in Durango, Mexico, ( see accompanying story, Page 24 ).  
</P>
<P>
 * Playing the ghost of athlete Jim Thorpe in the upcoming "Wind Runner," with 
Margot Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wounded Knee saga, Means says, "will mainly be a courtroom drama, taking 
it partially from my experience in 1973," referring to the eight-month trial 
that followed the siege. "Daniel's character would be an amalgamation of all 
the lawyers who represented Dennis Banks and myself." The $30-million film, he 
says, will be produced by himself and Nancy Gaelin, whose background is in TV 
and music production. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and Means led the American Indian Movement's armed seizure of the tiny 
reservation hamlet in February, 1973. While the standoff left a federal marshal 
paralyzed for life, two young Indians dead, and Banks and Means arrested on 10 
felony counts, the episode sadly did little to change the plight of those 
living on the country's reservations. The case against Means and Banks was 
eventually thrown out on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Means hopes his film will serve as a reminder of the living conditions and 
broken spirit of the country's native peoples. "Wounded Knee was the third most 
photographed event of the 1970s. Only Watergate and the Vietnam War were 
photographed more," he says. "Nothing definitive has ever really been written 
about Wounded Knee." The spot was previously site of the 1890 massacre where 
267 Sioux men, women and children were wiped out by the U.S. Cavalry, the last 
blood bath of the U.S.-Indian Wars.  
</P>
<P>
 But Day-Lewis' London attorney, Julian Belfrage, says the actor, currently 
nominated for an Oscar for "In the Name of the Father," isn't committing to any 
roles right now.  
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel is so exhausted after his last two films he has no plans to consider 
anything. He just wants to rest," says Belfrage. He did confirm that he wrote 
Gaelin a letter in 1992 saying Day-Lewis would be interested in the film, 
depending on contractual availability, choice of director and cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Means says he's been pitching the concept around Hollywood, but no script 
exists yet. He wants Erik Bergen ("The Elephant Man") to pen the screenplay. 
And he says he's scouting a director and production money. He hopes to begin 
production next winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But this summer holds a much more concrete project, a documentary on Indian 
women of this century and their accomplishments, a film that Means plans to 
co-direct with Jema Lockhardt, a Lakota documentarian who lives in Rapid City, 
S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the Indian women who have kept our culture alive in the home," he says. 
"They have always been depicted as an appendage of a macho culture, but in 
reality they are the keepers of the culture," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 This week, Means, who keeps homes in Chinle, Ariz., (on the Navajo 
reservation) and in Sioux Falls, S.D., is in Mexico filming the comedy "Wagons 
East," a Western from Native Americans' point of view, for Carolco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did this period piece because it's funny and I liked the overall script," 
says Means. "One of the reasons I wanted to act in Hollywood is to show we're 
human beings with emotions."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: COMIC RELIEF; THESE NATIVE 
AMERICANS CAN LAUGH AT THEMSELVES IN 'WAGONS EAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture this: A troupe of Indians -- played by some known as much for their 
activism as their acting -- fending off fellow warriors to help a bunch of 
white settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound absurd? Well, that's exactly what drew some of Hollywood's more 
prominent Native American actors to star in Carolco Pictures' off-the-wall 
late-summer Western comedy, "Wagons East," currently filming in Durango, 
Mexico. Director Peter Markle's film also stars John Candy and Richard Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot: An East Coast surgeon (Lewis) and his family move west in the late 
1800s. Without cappuccino and opera, the rugged life spent among sweaty, 
stinking animals on the dusty plains proves intolerable. So, the neurotic 
failed frontiersman packs up his crew and enlists a hapless wagonmaster 
(Candy), to guide them back east. But the wagonmaster takes a wrong turn and 
drives them right into the gullet of Indian territory . . . rough Indian 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Russell Means, Rodney A. Grant, Stuart Proud Eagle Grant and Michael 
Horse, who capture the ragged band of travelers, but forfeit their scalping 
plans, smelling a gold mine of their own: They'll help the settlers return, if 
and only if they promise to ward off any other ambitious whites hoping to 
strike it rich in the west. Problem is railroad baron J. P. Moreland, who is 
expecting a major land rush, is worried the naysaying eastbound group will 
jeopardize the government money he's getting to subsidize his westbound 
railroad. So he hires the cavalry to thwart the deserters' plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Means, who plays the chief in the film, is the Native American activist 
who founded the American Indian Movement, and also played the title character, 
Chingachgook, in "The Last of the Mohicans." Rodney Grant, who plays Big Snake 
That Makes Women Faint, was the Sioux warrior Wind in His Hair in "Dances With 
Wolves" and Crazy Horse in the ABC miniseries "Son of the Morning Star." Stuart 
Proud Eagle Grant, who portrays White Cloud, had a co-starring role in 
"Geronimo." And Michael Horse, an actor, musician and renowned silversmith who 
played Deputy Hawk on David Lynch's offbeat TV series "Twin Peaks," appeared in 
"Passenger 57." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering their resumes, why would this group consider such thin roles in a 
lightweight comedy? In fact, the humor was the real draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem with films is that everybody always thinks of us as a 
violent people," says Horse. "We are not. We are spiritual. And when you show 
someone without a sense of humor or families, which is the way you usually see 
Indians in movies, then they are without a spiritual base and become subhuman. 
And when they're subhuman, that justifies showing them anyway you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he concedes, "I'm the meaner Indian in this film. I love what I did in 
this. I cracked myself up." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse plays a Lakota Indian trying to attack the eastbound wagon train. When 
he sees Big Snake and White Cloud riding with the white travelers, he asks, 
"What gives? After all, my character went to warrior school with Big Snake." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse, who grew up in Tucson, is part Zuni, Yaqui and Cree. "We're doing this 
film because we smell a classic with a hysterical premise." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Proud Eagle Grant, a Lakota, says when he auditioned for his role, "I 
could tell (director) Peter (Markle) and (producer) Gary (Goodman) didn't 
really know if the script offended me. I was laughing inside and I let them 
squirm for a minute or two. Then I looked up at them and said: 'This is a 
scream.' " Finally, someone was offering a project that showed Native Americans 
the way they see themselves -- a people with a strong sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 He says his character is "a little white in the moccasins. He comes off as a 
really tough warrior, but he wears his feather on the wrong side. I won't say 
any more except that gay people in the Indian culture are revered as high as 
the medicine man spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Proud Eagle, Rodney Grant saddled up to "Wagons East" for another reason. 
It was a chance to star in a movie made at the site of all those John Wayne 
Westerns: Durango. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town was founded on John Wayne swaggering in and shooting five Indians 
with one shot . . . so ridiculous," Grant says. "That's why they always shot 
those movies in Mexico. If John Wayne had met some real Indians they would have 
whipped his butt."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LET'S PRETEND; 'DEATH WISH 
6,' THE MUSICAL -- CAN IT HAPPEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James L. Brooks received a lot of unwanted attention when he turned his 
audacious Hollywood musical "I'll Do Anything" into a conventional seriocomic 
tale of an out-of-work actor struggling to come to terms with his flat-lining 
career, his duplicitous girlfriend and his bratty estranged daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But "I'll Do Anything" is just an extreme case on a dreary continuum in 
Hollywood that decrees that the ends are justified if the means involve extreme 
tinkering with an artist's vision. An industry that'll turn an inspirational 
screenplay about a South-Central choir teacher into a crass comedy like "Sister 
Act 2" really will do anything to make a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit, we have combed through Hollywood records to find this list of 
other movies that began life as one project, and, thanks to incessant studio 
meddling and/or rudderless artistry, ended up something else entirely: 
</P>
<P>
 * Martin Scorsese had hoped to make a sequel to "Taxi Driver," with Travis 
Bickle running down more street scum, befriending another victimized female and 
trying to kill another political candidate. Studio executives liked the idea of 
a sequel and the story line, but were afraid Scorsese's visceral style wouldn't 
appeal to kids. So they bounced him from the project, and turned the aimless, 
disaffected cabbie into an aimless, disaffected super-hero. The result: "Batman 
Returns." 
</P>
<P>
 * Executives at 20th Century Fox wanted another "Home Alone" sequel, in which 
Macaulay Culkin wreaked grievous bodily harm upon everyone around him. When 
they saw the final project, however, they were distraught to find no laughs at 
all in the movie. Undaunted, they decided to package it as a thriller, which 
was eventually called "The Good Son." 
</P>
<P>
 * After the unexpected success of "The Crying Game," Hollywood was hot for 
another transvestite tale. "But, please, no politics -- ick!" said one 
executive. "And scratch the interracial thing," moaned another. "Can't we do a 
story with no edge whatsoever, that's all soft and mushy?" suggested a third. 
"But with a heart! And zany!" enthused a fourth. "Make it a one-joke premise!" 
added a fifth, and thus was born "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 * The placid wonder of "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" began with a concept 
surprisingly different from the final product. Filmmakers initially envisioned 
a gorefest about a ruthless vigilante bird with a tiny ponytail that pecked the 
eyes out of everyone who crossed it. Until James Franciscus beat out an 
environmentally conscious, budding action star for the voice-over of the gull, 
the working title was "Jonathan Livingston Seagal." 
</P>
<P>
 * After "Die Hard," a disaster picture starring Bruce Willis sounded like 
money in the bank; unfortunately, the producer, director and screenwriter 
misread the studio memo. Thinking they had been ordered to make "a disastrous 
Bruce Willis picture," they churned out "Hudson Hawk." 
</P>
<P>
 * Studio executives were nonplussed when a project titled "Reservoir Ducks," 
about a violently disturbed, alcoholic jewelry-store robber who taught a 
pee-wee hockey team to cheat and maim its way to the state title, came across 
their desks. Still, they recognized the box-office potential in splitting up 
the disparate concepts, and "Reservoir Dogs" and "Mighty Ducks" were created. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia decision-makers were already envisioning a sequel until they saw a 
rough cut of Arnold Schwarzenegger's last movie; then, they decided to cut 
their losses and retitled "Penultimate Action Hero" "Last Action Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 * After the success of "Free Willy," Disney executives wanted to remake "Moby 
Dick," or at least "Orca." But whale special effects proved to be too 
expensive; undeterred, they set about making a nautical yarn nonetheless. 
Aspiring for the same levels of quality that imbued "Orca," they expended all 
their energy on "Cabin Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 * " 'Citizen Kane' was great, we should make a movie like that," suggested one 
Disney executive. "Yeah, but the Midwest doesn't like sophisticated urban 
stories," opined another. "So let's move it to the sticks, skew Kane younger 
for teen audiences, make it a comedy and add a moral!" suggested one who was 
promptly promoted when Pauly Shore's "Son-in-Law" was released. 
</P>
<P>
 * All of Hollywood was shocked when "The Player" received immense critical 
acclaim. "But it didn't make a whole lot of money," one studio executive 
pointed out. "That's because none of the characters were likable," observed 
another. "Let's make a scathing Hollywood satire with nice characters." Then 
Jim Brooks intervened: "Y'know, it'd really be great if we could make it a 
musical. . . ."

 Fall fashions reflected cloistered living, modesty, a sense of atonement. But 
this spring, some designers celebrate youthful innocence via baby-doll and 
tomboy styles.Others embrace ethnic, neo-punk and deconstructivist looks. What 
does this say about the clothes we'll eventually be wearing? That they're 
light, sheer, very short or very long, shiny, sometimes pretty but more often 
not. This season, it seems, no one wants to dress up.

 I was shocked when a friend of mine, who has lived in Paris more than 20 years 
and who enjoys food more than almost anyone I know, confessed that he has never 
eaten in a Michelin-starred restaurant. His haunts are modest, old-fashioned 
bistros that rarely appear in any guide. He knows which one makes a great 
rabbit in mustard sauce, which has the best country pate or blood sausage. The 
next time he comes to Los Angeles, I know just where I'll take him -- to the 
new bistro at Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, ebullient owner-chef Michel Richard divided his L.A. 
restaurant in two: on the left, the original Citrus; on the right, the Bar 
Bistro. Walk in the door, and it's hard to resist the magnetic pull to the 
left, where lush plants, lavish flower arrangements and twinkling lights create 
a casually festive setting. The bistro side seems a little forlorn, like a 
party where half the guests didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard is surely one of the city's most creative chefs, exhibiting a 
formidable sense of design when it comes to his signature dishes. But slapping 
a few posters of Brittany on the wall along with a pastiche of menus from his 
favorite French restaurants does not a bistro make. The chairs are nicked and 
scarred, the seats stained. In terms of decor, he's got to do a bit more if he 
wants to attract the overflow from Citrus into this unlovely space. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard is at the bar, chatting with friends one night. Catching sight of a 
couple entering the restaurant, the portly chef rushes out, arms spread wide. " 
Mon ami! " he booms, enveloping the man in a big bear hug. He then proceeds to 
lead the couple into Citrus proper. The two Industry people seated next to us 
are in a snit. Somehow (an oversight, no doubt), they couldn't get a table next 
door. Only as a favor to Michel, they point out to the waiter, did they decide 
to try the bistro. Well, they're not having any more of it. Stuck in the middle 
of the room, where anyone who walks in could mistake them for the B-list, they 
insist on crossing over to the promised land. They'll wait, they say. And they 
do. We, however, are still game -- if they would just turn down the raspy Joe 
Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Right away, I like the familiar French names on the short bistro menu: poulet 
ro ti , steak au frites , moules a la marinie re , escargots en feuillete . 
Specials like veal kidneys and monkfish with zucchini sound appealing. The 
prices, even more so. 
</P>
<P>
 When the food comes, any traces of disgruntlement vanish. This is real French 
cooking -- not the high-flying cuisine of restaurants with eyes on the Michelin 
stars or the intricate French-California dishes that Richard and chef de 
cuisine Alain Giraud put out at Citrus, but the kind of cooking that made many 
of us fall in love with French food in the first place: chicken-liver mousse, 
daube de veau , gratin of coquille St. Jacques. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm delighted to find that the special saucisson plate is rosette de Lyons (a 
French salami), served with a pile of olives and puckery cornichons. Something 
as soul-satisfying and simple as this or the jambon de bayonne -- rosy ham 
streaked with white fat -- is hard to find. Then there are plump leeks ing 
vinaigrette, gaily strewn with chopped parsley, egg white and tomatoes. And a 
great version of champignons a la grecque , the chilled, marinated mushrooms 
given a lift with a little fresh tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 You can have a cool, refreshing cucumber-laced tomato soup or a thick, 
comforting puree of cabbage garnished with chopped ham and buttery croutons. 
Instead of rustic pate, Richard offers a delicate, molded mousse de foie blonde 
. No complaints with the ballotine of Provencal vegetables, a mosaic of 
eggplant and tomato set in a vibrant aspic, or with piles the escargots , plump 
little nuggets in a jewel box of fragile puff pastry surrounded with a moat of 
emphatic green sauce. Order the roast chicken here, and you get an entire small 
bird, crisp and juicy, with an enormous pile of perfect fries. At $10, I doubt 
very much there's a better value in town.  
</P>
<P>
 A few dishes are eminently suited for a serious bottle of wine, especially the 
daube de veau aux carottes with tiny caramelized onions and big, tender chunks 
of veal in a remarkably deep-flavored sauce. Or the beef filet stroganoff or 
the veal kidneys with noodles in a  
</P>
<P>
 whole-grain mustard sauce. The tough, chewy lamb steak doesn't win points, but 
the butter-tender flageolets make up for it.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard, who began his cooking life as a pastry chef, focuses on 
straightforward bistro desserts here, notably a dark-glazed apple tart, a 
plain, absolutely delicious chocolate mousse and a bowl of strawberries 
marinated in Beaujolais.  
</P>
<P>
 If Richard gets inspired enough to cheer up the bistro's decor, people may be 
clamoring to get a table at this side of Citrus, too. And when they do, they 
may be just as seduced as I was by this honest French food. 
</P>

 Tupac Shakur not only stars in the movie "Above the Rim" -- about the famed 
annual inter-borough basketball tournament at Rucker's Playground in Harlem -- 
but also (under his rapper name 2Pac) is on the soundtrack album. The album -- 
also featuring new songs from Onyx, Bell Biv DeVoe, H-Town, 2nd II None and 
Aaron Hall, with production by Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, D.J. Quik and Jam 
Master Jay -- is due on March 22, right in the middle of March Madness, the 
NCAA basketball tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unreleased tracks recorded with the Clash and Bob Dylan are among the 
highlights of Rhino Records' four-CD box set of poet Allen Ginsberg.The 
collection also features some old poetry readings by Ginsberg set to new music 
assembled by producer Hal Willner. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The first release by the reunited General Public will be a version of the 
Staple Singers' old "I'll Take You There." The track is part of the soundtrack 
album from the upcoming low-budget film "Threesome." The soundtrack, produced 
by Ralph Sall (who did the "Addams Family Values" music) features KROQ-type 
bands all with the common theme of sex. Among the other selections are an 
obscure Duran Duran B-side version of obscure English rocker Steve Harley's 
"Make Me Smile," a new The The recording of its own "This Is the Day" (retitled 
"That Was the Day") and Bryan Ferry's "Is Your Love Strong Enough," making its 
first album appearance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Also for KROQ fans, '80s new wave will be the focus of Rhino's latest 
comprehensive multi-CD anthology, "Just Can't Get Enough," a 15-volume set 
coming in June. . . .

POP MUSIC CHARTS: THE POWER OF 'COLOUR' 
</P>

<TEXT>

 Celine Dion, often put in the same vocal league with Mariah Carey, has 
blossomed into such a commercial force that she's performing like Carey on the 
charts too -- topping both of The Times' Southern California pop charts. Dion's 
"The Colour of My Love" is the No. 1 album and her "The Power of Love" is the 
leading single. One of the surprise hits of the year -- receiving an early 
boost from KROQ exposure -- is Us3's "Cantaloop," which is not only No. 9 on 
the local chart but No. 7 nationally. When it first came out, few thought the 
jazz/rap single would get much major airplay. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,42,11 Title,

 Edward James Olmos (left) not only starred in, directed and co-produced this 
powerful 1992 film about the self-perpetuating cycle of gang life in East L.A., 
but he also just about willed it into existence.Olmos' relentless passion is 
the best thing about the film, a cautionary tale that offers a chilling look at 
the connections between Latino prison gangs and drug traffic in the barrio. The 
movie packs a considerable wallop, but, be warned, it has concentrated so hard 
on delivering its message that, inevitably, its value as a drama tends to fall 
by the wayside. With Pepe Serna (center) and William Forsythe. (TMC Monday at 
12:30 a.m.) Kenneth Turan

By Michael Wilmington

<TEXT>

 Maria Novaro's immensely charming and satirical 1991 Mexican film aims for the 
pure exhilaration of great movie musicals and romances. It's designed to seduce 
the audience, just as the danzon itself -- a Caribbean-Mexican ballroom step 
that mixes elegance, tradition and earthy spontaneity -- is a mock-seduction, a 
pantomime of male lust and female coquetry.Her heroine (Maria Roja) is a 40ish 
telephone operator whose routine has its only bright spots at a Mexico City 
dance hall, where for six years she has had a courtly, constant dance partner 
(Daniel Rergis) of whom she knows little -- and who disappears suddenly. In 
trying to find him Roja's Julia discovers herself instead. With Tito 
Vasconcelos (pictured) as dancer "Susy." (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Michael

 This irresistable little 1992 movie, beautifully directed by Robert 
Marcarelli, got lost in theatrical release but just might find new life on the 
tube. Jason Alexander (pictured) stars as a suburban Philadelphia store owner 
who always buys chocolate kisses at the end of the day before boarding a bus 
for home.He's a nice young Jewish man, some 30 pounds overweight, who still 
lives at home with his doting mother (Lainie Kazan) and bombastic grandfather 
(Lou Jacobi). One day he meets on the bus the woman (Nia Peeples, pictured) who 
could change his life. Jonnie Lindell's wonderfully warm script is a romantic 
comedy that shows how limiting our perceptions of each other and ourselves can 
be. -- (Cinemax Thursday at 2:30 p.m.) Kevin Thomas

 This 1993 fairy tale may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray 
and director Harold Ramis, but this gentle effort is easily the most endearing 
film of both men's careers thus far. Murray (pictured) stars as a Pittsburgh TV 
weatherman who is so self-involved that he's convinced he doesn't just report 
the weather, he creates it.He hates nothing more than having to journey to 
rural Punxsutawney once a year and participate the unsophisticated shenanigans 
centering on whether a groundhog does or does not see his shadow. First-time 
writer Danny Rubin, who co-wrote the script with Ramis, wonders what would 
happen if this guy discovered he would be forced to relive Groundhog Day, not 
just once a year, but day after day, ad infinitum. With Andie MacDowell as his 
pleasant foil, Murray turns the film into a funny little Valentine. (HBO 
Saturday at 9 p.m., next Sunday at 4:30 a.m.) Kenneth Turan

 What architect Tim Merrill found heroic about the movie version of "The 
Fountainhead" is the tip of the iceberg ("Hollywood's New Edifice Complex," 
Off-Centerpiece, Feb. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Author Ayn Rand's Howard Roark is more than a creative genius who builds for 
his own enjoyment.He challenges the roots of Judeo-Christianity and defines the 
ethics of self-interest. True, he gets to romance a stunning Patricia Neal 
along the way, and their affair is unforgettable. But in an age in which 
self-sacrifice and serving others are being touted as virtues by everyone from 
the President to Rush Limbaugh, a character who boldly articulates the "virtue 
of selfishness" is more meaningful than a cool architect in great clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rand's brilliant tribute to the rational individualist remains a 
philosophically radical portrayal of "man as he ought to be." Howard Roark 
inspires the best in each of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when will Hollywood shock the world and film Rand's other classic novel, 
"Atlas Shrugged"?

 I find it interesting that MTV should find itself in a quandary regarding the 
possible convictions of rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg and 2Pac, as reported in Pop 
Eye (Feb. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Since when are artists' works prone to scrutiny in light of their private 
lives? While I find the alleged actions of these two to be reprehensible, and 
their music not to my specific tastes, I wonder if their works are being 
condemned because they are black males in a realm of music deemed too 
threatening by many people (i.e., straight white elders of American society). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet how many of us question whether to give continued attention to Ernest 
Hemingway, Frank Sinatra, Ted Kennedy and the Pope, regardless of allegations 
of violence and mayhem.

 In the Calendar piece on Michael Madsen ("He's Bad, but Not to the Bone," by 
Kristine McKenna, Feb. 6), there is a glaring oversight in reference to his 
work in the new version of "The Getaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Although early in the story McKenna makes reference to the source material 
(the novel by Jim Thompson, as well as the original film, directed by Sam 
Peckinpah from a Walter Hill script), she blunders later in describing a bit of 
business in a scene. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna writes: "The most ingenious bit of shading Madsen brings to the part 
is that he cradles a kitten in his arms . . . a kitten . . . lounging about on 
the chest of the psychopathic Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has seen the original Peckinpah production knows well that the 
first Rudy, wonderfully played by Al Lettieri, did exactly what McKenna credits 
to Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us be ever vigilant not to slight the originators of creative material.

 Thank you for Dan Berger's article on wine pricing (Restaurant News, Feb. 6).I 
have long since given up paying $30 in a restaurant for a wine that I can drink 
at home for $8. At a restaurant I would rather buy a single glass of wine and 
nurse it through the whole meal than to be coerced into paying exorbitant 
markups. 
</P>
<P>
 I have noted the restaurants Berger identifies as adding an eminently fair 
charge of $8 to $10 a bottle. Please list more. I am looking forward, again, to 
having a bottle of wine with my restaurant meal.

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; ANNE RAMSAY MAKES DESPERATION APPEALING ON 'MAD ABOUT 
YOU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years ago, Anne Ramsay and four UCLA drama student friends got together 
to form the Continuum. The play they wrote and starred in at the Carpet Company 
Stage, called "Waiting," got the attention of critics and Hollywood agents 
alike. "Witing," said a Times reviewer, was "undoubtedly a show with a future." 
In fact, it ran five months at the Carpet Company Stage (now Playwrights' 
Arena). 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Ramsay didn't have to wait long to have the future tap her 
on the shoulder. These days, she's catching attention as Helen Hunt's 
down-on-her-luck sister Lisa in NBC's hit sitcom "Mad About You." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1987, "Waiting" brought her and Jane Sibbett (now in "Herman's Head), 
among others, more-than-passing glances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my agent from that play," Ramsay recalls. "A lot of industry people 
came to see us in that. People still remember me from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Filmgoers also remember her from the hit 1992 "A League of Their Own," which 
starred Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna in the story of the all-woman's 
baseball league formed during World War II to keep the home folks coming to the 
ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly it's Lisa she's recognized on the street for now, as the sitcom 
moves up in the ratings. "Lisa is one of those people who, if you tell her not 
to do something, she will do it just to spite you," Ramsay says of her unruly 
character. "She's sort of a mixture of a lot of people I know, but would never 
admit to. She has this careless disregard that I've seen sneak into my own 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean that Lisa is more like Ramsay than she would care to admit? 
"Yes," she answers without missing a beat. "There's no bones about it. I think 
I hate to admit it. I kind of speak my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things she's happy to speak out about is not wanting to see Lisa 
settle down. "I hope she doesn't find anyone," she says. "It's fun to have her 
always dating and looking." While Ramsey herself is single, she's certainly 
"not at the desperation level that Lisa's at." 
</P>
<P>
 With the security the series has given her, she's bought a home in West L.A. 
and is involved in fixing it up. "There's a lot to be done here," she says, 
"but I haven't had one regret about buying it." 
</P>
<P>
 She loves jogging in the neighborhood and doesn't worry about how she looks 
when she goes out. "If anyone recognizes me, they're usually very surprised," 
she says, laughing. "I'm a total slob. I don't put on makeup or brush my hair. 
And the only time I dress up is if I'm going to dinner or a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised, though, if she puts on a little lipstick and brushes her 
hair to attend the Continuum's latest effort, "Borderlines," opening April 8 at 
the 2nd Stage in Hollywood. She'll be in the audience, though, and not on 
stage, since two episodes have been added onto "Mad About You's" schedule this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting, it seems, is something she won't be doing too much of anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mad About You" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.

ON THE SET; 'PARADISE' FOUND; BOCHCO'S 'BYRDS' PLANTS DRAMA AND HUMOR IN A LUSH 
SETTING

 In the shadow of Diamond Head's volcanic crater, Hawaiian actor Ray Bumatai 
shakes his head as he mutters his lines: "The guy was a real S.O.B." 
</P>
<P>
 "Put more feeling into it," prods a producer. Bumatai obliges, so much so that 
he forgets to abbreviate the expletive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cut!" The camera crew bursts into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such language won't make it into the newest television series by Steven Bochco 
Productions, creator of "Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law" and "NYPD Blue." Nor 
will it feature the "buns and guns" that help distinguish those productions. 
The one-hour family drama "The Byrds of Paradise," premiering this week on ABC, 
showcases a softer, quieter side of the award-winning Bochco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very interested to find out if viewers will, in effect, put their money 
where their mouths are," Bochco muses later. 'We're all hearing so much about 
violence and sex and language in TV programming, and the fact that there's 
nothing for families to look at. Well, here it is. Here's one." 
</P>
<P>
 The new show stars Timothy Busfield, of "thirtysomething" fame, as Sam Byrd, a 
Yale University ethics professor who brings his three children to Hawaii to 
start a new life after his wife is murdered. The story draws on conflicts 
inherent in that upheaval: the move, the loss of a parent, growing up with Dad, 
fitting into a new environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about it is that it doesn't insult your intelligence," says 
Bochco, executive producer. "We have found a way to be complex without being 
boring, entertaining without being silly." Unlike earlier Hawaii-based series 
such as "Magnum, P.I." and "Hawaii Five-0," "The Byrds of Paradise" draws on 
Hawaii as more than a breathtaking backdrop. Executive producers Charles Eglee 
and Channing Gibson deftly weave Hawaii's rich culture into their scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, affectionately known as Chick & Chan, spent months getting to know a 
side of Hawaii few tourists see. They traveled the length of the islands, 
interviewing such diverse characters as an onion farmer on the tiny island of 
Molokai and the chief of police on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of just going around and getting on and off of buses and looking at 
waterfalls, we got to talk to people that are real people," says Eglee. "Once 
we got outside the membrane of tourist Hawaii, we found this incredibly 
fabulous culture in which we can bounce our characters." 
</P>
<P>
 The series is set in a rural Hawaiian town, where Sam Byrd has taken a job as 
the headmaster of a private school. The part seems tailor-made for Busfield, a 
real-life father of three who considers parenting "a major deal in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a piece I feel very natural in," says Busfield, founder of Fantasy 
Theatre, the official children's theatre of California. "I feel like it's a 
place where I can do my best work." 
</P>
<P>
 He is the anchor for the show and brings an infectious, goofy spirit to the 
set. "It's impossible to be in a bad mood around him," says Seth Green, who 
plays his older son. 
</P>
<P>
 Busfield moved his own family to Hawaii for the filming and has high hopes for 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are real-life problems that I think are universal," he explains during 
a break between scenes. "It's a real drama with a spin on it, a lot more humor. 
I think this has the potential to reach a total audience. It's been a while 
since there's been a 'Bonanza.' I'd like to see parents sitting with their 
kids, watching the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The show features a large ensemble cast, a Bochco trademark. Green, Jennifer 
Love Hewitt and Ryan Sean O'Donohue play the Byrd children. Elizabeth Lindsey 
is dean of students, and Arlo Guthrie appears in a recurring role. 
</P>
<P>
 Local actors Robert Kekaula and Lani Opunui-Ancheta, the Byrd's housekeepers, 
give the show a genuine Hawaiian voice -- and some only-in-Hawaii touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always coming up to me, saying, 'Wear this all day will you?' and 
sticking little leaves in my pocket," chuckles Busfield, referring to 
Opunui-Ancheta's efforts to bring the show luck, Hawaiian-style. "In New York, 
I wouldn't let anybody put something in my pocket. In New York, you don't even 
talk to people. In L.A., it's, 'Where is my BMW?' Here, you are what you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is filmed on Oahu, Hawaii's most developed island, so the cast and 
crew must trek to remote spots to get the exquisite scenery they need. The Byrd 
family home is set at Kualoa Ranch on the windward side of the island. Its 
front yard spills into the ocean; its back yard is the verdant, pastoral vista 
featured in the stampede scene from 'Jurassic Park.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My skin tone is better off in London or the Scottish clouds," the redheaded 
Busfield concedes, "but I love Hawaii. There isn't a person on the Earth who 
wouldn't love the air here, the trade winds. ... If you're in Michigan, it'll 
make you feel five degrees warmer just watching the show!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Byrds of Paradise" premieres Thursday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Q & A: DONALD JOHANSON; LINKING OUR PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, Robert Koehler is a frequent contributor to Calendar and TV 
Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 That Holy Grail of anthropology, the "Missing Link" between ape and human, is 
a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Missing Link was actually found in 1974. Its discoverer, anthropologist 
Donald C. Johanson, is the host and producer of an ambitious three-hour "Nova" 
documentary, "In Search of Human Origins," airing Monday through Wednesday on 
PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Great Rift Valley of central Africa -- where most of the oldest human 
remains are found -- to the caves of southern France and the outback of 
Australia, Johanson's account of how the earliest human-like creatures survived 
and developed becomes a scientific detective story taking the viewer back 3 
million years. Villard has just published Johanson and his co-producer-wife 
Lenora's "Ancestors: In Search of Human Origins" (co-written with Blake Edgar) 
on which the documentary was based. Johanson talks with writer Robert Koehler 
about the challenges of the evolutionary hunt, TV-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the first television series to show how scientists trace evolutionary 
development? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, no. Anthropologist Richard Leakey did a series on the subject about 
15 years ago. But we're relating the state of the art, so to speak, of current 
scientific knowledge. We also wanted the series to be an adventure for the 
viewer, as we uncover clues along the way and draw as complete a picture as 
possible of the world our ancestors lived in. Just as important was letting the 
viewer participate in the work of scientists, to see what it is they do. 
</P>
<P>
 You're very concerned with how "humanness" developed in our ancestors, but you 
also seem interested in the very human disputes among scientists profiled in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, when we announced the Missing Link we named "Lucy," there was a 
lot of controversy, most of which circulated around Leakey and me. He and 
others questioned the legitimacy of our discovery. There seems to be an 
initiation period, when we need to look at and study fossils and bones, and 
arrive at conclusions. We announced Lucy in 1978, but only five years ago was a 
consensus reached that, as I joke, placed Lucy on man's family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the new debate which the series addresses? 
</P>
<P>
 It surrounds the "Out of Africa" theory, which contends that homonids 
developed in Africa, then spread through Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 
Others dispute it. This is a very strong debate right now, and we chose two 
strong scientific voices to state their sides. There's Alan Thorne, who says 
that development occurred in many different places, such as Australia, due to 
the free exchange of genes across populations. And there's Chris Stringer, who 
supports the "Out of Africa" theory. In the program's third segment, we see the 
arguments raging at the London Royal Academy gathering. The sides are vocally 
opposed, and there's overt competition. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your aim with this project? 
</P>
<P>
 The best example is in the second segment, in which we try to show that our 
ancestors weren't simply half-finished humans, nor impoverished 
hunter-gatherers, nor killer man-apes out of the "2001" story line, but were 
very well-adapted to their environment and able to survive within their own 
abilities. We might like to think of ourselves as having emerged from noble 
hunters. But what is presented here is a very different view. There's very slim 
evidence that early humans were killer-hunters, and much more evidence that 
they were scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a discovery of old bones, though, offer clues to our human identity? 
</P>
<P>
 Leakey's and Alan Walker's astonishing find of Homo erectus showed us a 
creature with the pelvis size of Lucy, who is a much older species, but with a 
much larger brain size. Thus, the baby must be born immature with a small 
enough brain to fit through the mother's pelvis, and then grow after birth, 
requiring family care and a social structure of empathy and caring. It's so 
interesting that this anatomical find gives us insight into human behavior and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does our violent urge come from then? 
</P>
<P>
 We can only guess, but I allude to it at the very end when I say that our 
modern capacity for culture has outpaced our biological evolution. What I mean 
is that, biologically and genetically, we are so related to chimps and gorillas 
and Lucy. Yet there's been an enormous acceleration in culture and technology. 
I wonder if that imbalance isn't what accounts for bizarre behavior like 
genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Human Origins" airs in three parts, Monday-Wednesday, at 7 p.m. 
on KVCR and 8 p.m. on KCET; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. (Part 1) and Wednesday at 7:30

RETRO; POST-MOD TIMES; CLARENCE WILLIAMS III CO-STARS IN FEATURE AND HBO FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIME STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before he became famous as hippie cop Link Hayes on the 1968-73 ABC series 
"The Mod Squad," Clarence Williams III was a well-respected stage actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought me out (from New York) to do 'Mod Squad,' " recalls Williams, 
who starred in the trend-setting show with Peggy Lipton, Michael Cole and Tige 
Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did so much enjoy doing it. I enjoyed working with Tige, Peg and Michael 
Cole," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Mod Squad" left the airwaves, Williams says, he was invited by a 
regional theater in Massachusetts to re-create a role he had originated on 
Broadway before the series. The play was "Slow Dance on the Killing Ground," 
and Williams had been nominated for a Tony for his part. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reviewers in Boston said how wonderful my work had grown since 
'Mod Squad,' " Williams says with a chuckle. "Obviously, the writer didn't 
realize I had created the part on Broadway before I did 'Mod Squad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was an artist-in-residence at Brandeis University, didn't 
realize the impact a TV series had on viewers until his first hiatus on "Mod 
Squad." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the staggering things is that if you work in TV, and particularly in a 
series, that first season you're at the studio all day long, working 14 and 15 
hours a day. But when you hit the hiatus period and you go off to wherever you 
decide to go for relaxation, all of a sudden everybody knows you." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Williams has never done another series, he's kept busy in TV, films and 
theater, most notably starring in 1980 with Maggie Smith on Broadway in Tom 
Stoppard's "Night and Day" and playing Prince's dad in 1984's "Purple Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Williams co-stars with Wesley Snipes in the movie "Sugar Hill," and 
is featured in the upcoming HBO film "Against the Wall," which dramatizes the 
1971 inmate rebellion at New York's Attica Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Sugar Hill," Williams plays the drug-addicted father of Snipes and Michael 
Wright. The actor was drawn to the role because he thought it was a brilliant 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to have the opportunity to play it," Williams explains. The film, he 
adds, "also was about a family's struggle. There's no glamour, no Armani suits 
and everybody walking around being beautiful. (Drugs are) a road to hell and 
destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 The family's destruction, Williams says, also is a metaphor for the 
destruction of Harlem, where the film is set. "I don't know if you have been to 
New York or Harlem, but certain areas of it look like Dresden after the 
bombings. This destruction has happened to Sugar Hill, this place in Harlem 
where successful African Americans lived (during the '50s). There was a 
tremendous creative renaissance there." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Against The Wall," which is directed by John Frankenheimer, Williams gives 
a chilling performance as Chaka, a sociopathic ringleader of the riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams doesn't know if Chaka was an actual person. The film, he says, is 
based on the real experiences of a young prison guard, Michael Smith (Kyle 
MacLachlan), who survived the uprising. Twenty-nine inmates and 10 guards were 
killed after government forces stormed the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I followed my work through the prism of his eyes," Williams says. "I assume 
Chaka is an amalgam of people. There were 12,000 inmates at Attica at that 
time. Obviously, we didn't travel through all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar Hill" is currently playing in movie theaters; "Against the Wall" 
premieres March 26 at 8 p.m. on HBO.

 Darn darn darn.

<P>
 When you hunker down to watch two interminably tacky hours featuring the 
American equivalent of the dysfunctional British Royal Family, you pray for a 
payoff. A gate-crashing sibling would have been a beautiful thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the scissor-happy producers of last week's "The Jackson Family 
Honors" would have let us see it anyhow. They denied us the evening's only 
deliciously nasty moment -- Elizabeth Taylor drawing catcalls after mentioning 
that Michael would not perform. "Don't boo," she snipped. "That's an ugly 
sound." (We only know this from published accounts by reporters who attended 
the taping of the show at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas.) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what did she expect? It was Taylor, after all, who ignored the fact that 
she was being honored for her humanitarian pursuits, turning her acceptance 
speech into a treacly love testimonial about Michael: "Your recent torture is 
not going to change your compassion toward children," she gushed, only whetting 
the crowd's appetite more. 
</P>
<P>
 And furthermore, she declared in defense of her friend, "Enough of tabloid 
media! Enough of tabloid television. Only you can put them out of business and 
wouldn't that be great!" 
</P>
<P>
 You were tempted to yell at your television set: "Enough yourself, Liz! Enough 
manipulation of an audience who wants only to see a beloved performer sing and 
strut. Enough pretending that accusations of child sex abuse and 
multimillion-dollar payoffs aren't big news." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, where is LaToya when you need her? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am not kidding when I compare the Jacksons to the Windsors. The parallels 
are striking: 
</P>
<P>
 The Windsors have two queens of England (Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother). 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksons have one King of Pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Topless photos of the outcast Duchess of York appeared in newspapers in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nude photos of the outcast LaToya appeared in Playboy in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 During an address to her decreasingly loyal subjects, the Queen of England 
pronounced 1992 her " annus horribilus ."  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a news conference preceding "The Jackson Family Honors," the 
King Mother, Katherine Jackson, was asked if her family has lived the American 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an American nightmare in the last six months," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Jackson-related questions that occur to me: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the title, "Jackson Family Honors," is Honors a verb or a noun? 
</P>
<P>
 * How could a family that has produced dancers the caliber of Michael and 
Janet end up on the same stage as the Michael Peters Dancers, who, frankly, 
were a worst-case Las Vegas scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did LaToya actually think she could sneak in to the MGM Grand Hotel 
unnoticed, especially if she donned what her husband called her "Arabic woman" 
disguise, veil and all? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it just me, or was anyone else grossed out by Taylor's description of 
Michael as "bruised but magically untouched by the tongues and opinions of the 
world"? 
</P>
<P>
 * If you stood the extremely underanimated Joe Jackson next a wax statue of 
himself, could anyone tell them apart? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is it really fair to call the Jacksons dysfunctional, when -- except for 
gobs of money, accusations of child sex abuse against one son, weird feuds and 
extensive cosmetic surgery -- they are really just like you and me? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I give credit to the Jacksons for pulling off something at which 
most American families would be utter failures: getting the entire brood (with 
one disappointing exception) under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way my family could replicate such a feat would be if the room were 
as big as an airplane hangar -- or maybe a concert venue -- and they were 
paying us millions of dollars to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 And the, on top of that, if we all had lawyers, agents and managers -- well, 
you can just forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 My heart really went out to Gary Smith, the man who produced "The Jackson 
Family Honors." He told a reporter for NBC's "Dateline" that "probably one of 
the most challenging parts of the show" was the negotiating that went on with 
representatives for Michael and Janet. 
</P>
<P>
 What those representatives wanted, he wasn't saying. 
</P>
<P>
 I noticed however, that Janet, who performed a song near the beginning of the 
program, had disappeared by the end, failing to join her siblings and their 
families on stage in the big, silly finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough!" she probably said. "Enough of this ridiculous, overscripted attempt 
to look like a normal, loving family when all the world knows we can barely 
stand each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, I bet, LaToya was smiling.

GALLERY: COSTUME DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ROY GRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An opera performance is a harmonious blending of music and stagecraft. And for 
the cast and crew, it's a lot of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Los Angeles Opera production of "Madama Butterfly," which opened 
Wednesday at the Music Center, the chorus must show up 90 minutes before 
curtain just to get dressed. In this case that means donning bedecked wigs, 
mounds of makeup and elaborate costumes for Giacomo Puccini's love story of a 
Japanese geisha whose marriage to a callous American naval lieutenant ends in 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the principals are given rehearsal kimonos, the chorus had relatively 
little time in their costumes, says Rick Geyer, wig master for Los Angeles 
Opera. They had only three dress rehearsals to learn how to negotiate stairs, 
ramps and a steeply raked stage. "But the chorus is generally adaptable and 
they find a way to work in whatever they're given," Geyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-person staff applies makeup and attaches wigs for the chorus. "Wig- and 
makeup-wise, 'Butterfly' is one of the more expensive shows to do because 
you're changing the ethnicity of the entire chorus," Geyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madama Butterfly," the fifth production of the 1993-94 season, will be 
presented Monday, Wednesday, Saturday and March 8. Two operas remain: "Le Nozze 
di Figaro" (in April) and "Der Rosenkavalier" (in May and June). Prices range 
from $20 to $105. Information: (213) 365-3500. ROBIN ROY GRESS

UP ALL NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: SHOP AROUND THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By 1:30 a.m. the number of customers at the only 24-hour Good Guys store has 
dropped off dramatically. There's a ledge of time only hard-core retail 
vampires choose to leap. One moment there are dozens of shoppers, the next only 
six or seven wandering past the "toys and distractions," as one salesman calls 
the TVs, cameras, phones, computers, boomboxes and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 1 a.m. is a nebulous time," says James Johnston, who walked to the 
store in the Beverly Connection mall on La Cienega Boulevard at 2 a.m. He came 
just to browse. Though he comes here often, he's never purchased more than 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 He stops to play "Acqueous Major," a CD video shoot-fly-crash game on the 
Panasonic 3DO machine. Ted Kim, one of the salesmen, coaches him on technique. 
There are maybe five customers in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about shopping late at night," says Johnston. "It's 
exclusive. You have the inside track. It's like being in a place after closing 
and having the run of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Johnston's electronic fighter aircraft twists and turns, Kim, 24, offers 
occasional advice. There is no sales pressure. The store has become an 
all-night video game clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 This easy-going relationship between browsing customer and un-harried 
salesperson happens again and again. It's a distinctly L.A. late-night scene, 
quiet and mellow. It stands in contrast to New York's intense and jittery 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff working the four-day-a-week 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. shift is also very 
L.A. in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Night manager Enamul Apu is a Muslim from Bangladesh. This summer he's going 
back home for a traditional arranged marriage. David Davis was once a tour 
manager with Smokey Robinson. Michael Pittman is a music composer; Stephen 
Ingle, a stand-up comedian. Shone Harris is a runway model. And actor John 
Belche has the recurring part of Al the bartender on "Days of Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the customers, it can be safely said that anyone who shops for a 
computer printer at 2:30 a.m. is a night owl. There are police officers, 
club-goers, homeless people, swing-shift workers, movie industry types, the 
occasional celebrity (the night staff says Ringo Starr, Dwight Yoakam and David 
Bowie have all been in), insomniacs, housewives who apologize for shopping so 
late ("I don't usually do things like this") and guys who bring dates and get 
teased by the staff about being cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Mikal Gilmore, self-described as "quite nocturnal," is shopping for 
stereo speakers in the wee hours. He tells of once watching a man keep a taxi 
waiting while he bought a speaker wire at 3 a.m. The customer was "blissed out, 
laughing at the TVs and basically scaring the hell out of people," says 
Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff tells of a Japanese tour bus full of shoppers pulling up at 5 a.m. 
They remember "the dog lady" who for months used the store's bathroom with her 
poodle every night at 3. And Apu is surely the only Bangladeshi to sell a 
cordless telephone to a Playboy Playmate of the Year by the dawn's early light. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingle, who at 2:45 a.m. is tidying the shelves, divides the customers into two 
groups. "They're either fully focused on what they're doing," he says. "Or 
they're killing time." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fully focused, this is a perfect time to shop. Never in a consumer's 
dreams could they get so much attention. There are moments at 3 a.m. when the 
salesmen are like fervid missionaries preaching to a congregation of one. Here 
the sermons are on TV picture tubes or the THX Surround Sound system. "In the 
day it can be like an assembly line," says Pittman. "At night, it's a 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "Break the ice and build rapport," Kim says, mantra-like. Talk to the 
browsers. Be friendly. "It's not like in the daytime," Kim says. "They remember 
you. They come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The salesmen seem almost grateful for the distraction from the tedium. "This 
late at night," says Ingle, "it's not fast-food electronics." 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30, three of the sales staff leave for lunch. Only night-shift workers 
could rattle off a complete list of nearby 24-hour dining options. Their 
favorite is the Beverly Hills Cafe; plus there's Ships, Norm's, the 
International House of Pancakes, Larry Parker's, Fatburger, Ben Frank's, 
Canter's and, the choice for this night, the recently opened Jerry's Famous 
Deli, a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 When the salesmen return after 4, the store is in the doldrums. Though never 
without at least one customer, at this hour the store rarely gets above single 
digits. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now that the salesmen change prices, discount returned items and amuse 
themselves by hooking the Panasonic 3DO ($700) to the Mitsubishi 120-inch TV 
($15,000) and playing a "Total Eclipse" video game ($50). 
</P>
<P>
 "It rocks," says Ingle of playing on the wall-size TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It more than rocks," says Kim. "It rules." 
</P>
<P>
 It's 5:30 a.m. There is one customer in the store, Jeff Catarino, a designer 
who's wearing a yellow Walkman as he looks for a two-line phone and a stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 Catarino has bought lots of electronic equipment here and the staff recognizes 
him. He walks through the store completely absorbed in the music on his 
Walkman, and the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 He removes the Walkman earplugs only once, when he's asked what would lead a 
person to price phones at this hour of the morning. With a slightly incredulous 
look, he takes the headphone out of one ear and says, "It's just a great time 
to go shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Elton John/RuPaul video plays on 150 TV screens behind him and dawn 
breaks over La Cienega Boulevard, he goes back to fiddling with the knobs on an 
Aiwa stereo.

THE BUZZ: LA WEEKLY GETS NEW HAUNT -- AND GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesday the LA Weekly makes its long-awaited move into the refurbished 
building on Sunset Boulevard that for years housed the Hollywood Reporter. 
There's a chance the Weekly staff might not be the sole tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 An enduring legend has it that the ghost of the Reporter's founder, Billy 
Wilkerson, inhabits his second-floor office area. Some say he sings during 
earthquakes. Others attribute to him a knocking sound that comes from beneath 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 One construction worker is said to have seen the ghost, although the 
remodeling project's general contractor, Steve Ondre, said: "He had ghosts on 
the brain. Every job he goes to he sees ghosts." Ondre said he's been at the 
building for more than a year "and I've yet to hear any rattling chains."

 United They Stand: In what might become a '90s version of the GI Joe doll, 
England's Padgett Brothers toy company is selling a line of United Nations 
Peacekeeping Force soldiers. Although the concept might be well-intentioned, 
the blue plastic figures don't look particularly peaceful. One figure is aiming 
a carbine, another is tossing a grenade and two others are holding rifles with 
bayonets. The figures do, however, come with a white "U.N. rescue tent." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Divided You Fall: It was the cover line on the new issue of America's Civil 
War that first caught our eye. The fact that a serious magazine devoted to the 
War Between the States would have a story on a "cross-dressing Confederate spy" 
seemed interesting. This alone could be the basis for a 19th Century-themed 
Geraldo episode. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was one of the ads in the mag's back that we found most striking. Among 
the pitches for history books, cavalry boot reproductions and 1862 recruiting 
posters was a 38-item reproduction of a Civil War surgeon's amputating kit. 
</P>
<P>
 For $875, an enthusiast will receive 24 instruments, 11 surgical needles, 
silver wire and silk suture thread, plus two types of tourniquets. Although all 
the instruments are made from surgical steel, there is what might be one of the 
ultimate kids-don't-try-this-at-home warnings about not using them for medical 
purposes. BILL HIGGINS

SUGAR EXPERIMENT IS SOMETHING TO CHEW ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, View ran an article stating that sugar is no longer considered by 
the medical community to be responsible for hyperactive behavior in children 
("Sweet Nothings?" Feb. 9). I must beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, I did the sound for "Romper Room" here in L.A. We taped from 
five to 10 shows a day. During the breaks between shows, a gaggle of 
kindergartners would line up at the candy machine and gorge their little bodies 
with the basest of junk foods. By late afternoon these kids would be bouncing 
around the stage, had shorter-than-normal attention spans, and were often out 
of control.  
</P>
<P>
 So one day the producers tried an experiment. On taping day, we put "out of 
order" signs on the candy machines. The difference was unimaginable. The kids 
stayed quiet and well behaved and the decibel level was reduced significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's suppose it wasn't the chemical reaction to sugar that made these 
kids crazy, but the sheer joy from having ingested the sugar. And let's suppose 
that being denied that sugar made these same kids sad and listless. Whatever 
the reason kids go off the wall after eating sugar, be it chemical or 
psychological, it is clear to me after 11 years of experimentation that 
everyone, old and young, is better off without processed sugar.

A FINE EXAMPLE OF FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo to "A Family United" (Feb. 9). Thank you for taking the time to show us 
what family values really mean: sticking by and supporting all the members of 
your family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Henigans deserve a standing ovation. Not just for their unconditional 
love, support and acceptance of their gay son, Patrick, but for taking an 
active, open role in making their community safer and supportive for other gay 
and lesbian teens. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the students who protested the inclusion of the Fountain Valley 
High School Student Alliance: Your school won't have a reputation as being a 
"gay school." Instead it will be a school known for its progressive tolerance 
and inclusion of support for all students.

WHAT IF THERE WERE NO MOTHERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In class at Barnard College five years ago, my daughter was defending an 
unpopular cause -- motherhood.So unworthy are we mothers, it seemed, that her 
professor sneered his ultimate insult: She probably wanted to grow up to be 
"just like her mother." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Trials of Lawyer Moms" (Feb. 21) was an intelligent article on a group of 
Washington lawyer-mothers who described some of the trials of juggling two 
full-time careers. Yet even this sympathetic piece said that joining the group 
"eased the stigma of going from legal eagle to mommy hen." 
</P>
<P>
 I am so tired of hearing mothers referred to as second-class citizens. Has 
anyone made it into this world without one?

MASS TRANSIT STORY IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Rules of the Road" (Jan. 31): I was pleased to read the article with 
tips on riding the bus. Having ridden with Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority for 10 years, I would like to add the following: 
</P>
<P>
 1.If you are next to someone who is having an animated conversation with 
himself, this is OK. It is only when they stop having that conversation and 
start talking to you that the problems begin. So, just ignore it and enjoy the 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 2. If the bus or train is packed and it is obvious you have no choice but to 
step on a few toes, always excuse yourself. The one time that you don't might 
be the time you wish that you had. 
</P>
<P>
 3. For those times you are about to die from someone's body odor, do what I 
do. I keep a sample vial of cologne in my purse and take a whiff every time I'm 
near the point of passing out. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Please don't stand in the front, blocking the way for oncoming passengers. 
The people in the back are also from planet Earth and do not bite. You might 
even find a seat back there. 
</P>
<P>
 5. And finally, you veterans, help those who are MTA challenged. Don't leave 
them standing at the back exit staring at the "PUSH HANDLE TO OPEN DOOR" sign, 
waiting for the doors to open by themselves. Push it for them or tell them.  
</P>
<P>
 So, now that we're all informed, let's go out and play nice on the MTA.

in Venice, Robin Rose and her husband, Roy, use the stuff to attract students 
to their traffic school for chocoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, started several years ago, serves up trays of chocolates and ice 
cream as it guides traffic offenders through the subtleties of the California 
Vehicle Code. The sweets have been "no small contributing factor" to the 
business's success, Robin says, though there were some problems early on -- 
when there was an all-you-can-eat ice cream policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That literally took the profit out of the traffic school business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, there's a limit of one scoop per student, and all's well again. 
Except, that is, when students think a chocolate-covered curriculum means they 
can take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robin Rose: "Woe to he who plans on reading his legal briefs during 
class." 
</P>

 SO SUE ME: At least one prosecutor is not happy with her job in the district 
attorney's Santa Monica office. And she's not afraid to say so, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Monika Blodgett, who was the supervising deputy in the 
Torrance office, is now a lower-profile trial prosecutor in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Blodgett met with reporters from The Times and another newspaper and 
said she was being demoted and transferred to the non-supervisory job in Santa 
Monica because she had complained about some of her Torrance predecessors 
"giving away the courthouse" with lenient plea bargains in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Her predecessor in the top slot in Torrance was none other than her boss, 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, whose 1992 campaign included promises he would halt 
overly generous plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Blodgett, who retains a noticeable accent from her native Germany, also said 
she was being harassed because of her heritage, often being referred to by 
other D.A. office personnel as a "Nazi." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she got home on the evening of her media interviews, Blodgett said 
later, there was a message on her answering machine ordering her to report 
Downtown the next day. Apparently the D.A.'s office had been alerted to her 
remarks when reporters called the office for comment. The next morning Blodgett 
was suspended for one day and, she said, forbidden to return to the Torrance 
office. The grounds for the disciplinary action, she said, included 
"insubordination" and failing to report contacts with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous," Blodgett said last week. "Even D.A.s have First 
Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has declined to comment, calling the 
disciplinary action a "personnel matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * ROMANIA MANIA: Is there something going on here? Last week we introduced you 
to Latchezar Christov, the consul general of the recently opened Bulgarian 
Consulate in Santa Monica, who is making big plans to foster business between 
the United States and his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes word that another group of Eastern Europeans, Romanians this time, 
want a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight a group of Romanian movie executives and a diplomat from the embassy 
in Washington will join Romanian immigrant George Lascu, 43, at his L.A. Farm 
restaurant on Olympic Boulevard for a gala to kick off the California/Romania 
Trade Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie executives, from Bucharest Studios, are in town for this weekend's 
American Film Market in Santa Monica. Lascu saw it as the perfect time to 
launch the council, which hopes to facilitate business between Californians and 
Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's bash will include a mishmash of California businesses representatives 
in the computer, financial services, furniture and agricultural sectors, to 
name a few. Mihai B. Sion, a trade counselor at the Romanian Embassy in 
Washington, plans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should all get along fine -- Romanians like a good time," said Bernard 
Stroppa, a colleague of Lascu. "The Romanians actually prefer the American 
freewheeling style. They're all very 'hail-fellow, well-met' types."

APPROVAL TO REBUILD CONTAINS CONDITIONS; MALIBU: CITY PLAN WOULD EXPEDITE THE 
PERMIT PROCESS FOR FIRE VICTIMS WHO ASSUME THE LEGAL RISK OF LIVING IN 
LANDSLIDE AREAS. THOSE WHO REFUSE TO SIGN WAIVERS WOULD HAVE TO CONDUCT 
GEOLOGICAL TESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Malibu is offering fire victims in landslide areas a speedier, less costly way 
to get reconstruction permits -- as long as they assume the legal risk of 
living on unstable land. 
</P>
<P>
 If these residents sign liability waivers, the city will allow them to rebuild 
without having to meet a longstanding requirement that they first conduct 
geological studies of their property. 
</P>
<P>
 The waivers, which would indemnify the city against liability for property 
damage or injuries stemming from landslides, are proving controversial. At a 
meeting Wednesday, where city officials discussed the issue with about 300 
residents, some homeowners said they felt the city was making it hard for them 
to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel betrayed," said Jody Stump, whose Rambla Vista home was burned to the 
ground. "We aren't seeking a build permit, we are seeking a rebuild permit. I 
want my house back and this is onerous. I had a perfectly good house . . . and 
to me, (the lot) is no different now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ron Goldman, a member of a fire victims group advising the city on 
reconstruction efforts: "All of this has a chilling effect on our ability to 
get loans, on our resale value and on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Carmany said the City Council will review the issue at its 
March 28 meeting. Residents are expected to press for changes, mindful that two 
council seats are up for election in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the rebuilding in Malibu is the geologic status of much of the 
property burned in the Nov. 2 wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Using state and federal landslide maps, city engineers and a geologist have 
determined that about 85% of the 280 residents whose homes burned down in east 
Malibu were sitting on potentially active landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the city from litigation arising from future slides on such 
property, city attorneys advised the council to approve the waiver policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who do not sign a waiver must conduct geological surveys that show 
the land is stable before they can get a permit. Such surveys are required in 
the building code the city adopted from the county when it incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys, which involve geologic drilling, could cost a homeowner $5,000 to 
$50,000, according to residents who have received estimates for the work. Once 
the survey is complete, the city reviews it and also studies historic geologic 
information before reaching a final decision on the permit application. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of property that is found to be stable would receive a permit to 
rebuild and would not be required to sign a liability waiver. Those who own 
land deemed unsafe would have to take steps to stabilize the land -- shoring up 
a hillside, for instance -- before they could receive a permit to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents at Wednesday's meeting said they were being discriminated 
against because, unlike other fire victims, they must spend time and money to 
satisfy the city's geological approval requirements. Others attacked the city 
for being vague about what was considered geologically hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said he worried that residents who sign the waiver could become liable 
for a wide range of lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to sign a waiver . . . and someone downstream from you says they 
want to sue the city," said Goldman, "the city will get a notice and they're 
going to ask you what lawyer you're going to hire."

COLLEGE CLEARED OF BIAS IN FIRING DISABLED MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Gilman's odd behavior may be attributable to a medical condition known as 
Tourette's syndrome, but a Superior Court judge found last week that officials 
of Santa Monica College were within their rights when they fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Judge Irving Shimer put an end to Gilman's effort to get back 
his job as a part-time video aide and recover three years of lost pay. He had 
argued that the college violated his civil rights and its own rules against 
discrimination on grounds of disability. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilman, a ruddy-faced 43-year-old who constantly jiggles the left side of 
his body and frequently sniffs and snorts, said he had no problem with the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy to have gotten it as far as it went," he said. "Whether you 
finally win or lose to me is not as important as doing the work I did, which 
helped me regain my self-esteem and my self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to pursue his case through the state workers' compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moore, president of the college, released a statement saying only, 
"We're pleased we have a decision by the court." 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Tuesday, Shimer found no grounds to overrule college authorities, 
said Gilman's attorney, Karen Hartmann of the California School Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tourette's aspect . . . was acknowledged, but there was a lack of direct 
evidence to prove this played a role," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing was based on charges of "discourteous, offensive or abusive 
conduct," "incompetency" and "repeated or unexcused tardiness or absence," 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after French neurologist George Gilles de la Tourette, who first 
described it in 1825, the syndrome is characterized by repeated involuntary, 
rapid movements known as tics, which may include blinking, head-jerking, 
shrugging and facial grimacing, throat clearing, sniffing, tongue-clicking and 
yelping and other noises.  
</P>
<P>
 Some patients also utter obscenities or repeat sounds they just heard, but 
Gilman's is a relatively mild case. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a college degree and worked as a substitute teacher before taking 
the Santa Monica College job, which he held for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now getting by on Social Security disability payments, Gilman, who is blind in 
one eye, said he hopes to get back into radio, a field he worked in before 
coming to Southern California from New York in the mid-1980s.

REROUTING THE NOISE; CONSTRUCTION: RESIDENTS NEAR THE FREEWAY REPAIR SITE GET 
RELIEF FROM THE RACKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After residents complained that the noise of late-night pile-driving was, 
well, driving them crazy, workers repairing the collpased Santa Monica Freeway 
recently installed large double-layer curtains around the construction site 
near La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-foot-high, 450-foot long panels are made of acoustical insulation 
wrapped in polyvinyl tarp and stretched over a steel frame. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair racket was unbearable for some. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nerve-racking at first . . . kind of like a really loud jackhammer," 
said Shavonda Calhoun, a bank worker who lives in one of several apartment 
houses on nearby David Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor Kimberly Fairbanks described it as a "clank-clank-clank" sound. 
"When you're sleeping, (it) starts getting kind of loud and it wakes you up, 
and then it's hard to go back to sleep," Fairbanks said. "Actually, this week 
hasn't been as loud." 
</P>
<P>
 After the panels were installed, sound meters showed a drop in noise from an 
average of 84 decibels to levels ranging from 70 to 74 decibels, said Peter J. 
Shutt, general manager of Bravo Environmental Sound Control Inc., the 
Bakersfield company that installed the buffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of approximately $100,000 for installation and rental of the panels 
will be paid by the contracting firm C.C. Myers Inc., which began 
reconstruction of the quake-damaged La Cienega-Venice and Fairfax-Washington 
freeway crossings on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to installing the sound wall, the Myers firm has agreed to refrain 
from pile-driving, its noisiest activity, between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., said 
Caltrans spokeswoman Patricia Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, she said, pile-driving will continue for only another week or so, 
but other construction work will continue 24 hours a day until the job is 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Although completion of the $14.9-million project is scheduled for July, 
incentives for early completion may bring an early end to the discomfort of 
noise-rattled residents, some of whom live up to half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Eula B. Walker, a David Avenue resident, has her own solution. "When it gets 
too noisy, I put my earplugs in," she said. "I'm learning to deal with it."

ARTS; EXHIBIT PUTS A FACE ON THE PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What makes it really crazy," said Joe Diaz, "is that there are eight gangs in 
a 2 1/2-block area." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz is talking about the Pico-Aliso Housing Projects in Boyle Heights, a 
couple miles east of Downtown, where he has lived all of his 21 years. Although 
he admits that the area has its problems -- gang shootings are not unusual -- 
he still believes the neighborhood is unfairly portrayed by the media as just 
another crime-ridden barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are together, not separate," he said. "Everybody here shares 
everything. But just the word projects is enough to scare some people away." 
</P>
<P>
 So Diaz and five other Latino youths set out last year to engage in some 
image-enhancing. The result is "We Live Here! (Nosotros Vivimos Aqui!)," a 
mixed-media exhibit that's traveled around town and will be on display starting 
Tuesday at the Midnight Special Bookstore and Cultural Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 With funding from several community groups and the backing of Dolores Mission 
Church, the exhibit of photographs, videos and text of interviews with 
neighborhood residents depicts everyday life in the projects -- the joy, the 
heartache, the tragedy and the tedium. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentary filmmaker Pamela Cohen and several community activists conceived 
of the idea as a way to provide an insider's view of life in the community. The 
project, which took eight months to complete, was organized by the church's 
Proyecto Pastoral group and funded by the Liberty Hill Foundation and the Los 
Angeles Arts Recovery Fund. Several businesses also donated services such as 
film processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the artists are deeply affected by gang life, they are not gang 
members themselves. Cohen said the artists were chosen on the basis of their 
commitment to the community, rather than any special experience or skill. The 
youths did receive some camera and interview training but chose what to shoot 
and who to interview on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the project is the 50 or so wide-ranging, black-and-white 
photographs that the youths, who refer to themselves as "community artists," 
took of friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to show reality," said 19-year-old Erica Parra, one of the 
artists (the other participants are Grace Campos, Becky Garcia, Larry Nguyen 
and Johnny Saldana). "We're not trying to say all things are good. We know 
there are some bad things." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Diaz's pictures, for instance, shows three gang members mourning over 
the open casket of a comrade slain in a drive-by shooting last year. Parra said 
the death led to a truce among Pico-Aliso gangs that was only recently broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other photos are artful depictions of everyday events: children 
racing excitedly to an ice cream truck, women hanging their laundry to dry, a 
father feeding his infant daughter. Diaz hit upon the idea of snapping his dog 
in a junked car; he sold the picture to a councilman from a neighboring city 
for $50. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots of pictures of kids holding babies, laughing, smiling, playing 
Little League," said Father Greg Boyle, former pastor of Dolores Mission and 
now director of Jobs for a Future, a local community group. "The prevailing 
culture says that (gang) kids are less than human and we should lock them up 
and throw away the key. But these (artists) know why the gang kids ended up the 
way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a professional news photographer offered a few hints along the way, 
the artists faced more than a few technical problems. Diaz and Parra said they 
often needed to shoot dozens of frames to find the right shot and took their 
first photos at the wrong exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other obstacles too. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wanted to make a "memory wall" containing the nicknames of 27 gang 
members killed in the neighborhood in the past six years. They asked a graffiti 
artist to spray-paint the names on a large wooden board, using the spiky 
lettering found on area walls and storefronts. The artist at first balked at 
painting the names of dead rivals but eventually was talked into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll have to add another name," Diaz said as he glanced at the memory 
wall, referring to the most recent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has already changed the young artists' lives. Diaz says he would like 
to publish a book of photos with his commentary. Parra credits the project with 
keeping her out of gangs during a vulnerable time in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both say they the most important goal of the project is to give others a 
realistic picture of life in Pico-Aliso. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this every day," Diaz said. "When people go home from watching our 
video and looking at our pictures, we go back to living it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We Live Here!" will be at the Midnight Special Bookstore and Cultural Center, 
1318 3rd St., Santa Monica, through March. Information: (213) 461-7305.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-WILSHIRE; WOULD-BE TAGGERS PUT AMBITIONS TO WORK AT DESIGN 
STUDIO

<P>
 At Bresee Youth Design, kids try to make their mark in the business world 
instead of on walls, signs or buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Established last month as a project of the Bresee Youth Center, the new 
desktop publishing service allows youths to channel their creative talents into 
a range of design, layout and paste-up, typesetting and printing services for 
flyers, brochures, business cards, posters, resumes, stationery and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer concept-to-completion service," said Jeff Carr, the youth center's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of the young employees were chronic taggers, they serve as role 
models for other youths who might consider trading their spray cans for a 
keyboard, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Perez, the 15-year-old student team leader, said the computer business is 
a positive way to get attention: "This will probably change some people around. 
(Graphic design) is like tagging -- but you get paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 10 youths who launched the operation, Bresee Youth Design is 
strictly business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the research and checked out the prices around town and we think we'll 
be competitive," Carr said. "Our motto is 'Good kids, good service, good 
prices.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The design team has state-of-the-art equipment thanks to a grant from the 
Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. The youth center also has a fully equipped 
computer lab funded by grants from the Whitecap Foundation and the city of Los 
Angeles. Graphic designers from Walt Disney Imagineering volunteer their time 
to offer students tips on computer techniques and, at the end of the training 
course, a tour of the Disney facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids who can develop these skills will be marketable for all kinds of jobs," 
Carr said. Jobs that require computer skills "are the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 After producing a slick promotional brochure to advertise its services, the 
Bresee Youth Design team has moved on to its first orders: six in-house 
projects for the P. F. Bresee Foundation, the First Church of the Nazarene, 
which houses the youth center, and its school. 
</P>
<P>
 The next marketing phases include spreading the word among neighborhood 
churches and organizations that work with the Bresee Foundation, and then 
training a sales team to call on local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees earn $6 an hour and charge an hourly rate for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth center at 3401 3rd St. offers academic assistance and other 
activities. Youths who drop in -- about 400 did last year -- can take computer 
classes. The current design team members are regulars at the lab; future 
employees will be selected from the training classes.

 Perez, a sophomore at Belmont High School and a muralist, said he hopes his 
training will help him find a good job after he graduates. But he won't forget 
his early influences. 
</P>

 "I find my ideas out there on the street and then I change them around to make 
up my own designs," Perez said of his computer-generated work. "Another one of 
our mottoes is 'Youth Making Their Mark.' We're trying to show our good 
qualities, and we want people to realize what we are."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY; COUNCIL PANEL OKS PACIFIC TRADE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed Pacific Trade Center cleared another hurdle when a Los Angeles 
City Council committee joined the Planning Commission in recommending approval 
of construction plans for the 25-story hotel, office and commercial project. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, planned for the corner of Olympic Boulevard and Western Avenue 
where a supermarket now stands, still needs the approval of the full council, 
which will consider the matter March 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The $115-million, 587,000-square-foot project would include a 230-room hotel, 
offices, stores and a youth center and generate 1,400 jobs and $3 million in 
tax revenues for the city, said King R. Woods, a consultant for the South 
Korean and American development partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents and local business people who testified at the Planning and 
Land Use Management Committee hearing said they fear the project could further 
stunt the community's weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kang, representing the Koreatown Hotel Assn., said vacancy rates in the 
area's hotels are about 50%. A new hotel and office building "might create some 
movement between buildings but it won't create more guests or tenants," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a large project might also dislocate small businesses, create 
"unnecessary" competition and add more traffic at an already clogged 
intersection, said Howard Ree of the Koreatown Committee for Planned Growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cornwell of the Wilshire Homeowners' Alliance said the project is too 
large, noting that city planners had recommended that it be scaled back. "This 
project is going to seriously siphon off business from an already struggling 
Wilshire Boulevard and it upsets a good planning process on Olympic Boulevard," 
Cornwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large project of this sort, away from Wilshire Boulevard and outside the 
area to be served by the Red Line subway, runs counter to the Wilshire 
Community Plan that guides development, Cornwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters, such as the Miracle Mile Apartment and Commercial Owners 
Assn., see it as a centerpiece for a rejuvenated Koreatown, said association 
president Linda Scheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of jobs and investment are benefits that "outweigh any doubts," 
said Patricia Cross of Country Club Park Neighborhood Assn., whose western 
boundary is next to the project area. "We like the concept of a center that can 
bring international business into our community." JAKE DOHERTY

<P>
 A summary of significant Los Angeles City Hall decisions affecting the 
Westside in the past week. CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WILSHIRE TRAFFIC: Approved transferring $1.7 million in parking revenues to 
a project designed to improve the flow of traffic on the Miracle Mile section 
of Wilshire Boulevard, between Fairfax and Sycamore avenues (one block east of 
La Brea Avenue).The project will include expanding left-turn capacities, 
re-landscaping medians and lane re-striping. The plan does not include a 
synchronized lighting system for the 16-block stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * DRUG TASK FORCE: Approved using $70,000 from the Police Department's general 
fund to pay for the overtime work of eight narcotics officers working for the 
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force, which is under the control of 
the federal Drug Enforcement Agency. Operating throughout Southern California, 
the task force focuses on disrupting major distribution rings of cocaine, 
heroin, PCP and marijuana. The DEA will reimburse the city. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * GUN CONTROL: Approved a motion expressing the council's support for a bill 
pending in the state Legislature that would allow California cities to adopt 
their own gun-control laws, provided they are more stringent than current state 
and federal laws. Among those arguing against the motion was Councilman Nate 
Holden, who said that if the bill becomes law, Los Angeles County could 
theoretically have 86 different gun-control laws. Passed 10-4. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; COUNCIL TO REVIEW CHANGES IN CABLE TV RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday will seek public comment on changes to the basic 
cable service rates and channel lineups established by Century Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was authorized in October by the Federal Communications Commission to 
set local basic cable rates by March.A staff report, presented to the council 
earlier this month, recommends a monthly fee of $22.40 for the lowest tier of 
basic service, which includes a 42-channel package of local broadcast channels 
as well as government and public access channels. 
</P>
<P>
 That is $1.68 less than the $24.08 that Century instituted Sept. 1 for the 
city's 9,209 basic service subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also plans to take up changes made by Century Cable in its channel 
lineup last September. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company introduced Century Select, a 12-channel tier that includes 
many channels that were previously available on a 53-channel basic tier, said 
Fred Cunningham, the city's executive director of public affairs and 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers must now pay for channels usually provided as part of basic service 
such as CNN, TBS, MTV and Nickelodeon or get them through the Century Select 
package, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission, 
protesting the pricing of those channels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has until March 17 to establish rates or the rates now charged will 
remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may approve Century Cable's current rates, or if it determines the 
rates are unreasonable, it has the choice of rejecting the rates and asking the 
operator to return with a lower rate, or the city may prescribe a rate using 
FCC guidelines. The city may also order Century Cable to give refunds to 
subscribers back to Sept. 1. G. JEANETTE AVENT

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; ALPHONSE'S YOUTH CENTER FACES EVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youth foundation director Chilton Alphonse, who attracted national attention 
several years ago by sinking a hefty portion of his state lottery winnings into 
building up his nonprofit organization, says he must raise $100,000 by April 1 
or close his doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Alphonse's Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, the sole occupant of a 
building at 4828 Crenshaw Blvd., received an eviction notice last week. The 
building's owner, who is preparing to sell the two-story complex, said Alphonse 
is three months in arrears on his rent and owes $11,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Charles Colbert gave Alphonse until April 1 to pay his back rent or move 
out. Even so, with Colbert's plans to sell the building, the only way Alphonse 
can stay long-term is to come up with $100,000 -- enough to buy out Colbert and 
assume payments on the $175,000 balance of the property loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert's attorney, Byron Nelson, said Colbert wants to sell the property 
because he is elderly and wants to move out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Alphonse has tried for the past month to raise money by selling seating and 
sponsorships, ranging from $1,000 to $2,500, at an awards dinner Friday at the 
Biltmore Hotel. The "Visions and Motions" dinner will honor 
actress-entrepreneur Marla Gibbs and former RLA chairman Bernard Kinsey for 
extensive community service. 
</P>
<P>
 But ticket sales have not yet generated enough to cover the $50,000 cost of 
the event, although Alphonse says it will take place even if less than $50,000 
in tickets are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very tough going," said dinner coordinator Alicia Watts. "We've 
been hitting anyone and everyone -- athletic companies, beverage companies, 
private corporations. People just aren't giving." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson hopes that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really hoping that after the dinner, he'll have enough money to stay," 
he said. "Otherwise, he'll have to fight this out in court. And even if he does 
come up with it, he'll have to qualify with lenders before he can take over the 
note." 
</P>
<P>
 Alphonse cited the recent Northridge earthquake and the continued recession as 
the primary causes for the center's failing fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the riots, we got a lot of attention," he said. "But now a lot of 
corporations are giving money to earthquake relief. Plus everyone's cutting 
back. It's a bad combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite cash grants totaling about $200,000 over the past two years and 
in-kind donations from companies such as Shell Oil, Unisys, Xerox Corp. and 
Pacific Bell, the cash flow never gained enough momentum to cover the 
foundation's operating costs, Alphonse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation offers a variety of services and programs for youths, including 
a Los Angeles Unified School District alternative high school, SAT and ACT 
preparation courses, an entrepreneurial training program, parenting classes, a 
group home and a boxing gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Alphonse said that if his fund-raising efforts fall short, he doesn't know 
what his next step would be. "I guess I'll just have to fight it out, drag it 
out," he said. "But I don't know if I'll make it this time." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: PLAYA DEL REY; WORKER DIES WHEN PIT COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A construction worker died last week when a foundation pit for an ocean-view 
home collapsed, burying him in sand, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the 62-year-old worker was pulled free about two hours after the 
3:22 p.m. cave-in Wednesday at Manchester Boulevard and Vista Del Mar Lane, 
said Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred as workers were drilling holes for pilings to support a 
hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
 The drill had reached 18 feet and was being withdrawn when the sides of the 
hole collapsed, bringing down two workers who were standing at the edge, said 
Fire Department spokesman Mike Little. 
</P>
<P>
 One man managed to scramble out of the hole, but the other apparently fell in 
head-first. A secondary cave-in buried him under two to 10 feet of sand, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five firefighters and a rescue ambulance were sent to the scene, along 
with a specially equipped search-and-rescue team. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews propped up the sides of the hole with lumber as they used buckets and 
shovels to excavate the man, whose identity was not disclosed.

THE GLOBAL CLASSROOM; LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS INVOLVE MORE THAN MEMORIZING

 Principal Stephen Martinez tiptoed into the Farragut Elementary School 
kindergarten classroom in Culver City, trying not to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearing him, the students -- whites, Latinos, African Americans and Asian 
Americans -- jumped up, faced Martinez, bowed deeply, and greeted him in a 
singsong chorus with " Ohayo Gozaimasu Martinez Sensei ." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez grinned, bowed, and replied "Ohayo Gozaimasu."  
</P>
<P>
 The formalities over, the children sat back on the floor, cross-legged in rows 
marked by strips of colored tape on the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 Red and blue construction paper folded into shapes of birds and elephants, 
called origami , were pinned to a corkboard. On a wall nearby was a clock with 
Japanese Kanji characters instead of Arabic numerals, and a photo of Japan's 
royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez sat down to observe, and teacher Naomi Kawano resumed her lesson, 
reading aloud to her students in Japanese a tale about a dog and cat who become 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The children sat in rapt attention, appearing to understand her every word. 
</P>
<P>
 Farragut is one of about 150 elementary schools nationwide that "immerses" 
children in foreign languages ranging from Spanish and French to Japanese and 
Korean. The idea, say educators, is to start teaching second languages to kids 
when they are eager 5-year-olds, not when they're 16 -- and less willing to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than taking a single language class that meets for an hour a day, 
students in immersion programs actually do course work -- history, social 
studies, math -- in a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 Such learning has taken root on the Westside, which is served by three of the 
45 school districts statewide that have language immersion programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Unified launched the country's first Spanish immersion program in 
1971. Now the district has a K-5 Spanish immersion curriculum and a newly 
launched kindergarten through second-grade Japanese immersion program, which 
serve 300 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified has three Korean and four Spanish immersion programs in 
elementary schools, with one of the Spanish programs at Grand View Elementary 
in Mar Vista serving 146 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica/Malibu Unified offers K-8 Spanish immersion courses and next fall 
plans to add ninth-grade Spanish-language courses in physical science, 
humanities and algebra to its foreign immersion track, which now serves 405 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale offered for such programs is that Americans must learn to 
communicate in other tongues in an era of growing economic and cultural 
interdependence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're deficient in our collective knowledge of other languages and other 
cultures," said Russell Campbell, a professor of linguistics at UCLA who helped 
design Culver City's program 23 years ago. Language immersion, he says, 
produces "kids who can use other languages in the real world, and who can be a 
benefit to society." 
</P>
<P>
 Immersion usually begins in kindergarten. In the early grades students are 
taught almost exclusively in a second language so that by second and third 
grade they are reading and writing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Culver City and Santa Monica programs only 20 minutes a day is spent on 
English instruction in kindergarten, but that amount increases as students 
progress to higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth- and fifth-graders at El Rincon Elementary in Culver City and Edison 
Elementary in Santa Monica spend half their school day learning in Spanish and 
half in English. Culver City students who make it through the K-5 Spanish 
immersion curriculum can go on to take a Spanish language arts course in middle 
school and an advanced Spanish language course at Culver City High. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children, though generally less inhibited than older students when 
learning a second language, still face hurdles in mastering another tongue. 
Learning to write the complicated Kanji alphabet -- one of three Japanese 
alphabets -- poses a special challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) a meticulous process," said Kawano. "Their motor skills are not as 
developed yet, so they go through a process of repetition." 
</P>
<P>
 But immersion veterans say their intensive early instruction made learning in 
another language far easier in higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayanna Bledsoe, an eighth-grader at John Adams Middle School in Santa Monica, 
says one of her toughest assignments recently was "no big deal," thanks to the 
earlier immersion courses she took as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to read 'Don Quixote,' in Spanish," said Bledsoe, 13, a native English 
speaker. "Then we had to do a book report in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 She helps her younger sister, a fifth-grader at Edison Elementary, with her 
Spanish homework. And the pair use their new language for some extracurricular 
communicating at home. Nothing, Bledsoe says, beats dishing some chisme 
(gossip) in Spanish within earshot of their mother, who speaks only English. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the Culver City and Santa Monica school districts say many 
immersion students approach foreign language programs as Bledsoe does -- a 
challenge that is fun at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, however, some parents worry that immersion classes might put their 
children at a disadvantage when it comes time to do English-language 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 For Diana Bulgatz, that concern proved short-lived. Bulgatz acknowledges she 
had some qualms when she enrolled her daughter, Heidi, in Culver City's Spanish 
immersion program in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends asked, 'Aren't you worried that its going to ruin her English?' " 
recalled Bulgatz. But she decided to try the program anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Bulgatz graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UC Santa Barbara two years ago 
with a degree in cultural anthropology and a minor in French. She developed 
fluency in Spanish in the Culver City schools, and went on to learn French and 
study one year at the University of Bordeaux in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Bulgatz is now an international marketing consultant for a company that 
manufactures and sells inflatable kayaks and rafts. "It's a great program," her 
mother said. "I wish we had more in the schools."  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell of UCLA says research has shown that immersion students do as well or 
better on standardized performance and achievement tests as other students. 
</P>
<P>
 But immersion programs have not come problem-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary school textbooks in Spanish and Japanese are hard to find in the 
United States, so school districts have to buy them from publishers in Spain, 
Mexico and Japan. It's particularly hard finding Japanese texts, said Vera 
Jashni, a deputy superintendent with the Culver City schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is the popularity of the immersion programs. In the Culver 
City and Santa Monica school systems, officials say, some students have been 
put on waiting lists because there has been no room in the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding qualified teachers has also been a challenge. Both Santa Monica and 
Culver City have hired teachers from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite such problems, the successes of immersion classes have prompted a 
diverse group of families to choose the schooling for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edison Elementary's immersion program was in its early stages five years 
ago, 88% of the student body was Latino, says Principal Ruth Odell. Since then, 
the school has drawn students from communities including Inglewood, Pacific 
Palisades and Baldwin Hills. Largely because of the immersion classes, Odell 
says, enrollment now is 59% Latino, 30% white, 9% African American and 2% 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we're crazy," said Debbie Leathers, the white parent of a 
first-grader in Farragut's Japanese immersion program. Leathers admits she was 
worried about her son Phillip getting little English instruction until the 
second grade. But she says she thought a knowledge of Japanese might open doors 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program seemed like a way to provide a challenge, enrichment and offer 
him opportunities for the future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she adds, she's happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Leathers said her son is learning such math concepts as more than and less 
than in Japanese. And referring to the three Japanese alphabets, she said: 
"Last year, they learned Hiragana. Now, they almost know all of Katakana, and 
they're tackling Kanji. He has no problems writing the letters." 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of students in Westside immersion programs are of Japanese or 
Latino descent. In some cases, parents want their children exposed to the 
family's cultural heritage. In others, families who do not speak English at 
home see the immersion program as a way to ease their children into the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say native Spanish speakers enrolled in immersion programs do as well 
or better in school than Spanish speakers who are not -- partly because they 
encounter English more gradually -- and, thus, more confidently.  
</P>
<P>
 Consuelo Perez is from Jalisco, Mexico, and has a daughter, Brisa, in John 
Adams Middle School's Spanish immersion program. When she enrolled Brisa in 
kindergarten at Edison eight years ago, the child knew no English. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 14, Brisa is an A student, reads and writes in Spanish and English and 
plans to attend Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is good because since they can speak Spanish and English, and 
feel comfortable learning, their self-esteem is very strong," said Perez, who 
received only a sixth-grade education. "She will have more opportunities here 
and in Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
 Westside school officials say immersion programs are likely to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion, in fact, is already under way. After Santa Monica Unified adds 
its new ninth-grade immersion courses this fall, it plans to offer Spanish 
immersion humanities, math and science courses next year, said Peggy Harris, 
the district's language coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even talking about a preschool Spanish immersion program," Harris said. 
Ultimately, she said, the district hopes to help Santa Monica College establish 
an immersion program for its students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibilities are endless," Harris said.

FOR SENIORS; RADIO COMMENTATOR RELISHES THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT

 Connie Goldman had it all: dream job as a national radio commentator, dream 
apartment in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, secure income. So what made 
her leave it all for a new career? Passion. And a mission: to produce, write 
and talk about positive images of aging. Eleven years ago, at the age of 53, 
she had no idea that her mission had anything to do with herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, a native of Minneapolis, was working in public radio there when 
someone from National Public Radio in Washington asked her to fill in as guest 
co-host for "All Things Considered." It was a two-month temporary job that 
changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when I was getting ready to go back to Minnesota, the weekend host of 
'All Things Considered' became ill and I was asked to fill in for him. At about 
the same time, a friend showed me this great apartment in Georgetown -- high 
ceilings, brick walls -- well, the weekend host didn't get well quickly. Twenty 
months later, NPR gave me a desk, a telephone, a tape recorder and the 1970s 
equivalent of technology -- a typewriter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman became the arts reporter. She interviewed a lot of creative people. 
But the fascinating ones, she believed, were older. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were exceptional people," she recalled. "They had wit and wisdom and 
years of experience to draw from. But the perspective of society was and still 
is: You're as disposable as Kleenex, the economy doesn't want you anymore, 
you've had your time. That's the prevalent attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 But even celebrities said things such as, "Oh, I'm too old to do this," or "I 
should have done that when I was young." And that made Goldman mad, although 
she didn't know why. She interviewed young children and asked them about older 
people. They told her stereotypical things like "they sit around," "they don't 
smell good," "they fall asleep when you talk with them." It surprised Goldman 
that they did not connect older people with positive relationships such as with 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when her mission seized her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized there must be something to say in praise of age, something both 
the young and old could benefit from," she said. She left NPR in 1983, formed a 
nonprofit corporation, created a production company (she was the only employee) 
and applied for grants to produce radio shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting money for public radio shows is tough enough. But shows about old 
people? It took two years before she received enough funding -- she got a 
$7,000 seed grant from the National Endowment for the Arts -- to do her first 
show. Since then she has produced 12 others. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour segments air on NPR. Her most recent show, which aired in 
December, was "The Grandparent Connection: To Love and Be Loved." It was, she 
says unashamedly, a warm-fuzzy. More than a decade later, she has a new way of 
thinking about what's old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an older person now. It doesn't mean I'm obsolete, damn it! It doesn't 
mean I don't work hard, travel, date men, go to dinner parties. I've had vast 
life experiences, raised children, been educated. If we are self-conscious and 
act as if being older is a country we never want to go to, if we act as if this 
is a terrible time of life, how can we get respect from the younger 
generations?" she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check. There are things that diminish with age: hair, energy, health. 
And there are things that increase: weight, wrinkles, grayness. But after 
spending most of life trying to figure out who we are, the beauty of aging is 
that you just might find out -- but you have to keep exploring and you can't do 
that if you stop growing. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you keep growing when society wants to publish your obituary? 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is not a psychologist, anthropologist, sociologist, gerontologist or 
advice columnist. Yet she has some ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knowledge comes from what other people told me about their lives. I retell 
the stories. When I started doing this I didn't believe it had anything to do 
with me. But what I didn't realize was that I was taking early retirement. This 
is really my retirement career," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman believes everyone should have a retirement career but it doesn't 
necessarily have to be work. It's just a plan to continue growing -- and that 
could mean walking on the beach and meditating. "Don't let anyone tell you 
you're doing nothing -- there's a bigger world inside (of you)," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Being busy is not the answer. Busy without satisfaction, Goldman says, isn't 
productive. It's just filling time. "I started all this with my eye on busy, 
active seniors. But this idea of busy every minute -- the aerobic grandmother 
syndrome -- is as dangerous a stereotype as the ones the kids told me. By being 
busy, maybe we're missing the wisdom and satisfaction only available to older 
people. We can't stay young forever, but we can stay fresh, alive and aware. We 
are challenged to find our own process of creativity, to discover a new way of 
being in our retirement years."

THE AMES CIA SPY CASE: UNSTACKING RUSSIAN DOLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Wise, David Wise is the author of Molehunt (Random House), a book 
about the Central Intelligence Agency's secret search for Soviet spies in its 
ranks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA spy case that exploded here and across the world last week resembles 
nothing so much as a matryoshka , one of those Russian stacking dolls that open 
to reveal another inside, and so on, until the last one is reached. But in this 
instance, the last, smallest doll may never be found. 
</P>
<P>
 For the case of Aldrich Hazen (Rick) Ames, and his Colombian-born wife, Maria 
del Rosario Casas Ames, arrested by the FBI on charges that they were Russian 
spies, is so rich in mysteries, puzzles, riddles and contradictions that the 
answers may never be untangled even as the CIA's counterintelligence experts 
begin their long, and sure to be difficult "damage assessment," a process 
already under way. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the facts seem simple enough. If the charges are true, Ames, 
who has worked for Central Intelligence for 31 years, and his wife, once a CIA 
asset in Mexico City, were paid more than $1.5 million by the KGB and its 
successor, the SVR, over a nine-year period to spy for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the puzzles begin. How and when did U.S. counterintelligence discover 
the alleged traitors? The answer to this question, at least, is known within 
the CIA and the FBI, but the information filtering out of those agencies is 
fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer goes back to a former KGB official, Vitaly Yurchenko, who 
defected to the CIA in August, 1985, only to redefect three months later, 
apparently disgruntled with his CIA handlers and disappointed that he was 
unable to rekindle a love affair with the wife of a Soviet diplomat. Yurchenko 
provided information that led the FBI to Edward Lee Howard, a former CIA 
officer who sold the secrets of the CIA's Moscow station to the KGB. Howard 
then escaped an FBI dragnet and vanished into the New Mexico desert, only to 
turn up a year later in Moscow, where he still lives under the protection of 
the SVR. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert M. Gates, the former director of the CIA, says that in the 
mid-1980s, "there were some problems that couldn't be blamed on Howard." The 
problems were that the CIA was losing agents inside Russia who had been 
recruited after Howard had escaped. Some were arrested and some -- but not all 
-- presumably executed, although the CIA won't talk about that. Gates said an 
investigation then began that eventually zeroed in on the Ames couple. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ames, it is known, was one of Yurchenko's CIA debriefers in 1985. If the 
FBI's charges are correct, Ames had already started spying for the KGB three 
months before Yurchenko defected. And Yurchenko was the man in charge of North 
American operations for the KGB. He should have known of a major new 
recruitment inside the CIA, a tremendous coup for the Russians. Why did 
Yurchenko not tell the CIA that one of the men debriefing him was a Soviet spy? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently he did not, because former FBI director William S. Sessions says he 
was informed of the investigation into the Ameses some two years ago, which 
suggests that the FBI and the CIA were not focusing on Ames and his wife until 
about 1991 or 1992 -- seven years after Yurchenko left town. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some speculate that Yurchenko was sent here to reveal Howard and 
ex-National Security Agency officer Ronald W. Pelton, who is serving life in 
prison, and thereby divert attention from a more important spy, U.S. 
counterintelligence agents doubt that. Most believe Yurchenko a true defector 
who changed his mind and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 Open another doll. Last year, the Washington Post revealed that the FBI had 
recruited two KGB agents inside the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Valery 
Martynov and Sergei Motorin. Martynov, in fact, was the KGB officer assigned to 
escort Yurchenko back to Moscow in November, 1985. Martynov was then arrested, 
as was Motorin, who was sent back to Moscow around the same time; both were 
reportedly executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence officials whisper that the pair were betrayed by Ames. But if 
Ames was already a KGB spy, as the FBI claims, why didn't the two KGB men 
inside the Soviet Embassy beat Ames to the punch and betray him first? Ask John 
Le Carre. 
</P>
<P>
 Move on and open another doll. Why didn't the CIA or the FBI catch on to the 
Ameses sooner, considering their high-living style? For example, the couple 
paid cash -- $540,000 -- for a home in Northern Virginia, bought a farm and two 
condos in Colombia, and spent $5,000 a month on credit cards. One answer, 
according to intelligence officials, is that Ames spread the word to friends 
and neighbors that his wife's family was wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the puzzle of the polygraphs. Ames passed two lie-detector tests 
at CIA, an agency that continues to have touching faith in the device, although 
it is often unreliable and there are various ways to defeat it. (Taking 400 
milligrams of meprobamate will do the trick nicely, studies show.) Under 
present policies, the CIA gives lie-detector tests to new employees, again in 
three years, and after that, every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, within the CIA, sensitive employees like Ames, who was chief of the 
counterintelligence branch of the Soviet division, are not screened more 
frequently than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 If we open yet another doll, we come to the peculiar fact that, in 1984, Ames 
was assigned by the CIA to approach and try to recruit officials of the Soviet 
Embassy in Washington. He was supposed to report these meetings to the CIA, but 
the FBI says he did not report some of them. Instead of recruiting Russians, 
the government charges, he began taking money from them, starting in May, 1985. 
But Gates told me that it would be very unusual for a CIA officer to approach a 
Soviet official in Washington to try to recruit him. "That's the job of the 
FBI," he said. The CIA is barred by law from conducting operations inside the 
United States. Did it violate its charter? Other CIA sources say that Ames' 
assignment was, if unusual, not without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the mystery, contained in the FBI's affidavit in the case, of 
the 1986 meeting with the Soviets. According to the FBI, "FBI records" show 
that Ames scheduled a meeting with a Soviet around Feb. 14 of that year but 
never reported the meeting to the CIA. If U.S. counterintelligence did not 
investigate Ames until around 1992, how could the FBI have records of the 1986 
planned meeting? 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds as though the FBI may have checked its wiretaps of the Soviet 
Embassy and discovered that Ames telephoned the embassy to arrange a meeting. 
If he did not use his real name, did the FBI match his voice print to the tape? 
That technique was used to identify Pelton. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the puzzle of how many, if any, CIA agents were executed on 
the basis of information that Ames may have provided to the KGB. Some reports 
say as many as 10 were executed, but is the number accurate, and can they be 
tied to Ames? As a counterintelligence officer in the Soviet division, Ames, if 
the charges are true, would have been in a position to destroy the CIA's 
operations against the Soviet Union, and after 1991, Russia. The FBI says that 
he revealed the identities of CIA officers, and of CIA "human assets," 
presumably a reference to the CIA's Moscow station and to Russians secretly 
spying for the agency. If Russian intelligence knew all about the CIA's 
operations in Moscow, then the KGB and the SVR were like puppet masters pulling 
the strings. If it's all true, the CIA officers were marionettes dancing to 
Moscow's tune. In effect, the KGB/SVR controlled the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the professed shock in Washington that the Russians continue to spy on 
the United States, most political leaders understand that espionage did not end 
with the end of the Cold War. It is a point made by another former CIA 
director, William E. Colby. "Before we get too morally indignant," Colby says, 
"let's realize the Russians were said to be using Mr. Ames to identify American 
spies in Russia. That meant we had those spies." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional spies, as Colby was, know that the game goes on. They are 
dismayed, although not shocked by the week's developments. But even veteran CIA 
officers do not pretend to know the answers to the many mysteries and the 
tangled maze that is the Ames case. Only a CIA optimist would think that the 
Ames matryoshka will yield up all its secrets.

WHY FASCISTS ARE SMILING: RUSSIA IS A BOSNIA PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alex Alexiev, Alex Alexiev, a foreign consultant, writes frequently on 
Russian and Eastern European affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Silencing the guns of Sarajevo has been hailed in Washington and the West as a 
breakthrough achievement in Western efforts to halt the Bosnian carnage. But 
will it bring this tragic conflict to a close and redeem the West after years 
of empty threats and appeasement? 
</P>
<P>
 The truce in Sarajevo will not guarantee a quick and equitable settlement. 
Quite the contrary. It is more likely to make it more difficult to achieve one. 
Also, what has happened in Sarajevo is virtually certain to complicate the 
already complex interaction of regional and foreign powers and have further 
negative consequences for U.S. policy and the progress of reform in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a cursory look should show that what has been accomplished so far is no 
more than the cessation, at least for the time being, of the criminal shelling 
of Sarajevo's civilians by the Serbs. While this is not a small matter for 
traumatized Sarajevo residents, it is hardly a momentous victory for the West. 
The Serbs appear to be complying with the ultimatum, by and large, but they're 
not exactly doing it on NATO's terms. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
stern insistence on placing heavy weapons under its control has been quietly 
replaced by a vague demand for "monitoring," and cases of flagrant defiance of 
the ultimatum by the Serbs have gone unpunished, as so many times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most serious new development, however, is the sudden emergence of 
Russia as a decisive player in the conflict, apparently at the urging of the 
Clinton Administration. There is, of course, nothing wrong per se with getting 
Russia engaged in resolving international conflicts. Attempts by some in the 
West to treat Moscow as an irrelevant, defeated power are myopic and fraught 
with danger. But allowing Russia to play a key role in the Yugoslav conflict, 
under the auspices of the United Nations, is a serious mistake. Moscow is 
anything but an impartial player. 
</P>
<P>
 The West appears to have swallowed the journalistic shibboleths about a 
"historical brotherhood" between Russians and Serbs, which somehow entitles the 
former to intervene on behalf of their "fellow Slavs" and "Orthodox brethren" 
and have a say in Balkan destinies. Conveniently disregarded in this analysis 
is that Russia's policies, as with all great powers, have historically been 
driven solely by national interests and imperial ambitions rather than altruism 
or ethnic and religious affinity. For that matter, some of the implacable 
enemies of the Serbs -- the Croats and, indeed, the Bosnians themselves -- are 
also "fellow Slavs," while other age-old antagonists, like the Bulgarians, are 
both "fellow Slavs" and "Orthodox brethren." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten also is the fact that, for the past 50 years, relations between 
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union had more often 
than not been characterized by hostility. It is worth pointing out that 
throughout most of this period, Serbian officers were trained in U.S. military 
academies on how to fight the Russians and that the Yugoslav military doctrine 
of "territorial defense" was predicated on repulsing Soviet aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 By implicitly recognizing the region of the Yugoslav conflict as within the 
sphere of Russian interests, the West has handed Moscow a de facto veto power 
over its resolution. That it may not be reluctant to use it has already become 
evident in its opposition to extending the NATO ultimatum to areas other than 
Sarajevo. Worse still, given the obvious Russian sympathies for the Serb cause, 
it would not be far-fetched to imagine that the Russians' current task of 
"restraining" the Serbs could easily be transformed into one of protecting 
their territorial gains. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Russia's intervention has broken the international 
isolation of Serbia and has seemingly given the pariah state a powerful 
champion. This at a time when the tide of war appeared to be turning against 
the economically prostrate and increasingly demoralized Serbs. No wonder they 
loudly rejoiced what we have touted as a great NATO victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Less obvious, but no less important, Russian intervention in the Bosnia 
conflict cannot but negatively affect the chances for a successful democratic 
transformation in Russia itself. The simple fact is that the same forces that 
are pushing for unequivocal support of the Serbs are also dyed-in-the-wool 
opponents of democracy and market economics. And they see chauvinism and the 
resurrection of latent neo-imperialist and anti-Western sentiments among 
Russians as their most promising weapon against the democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Their portrayal of Serbia as the innocent victim of Western imperialism and 
Islam could serve a useful purpose. Nothing will strengthen their cause better 
than a new political confrontation with the West, especially with America. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's democrats seem not to detect this danger. Though it is not exactly 
clear where President Boris N. Yeltsin stands on the Yugoslav war, most 
democratic reformers have long known that their country cannot afford the 
burden of empire and foreign interventionism if it is to join the community of 
prosperous, democratic nations. Thus, they have pushed to curtail subsidies to 
the former republics, cut military expenditures and maintain friendly relations 
with the West. Unfortunately, it is their opponents' thinking that seems to be 
increasingly telling in Moscow's behavior, including its foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The final new element in the Bosnian imbroglio is the U.S. role. By claiming 
leadership and taking credit for NATO's new-found activism, Washington, which 
has mostly remained on the sidelines, has assumed a center-stage role and, 
therefore, some responsibility for the ultimate outcome of current peacemaking 
efforts. It will get much of the credit if peace prevails. If not, blame will 
surely follow. If Russia's support emboldens the Serbs to resist a meaningful 
compromise, while the Europeans continue their efforts to coerce the Muslims 
into settling on Serbian terms, the chances of failure and continuation of the 
bitter struggle are very good indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 And thus the chances that the guns of Sarajevo will speak again. When they do, 
on the receiving end will not only be the long-victimized Bosnians, but also 
America's credibility and the cause of Russia's democratic transformation. For 
Slobodan Milosevic and his generals in Belgrade and for the reactionaries in 
Moscow, this is an enticing prospect.

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT; THE FEMINIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow with the Center for the New West and international fellow at the 
Pepperdine University School of Business in Los Angeles. He is also 
business-trends analyst for Fox TV.

<P>
 At a time when California's male-dominated aerospace and big-company economy 
is losing its luster, women entrepreneurs are picking up the slack and becoming 
shapers of the state's new-business culture. And it's not just in California. 
According to a 1992 congressional study, women across the country are starting 
enterprises at twice the rate of men. 
</P>
<P>
 California already boasts, by far, the nation's largest concentration of 
women-owned businesses. Eleven are among the top 50 in the country, including 
Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centers, Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods and Discovery Toys. 
According to the most recent census, Los Angeles-Long Beach ranks No. 1 in 
women-owned businesses, while Santa Ana-Anaheim is third. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing female role in the region's economy, says Geoffrey Kessler, a 
Northridge-based small-business expert, has dramatically expanded with the 
decline of the aerospace-oriented economy. Companies owned and operated by 
women are growing chiefly because of their skills at adjusting to rapid changes 
in markets and customer needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, California is home to a corps of women entrepreneurs who have 
been steadily moving up the corporate and professional ranks since the 1970s 
and are now coming into their most productive years. Today, for example, about 
one-third of the almost 100,000 women entrepreneurs in Los Angeles County 
possess professional backgrounds in fields as diverse as marketing, 
engineering, software and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 These women are moving beyond traditional service-oriented professions into 
male-dominated fields like manufacturing. Nationwide during the 1980s, the 
percentage of women owning industrial enterprises rose from 16% to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Women business-owners contend they enjoy advantages that can overcome such 
hurdles as access to capital and the hostility of male-dominated business 
networks. Jon Goodman, director of the USC entrepreneurship program, says that 
many female entrepreneurs, by necessity, gravitate to non-traditional fields 
and new markets. They often tend to be, as she puts it, "less consumed by 
tradition. They worry less about what is the right and proper thing to do in a 
business context." 
</P>
<P>
 This flexibility is well-suited to the new realities facing California 
business. Today's successful companies, no matter who owns them, operate in an 
environment in which a well-established market niche may suddenly come under 
attack from a domestic or international rival armed with lower costs, a new 
product or faster delivery service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, these nimble, niche-oriented companies -- the core of women-owned 
firms -- have attracted relatively little attention from those who should be 
their natural allies: female politicians. Their preoccupation with large 
aerospace companies, it may be argued, has slowed the region's job-creating 
momentum in fashion-oriented fields, including apparel, home appliances, toys 
and entertainment, where women's adaptability to rapid market shifts is 
strongest. Entrepreneurs like Brenda French, founder of French Rags, and 
Barbara Rodstein, head of Harden Industries, have grown rapidly and been able 
to stay in Southern California because of their willingness to break with 
industry traditions and exploit niches ignored by male competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 French, for example, has built her French Rags knitwear company into an 
industry leader by circumventing traditional retail outlets, which tend to more 
than double the manufacturer's price, and selling customers custom-made 
garments direct through regional "trunk shows," facsimile and telephone sales. 
In contrast to most department-store executives, she believes women are too 
busy to "shop till they drop" and desire clothing that fits their real shape 
rather than conform to fashion designers' fantasies. French Rags' West Los 
Angeles factory now employs more than 100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reasons for women's success in running companies are not restricted to 
their fine sense of markets or consumer tastes. USC's Goodman points out that 
women are quicker to adopt management methods that promote collaboration rather 
than competition within the company. With an increasingly diverse work force 
and an ever-expanding need to share information, this kind of management 
approach has become critical to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not autocratic," says Harden's Rodstein, whose bathroom-fixture company 
expects sales in excess of $25 million this year. "I try to create an 
environment in which ideas can be exchanged and in which those people around me 
who have better skills than I do in certain fields can rise in those levels and 
achieve. If I find out that I am a problem, I tend to move out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, women entrepreneurs in manufacturing, although rapidly growing, 
still represent only a small minority of all female-owned companies. Most 
women-owned businesses are small and concentrated in the service area. Yet, 
their companies, often denigrated by big-company-oriented economists and policy 
professionals, are serving as major avenues of upward mobility for women, 
particularly minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, women of immigrant backgrounds, who constitute about one-third of all 
Angelenos, see entrepreneurship as both an economic and sociological plus. It 
provides an ideal way to break out of the more restrictive, traditional roles 
of their home countries while providing needed income for their recently 
arrived families. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the remarkable success of minority women engaged in such programs 
as the Coalition for Women's Economic Development, which has financed hundreds 
of enterprises, underscores the enormous potential of the historically ignored 
ranks of minority entrepreneurs. Thousands of women like Mary Flowers, owner of 
Sturdi-quick Building Systems, have risen in male-dominated industries, only to 
collide head-on with a glass ceiling of racial and gender prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than sue discriminatory employers, Flowers and other entrepreneurs 
have followed the old adage that living well is the best revenge. With 
assistance from the women's coalition, she has built a successful construction 
firm that has five full-time employees and has ties to scores of subcontractors 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 New telecommunications technology will open up other opportunities for women 
entrepreneurs. Along with the growing use of faxes, modems and computer 
networks, the number of home-based businesses has been rising at 10% a year 
since 1988. About 70% of them are owned by women. California, according to New 
York-based Link Resources, accounts for one of every six of the nearly 24 
million home-based businesses in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Home-based businesses are critical for women with children. Although about 66% 
of adult women are in the work force, most still have primary responsibility 
for their children, all too often without much economic assistance from their 
male partners. Home-based businesses offer women an ideal way to balance the 
roles of mother and wealth creator. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these businesses perform important jobs -- from arranging company 
parties to keeping company records -- that used to be done at corporate 
offices. At the same time, their relatively low operational costs enable these 
companies to charge less. As specialist firms, they can manage supplier 
relations to maximize leverage, thus allowing them to reduce costs further and 
boost efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The feminization of company ownership in California presents the state with 
yet another way to leverage its strengths -- openness to new social forms and 
innovation -- and replace the dying structures of its economic past. Far more 
than any prospective female political triumph, women entrepreneurs are 
providing the kind of economic elixir the state so desperately requires.

BOOMERS' LAST FRONTIER: ACHIEVING PERFECT DEATH; DYING: UNABLE TO AVOID 
MORTALITY, THE YUPPIE GENERATION IS TRYING TO MANAGE IT. BUT ISN'T THIS JUST 
THE LATEST TRIVIALIZATION OF LIFE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Gordon, Suzanne Gordon, the author of Prisoner of Men's Dreams, is 
working on a book about the nursing profession. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The baby-boom generation is the first to be shepherded through life by a 
mass-media culture that turns the mundane occurrences and eternal transitions 
of life into brand-new events. With help from the commercial marketplace, 
boomers are encouraged to have lifestyles rather than lives, and to substitute 
conspicuous consumption for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, boomers are confronting the biggie -- mortality. Many members of the 
baby-boom generation have finally got it -- death is definitely not optional. 
To temper the blow, however, boomers can turn to the "death-awareness movement" 
and try to acquire the latest lifestyle fashion -- the perfect death. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, of course, only the last in a long list of perfect experiences 
boomers have tried to orchestrate for themselves. First came sex and 
relationships. As if they were the first men and women ever to copulate or be 
on intimate terms, boomers in their late 20s and early 30s sought intimacy and 
connection and tried to fathom the unfathomable -- why it is that men hate the 
women who love them, and women love too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Then -- with or without intimacy -- came child-bearing and the perfectly 
choreographed labor and delivery. The competitive spirit so characteristic of 
the well-heeled was much in evidence. Not only was dad at the hospital bedside, 
so were mom's labor coach and a friend who would video every shriek, pant and 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
 As these perfect infants and toddlers were soon to learn, growing up was 
serious business. As Discovery Toys put it, "Play is a child's work" and 
workaholic boomers began tutoring their tots in the crib -- if not in the womb. 
As if this weren't enough, boomers entering middle age discovered there was 
another child to deal with -- the child within. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, of course, boomers are discovering that there is more involved in 
getting old than searching for one's lost youth. Just as our parents began 
losing friends and loved ones in their 40s and 50s, boomers, too, are now 
losing those near and dear. Lest death should just happen to us in the messy, 
unmanageable way it happened to our parents, we boomers have decided to take 
charge -- to turn it into a production. Added to the pressure to produce the 
perfect home, career, relationship and child comes the pressure to produce the 
perfect death. 
</P>
<P>
 The best death production -- if you can temporarily arrange it -- is the 
near-death experience. These brief trips to the other side, as in Peter Weir's 
film, "Fearless" or Betty J. Eadie's best-seller, "Embraced by the Light," are 
ecstatic voyages of discovery. Some, like Weir, seem to believe death is just 
another lifestyle option. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jeff Bridges swallows that one last strawberry and goes into anaphylactic 
shock, we see his embodied spirit trying to decide whether to stay with his 
adoring wife, or go off into the unknown. He debates the issue for a few 
minutes, wistfully glances toward the diaphanous heavens that beckon, bethinks 
himself and decides to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Since near-death experiences are so few and far between, most of us will have 
to cope with the real thing. And if we can't mercifully go in our sleep or die 
instantly after being hit by a Mack truck, that leaves us with the prospect of 
one of those grim reapers like cancer or coronary artery disease. But not to 
worry, this, too, can be overcome -- the trick is to die with all life's 
problems resolved, all major relational loose ends neatly tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Older elites used to believe that the one who died with the most toys won. 
Boomers are now being taught that it's the one with the least anger. Consider 
Michael Keaton in the movie, "My Life." Happily, he has the money to spend on 
alternative healers, and with the help of the latest Sony equipment, he manages 
to acquire immortality. For his family, the wrenching business of bereavement 
is overcome just by popping the cassette in the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there is a positive side to this: Maybe boomers will try to talk about 
their feelings if they or a loved one is dying and do something to control the 
physical pain our medical system seems to ignore. But it's hard to believe that 
this new death-awareness isn't simply another trivialization. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings have always tried to flee mortality. But in facing loss, we may 
reap spiritual gain. And this generation, like others before it, will find 
there's no way to control the final destination, with or without the Sony.

REFINE IMMIGRATION POLICY TO REFLECT HISTORY AND THE MOMENT WE LIVE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ruben Martinez, Ruben Martinez, co-host of KCET's Life & Times, is an editor 
at Pacific News Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America, the free and democratic country whose moral strength made it the 
victor of the Cold War, now wants to enforce its immigration laws by the most 
inhumane means possible. Deny illegals health care. Deny them education. Deny 
them non-emergency aid after the Northridge quake. Indeed, Rep. Dana Rohrbacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) even proposed that illegals be deported when they showed 
up at earthquake aid centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over immigration appears all but over: Democrats and Republicans 
alike leap-frog over each other to propose ever more restrictionist policies. 
Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, are we on the verge of erecting a 
similar wall on our southern border? 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus that there is an "illegal" problem even includes Latino elected 
officials, who late last year formed Proponents for Responsible Immigration 
Debate & Education (PRIDE) in an attempt to counter anti-immigrant proposals. 
The coalition has been largely silent about the future of that portion of the 
Latino population who can't prove legal residency. Rather than advocate for the 
undocumented, a mission most consider political suicide, PRIDE officials have 
generally lauded the Clinton Administration's new immigration policy because it 
appropriates money for the naturalization of "legal" residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this obsession with "legality" in the immigration debate misses the 
point. Immigration policy, in practice and policy, is out of touch with both 
history and the moment in which we live. In an era of globalized capital, the 
right of people to freely move across frontiers must also be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 California cannot escape the consequences of this emerging era. One day soon, 
the state will have an Asian and Latino majority. Those who fear a hostile 
takeover by a cultural "other" fail to see that immigration to America cuts 
both ways: The "immigrant" and the "native" are remade, and both become the 
stronger for it. The American spirit grows by embracing the "other" and by the 
"other" embracing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration restrictionists would stop this acculturation. The truth is, the 
immigrant has already embraced us -- in some cases literally. Think of the 
Salvadoran or Mexican nannies who help working moms. Think of the food on the 
dinner table each night: Brown hands grew and picked it from California soil. 
Walk city sidewalks, where vendors strive to resurrect the moribund American 
dream. Ride public buses, in which immigrants travel to their jobs in the 
pre-dawn hours. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not some mysterious "other" that has "invaded" California. Rather, it 
is the immigrant come to remind us of what America really is: a land of 
optimism, a culture born from the cross-germination of its member cultures. To 
wall off the immigration from the south and from Asia would be to deny America 
its second great immigrant transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this cultural and economic rejuvenation has ever been easy. Nativists 
and their immigrant-advocate counterparts have long clashed over who to allow 
in -- and who to keep out of -- the country. It is a paradox at the heart of 
American identity: We are a country of immigrants, yet we hate immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restrictionist political lexicon, the argument often comes down to 
this: "Illegals" are in violation of the law, and are thus not entitled to the 
rights and benefits enjoyed by "legal" citizens. But there is another -- more 
important -- factor at work here: Whether or not an immigrant is called an 
"illegal" depends on economics -- and political opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
 When nativist sentiments focused on Asians and non-Anglo-Saxon Europeans, the 
border with Mexico scarcely existed. Mexicans arrived in the Southwest in great 
numbers during and after the Revolution of 1910, but rarely were they divided 
into legals and illegals. The Border Patrol's mission was largely symbolic. 
Agents would ask migrants to show both hands -- if no fingers were missing, you 
were allowed to cross into America. (Mutilated hands, it was assumed, would 
mean a life of begging instead of working in the fields.) It wasn't until the 
Great Depression that America decided there were too many Mexicans here; the 
repatriation sent hundreds of thousands of them back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 When California agribusiness needed Mexicans during World War II, they weren't 
called illegals. But Mexicans deported after the war, as part of Operation 
Wetback, were. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the slow-growth '90s, immigrants are again branded "illegal." The 
problem is that because of exploitation and the way immigration laws are 
enforced, Latino immigrants are often denied the upward mobility that other 
groups enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, politicians have relied on a handful of studies that claim 
immigrants soak up more in social services than they contribute in taxes. But 
new research from the Urban Institute shows that immigrant labor may actually 
be contributing more than it is taking away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigrants in California are not the reason the economy is doing badly," says 
Jeffrey Passel of the Urban Institute. "It has much more to do with the 
defense- industry cutbacks and the flow of federal money to and from 
California." Passel's data also show that "legal" immigrants contribute more to 
the overall surplus than "illegals" do, but this doesn't necessarily buttress a 
restrictionist immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal residents, who have been in the country longer, tend to have higher 
levels of education and income. But these "legals" were once recently arrived 
-- indeed, millions were once "illegals." If given half the chance, today's 
undocumented could become a "legal" and productive community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our economy needs that labor, there's no question about it," says David 
Hayes-Bautista of the Alta California Research Center. Of the top five economic 
sectors in California -- agriculture, apparel, entertainment, hi-tech and 
construction -- three of the five "depend almost exclusively on immigrant 
labor," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the contributions of the undocumented-immigrant working class are 
absent from the immigration debate, so is a serious discussion of alternatives 
to the restrictionist frenzy. But there are options. 
</P>
<P>
 A more enlightened immigration policy must address several issues. The 
"illegal" problem can be dealt with by establishing a new "amnesty" similar to 
that implemented in 1986. It should target long-term residents, many of whom 
have established deep roots here. A significant portion are parents of 
citizen-children who identify more with America than with the old country. This 
would not be a "gift" to the immigrant. Rather, it would be past-due 
recognition of immigrants' role in our economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also the "floating" population that crosses back and forth across 
the border, spending several months working in the fields or in the cities, 
then returning to Mexico, usually at the end of the year. A new "bracero"-like 
program to recognize this migrant labor force is necessary. Applicants would be 
granted temporary residency status, which would entitle them to receive only 
the most basic social services, such as emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Political issues must be dealt with as well. Because political representation 
for immigrants, in general, and Latinos, in particular, is inadequate -- 
political scientist Jorge Castaneda calls the situation in California an 
"electoral apartheid" -- a modified electoral scheme should be instituted that 
would allow legal residents who are not yet citizens to vote in local 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we need to invest more in English-as-a-second-language and 
citizenship classes so immigrants can join the political and cultural 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs are not merely "pro-immigrant." They promote middle-class 
interests as well. To have a work force that is well-educated and healthy -- 
and therefore more productive -- is something that contributes to the good of 
all. It is an investment in our future. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take courage to live through this time of transition in California. 
But the work is already half-done: The immigrant has already embraced us.

A FOREIGN POLICY HEADED TOWARD THE ROUGH SEAS OF IRRELEVANCE; DIPLOMACY: THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S AVOWED PURPOSE AND ACTUAL POLICY TOO OFTEN HAVE LITTLE IN 
COMMON. ITS CREDIBILITY IS SLIPPING AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few, if any, administrations have been so ideological in their perceptions or 
as global in their programs as has the Clinton Administration. Yet, none has 
been more pragmatic and prudent in execution, or as driven by domestic 
considerations. The Administration's operational dexterity has, time and again, 
saved it from the implications of its sweeping pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
 When concept and action merge -- as in the North American Free Trade Agreement 
-- the Administration has been highly effective. But too often it neglects the 
importance of credibility. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration started out seeking to vindicate the territorial integrity 
of Bosnia and wound up supporting partition on terms worse than those available 
a year ago. In Somalia, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine 
Albright proclaimed the goal of multilateral democratic nation-building, only 
to see her country retreat to a mission of defending its expeditionary force. 
On China, the Administration has insisted on human-rights progress while its 
body language conveys a desire to extricate itself from its pronouncements. In 
Eastern Europe, Partnership for Peace will prove either vacuous or 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 This disparity between avowed purpose and actual policy threatens U.S. foreign 
policy with growing irrelevance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has neither explained to the American people the meaning of 
current crises nor has it sought to relate the proposed remedies to a 
definition of U.S. interests. The Bosnian tragedy, for example, still awaits an 
articulation of the precise U.S. interest at stake. To be sure, the problem is 
complex because it involves two conflicting principles: how to deal with 
aggression, and the the relevance of America's historic commitment to 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of the Bosnian tragedy was the decision by the international 
community -- inherited by Bill Clinton -- to constitute Bosnia as a sovereign 
nation without regard for its ethnic composition. A responsible course of 
action would have been to establish a temporary U.N. or European Community 
trusteeship to bring about either partition into ethnic groups or some kind of 
ethnically based cantonal arrangement. Ignoring historic, cultural and ethnic 
realities led to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Every American instinct has been to stop the carnage. But in the name of what 
and by what means? Many argued for a restoration of the status quo ante by 
means of air power. History suggested, however, that involvement in a Balkan 
civil war could be costly and prolonged. Serbia would have been unlikely to 
yield what it considered its national heritage to a few air raids. A prolonged 
military campaign would have required ground troops. Also, such a course would 
have been inconsistent with the principle of self-determination, since it would 
have forced half of Bosnia's people to live in a country not of their own 
choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 A more feasible objective would have been to insist on a cease-fire with 
threats similar to those used to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. But the 
consequence would have been to confirm Serbian and Croatian gains and to 
support partition. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first two months in office, the Administration refused to endorse the 
Vance-Owen plan as tending to partition Bosnia. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher went to Europe to promote military intervention. At the last 
moment, the Administration recoiled, chiefly because it was not prepared to run 
the risks of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration then invoked the rhetoric of Bosnian territorial integrity, 
coupling it with a policy of partition without participating in a diplomacy on 
behalf of either course. The Sarajevo carnage ended this ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as the Administration and the public are unwilling to pay the price to 
restore Bosnia's territorial integrity, rhetoric to that effect confuses the 
issue. The realistic option remains an imposed cease-fire and a negotiated 
partition. Affirming goals one is not prepared to vindicate by force if 
necessary will accelerate the loss of credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between proclaimed U.S. objectives and the price the Administration is 
willing to pay exists as well on issues that are largely diplomatic. The wisdom 
of making most-favored-nation trading status dependent on Chinese progress on 
human rights is moot. Nevertheless, the spectacle of the Administration 
imploring Beijing, on the basis of U.S. domestic necessities, to rescue it from 
its self-imposed dilemma is worrisome. Beijing will resist reacting to what it 
considers foreign intervention in its domestic affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The only way out is by way of a political and strategic dialogue defining 
reciprocal interests into which some American human-rights concern could be 
embedded. With time running out, unpalatable alternatives loom for the United 
States: either abandon the proclaimed policy, or start a major confrontation 
with the nation that has the world's fastest-growing economy. Such questions -- 
if human rights and other policies clash, how are priorities to be determined? 
-- have not been dealt with for two reasons. The first is the Administration's 
tendency to treat programmatic statements and operational policy as separate 
activities, each driven by its own necessities, usually defined in terms of 
public relations. Though the underlying reality had been clear for more than a 
year, the ultimatum on Sarajevo was triggered by television footage. 
</P>
<P>
 The second obstacle reflects the Administration's reluctance to deal with a 
world that includes conflict, clashing interests and the need for equilibrium. 
The Administration subordinates such matters to global multilateral concepts. 
The result is that almost every concrete event is unrelated to the 
Administration's philosophical expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, the President has eloquently stated fundamental principles, and 
his colleagues have shown great skill in extricating the United States from 
involvements they had a hand in creating. What is lacking is a national 
strategy that relates means to ends. Avoiding disaster cannot remain the sole 
test of U.S. foreign policy.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; WITH A KILLER'S CONFESSION, GAINESVILLE STUDENTS BREATHE 
EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jon Glass, Jon Glass, editor of the Independent Florida Alligator, the 
student newspaper, is a senior majoring in journalism. He was a first-year 
student at the time of the murders. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last days of August, 1990, mean something to everyone who was in 
Gainesville at the time. The home to the University of Florida, a relatively 
quiet town, was taken siege by the worst enemy possible -- fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Five college students were found brutally slain in their apartments. A killer 
was on the loose. Rumors abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students who had just finished unpacking for the fall semester repacked 
their suitcases and headed home. Some would never return to the university, 
instead pursuing their education elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, unable to get out of town, immediately bought weapons and extra locks 
for their living quarters. At night, we would sleep over in groups of as many 
as a dozen. And no matter what, we never went out alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainesville, which used to be known only as home of the UF Gators, was renamed 
the "college murder capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Danny Harold Rolling would be named a suspect, indicted and 
convicted of a robbery spree throughout Florida. But no one knew for sure 
whether this soft-spoken drifter from Louisiana was responsible for the savage 
deaths of the five students. Investigators and attorneys were bound by a gag 
order until the trial was under way. News reports sometimes conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Feb. 15, just as jurors were about to be selected, Public Defender 
Rick Parker asked the presiding judge if he could make an announcement. And 
from out of nowhere, Rolling admitted to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks of anticipation, months of planning and years of waiting had preceded 
that day. It was all over in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, a career criminal known for singing his self-written ballads before 
judges, gave a simple explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been running from one thing and then another all my life. . . . But 
there are some things that you just can't run from, and this being one of 
those." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gainesville and UF, Rolling's confession means they finally can escape the 
uncertainty that has haunted them for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at UF and the local Santa Fe Community College have learned a great 
deal since the murders. Fear may not go away, but personal safety, trust and 
common sense, which were not such pressing issues before, now seem vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has changed, though. Many students, especially those who have 
enrolled since the murders, forget to call roommates when they are running 
late. Some still jog alone. Doors don't always get locked.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps with details about the murders finally coming out, these students will 
better understand what their older colleagues had to deal with. It's not the 
kind of education the college promises in its glossy brochures; but for those 
of us who lived through the nightmare, it was an unforgettable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The community, which has been forced to carry the memory of the murders too 
long, can finally put the incident behind it. The thought of state and national 
media again descending on the town to cover Rolling's trial, expected to last 
three months, was enough to make civic leaders cringe. At one point, someone 
suggested that a public-relations campaign be started to combat the trial's 
negative publicity. Now that the case has been compressed into a monthlong 
process of deciding whether Rolling will face the electric chair, the bigger 
media outlets have retreated. And, with them, so has the stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pressure of a trial gone, the victims' families and friends can 
continue the healing process that few of us will ever fully understand. They 
are the ones who waited 3 1/2 years to find out if Rolling was the person who 
destroyed their lives by taking away a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 The only people who gain nothing from Rolling's admission are the victims 
themselves. Christa Leigh Hoyt, Sonja Larson, Tracy Paules, Christina Powell, 
Manuel Taboada. They are the names inscribed on several memorials, including 
honorary trees on UF's campus and a place on the 34th Street Wall, a 
quarter-mile stretch of graffiti-covered cement. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be with Gainesville forever. 
</P>
<P>
 As will the fear.

By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox 11 News and a

 When Bernard Kinsey, an RLA co-chair, resigned last month, he noted that a 
basketball player, Larry Johnson of the Charlotte Hornets, had just signed an 
$84-million contract -- more than the total of all government funds put into 
inner-city Los Angeles since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Created when Los Angeles was still smoldering from the riots, RLA is a private 
agency charged with developing the economy of the central city. Its first 
chairman, Peter V. Ueberroth, estimated it would need $6 billion in investment 
to create the 75,000 jobs needed to turn L.A.'s neglected neighborhoods around. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of last year's mayoral elections, it was clear that RLA was not 
meeting public expectations. Ueberroth had resigned in May, 1993. Few jobs had 
been created. Only one-tenth of the needed investment had been obtained. The 
board wanted a new chairperson, but most of the likely candidates made it clear 
they didn't want the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lodwrick M. Cook offered to take the helm, with one caveat. He wanted 
Linda Griego to run the organization as a full-time, paid CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is no stranger to RLA or to community causes. As chairman and CEO of 
Arco, he heads one of the cities biggest and most civic-minded corporations. A 
native of Louisiana, he came to Los Angeles in the early '70s. He has been 
Arco's CEO since 1986. Active in the rebuilding of the library Downtown, Cook 
is the father of five grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Angelenos will remember Griego from a commercial she ran during her 
unsuccessful bid for mayor last year. It featured Griego, clad in red, walking 
among black & white, life-size cut-out photos of her male opponents. A former 
deputy mayor under Tom Bradley, she spent six years in Washington as an aide to 
Sen. Alan Cranston. In 1986, Griego opened a successful downtown restaurant, 
Engine Co. 28. She is married to attorney Ronald Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook and Griego say their short-term strategy for RLA will include following 
up on commitments by businesses that have never been fulfilled. Over the longer 
term, they say they will stress a "bottom-up" economic strategy that they 
believe will create jobs by focusing on small- and medium-size businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview held on the top floor of the Arco tower, both admitted that 
RLA had lost direction. But each is convinced that with good management and 
hard work, RLA can accomplish its goal of creating greater prosperity for the 
whole of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q uestion : How would you define, or redefine RLA? What has it been, and what 
should it be?  
</P>
<P>
 Cook: Focusing RLA on economic development is the direction Linda and I want 
to go, and the board has approved that. We want to help existing companies 
expand, help small companies get going in the neglected areas and work with 
companies that might consider relocating parts of their businesses to these 
areas. In other words, job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's in contrast with the past, when RLA sometimes tried to do other things. 
We're better suited to work in this economic-development area than we are in 
things like affordable housing, for example. Unless, of course, if that is 
specifically an obstacle for a business to get started -- then we would address 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego: For the first couple of years, RLA was like a developer. Developers 
juggle a lot of balls. Some things work, and some do not. One of my first tasks 
will be to evaluate what has worked and what hasn't. That development stage is 
over for RLA, and I see us moving into the building stage. We want to focus on 
the things that did work, and add to that some of the ideas I have about 
business networks. These are ways small and medium-sized businesses in the 
neglected areas can collaborate so that they can compete for larger contracts. 
This is a great way to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What else has RLA done right, and how would you rate its success so far?  
</P>
<P>
 Griego: We've succeeded in showing businesses that there are profits to be 
made. There's now a lot of interest by business in areas that are underserved. 
For instance, I live in Baldwin Hills, and Lucky's grocery finally opened a 
store in my neighborhood. It's become the top-revenue producer in Lucky's 
chain. For years, there were two Boy's markets -- no competition. Then 
competition comes in, and that's started some revitalization in the Crenshaw 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 I always work from a position of trying to build on what we already have. And 
we already have companies that are committed to the neglected areas -- that are 
doing business there, that hire locally. And the question now is what else do 
they need, what can we do for them? We want to work from the bottom-up. We want 
to know if businesses need capital, access to new markets or technical 
assistance. Are they running into red tape at City Hall? 
</P>
<P>
 Cook: I think it's hard at this time to specifically measure the success of 
RLA. But from the beginning, RLA was a point around which people could rally. 
And the interest is still out there. Sure, we've got to be more effective; 
we've got to do a better job of channeling our energies. But we have a great 
resource in the people on our board of directors. It's been criticized for 
being too big, but I think it's wonderful that we have so many people from 
across the spectrum in our community who are working to revitalize the city. I 
believe that we've learned some things about what's possible, and I think the 
level of expectation about what we can do is a little more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do each of you bring to the job? How are you going to divide the work? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Cook: Linda is the key to our new focus on economic development. She's been an 
entrepreneur. She's worked in City Hall, and had to work through City Hall as a 
businessperson. So she brings a real firsthand knowledge to the task. 
Hopefully, I can help her by continuing to tap resources that will push us 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego: This is just the kind of team that will work -- the small-business 
perspective I bring, and the City Hall expertise, and Lod's connections in the 
corporate world and his involvement in the community. We each have a stake in 
this city. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook: It's a personal stake and a business stake. This is the biggest gasoline 
market in the country, if not the world, and Arco is the leader in that market. 
This is where a lot of our people live; so we have a real stake in seeing that 
things work better. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego: We've been through some pretty rough times, but there are a lot of 
small emerging businesses in our city. You don't read about them, because they 
don't make headlines. But, for instance, I was just talking to a man who, with 
his sister, started a flower business at 8th and Olive 10 years ago. They 
started with $150 and bought a used refrigerator. Today, they employ 150 
people. This guy says he's not stopping until he gets in the Fortune 500. These 
are the kind of entrepreneurs I know exist in the communities we're concerned 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned one model, of businesses coalescing to win bigger contracts. 
Are there other models, other things being done elsewhere that might work here 
in Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 Griego: The model I referred to was from Pennsylvania, where, in the '80s, the 
state had lost a lot of its industrial base and tried to figure out what it 
could salvage. It turned out there were a lot of small and medium-size 
companies -- mostly manufacturers -- and they worked on ways to intersect and 
strengthen these businesses. Today, that area is doing very well. Maryland did 
something similar with biotech firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest success stories are in Northern Italy. Those were very 
small companies that were not able to compete with the Germans and others. So 
they began collaborating -- figuring out who could do this, and who could do 
that, and today that is the most successful region in Italy. So collaborations 
are not a new concept; they would just be new here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are your goals? What would you like to accomplish in a year, in two or 
three years?  
</P>
<P>
 Cook: The first task is to zero in on the commitments that were put forth by 
businesses and government two years ago, when the organization was born. We 
want to pin those folks down and get them to honor their commitments. I'm sure 
Linda is going to evaluate the people in the organization. We want to make sure 
that we have plenty of people out in the field, working one-on-one with 
businesses, and with the city as well. So it's a step-by-step process of 
getting geared up in a new direction and becoming a truly active player. We 
don't want to duplicate efforts being made by others, and we don't want to 
compete with others for resources -- if the funds can be used more effectively 
by another organization, we will support their efforts. Of course, we need more 
funding, too. But if someone isn't working the downstream part of the business 
-- out there with the entrepreneurs, finding out what their needs are -- then 
it doesn't do much good to accumulate a big war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego: I think that's what's unique about RLA: It's private-sector-driven. 
Entrepreneurs like that, because they know we understand what they are going 
through, and that perhaps we have been there ourselves and can provide some 
answers. Many times when government offers assistance, you get there, and it's 
just a lot of forms and documents. RLA can help businesses cut through some of 
those forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the criticisms of RLA -- and it's one the mayor has expressed -- is 
that there is too much emphasis on creating jobs within the inner city. A 
better course, it's suggested, would be trying to place inner-city workers in 
jobs located elsewhere. What's your answer to this charge?  
</P>
<P>
 Griego: I don't think some magic company is going to come along and say, "OK, 
we've got jobs, just bring the people over here." Let's face it, most people 
use networks to get jobs. Friends or family will tell them about an opening 
where they work -- that's always been the best way to get a job. And the new 
jobs are coming from small business. Think about this: If each small business 
could hire just two people -- and there are 130,000 small businesses we've 
identified in the neglected areas -- you are talking about a huge number of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the recent earthquake change the focus of RLA?  
</P>
<P>
 Cook: I think it reminds us again that we are a community, and that we depend 
on each other a great deal. It reminds us that when there is urgency, we can 
get a lot done. If we could get some fraction of that urgency back and working 
for us, so that red tape isn't as burdensome as it is, we would accomplish a 
great deal. If you look at all these calamities that have hit us, the one 
positive to come out of them is that we've found quicker ways to do things. We 
ought to learn how to keep those same kinds of efficiencies during times when 
we aren't having calamities. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego: The very things that small businesses complain about -- why does it 
take so long to work through the bureaucracy? -- seem to disappear when there 
is a disaster. Suddenly, the city can get a permit out quickly. It's not like 
people are working overtime. They've just changed their thinking in order to 
make things happen faster. And this is what small business has been asking for 
all along. And, of course, the more responsive the city is to helping business, 
the quicker it can rebuild its tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook: The quakes and fires and floods have been devastating for many 
individuals. But we still have huge underlying social issues in our community 
that affect everyone, everyday. So we don't want to give up. Whatever we do at 
RLA is not going to be overnight, not dramatic, and we may not know for a 
period of time if we've had any success or not. Hell, we may fail. We may not 
make a difference. But we are not going to give up.

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Medfly project officials have congratulated themselves on a successful first 
spraying over Corona (Feb. 17). But this could equally be seen as a resounding 
failure to heed the pleas of the public for non-invasive approaches more in 
keeping with the notion that this is a democracy.The governor declares a state 
of emergency upon the finding of a single Medfly. That doesn't constitute a 
genuine emergency. A 6.8 earthquake -- that is an emergency. The helicopters 
may conduct their maneuvers with military precision, yet what a messy affair! I 
get tired of hearing them say malathion is proven safe. It is not. Numerous 
scientific studies from around the world, and our own anecdotal evidence, 
clearly show its toxicity, particularly to the nervous system. Some of those 
studies are available from the World Research Foundation in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not blindly trust the official scaremongering concerning the threat of 
the Medfly, nor their reassurances concerning the safety of aerial spraying 
with malathion.

WHY BAD SCIENCE CAN'T BE GOOD EDUCATION; DOGMA CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO FUNNEL 
NONSENSE INTO CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are perilous times for science. Scientists have long been accustomed to 
battling public fascination with astrology, psychics, channelers and New Age 
quackery, and the more pernicious efforts by religious fundamentalists to 
infiltrate the public schools with the arrant nonsense of "creation science." 
But now comes an assault from the political left too, which has seized on false 
science as means of promoting multicultural political correctness, trying to 
replace testable science with favored myths that are more agreeable than 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 FROM THE LEFT: An Afrocentric view holds that melanin, which makes skin dark, 
is at the root of a putative black superiority; melanin is said to operate as a 
superconductor and regulate human psychological and physiological processes. 
The "melanists" also argue that the white race is the product of mating between 
albino mutants of blacks who migrated to Europe to escape the African sun. 
Another theory holds that the Maya Indians came to Earth in the form of genetic 
information from another solar system. There are comparable formulations from 
radical feminists and American Indians. Some of this has made its way into 
schools, sometimes as part of well-meaning efforts, for example, to bolster the 
self-esteem of black youths. 
</P>
<P>
 These trends were a significant topic of discussion at the annual meeting of 
the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in San Francisco last 
week. Some of the false notions have managed to gain credibility in schools. 
For instance, a textbook used to train multicultural teachers argues that the 
well-established anthropological fact that native American peoples migrated 
from Asia across the Bering Strait is just an "unsubstantiated" theory of white 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 False science has been given witting or unwitting support by some 
"post-modernist" scholars who argue that all knowledge is relative and 
traditional Western scientists have no greater claim to explaining reality than 
other thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 FROM THE RIGHT: And public school decentralization, however beneficial in 
other respects, has made it easier for pressure groups to get science claptrap 
into the classroom. In many cases science teachers have valiantly fought 
creationist efforts but have been cowed into agreeing that evolution is "just" 
a theory. Although science continues to debate the fine points, evolution has 
been proven beyond any doubt, no more open to question than whether the Earth 
is round. Pressure groups have been aggressive in advancing their views. So 
right-thinking parents must come forward to support teachers in resisting the 
forces of ignorance. An ally for them in this is the Berkeley-based National 
Center for Science Education, a nonprofit group that maintains a hot line, 
(800) 290-6006. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, science is not as pure as some of its mandarins would have us 
believe. Greed, envy and personal aggrandizement are often as much the motives 
in scientific creativity as the search for truth. And examples of scientific 
fraud and error abound. 
</P>
<P>
 But dogma, religious or otherwise, cannot be allowed to funnel nonsense into 
our children. "Science does not contradict religion," says Francisco Ayala, a 
former Jesuit priest who is a geneticist at UC Irvine and the president-elect 
of the AAAS. Religion has a legitimate role in the discourse over the ultimate 
origin of matter, a mystery that science may never solve. But to seek refuge 
from scientific uncertainty in the irrational is absurd and dangerous. 
Scientific and technological prowess is critical to American competitiveness in 
a global economy. Some of our schools are bad enough, too often graduating 
semiliterate youngsters ill-equipped to function in the modern world. To 
mis-educate them also in science is self-defeating ignorance that borders on 
intellectual and economic suicide.

REPAIRING THE COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The article by Catherine O'Neill ("Time Out on Coliseum Repairs," 
Commentary, Feb. 18) asked, "Why the rush to spend unknown millions on this 
white elephant?" Yet she failed to mention the best reasons for supporting 
federal funding for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a 1994 football season, both USC and the Raiders will be forced to 
play their home games outside the city of Los Angeles, taking hundreds of jobs 
with them. Exposition Park's museums would be adversely affected as well. The 
Raiders could decide to leave town for good. The real price to be paid by 
forgoing Coliseum repairs in favor of building a new stadium is that several 
years would be lost before USC and the Raiders could play in Los Angeles again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum's distinctive architecture makes it the most recognizable public 
edifice, nationally and internationally, in all of Southern California. It is a 
symbol of Los Angeles and the significant role sports has played in our 
history. Its reconstruction by September will send a message that Los Angeles 
is back on its feet.  
</P>
<P>
 Although far from a state-of-the-art facility, the Coliseum is no white 
elephant. Its operation is self-supporting, and the facility does not receive 
government funding. The $35 million estimated cost of repairs represents less 
than 1% of total federal quake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Coliseum can be rebuilt in time for football this year, the work should 
proceed. The idea of a brand-new stadium somewhere in the county is well worth 
exploring, but Coliseum repairs should not be held hostage to that debate. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * O'Neill refers to "the urban blight that plagues the area." I dropped by 
Exposition Park a few days before her article appeared. And I was appalled by 
the same acres of empty parking lots that she points out contribute to the 
blight. What really stuck in my craw was to see how a jewel of a recreational 
and educational preserve for all the public has been turned by "big money" 
interests and local governmental sycophants into a closed reservation of 
privilege, influence and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The public road that used to offer access to museums, grassy expanse, a 
world-class swimming pool and tennis courts is no more. Instead of hundreds of 
parking spaces available for a dime or a quarter, now everyone must pay $3 for 
the dubious privilege of paying $5 per adult and $2.50 per child to gain 
admittance to the county's only natural history museum. What most of us kids 
came to the area for, years ago, was to play touch football or basketball or 
softball on the playground, or a fast game of roller-skate hockey on the 
sidewalks around the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're going to rebuild L.A. and all just get along, why not rejuvenate the 
Coliseum and environs as an area where we can all play and learn to live 
together harmoniously? And bring back those metered parking spaces! 
</P>

<P>
 * I am a person who has been to every USC-Notre Dame and UCLA game since 1974 
and consider myself not to be a sports fanatic, but rather someone who 
cherishes not just the teams, but the places where they play. In many cases, as 
with the Coliseum, the places have more history or importance than the teams 
that play in them. I cannot express in words the feeling I get being with my 
friends, as we walk toward the Coliseum, viewing the ivy-covered walls and 
imagining the great games of the past as we walk down the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 I do agree that money should be allocated only after a budget has been worked 
out or at least proposed, by the commission. I do not and will not agree or 
ever support building a new stadium. I am more than willing to see Al Davis go 
but certainly not the Coliseum!

<P>
 * I don't get it. The City Council votes to authorize a city attorney 
investigation into allegations that the Coliseum's private manager, Spectacor, 
and its architect, HNTB, withheld a technical report from the Coliseum 
Commission that stated that the stadium could suffer severe damage in the event 
of a large earthquake (Feb. 10). Let's see . . . the Coliseum was constructed 
of unreinforced concrete in the early 1920s, before substantial revisions to 
building codes in response to the 1933 Long Beach quake and the 1971 Sylmar 
quake. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to conclude that a building 
constructed in this fashion over 70 years ago could come down if a large 
earthquake were to hit.  
</P>
<P>
 To top this, the commission turns around and hires an architect (without 
competitive bidding) to assist in earthquake repairs (Feb. 15). Yes, the same 
architect that the city attorney is investigating for allegedly withholding 
seismic information from the Coliseum Commission.

<P>
 * It blows my mind that $10.9 million out of the first $75 million being 
allocated to Los Angeles for earthquake damage will go to repair the Coliseum. 
What has happened to our council's sense of priority? Do you not think that 
perhaps the damaged public schools should be repaired first? This taxpayer 
resents this motion and is ashamed of our City Council.

WILSON ON EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In her remarks during her announcement of candidacy for governor, Kathleen 
Brown stated, " . . . Wilson was more than 1,000 days into his term before he 
hired a consultant to reform education. . . ." Perhaps Ms. Brown was out of 
California on Jan. 8, 1991. On that day -- the second day of his term -- Gov. 
Pete Wilson created the Cabinet-level Office for Child Development and 
Education, and appointed me as secretary of child development and 
education.This historic event brought the status of children and education to 
the highest level of the governor's office for the first time in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, my office has been instrumental in creating the Healthy Start 
Program, the model California Learning Assessment System, the Early Mental 
Health Program, and the California Academic Volunteer and Mentor Services Act. 
We have also expanded the state preschool program by more than 200%, and 
increased funding to K-12 education by more than $4 billion. All of this 
occurred during the worst recession since the Great Depression and during a 
time when Wilson has had to declare 55 of the 58 counties in California a 
disaster area.

A SMALL FEDERAL PRECEDENT FOR GAYS; EXTENSION OF ANTI-BIAS LANGUAGE IN QUAKE 
RELIEF PACKAGE IS LAUDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $8.6-billion earthquake aid package, passed by Congress and signed by 
President Clinton, contains a little-noticed precedent: It protects gays who 
seek quake relief from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although 
this safeguard applies only to emergency earthquake assistance, it is 
significant because it is the first time that gay men and lesbians have been 
accorded such federal civil rights protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) 
added sexual orientation to standard federal anti-discrimination protections -- 
which outlaw bias based on race, color, creed, religion, gender and national 
origin -- in the application process for federal disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Though intended to protect against unfair denials of disaster aid, the change 
extends to housing rented with emergency-relief checks, housing officials 
believe. The protection is warranted for this disaster because neither federal 
nor state laws ban housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. A Los 
Angeles ordinance does outlaw housing bias based on sexual orientation but it 
lacks the clout of the strong federal fair-housing laws that protect 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men and women are not the most common victims of housing discrimination. 
Minorities and individuals with large families generally encounter greater 
prejudice. But the Northridge earthquake has made finding housing difficult for 
all but the most affluent because it damaged thousands of homes and apartments 
and increased the competition for affordable rental housing. A tighter market 
is conducive to bias because it allows landlords greater selectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of homeowners and tenants who have been displaced by the quake 
believe they have suffered discrimination and have filed complaints. Many 
would-be renters know their rights and to whom they should complain because of 
a noteworthy public-service campaign by the Fair Housing Congress and the 
Western Center on Law and Poverty, which leafleted disaster assistance centers. 
The Clinton Administration official in charge of fair housing, Roberta 
Achtenberg, has been to Los Angeles to address discrimination complaints since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending broad federal civil rights protections to gays and lesbians has long 
been politically impossible in Washington. Many politicians have opposed 
creating a new protected class. This change prompted no uproar, perhaps because 
of the narrow application. Still, a laudable precedent has been set.

SMOKE GETS IN LAWMAKERS' BRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much more evidence of the dangers of tobacco smoke do the members of the 
California Legislature need? Research published last week in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. provides the first biochemical proof that secondhand 
cigarette smoke affects unborn children. Doctors in Toronto have shown that 
tobacco's toxic elements accumulate in the fetuses of women who do not smoke 
but who live or work with smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have long linked smoking by pregnant women to a baby's increased 
risk of low birth weight, prematurity, slow neurological development and sudden 
infant death syndrome. But researchers have had difficulty confirming that a 
fetus can be affected by secondhand smoke as well. The Canadian researchers 
measured the level of cotinine, a long-lasting byproduct of nicotine, in the 
hair of newborn babies and found that cotinine levels were twice as high in 
infants of so-called passive smokers as in those born to women not exposed to 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this news worry cigarette manufacturers? Apparently not. A spokesman for 
the industry's Tobacco Institute maintained that the Toronto study provides no 
evidence that there are long-term dangers for infants exposed to secondhand 
smoke.  
</P>
<P>
 But others see the mounting scientific evidence of the health risks posed by 
passive smoke as a call to action. Last week, U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn 
Elders, citing a rise in smoking by teen-agers, issued a clear warning: 
"Tobacco addicts and it kills." Also last week, McDonald's Corp. announced that 
its 1,400 company-owned restaurants will be smoke-free. Arby's last month 
banned smoking in its company-owned restaurants. The National Council of Chain 
Restaurants, of which McDonald's is a member, endorsed a pending federal bill, 
introduced by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), to ban smoking in most 
commercial buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 California should show the way by finally passing its own workplace smoking 
ban. That bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), 
passed the Assembly last year but stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Former committee chairman Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), now Senate president, has 
been noncommittal on this reasonable bill. He should support it now; the 
Toronto results provide yet more evidence of how far beyond the smoker 
tobacco's harm can reach.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEBRON MASSACRE; SECURITY CUTS BOTH WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAUOD KUTTAB, Daoud Kuttab is a Palestinian journalist and filmmaker living 
in Jerusalem. He is currently involved in the production of Peace Chronicles a 
Palestinian, American, Israeli documentary for Channel Four in Britain. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the most telling picture of Friday's tragedy at Hebron was that of 
extremist Jewish settlers cheering Baruch Goldstein for killing so many Arabs. 
It showed that Jewish settlement was no vanguard action or security tactic; 
Jewish settlement is a racist expansionist policy that ultimately aims at 
"ethnically cleansing" the Palestinian territories of their indigenous Arab 
population. But, unlike the Deir Yasin massacre of 1947, the Palestinians this 
time will not be driven from their homeland no matter how brutal the Zionist 
terror is. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragic and cowardly act of the settler Goldstein bursting into the Ibrahim 
Mosque with an assault rifle revealed one of the biggest pitfalls in the 
current peace talks: The agenda calls for a delay in dealing with the issue of 
settlements until the second phase of negotiations at least three years from 
now. With little real support from the Arab world, and without any pressure on 
Israel from the United States, PLO leaders were forced to accept a deal 
according to Israeli conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months were wasted as Israel mercilessly kept the presure on Palestinians 
by demanding exaggerated security conditions in order to protect Jewish 
settlers ever-ready to take advantage of their situation. The Palestinians' 
demands for the security of their unarmed population were disregarded as a 
negotiating tactic. Even the clear erosion of support for the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and the peace process did not dent the Israelis' 
insistence on getting the most from their weak Palestinian counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis wanted to have their cake and eat it, too: The government wanted 
the appearance of a peace process, international normalization and support 
without giving up land or dealing with difficult issues, such as the illegal 
settlers and their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that this tragedy has befallen us, some Israeli cabinet ministers are 
finally admitting that their government has been too lax with the Jewish 
settlers. Arms were distributed to them upon request, even to those convicted 
of killing Palestinians. One of the settler leaders in Hebron, Rabbi Moshe 
Levinger, handed over his gun as he went into jail to serve a four-month term 
for killing an innocent Palestinian shopkeeper in Hebron a few years ago. When 
he walked out of jail, his gun was handed back to him and he was given a hero's 
welcome by the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian outrage after the terrible massacre on Friday quickly centered on 
the need for the PLO to walk out of the peace talks. Chairman Yasser Arafat 
might find himself forced to do just that unless he can show his people that 
peace is worth the sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the process began with the first talks in Madrid, Palestinians have 
been more than willing to give peace a chance. Palestinian stone-throwers 
instead presented Israeli soldiers with olive branches in a gesture of peace. 
But since that date, the lot of Palestinians has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Likud government, illegal Jewish settlements continued to be built; 
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has admitted that he would have dragged 
the talks out for 10 years. The victory of the Labor Party renewed 
Palestinians' faith in the peace talks. Palestinians were willing to give the 
declaration of principles signed in Washington on Sept. 13 a chance, even 
though it reflected Israeli demands more than Palestinian aspirations. But 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government refused to show the Palestinian 
population any sign of peace unless the PLO gave in to his demands for the 
illegal settlers and total security on the borders.  
</P>
<P>
 The 27 years of Israeli occupation have been based on the warped concept that 
might is right; instead, right is might. The unarmed and politically weak 
Palestinians cannot do much to improve the present balance of forces. The only 
way out is for the sponsors of the Middle East peace process to act morally in 
order to correct the imbalance in the peace talks. PLO leaders agreed to 
President Clinton's request to go to Washington with the hope that the United 
States will act in accordance to the principles and values that have made it 
the world's leader. Only a summit of the top decision-makers and the strong 
involvement of the President of the United States made peace between longtime 
enemies possible at Camp David. What is needed now is for the current leader of 
the free world to act with the same decisiveness that he employed last week 
against Serb aggression.

PLATFORM; 'STAND UP TO THIS TYRANNY' OF GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi GARY GREENEBAUM is Western regional director of the American Jewish 
Committee and president of the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. He 
had this comment on the murder of LAPD rookie Christy Lynne Hamilton on 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 A police officer, shot dead in the line of duty. She didn't have a chance, 
even though she did everything right. She was killed by a gun that should not 
have been in anyone's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol Officer Christy Hamilton, answering a 911 call in a quiet, middle-class 
neighborhood of Northridge, stepped from her patrol car. She was told by two 
women who had run from a house that a 17-year-old inside had shot his father. 
Hamilton and other officers, wearing bulletproof vests, followed safety 
procedures. She crouched behind the open front door of her car for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Golly, 17, shot her in the chest with an AR-15 semiautomatic 
assault rifle. The shot entered her body at the edge of the armhole of her 
bulletproof vest. She was acting properly and wearing body armor, yet she was 
shot dead. The young man then returned to the house and shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
 We have here a great human tragedy. We also have here a graphic example of a 
simple fact: Our police officers today are outgunned on the streets of our 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers don't carry assault rifles. These are guns developed for war, 
but which now sit in people's closets or under their beds or on proud display 
in glass cabinets. By the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Can there actually be doubt in any person's mind about whether a high-powered 
gun like this should be available to average citizens? Can the National Rifle 
Assn. defend the laws that allow a gun such as this to be legally held in the 
home? 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after Officer Hamilton was killed, I met with a group of 30 or so 
officers, mostly LAPD lieutenants and captains. A captain finally said to me, 
"Commissioner, we need you to say something. There needs to be some real form 
of gun control. No one is safe anymore. Officers cannot do their jobs. You 
represent law enforcement in this city. Something needs to come from you. 
Something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Something needs to be said. Something needs to be done. For all of the 
officers killed in the line of duty, for every victim of a drive-by shooting, 
every car-jacking. For the next victim of a senseless shooting. For you or for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 When the police tell us they are outgunned by the criminals and the 
drug-crazed, then it must follow that our whole society is outgunned, held 
hostage by those who would kill any one of us for no particular reason. Held 
hostage, too, by the National Rifle Assn., gun manufacturers and gun dealers, 
all of whom thrive at the expense of the rest of us. They are holding a gun to 
each of our heads. 
</P>
<P>
 We must rise up and overwhelm them together, stand up to this tyranny before 
it's too late.

WANT TO CUT LAWYERS' FEES? ROUTE JUSTICE TO 'INTERPLANET 1' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is former president of the Los 
Angeles County Criminal Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 40 years, practicing law in Los Angeles has depended on an automobile 
technology for mobility and a typewriter-paper technology for record-keeping. 
It is as archaic as circuit-riding judges on horseback going from town to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Northridge earthquake -- and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake virtually stopped the machinery of justice. Police stations and 
courthouses were either condemned or declared uninhabitable. Irreplaceable 
files were lost or destroyed. Damaged freeways and streets impeded travel to 
standing courthouses. The county may not be able to find the money to put all 
the pieces back together again. 
</P>
<P>
 But why rebuild a legal-judicial infrastructure that depends on the antiquated 
technology of the 1950s? This is the age of computerized communications. With 
the exception of actual trials or evidentiary hearings, everything in civil 
litigation could be done electronically by computers and telephone lines, and 
court time in criminal cases could be radically reduced. Since criminal filings 
last year surpassed 600,000 cases -- all done on paper -- the time saved would 
be significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than write out their numerous required crime reports in pencil, for 
example, officers could dictate them into cassettes, to be transcribed onto 
computerized forms by clericals. The clerical would then push a button to send 
all the reports to a computer console in the district attorney's office. If the 
deputy D.A., sitting at his console, chose to file the case, he or she would 
input the appropriate charges, add the formal complaint to the police reports, 
push a button, and the entire package would be transmitted to the clerk's 
office, given a case number and a court date. 
</P>
<P>
 It is high time for the law enforcement, legal and judicial community to start 
driving on "Interplanet 1," the much-vaunted information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Technologically, there is no reason why an attorney could not file a lawsuit, 
call his opposing counsel, serve the complaint by computer and commence the 
pretrial exchange of information, all without leaving his or her office. Court 
filing fees could be charged automatically by a credit- or debit-card system 
administered through the courts or the County Bar Assn. Thus, instead of 
clogging up the freeways with messengers running around to serve 30 different 
lawyers, the same result could be achieved with the push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
 Such suppliers of legal information as Mead Data Central, Thomsen Publishing 
or West Publishing Company already have mainframe computers and a history of 
storing cases and case documents. These companies could move from being a 
secondary source of data -- copying records from the courts -- to the primary 
source of data -- the holder of the data for the court itself (with secondary 
distribution rights to customers). Moreover, by charging attorneys for the 
service, private-sector funding could provide a major public record-keeping 
service, make its owners a profit, while saving lawyers and their clients large 
sums of money -- a "no lose" situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtrooms could be set up wherever telephone service existed, and courts 
could readily retrieve files from any location that had a computer and modem. 
Judges -- perish the thought -- could work from home, unless they happened to 
have a trial on calendar that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than dozens of civil litigators sitting around waiting to argue at "law 
and motion" calendars, judges could post their indicated rulings by computer, 
invite comment and then allow a 700-word computerized rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest roadblock to Interplanet 1 is technophobia, since lawyers are 
notoriously fearful of anything new. Fortunately, the IBM-clone computer world 
is learning with Microsoft's "Windows" what Apple's Steve Jobs figured out 
years ago with the Macintosh. Anyone can point and click -- the computer 
version of banging two rocks together to get fire. 
</P>
<P>
 If you point your computer "mouse" and click at the screen icon (picture) of 
an envelope going into a mailbox, the computer will transmit your mail 
electronically to the right electronic mailbox. If you point and click the 
"mouse" at, say, a "scale of justice" icon, the computer will electronically 
file your court papers, get a case number, pay the filing fee, obtain an 
electronic receipt from the court's computer and print out the transaction onto 
paper -- just to make you feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients -- and this won't make lawyers feel better -- will eventually find out 
that enormous, mahogany-paneled law offices are largely unnecessary, that 
partners bringing three young associates to court and charging the client 
quadruple time is similarly unnecessary and that most of the classic 70-hour 
lawyer workweek can be done from home. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of a telecommuting judge already at work is state Court of Appeals 
Justice Michael G. Nott, who resides mostly in Idaho, for family reasons, 
telecommutes by computer to his chambers in the Ronald Reagan State Office 
Building Downtown, confers with his colleagues by telephone and receives 
emergency writs and other papers by facsimile or electronic transmission. He 
flies to Los Angeles several days before oral arguments are scheduled to confer 
with his colleagues about anything requiring face-to-face encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 While there has been some suspicious judicial back-biting that Nott's physical 
absence detracts from his job, he produces just as many opinions as his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer marble-tiled hallways and more microchips will mean more cops on the 
street, lower lawyers' fees, less traffic and fewer courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man said, "Just Do It!"

TRENDS; NEW AGE ENTERS A NEW PHASE; CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT, BUT THE SOUND OF 
YANNI AND HIS SIMILARLY MINDED PALS -- NOT JAZZ, FOLK, ROCK OR CLASSICAL BUT AN 
EVOLVING MIX OF THEM ALL -- IS REACHING FAR BEYOND ITS OLD IMAGE OF AMBIENT 
MOOD MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, Don Heckman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an image straight out of 19th-Century Romanticism. Yanni, gorgeously 
dressed in pristine white, dark hair swirling, at the center of a formally clad 
symphony orchestra. Behind the orchestra, soft-toned lights capture rough stone 
walls, and above everything, bathed in what seems to be the metaphoric light of 
millennia, is the classic image of the Parthenon. 
</P>
<P>
 This is New Age music? 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the psycho-acoustic transformations, the crystal harmonies 
and spatial planetary rhythms? 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the electronic symphonies, the channeled chanting and the microtonal 
melodies? 
</P>
<P>
 New Age is in a New Phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn into this New Phase are musical refugees from the worlds of jazz, folk, 
rock and classical, a far-reaching collection of techno-oriented electronic 
synthesists and ethnic-music fusionists, as well as a mostly entrepreneurial 
cadre devoted to music as healing art. This musical conglomeration seems a far 
cry from what began in the early '80s as a pleasant form of ambient mood music, 
mostly locatable in bookstores and boutiques dedicated to astrology, 
divination, philosophy, incense and crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanni's virtuosic performance at the Parthenon in Athens with the Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra, taped last September for release as a video and 
laserdisc (the concert airs on PBS next month), is one of the most visible 
aspects of an increasingly catch-all musical category. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started rehearsing with the orchestra," the keyboardist recalls, "the 
musicians asked to see the music. I showed it to them and they said, 'That's 
not New Age.' And I said, 'I know. What would you call it?' And one woman said, 
'Well, how about progressive classical?' And I said, 'I don't think you're 
going to sell anything with that name.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Which defines the New Age dilemma in a nutshell. No one seems delighted with 
the term, yet everyone acknowledges its importance as a kind of umbrella 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've finally figured out that the main reason people don't like the 
term New Age is because it's the only musical category that isn't a musical 
term," adds David Lanz, a pianist whose persistent appearances at the top of 
the New Age charts attest to the salability of the romantic qualities in his 
music. "Jazz and rock and classical are pretty specifically musical. But when 
people say New Age , it brings up other images and philosophies that suggest 
other things to them. Like my mom, for one. She hates the term. 'You're not a 
New Age musician, are you, David?' she says." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, New Age often is defined by what it isn't, rather than by what it 
is. It isn't jazz, it isn't folk, it isn't rock, it isn't classical. Yet 
elements and influences from all these more precisely defined arenas 
occasionally sneak into the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the arrival of New Age-associated vocalists such as Enya, Sheila Chandra 
and Clannad, the only consistent similarity between the rapidly emerging 
stylistic variations was that all were instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Scott's "Music for Zen Meditation," released in 1964, is generally viewed 
as the New Age music progenitor, and much of the music that followed -- led by 
breakthrough recordings on the Windham Hill label -- followed similarly 
meditative patterns. But the addition of percussion and synthesized sounds -- 
especially in the music of Vangelis, Andreas Vollenweider, Mannheim Steamroller 
and Tangerine Dream -- began a continuing pattern of eclectic stylistic 
expansion, confusing some to the extent that the light-jazz and fusion formats 
of radio stations such as KTWV-FM, the Wave, are often mistakenly identified as 
New Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more bothersome to many current listeners are the lifestyle connotations 
that surround New Age music -- the images of crystals, the fragrance of 
incense, the implications of transformational healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some of the venues I play in," says musician-broadcaster John Tesh, 
"especially those that are distant from California, people seem to think that 
we're going to go onstage and play instrumental music and start channeling or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the top-level performers who have managed to transcend the 
category, Yanni would like to avoid the problem entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the truth is that I don't lose sleep over it," he says. "Creative 
people -- painters, writers, all artists -- prefer to avoid categories. No one 
likes being pigeonholed, because that implies that your next project will be in 
the same vein. And I want the freedom to move forward or backward or laterally 
or any direction I choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the existence of labels in every aspect of life, because it 
helps us find things. I happen to have been placed in this New Age category, 
but I think almost anyone who takes my album home couldn't care less if it's 
called New Age or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no denying the value of the category to listeners who know 
precisely where to go in a record store to find product by Yanni, Tesh, Enya, 
Lanz, et al. According to Dieter Wilkinson, national buyer for the Musicland 
Group of more than 1,000 retail outlets, New Age music -- having expanded well 
beyond the boutique market -- is selling more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not comparable to jazz or classical, which average between 7% and 8% 
each of overall record sales, in terms of market share," he explains, "but it 
is a significant category, and one which is now being driven especially well by 
the live performances of artists like Yanni, Kitaro, Tesh and Enya." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Tesh, Yanni is concerned that the label New Age may mislead listeners 
unfamiliar with his music. 
</P>
<P>
 " New Age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do," he says. 
"My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic. So in that 
sense, the label could be a detriment. But I think I'm finally getting past it. 
And I hope that the Parthenon video -- and the album, which will be released on 
Tuesday -- will give me some exposure over and above the New Age labeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanni, 39, has been a solid performer in the genre since the mid-'80s; his 
nine albums have sold 5.3 million copies in all. When "Live at the Acropolis" 
is released, Private Music, Yanni's record label, expects that it will hit gold 
status immediately. Based on the fact that his "Reflections of Passion" hit 1.8 
million and "Dare to Dream" is past 800,000 in sales, this seems to be a 
realistic appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 His prominence increased dramatically several years ago when he made talk-show 
appearances with actress Linda Evans to discuss their continuing romance. 
</P>
<P>
 The musician -- born Yanni Chryssomallis in Kalamata, in the southern part of 
Greece -- came to this country at the age of 18 to study psychology at the 
University of Minnesota. After earning a bachelor's degree, however, he became 
a member, co-writer and producer of the popular rock band Chameleon, before 
beginning his solo recording career in 1984 with the album "Optimystique." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone was even using the term New Age at that time," he 
recalls. "But the one thing that appears to have changed since the term came 
into use is the fact that the industry seems to be more open to instrumental 
music. For a long time, there was a connotation that instrumental music would 
not sell at all. But a few of us have managed to be successful enough to get a 
second look, even though, for the most part,we're viewed as a hard sell. But it 
doesn't make any difference to me, because instrumental music is what I do, and 
it's what I will continue to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tesh's high visibility as a host of "Entertainment Tonight" has paralleled his 
prominence as a composer of music for sporting events, with Emmy Awards for his 
themes for the Pan American Games in 1983, the Tour de France bicycle race in 
1987 and the World Track and Field Championships in 1991. Like Yanni, Tesh 
believes in the power of instrumental music but is quick to note its potential 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, there are plenty of charlatans around in the instrumental venue," he 
says, "people who put out an album of synthesizer music that winds up being 
something that you might want to be massaged to." 
</P>
<P>
 When the music is "happening," and especially during live performances, Tesh 
sees a fascinating impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that I've discovered," he says, "is that when you get a fan -- and 
they can be anybody between the ages of 18 and 65 -- they're usually your fan 
for life. It's not like that with pop music. Bam! One hit, the band is gone, 
and it's over. The fans we end up getting are much more loyal." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the important differences, Tesh believes, relates to the primary 
difference between vocal and instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
 "An instrumental song has to have the same musical elements that a vocal has 
to have to be successful," he says. "But once you hear a vocal song -- 
something about one lover missing another lover -- that's what the song is 
about, regardless of what the melody is. But an instrumental piece of music, 
with an attractive melody, that's put together well, can mean all sorts of 
different things to different people, at different times. That's why when my 
wife, Connie (Sellecca, the actress), listens to my tune 'Winter Song,' she 
gets depressed; and when my mother hears it, she wants to go out running." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanz, who started out in the business with a Steely Dan-type ensemble before 
turning to moody piano works, takes a somewhat different tack. Stressing the 
importance of "pop sensibilities," he tries to bring structure and content to 
his music in an effort to avoid the "mindless noodling" of some New Age music. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main goal as an artist is to communicate, and to me, communication means 
putting yourself out there," Lanz says. "So the intellectually detached, 
therapeutic-style music is not really what I do. I'm much more inclined to take 
the music out to the audience, and see what kind of reactions I can get. The 
important thing to me is just kind of hearing my inner self saying, 'Hey, try 
this; it feels good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Performers like Yanni, Kitaro (who did the music score for Oliver Stone's 
recent film "Heaven and Earth"), Lanz and Tesh have managed to stretch the New 
Age envelope in ways that have been appropriate to their own distinctive 
styles. Lesser-known artists continue to range across the wide spectrum of 
styles embraced by the category. 
</P>
<P>
 "Authentic New Age music," says Steven Halpern, who was recording 
transformationally oriented works long before New Age became a commercial 
phenomenon, "must continue to do what it's supposed to do: heal and reach out 
on an internal level." 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Michael Hoppe's highly praised recording "The Yearning," featuring 
flutist Tim Wheater, stresses a more external perspective. "When I worked with 
Vangelis," says former record producer Hoppe, "his sales were always relatively 
healthy. But until his music was successfully visualized by (the soundtrack for 
the film) 'Chariots of Fire,' he didn't really have a large audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoppe -- who will perform "The Yearning" with Wheater on Monday night at the 
Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills -- brought a visualization to his own music by 
basing the work on pictures of Hollywood celebrities such as Marlene Dietrich, 
Mary Pickford and Marion Davies, taken by his noted photographer grandfather, 
E. O. Hoppe. "I decided," he says, "that if I couldn't get my music into a 
film, I could at least have my grandfather's photographs as a visualization." 
Hoppe has included some of these photos in the album liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Barde, president of Backroads Music, a primary source for New Age 
recordings, is happy to stretch the rubric even further, to include a 
far-ranging collection of musical styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not opposed to the term New Age ," he says. "I think it's the best term 
that's available to umbrella all this music. But for me, it has to include 
mouth music, techno-tribal, ethnic fusion, all kinds of hybrids and so forth, 
as well as more familiar New Age regulars such as Steve Roach, Jonn Serrie, Ray 
Lynch and dozens of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Barde provides an example of an emerging new trend that reaches well beyond 
traditional New Age definitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of response lately on something called 'ambient house 
music,' " he says. "It's music that has grown out of the techno-rave parties, 
at which there is a chill-out room to get away from the incessant pounding of 
the rave music. In the chill-out rooms, they play space music with a dance 
beat. It kind of grew out of Brian Eno, but there are a lot of groups from 
England with names like Higher Intelligence Agency, Young American Primitive, 
etc. It's dance music with nature sounds and a lot of space-music elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few domestic releases so far, although Caroline Records has 
two compilations called 'Excursions in Ambiance,' with a bunch of groups you 
haven't heard of yet, but you might start to hear soon. Enigma and Deep Forest 
are some of the groups that have started to have some chart success and some 
recognition with this music." 
</P>
<P>
 Barde has no problem including ambient house music in his Northern 
California-based Heartbeats Music catalogue, which provides more than 45,000 
potential customers with recordings ranging from (in addition to the bigger 
names) Michael Stearns and Coyote Oldman to Mars Lasar and Eliza Gilkyson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not be Steven Halpern," he says with a laugh, "but to me, it's all 
part of New Age music. I mean, take a look at jazz. There's a word that has no 
controversy; it's completely accepted. But check out the jazz bin and tell me 
how Ornette Coleman and Joe Sample, or Michael Franks, have anything to do with 
each other. But it's all jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Hill, another veteran New Age producer and radio personality, has a 
slightly different view: "I think that every distinctively different genre 
forces you to listen in a different way. You don't listen to jazz the same way 
you listen to space music. Jazz asks for a response based on an appreciation 
and awareness of the genre's history. Obviously space music and New Age music 
were originally intended to create an ambience that can range from totally 
insipid to very, very profound." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's Hearts of Space radio service, heard on local public radio stations 
KUSC in Los Angeles, KCPB in Thousand Oaks and KFAC in Santa Barbara on Sunday 
nights at 11, has long been one of the primary media outlets for the changing 
sounds of New Age music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the way you can sum it up right now," he says, "is that New Age is 
being freely cross-pollinated by everybody. It may be that a neutral term like 
contemporary instrumental -- rather than New Age -- is about all you can hope 
for as a more descriptive label. But, even so, it too will eventually become a 
dumping-ground category." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, according to Hill, is that New Age music may have become so 
diversified, so all-inclusive and so eclectic, that whatever cachet it 
originally possessed has been dissipated by the effort to identify everything 
that isn't jazz, rock or classical within the category. But there is one saving 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a style or a fad, New Age may well be over," Hill says. "As a genre, in 
fact, it may actually be cutting back to its core audience. What it has done in 
the last decade, however, is to open the doors for a huge range of musical 
styles -- most of it recorded by small labels. And the good news is that 
independent music of all kinds -- labels, the whole melange of individual 
styles -- has never been better."  
</P>
<P>
 In his own way, Yanni agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever label you want to attach to what I do, the great value of the New 
Age identification is that it has made it possible for me to never lose my 
freedom with my music," he says. "Everything I've ever written has been totally 
without regard to sales value. And I was fortunate in the sense that when I 
started out, my record company allowed me to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, at this point, it's too late for somebody to manipulate me to do 
things any differently. And I guard that freedom carefully, because creativity 
and making music are the most important parts of my life."

<P>
 The Globe, a corner bar with the cozy informality of a '60s coffeehouse, may 
be the only collegiate hangout in America where the members of R.E.M. don't 
cause a stir. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead singer Michael Stipe, 34, is a special target because his lyrics offer a 
comfort and kinship that attract rock fans to him and the other members of the 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 In Athens, however, where the quartet has been based since the early '80s, 
fans pride themselves on respecting the musicians' right to a degree of 
normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, however, even the locals can't ignore the town's favorite 
sons, who have reigned for a decade as America's most acclaimed band. 
Throughout the bar eyes are on Stipe as he walks through the room and takes a 
seat at a window table where R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, 37, and bassist Mike 
Mills, 35, are waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 One fan in his early 20s follows Stipe, hovering a few feet away as he waits 
for a diplomatic moment to approach the table. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons for the special interest. The band hasn't been in Athens 
much in recent months, and there are questions about the status of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M. has not toured in more than four years and took off most of 1993 -- a 
"sabbatical" -- to get time away from rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group members got back together to explore new material last fall in 
New Orleans, there were no guarantees that they'd even make another album 
together, much less tour. If anyone believed after the year away that things 
were stale, he could extend the sabbatical or, in the extreme, call an end to 
R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sessions provided an avalanche of new material and the band -- rounded 
out by drummer Bill Berry, 35 -- was now back in Athens, working in its 
rehearsal hall on almost 40 tunes, a quarter of which will be on an album due 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about a tour? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the fan at the Globe wants to know as he finally steps toward the 
band's table. He's heard that R.E.M. is going to do a surprise show the 
following night at the local 40 Watt Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," the gregarious Buck says politely. "Not tomorrow night . . . but we are 
probably going to start playing again." 
</P>
<P>
 " All right ," the fan says eagerly, then heads back to his buddies across the 
room. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's Grammy ceremonies could represent another milestone in R.E.M.'s 
career. The group, which has won three Grammys previously, has been nominated 
for four more, including two that underscore dramatically the wide-ranging 
appeal of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 Its "Automatic for the People" is nominated in both the best album category, 
where it competes against such commercial pop mainstays as Whitney Houston and 
Billy Joel, and in the best alternative music category, where it is matched 
against such radical young rock forces as Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom in pop is that you can't be a mainstream favorite and an 
underground rock hero, but R.E.M. has never been known to accept the 
conventional wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 When R.E.M. didn't tour after its 1991 album "Out of Time," industry insiders 
said the group was jeopardizing its future. Without live shows to promote the 
new record, they said, sales would surely fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't work out that way. Thanks to the hugely successful hit single 
"Losing My Religion," the album sold 10 million copies worldwide -- more than 
twice as many as the group's previous best-selling release. And 1992's 
"Automatic for the People" has passed the 8-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgetting their original warnings, industry insiders now speak of R.E.M.'s 
break from touring as a shrewd move. Concert promoters are drooling over the 
prospects of another R.E.M. tour. Having been away from the road so long -- 
while enjoying its two most successful albums -- the band is a bigger draw than 
ever, the promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Stipe, in his first interview in nearly two years, laughs at the idea that the 
break from touring was a commercial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 All four group members agreed at the end of the 1989 "Green" tour that they 
needed a break, he says. The problem wasn't the usual suspects -- drugs or 
other self-destructive behavior. Rather, it was the accumulation of a decade on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally spent," he says, 
heavily bundled on this 35-degree night as he leaves the Globe. "I thought I 
would never tour again. The idea to stop touring wasn't any strategy. It was 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the "Automatic for the People" album was released three years 
later, however, everyone except Stipe seemed relatively open to touring. Yet 
his reservations were enough to cancel the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tour burnout is like an injury," Berry says of Stipe's continued resistance 
to going back on the road. "It takes time to heal and it takes longer for some 
people than others, but we recognized that." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 S urvival . 
</P>
<P>
 Most of rock's landmark outfits -- the Beatles and the Band, Creedence 
Clearwater Revival and the Doors -- failed to last even one decade as a 
recording unit. Cream soured after three years. The Sex Pistols never made it 
to a second album. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bands, usually with personnel changes, have continued into their second 
or third decades. Few, if any, however, have maintained a sense of creative 
urgency. The Rolling Stones have been an uneven proposition for years on 
record. The Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, the Allman Brothers -- among many -- no 
longer matter as recording forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet R.E.M. is a survivor, a group that, like U2, has defied almost 40 years of 
rock history by not only recording together for more than a dozen years now, 
but also continuing to make vital music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a remarkable story: a band that emerged in the early '80s as the leader 
of a loose federation of underground groups, from X to the Replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 These bands saw that there was a dignity and reward in simply making music 
with character and heart rather than in copying the soulless commercialism of 
such then-popular acts as Journey and Styx -- even if it meant playing small 
clubs and traveling around in vans, not chartered jets. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most of its peers remained part of the underground scene (and 
ultimately disbanded), R.E.M., thanks to the strength of its songwriting, 
ultimately gained mainstream acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's folk-dominated, guitar-accented style reflects an American rock 
purity that goes all the way back to the Byrds. The vitality and grace of its 
music and the arty introspection of its videos have influenced a whole 
generation of '80s and '90s bands, from such obvious parallels as 10,000 
Maniacs and the Lemonheads to a more subtle connection with Smashing Pumpkins 
and Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the old fans worried in 1987 when one of R.E.M.'s singles, "The One I 
Love," went into the national Top 10 and again the following year when the band 
left tiny I.R.S. Records in favor of giant Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight studio albums, however, R.E.M. stands with its original 
independence and vision intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana's outspoken Kurt Cobain, who is quick to attack corruption and 
laziness when he sees it in rock, is among those in awe of R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, they're the greatest," he told Rolling Stone recently. "They've dealt 
with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Miles Copeland, chairman of I.R.S. Records, lauds the group's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most bands start out saying they'll be true to their vision, but R.E.M. was 
one of those rare bands that meant what they said," Copeland says. "I've had 
plenty of bands come to me since then and say, 'We are prepared to handle our 
career R.E.M.'s way,' but they won't. They want money or success right away, 
and they'll eventually do anything that they think will get it for them, 
including changing their sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does R.E.M. continue to make acclaimed music, but it also uses its 
power with taste -- supporting social issues, from environmental concerns to 
safe sex, that may be the definition of political correctness today, but 
without the sense of self-congratulation that often accompanies celebrity 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards show, when the band won six awards for its 
"Losing My Religion" video, Stipe walked onstage to accept each award wearing a 
series of T-shirts, each with a different message printed on the front. Each 
time the group returned to the stage to accept another award, Stipe peeled off 
another shirt, revealing a different message: 
</P>
<P>
 Love Knows No Colors.  
</P>
<P>
 Wear a Condom.  
</P>
<P>
 Choice.  
</P>
<P>
 Handgun Control.  
</P>
<P>
 "I watch them and I'm amazed," says Lenny Waronker, president of Warner Bros. 
Records, which has released the band's records since 1989. "I have children who 
are now in rock bands, and I always end up using R.E.M. as the perfect example 
of the best way it works . . . how they force themselves to take chances 
artistically and pull together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret of R.E.M.? 
</P>
<P>
 The band's manager, Jefferson Holt, and attorney, Bertis Downs, try gamely to 
supply a blueprint for success during dinner at a crowded, upscale (for Athens) 
restaurant next to the band's rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who managed a North Carolina record store and booked concerts on the 
side when he met the band in 1980, speaks about "a miracle of chemistry between 
the four members." Downs, who was a young lawyer in Athens at the time and now 
also teaches entertainment law at the university, cites the way the band 
members realize that the music they make together is better than they could 
make with anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 After half an hour, Holt and Downs both realize they are just going around in 
circles in trying to define how R.E.M. has defied so many rock odds. With a 
sly, conspiratorial look on his face, Holt leans across the table and says, 
pointedly: "The truth is, I don't know ." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are clues to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews with all four band members, they make clear that 
certain guidelines have been present from the beginning -- many designed to 
prevent conflicts over matters of ego and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: shared songwriting credit and royalties on every song; the policy 
of a sole member having veto power over key career decisions, and remaining 
based in Athens, thus avoiding the pressures of a major recording center. Buck, 
who is now in the process of a divorce, moved away from Athens last year, but 
it was to Seattle, not Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M.'s imprint is virtually everywhere you step in the old downtown section 
of Athens, which is about 60 miles northeast of Atlanta and home of the 
University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the street from the Globe is Wuxtry Records, the store where Buck, 
then a clerk, and Stipe, a student at the university, met in 1979. Also nearby: 
the site of the abandoned Episcopal church where R.E.M. gave its first 
performance in 1980. The property now houses the Steeplechase Condominiums, 
named after the church's only remaining symbol: its steeple. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask enough people, you can also be directed to the house where Stipe 
lives and the house where Buck used to live. Both are within walking distance 
of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen O'Looney, the first woman mayor in the city's history, recalls dancing to 
R.E.M.'s music at local clubs in the early '80s, but she speaks most about the 
group members' contributions to the city -- how they have paid for a study 
about the future use of the downtown area and supplied the funds needed to keep 
the city's homeless shelter open. 
</P>
<P>
 She also thinks Athens is good for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps them stay connected to the everyday," she says, sitting in her 
office. "The other day, I went into the vacuum cleaner shop, and there was Bill 
Berry and he was talking to the man about how his vacuum cleaner worked . . . 
as serious as you can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was out in Los Angeles or someplace, he'd probably have someone else 
bring it in for him -- if he'd use a vacuum cleaner at all. They are very 
modest people. I've never seen them do a snobby thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't be a hero in a small town for all these years without some 
backlash, and someone has expressed displeasure with the group, on the wall 
across the parking lot from the rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Written in bold letters: REM Suk . 
</P>
<P>
 When a photographer asked about a good backdrop for a photo shoot, Peter Buck 
good-naturedly suggested that wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, if I grew up around here hearing about a band for all these years, I'd 
probably write that on the wall too," he says, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's just past noon the day after the Globe gathering and the band members are 
starting to arrive at their rehearsal hall on Claypool Street, a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the final day of two weeks of work on the songs for the new album. The 
sessions normally start around 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, the first to arrive, is checking some of the equipment in the main room 
of what was once a carriage house. The songs' working titles are written on a 
piece of paper -- playful titles like "Big Fuzz Bass," "Compulsion" and 
"Cranky" that will later be changed as the band selects which ones it wants and 
Stipe puts words to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Stipe writes most of R.E.M.'s lyrics, all three of the other members 
write the music. Though there is normally a primary writer on each song, all 
four are credited as co-writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the first and best decisions we ever made," says Mills. "When 
we started out, my thought was that when I wrote a song, the record should say 
it was written by me and the same for the others. But Peter said, 'No.' He said 
we are all four going to write these songs, so we should all get credit for 
them because it eliminates money as an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Buck, who reads about rock history as fervently as he listens to vintage 
recordings, knew about all the tension caused in groups by lucrative 
songwriting royalties. Creedence and the Band both broke up at least in part 
because of songwriting issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember reading an interview where the drummer for a famous '60s band 
said, 'The money's in songwriting, and I am going to get three of my songs on 
the next album no matter how bad they are,' " Buck explains. 
</P>
<P>
 The band members feel so strongly about partnerships that they also share 
certain royalties with Holt and Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The members of R.E.M. remained active between 1990 and 1992 despite the 
absence of touring. They recorded "Out of Time" and "Automatic for the People," 
did interviews in this country and acoustic radio-TV appearances in Europe, as 
well as "MTV Unplugged." 
</P>
<P>
 The real time off came last year. They didn't use the year to do things 
considered glamorous by rock 'n' roll terms. They used it to simply unwind 
after more than a dozen years immersed in the rock 'n' roll world.

 Berry and his wife bought a small cabin on a lake and oversaw the building of 
their new house in the countryside outside Athens. Mills traveled some but 
mostly stayed around Athens. One of his private treats: making it through a 
whole season with his local softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Stipe devoted most of his time to his photography hobby and the development of 
a film company, C-00, which specializes in feature films, videos and public 
service announcements. Though he says music remains his primary interest, the 
company is now showing added ambition. On tap is a movie, "Desperation Angels," 
which he will executive-produce with Oliver Stone. The film -- which Stipe 
describes as a "volatile American road movie about the wreckage during the 
Reagan-Bush years" -- will be directed by Jim McKay, a partner in C-00. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck fed his lifelong wanderlust by spending much of the time on the road, 
delighting in his anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I resent about being in a rock 'n' roll band is the 
regimentation," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to be in the situation where I can get up in the morning and throw 
stuff in a suitcase and go wherever I want -- and that's how I spent most of 
last year. It was great for me. I grew this huge beard and hitchhiked around 
Mexico -- and ate meals in places you could see them killing the chicken out 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The band members came back together last fall for a week at Daniel Lanois' New 
Orleans studio, where they had worked on "Automatic," to see what they had for 
a new album. It was a heady time: pieces of almost two dozen songs -- most of 
them in a harder rock sensibility than the slower, moody currents of "Automatic 
for the People." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when they agreed to regroup in Athens to work more on the material 
before going into a Miami studio in April to begin recording. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck reflects the enthusiasm of the entire band these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt we'd fall victim to things like ego and greed," he says after 
the rehearsal. "The main thing I worried about is that we would run out of 
songs someday. That's why it was so thrilling when we got together in New 
Orleans. I could see that we had the new songs. . . . Taking this time off was 
the best thing that could have happened." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 It's been almost nine years since Michael Stipe sat on the steps of one of the 
buildings on the University of Georgia campus and defined his goals in R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just before the release of "Fables of the Reconstruction," the group's 
third album. Even then, there were questions about whether R.E.M. would be able 
to retain its values and vision amid the increasing national acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest goal isn't to be No. 1," Stipe said at the time. "My goal is to be 
able to think in 10 years from now that I'll be able to listen to our third 
album and not be embarrassed by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded of that quote, Stipe rolls his own cigarette -- regular tobacco -- as 
he sits on a couch in an otherwise bare room adjacent to the band's rehearsal 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, there's still two more years before I can really tell you, but I still 
feel pretty good about that album," he says good-naturedly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days of the band, Stipe was extremely shy and avoided interviews, 
which many saw as an attempt to build mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still something enigmatic about him, partly because he, like his 
friend Natalie Merchant, steadfastly draws a curtain around his private life. 
Yet he's far more relaxed than in the old days, and he talks freely about the 
band and even his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm the trickster that people want to make me out to be or the 
strategist," Stipe says in his soft-spoken tone. "I think all of us have 
certain standards we try to bring to the band and we like to change the music 
and keep people a bit off guard, but it's not like we sit around and say, 'How 
can we come up with something today that is incredibly manipulative and clever? 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I don't think that 'being clever' is what is important in music or 
in the arts. What's important to me is conveying feelings and ideas. . . . And 
cleverness sometimes gets in the way of real feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, Stipe once seemed guilty of putting cleverness over passion -- as 
he sang words that seemed like little more than riddles and made them even more 
mysterious by slurring them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, there is a directness, revelation and vulnerability in the 
lyrics to songs such as "Man on the Moon" and "Everybody Hurts," a stark ballad 
that seeks to comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was written for teen-agers basically, saying don't kill yourself," he 
says of the latter tune. "My sister is a teacher and someone she knows, who is 
15, tried to kill himself, and it led to this song. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to write something that would appeal to someone who is having 
trouble . . . so that if they hear the song, they might be able to say, 'God, 
that's me,' and feel some sense of hope or that someone might care about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stipe pauses when asked about any new goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have any ambition at all, there is a point in a band's career that you 
begin thinking about making the perfect record," he says. "I don't know if you 
ever do that, but I do feel good about what we've done so far and I'm happier 
now than I've ever been with the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got back together, we were all in the same place. We all wanted to 
kick butt musically . . . get the energy back. . . . But there's going to come 
a point where we get back together and the passion is gone; I hope we have the 
courage to stop."

GRAMMY TIME; THE CRYSTAL BALL & THE MERIT AWARDS; WHO WILL WIN; STING MAY NEED 
A BODYGUARD FOR HIS ALBUM OF THE YEAR AWARD FOR 'TEN SUMMONER'S TALES.' BUT 
DON'T CRY JUST YET FOR WHITNEY HOUSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN, Paul Grein is a Los Angeles-based writer who has forecast the 
Grammys for Calendar since 1981. Last month he correctly predicted four of the 
five best single nominees and three of the five best album finalists. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Grammys were based mostly on record sales, as critics sometimes charge, 
"The Bodyguard" soundtrack would have a lock on the prize for best album when 
the awards are presented on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The record -- featuring six tracks by the movie's star, Whitney Houston -- has 
outsold the four other finalists combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, "The Bodyguard" is likely to lose to Sting's critically admired "Ten 
Summoner's Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Grammys are based strictly on musical merit after all? 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 But another outside consideration is also boosting Sting's chances: Image . 
The voters admire Sting's music, but they also like his cool, classy persona. 
The English musician, who has won 10 Grammys since 1981, is the kind of 
sophisticated, intelligent artist voters can feel good about honoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Image isn't supposed to enter into voting decisions, but it often does. After 
all, the 8,000 voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts & 
Sciences care about how their choices are received. They don't want a repeat of 
the grousing that followed their best album citations to Christopher Cross and 
Toto in the early '80s. They know that a Sting victory will be popular with 
critics, the industry and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, however, won't be going home empty-handed. She's likely to win three 
awards, including the other top prize, best single. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are my predictions: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Album -- The nominees: Donald Fagen's "Kamakiriad," Houston's "The 
Bodyguard," Billy Joel's "River of Dreams," R.E.M.'s "Automatic for the 
People," Sting's "Ten Summoner's Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bodyguard" wouldn't be the first soundtrack to be voted best album: 
"Saturday Night Fever" won in 1979. But "Fever" represented a major cultural 
phenomenon -- disco. "The Bodyguard" represented little more than expert 
cross-media marketing, and half the tracks are by various artists with little 
connection to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M.'s album came out at the very beginning of the eligibility year -- Oct. 
1, 1992, to Sept. 30, 1993 -- which will probably hurt its chances. Joel hasn't 
won a Grammy since 1981, so it would be a big leap for him to suddenly take the 
top prize. And Fagen's collection had little staying power: Released in May, it 
was off the charts by October. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Sting's fourth solo studio collection as the probable winner. 
Added tip-offs: "Ten Summoner's Tales" is also represented in the producing and 
engineering categories, and Sting's video of the same name is up for best 
long-form video. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Single -- The nominees: Peabo Bryson & Regina Belle's "A Whole New 
World," Houston's "I Will Always Love You," Joel's "The River of Dreams," 
Sting's "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You," Neil Young's "Harvest Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston has been the front-runner to win this award virtually since the day "I 
Will Always Love You" was released. The steel-belted ballad has everything that 
Grammy voters prize in a best single winner: It's sleek and well-crafted, 
dramatic and anthemic, and it was a big hit in a variety of radio formats. 
Besides, Grammy voters like Houston, who has won twice in the pop female 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 The only possible hitch is that enough voters will rebel at going along with 
such an obvious choice and will instead root for an underdog. That could give 
Young's gentle "Harvest Moon" a chance at one of the biggest upsets in Grammy 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballad is from Young's album of the same name, which was the spiritual 
successor to his classic 1972 album "Harvest." That should give it a comfort 
factor with Grammy voters, many of whom came of age musically in the late '60s 
and early '70s. (That helps explain why several other veterans from that period 
-- including Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and Bette Midler -- have been big 
recent winners.) 
</P>
<P>
 Best Song -- The nominees for this songwriter's award: Young's "Harvest Moon," 
Jim Steinman's "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)," Sting's "If I 
Ever Lose My Faith in You," Joel's "The River of Dreams," Alan Menken & Tim 
Rice's "A Whole New World." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Will Always Love You" would have won in a landslide, but it was 
disqualified because Dolly Parton's original version, a country hit in 1974 and 
1982, achieved prominence before this eligibility year. That's a lucky break 
for "A Whole New World," an instant standard that won the Oscar last year for 
best original song. 
</P>
<P>
 Best New Artist -- Nominees: Belly, Blind Melon, Toni Braxton, Digable 
Planets, SWV (Sisters With Voices). 
</P>
<P>
 Braxton has a big advantage over the four groups: This award usually goes to a 
solo artist or a group with a strong lead personality. Besides, Braxton has 
been hailed as the next Anita Baker, who has scooped up seven Grammys since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the likely winners in key performance categories: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female -- A trained chimp could guess this one -- 
Houston's "I Will Always Love You." Also nominated: Mariah Carey's 
"Dreamlover," Shawn Colvin's "I Don't Know Why," k.d. lang's "Miss Chatelaine," 
Tina Turner's "I Don't Wanna Fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Male -- Sting's "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You" has a slight edge in an 
extremely competitive race. But many voters will support Joel ("The River of 
Dreams"), a Grammy favorite son who has been going home empty-handed in recent 
years, and Rod Stewart ("Have I Told You Lately"), a Rock and Roll Hall of 
Famer who has never won a Grammy. Also nominated: Boy George's "The Crying 
Game," Aaron Neville's "Don't Take Away My Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Group or Duo -- As a best single finalist, Bryson & Belle's "A Whole New 
World" is likely to win -- unless the four male-female duets split the vote, 
allowing R.E.M. ("Man on the Moon") to sneak in. Also: Celine Dion & Clive 
Griffin's "When I Fall in Love," Barbra Streisand & Michael Crawford's "The 
Music of the Night," Vanessa Williams & Brian McKnight's "Love Is." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Pop -- Streisand has been so visible and productive in the past 
year that she's a shoo-in to pick up her ninth Grammy, for "Back to Broadway." 
Also: Tony Bennett's "Steppin' Out," Rosemary Clooney's "Do You Miss New 
York?," Crawford's "A Touch of Music in the Night," Diane Schuur's "Love 
Songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Solo -- A year ago, who would have thought that Meat Loaf, then a 
semi-forgotten '70s relic, would be the favorite to beat Sting, Peter Gabriel 
and Neil Young? But the singer made a stunning comeback with "I'd Do Anything 
for Love (But I Won't Do That)," which was inescapable during the voting 
period. Gabriel ("Steam") is strong, but the entries by Sting ("Demolition 
Man") and Young ("All Along the Watchtower") are side projects that aren't 
included on their latest albums. Also: Lenny Kravitz's "Are You Gonna Go My 
Way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Group or Duo -- Aerosmith has been around long enough to have acquired 
stature, but it's still regarded as a credible and contemporary act. That's why 
the band is expected to win here for the second time in four years, with 
"Livin' on the Edge." That is, if the voters can resist the chance to 
simultaneously salute Bob Dylan, Young, Clapton, George Harrison, Tom Petty and 
Roger McGuinn -- all nominated for "My Back Pages," a track from a Dylan 
tribute album. Soul Asylum's "Runaway Train" is also a strong entry, though the 
socially conscious song, written by group leader David Pirner, will have a 
better chance in the rock song category. Also: Blind Melon's "No Rain," Spin 
Doctors' "Two Princes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard Rock -- AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," a track from its recent "Live" album, 
has a huge advantage -- it was the title song of the band's first blockbuster 
album in 1979. That familiarity factor should help it overcome the 
hot-new-thing buzz associated with Smashing Pumpkins ("Cherub Rock") and Stone 
Temple Pilots ("Plush"). Also: Living Colour's "Leave It Alone," Robert Plant's 
"Calling to You." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal -- Keep your eye on White Zombie's "Thunder Kiss '65." The band's 
million-selling album is still going strong, while its rivals' albums have 
dropped off the charts. Also: Iron Maiden's "Fear of the Dark," Megadeth's 
"Angry Again," Ozzy Osbourne's "I Don't Want to Change the World," Suicidal 
Tendencies' "Institutionalized." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative -- R.E.M.'s best album nomination is the tip-off: The critically 
acclaimed band, which won this award two years ago with "Out of Time," will 
repeat with "Automatic for the People." Also: Belly's "Star," Nirvana's "In 
Utero," Smashing Pumpkins' "Siamese Dream," U2's "Zooropa." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Female -- Houston will win her first R&B Grammy with her remake of Chaka 
Khan's "I'm Every Woman." Newcomer Toni Braxton ("Another Sad Love Song") is 
her strongest rival, but Arista Records, which distributes both artists, would 
probably rather see Houston win. This was Houston's year, and a win here would 
build up her R&B credibility. Braxton, already assured of an award for best new 
artist, will have other years. Janet Jackson ("That's the Way Love Goes") is 
destined to be a bridesmaid in this category again. Also: Aretha Franklin's 
"Someday We'll All Be Free," Patti LaBelle's "All Right Now." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Male -- Luther Vandross strikes the right Grammy balance of class and 
commercialism. So he's likely to take this award for the third time in four 
years, with his soulful remake of the Bee Gees' "How Deep Is Your Love." Also: 
Babyface's "For the Cool in You," Tevin Campbell's "Can We Talk," Ray Charles' 
"A Song for You," Teddy Pendergrass' "Voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 R&B Group or Duo -- Sade's "No Ordinary Love" was featured in the hit movie 
"Indecent Proposal" (and in the film's ubiquitous ads), which gives it an edge 
in terms of familiarity. (Now will someone explain why this lilting, jazzy 
ballad is considered R&B ?) Also: Boyz II Men's "Let It Snow," Earth, Wind & 
Fire's "Sunday Morning," En Vogue's "Give It Up, Turn It Loose," Tony Toni 
Tone's "Anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
 Rap Solo -- Many Grammy voters are wary of rap, but even they had to notice 
that Dr. Dre ("Let Me Ride") found mainstream acceptance last year -- including 
a Rolling Stone cover and a hit album that outsold Sting and Neil Young 
combined. Also: LL Cool J's "Stand by Your Man," MC Lyte's "Ruffneck," 
Paperboy's "Ditty," Sir Mix-a-Lot's "Just Da Pimpin' in Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rap Group or Duo -- How big a handicap is a murder charge in Grammy voting? 
We're about to find out. Dr. Dre & Snoop Doggy Dogg's million-selling hit 
"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" would have been the front-runner here, but Snoop's 
murder charge will probably sink its chances. As a result, Arrested Development 
will probably win here for the second year in a row, with "Revolution," which 
was recorded for Spike Lee's movie "Malcolm X." Also: Cypress Hill's "Insane in 
the Brain," Digable Planets' "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)," Naughty by 
Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Female -- Nashville voters like the way that sassy Mary-Chapin 
Carpenter ("Passionate Kisses") has shattered the traditional image of the 
country music queen. So she's likely to become the first woman to ever take 
this award home three years in a row. Her only serious competition is Wynonna 
Judd ("Only Love"). Also: Emmylou Harris' "High Powered Love," Tanya Tucker's 
"Soon," Trisha Yearwood's "Walkaway Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Male -- Alan Jackson's spirited "Chattahoochee," which was voted best 
single in October by the Country Music Assn., is the entry to beat. Also: Garth 
Brooks' "Ain't Going Down (Til the Sun Comes Up)," George Jones' "I Don't Need 
Your Rockin' Chair," Aaron Neville's "The Grand Tour," Dwight Yoakam's "Ain't 
That Lonely Yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Group or Duo -- Brooks & Dunn, country's hottest duo since the Judds, 
have an edge with "Hard Workin' Man," the title track from their second album. 
Also: Confederate Railroad's "Trashy Women," Diamond Rio's "In a Week or Two," 
Little Texas' "God Blessed Texas," Sawyer Brown's "All These Years."*

GETTING THEIR WORDS' WORTH; THEY'RE 30 YEARS INTO IT AND SOUTH COAST REPERTORY 
ISN'T BROADWAY, BUT IT IS REGARDED AS A 'PLAYWRIGHT HEAVEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Jan Herman is a staff writer for The Times' Orange County 
edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Robards had never been to South Coast Repertory. He also had only a 
vague idea of where it is and couldn't get its name quite right. But with great 
charm and sincerity the actor was touting the theater one day last year to a 
roomful of would-be actors gathered at Kennedy Center in Washington for the 
American College Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Robards kept calling it "West Coast Repertory out there in Los 
Angeles," he got South Coast's reputation right. He knew that the theater is 
committed to staging new plays. He knew that many of them have been noticed in 
New York, because they get second productions there. And so his career advice 
was simple. "Go west," he said, echoing Horace Greeley. "Go to West Coast 
Repertory." 
</P>
<P>
 New York playwright Richard Greenberg, who had the way to South Coast pointed 
out to him in 1986 by its longtime dramaturge, Jerry Patch, understands the 
confusion of names. "It's hard to keep any of them straight," Greenberg said in 
a recent interview at the Costa Mesa theater, where his new play, "Night and 
Her Stars," premieres Friday on the SCR Mainstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents still call this place West Coast Repertory, and they've actually 
been here. Before I became part of it, all I knew was it was very generous. I'd 
heard it liked to take on playwrights, give commissions and put on first 
productions by a lot of interesting writers. That's all I knew. I never knew 
what was San Diego (Repertory Theatre), what was La Jolla (Playhouse), what was 
South Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Craig Lucas, probably the New York playwright most closely identified 
with South Coast, recalls never having heard of the now-29-year-old Orange 
County theater company before being contacted by Patch for the first time in 
1984. "I remember asking Christopher Durang about them," he said. "Thank God, I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' plays quickly came to dominate the SCR schedule with five productions 
in four consecutive seasons, 1985 to 1988. There were revivals of "Reckless" 
and "Blue Window," world premieres of "Three Postcards" (with music by Craig 
Carnelia) and "Prelude to a Kiss" (before it went to Broadway and became a 
Hollywood movie) and a reprise of "Marry Me a Little" (a chamber musical 
created from trunk songs by Stephen Sondheim). 
</P>
<P>
 "I received a commission from South Coast when nobody was paying much 
attention to me," Lucas, 43, recounted in a recent interview from his home in 
Putnam County, just north of New York City. "I was not a known writer at all 
when we talked about a commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The New York Times had completely lambasted my first play, 'Missing Persons.' 
I couldn't even get it published. Unfortunately, theater in New York lives and 
dies by their reviews. 'Reckless' went unreviewed by them. And 'Blue Window' 
received an absolutely scathing review. . . . So I was terribly grateful for 
the support I got at South Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 David Margulies says a commission for "Sight Unseen" turned his career around. 
When South Coast decided to back him, he was seriously thinking of giving up on 
theater. He'd already written a dozen plays, many produced but not much noticed 
(including one at the late, lamented Los Angeles Theatre Center and one at the 
Back Alley Theater). 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe it to South Coast that the script for 'Sight Unseen' exists at all," 
Margulies, 39, said from New Haven, Conn., where he teaches at the Yale School 
of Drama. "Their commission came when I was getting involved in screenwriting 
and wondering if I would continue with plays. It was quite a boon, a vote of 
confidence. It ended up changing my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after its South Coast premiere in September, 1991, "Sight Unseen" was 
remounted by the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York and transferred to a 
commercial house, where it ran for seven months in 1992 as a smash hit of the 
Off Broadway season. The play, about the travails of a successful painter, was 
also nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this season "Sight Unseen" is second only to David Mamet's "Oleanna" 
as the most-produced new American play, with 16 professional stagings at 
theaters across the country, according to Dramatists Play Service, which 
licenses the rights for both plays. ("Oleanna" has 21.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran South Coast playgoers -- there are 19,730 subscribers for this season, 
the theater's 30th -- have gotten used to seeing productions polished to a high 
sheen. Technical excellence, underwritten this season by a $5.8-million budget, 
has long been one of the theater's hallmarks. The core acting company of five 
founding and two resident artists is top-notch and is regularly surrounded by 
guest performers of equal caliber. The resident and guest designers brought in 
from all over the country also rank among the best working anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But when South Coast won a special Tony Award for regional theaters in 1988, 
it was largely in recognition of its commitment to new plays. Of 296 
productions since its first ramshackle touring show, staged from the back of a 
station wagon in the fall of 1964, no fewer than 53 productions have been world 
premieres. The overwhelming majority of those premieres -- 45 -- have come 
during the last 15 seasons, basically since South Coast moved into the sleek 
theater complex that houses its 507-seat Mainstage and 161-seat Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are more revealing when compared with those of Southern 
California's other three largest not-for-profit theaters -- all regional Tony 
winners, as well -- the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles (with a $10.8-million 
budget), the Old Globe Theatre ($8.4 million) and the La Jolla Playhouse ($4.6 
million), both in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper has produced 48 world premieres since its founding in 1967, 
including 29 during the last 15 seasons. The Old Globe has produced 31 world 
premieres since its founding in 1935, including 22 in the last 15 seasons. The 
La Jolla Playhouse has produced 15 since current operations began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For Greenberg, "Night and Her Stars" represents his second South Coast 
commission. The play dramatizes the TV quiz-show scandals of the late '50s and 
their chief real-life protagonists, contestants Charles Van Doren and Herb 
Stempel and producer Dan Enright. Written in prose but disguised on the page as 
blank verse, it is a cautionary tale about the twin seductions of money and 
fame and the corruption of basic moral values by corporate greed and 
all-too-human venality. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's first commission, in 1987, resulted in "The Extra Man," a very 
different kind of work about a group of unhappy Manhattanites buffeted by urban 
Angst . It premiered at South Coast in 1991. By then he had already gained 
national attention with his best-known play, "Eastern Standard," a witty comic 
satire about the post-crash '80s that bowed at Seattle Repertory in 1988 and 
made a well-publicized journey to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This theater has been like my convalescence," said Greenberg, 35, who wrote 
"Night and Her Stars" while recovering last year from Hodgkin's disease. "I 
think of my convalescence as being the way I always wanted to work. It was a 
utopian environment. I had no responsibilities, except to get chemo and write." 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, theater is about creativity," said producing artistic director David 
Emmes, 56, who co-founded South Coast with artistic director Martin Benson, 55. 
"It's about transforming a play from a piece of dramatic literature into 
something alive on the stage, and there's nothing more fulfilling than doing it 
with a new play. You're there at the inception. The form hasn't been created 
before. It's exciting to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, alone among comparable resident theaters anywhere in the country, 
South Coast has built up a $1.4-million endowment for exclusive use by its 
play-development program. Each year, income earned by the endowment helps 
underwrite the Collaboration Laboratory and its offshoots, the Hispanic 
Playwrights Project and the NewSCRipt readings for unproduced plays. A total of 
45 commissions have been awarded to 36 writers largely since the mid-'80s, all 
financed by the endowment. Amounts vary, but the commissions generally range 
between $6,000 and $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very smart about how to support their commissioning process," 
Taper producing director Robert Egan said. "We allocate money and try to 
commission four or five writers a year. But a more formalized program with a 
budget has existed for only the last five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Globe generally does not offer commissions. "We have done some, but 
it's not a regular thing," spokeswoman Charlene Baldridge said. The theater 
supports emerging writers through a Play Discovery Program that invites scripts 
and provides public readings. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Jolla Playhouse commissions plays "when the money is available," 
spokesman Josh Ellis said. "We have done it in the past and we expect to 
continue doing it in the future." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, South Coast's commitment to new plays comes not just from 
Emmes and Benson (the longest-running partnership among leaders of the nation's 
resident theaters), but from a behind-the-scenes team that may fairly be dubbed 
"The Jerry and John Show." It stars dramaturge Jerry Patch and literary manager 
John Glore and is one show South Coast playgoers rarely get to see except in 
playbill essays. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the ones who scout the talent, recruit the writers, and deal with 
their scripts and their agents, sometimes going so far as to get them agents 
when they don't have them. And the duo's performance earns them raves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry and John are fabulous," said Helen Merrill, an independent New York 
agent who represents Christopher Durang. "I'm a fan of both of them. They 
really serve the artist, and they're exceedingly well-informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Parker, the William Morris agent who represents Beth Henley, concurs: 
"They're two of the best literary managers in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Emmes: "They deserve much of the credit for what happens at this 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Patch, 51, joined South Coast in 1967. Tall and lanky, he has an outgoing 
manner, loves tennis and says he wishes "people would just as soon forget I was 
born and raised in Burbank." For the last 14 years South Coast has staged his 
adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 Glore, 38, came to South Coast in 1984 from Washington's Arena Stage, where he 
spent three years after graduating from the Yale School of Drama. Tall and 
taciturn, he too is a writer. In 1990 his 10-minute play "What She Found There" 
won the Heideman Award at the Actors Theatre of Louisville. And earlier this 
season South Coast produced the world premiere of his first full-length play, 
"The Company of Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "I take great pride that we do a lot of new plays," Patch said. "It has become 
fashionable in the last 15 years, more so than it was in the late '70s, when 
David started sending me around the country to go find writers and tell them we 
wanted to be their theater. David and Martin make the ultimate decisions on 
what gets produced. But I have to tell you, at most theaters you don't get the 
kind of leeway John and I get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Greenberg: "What's great about Jerry is that there's never an edge of 
superiority in the way he deals with you. He doesn't infantilize you. That's 
just what they don't do here. They don't treat you like the idiot playwright 
who somehow accidentally managed to generate something that interests them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes in my early exposure to 'development' at other theaters, I found 
that it was a euphemism for giving people with no specific talent something to 
do. Everybody had an opinion. I've seen people whose plays have been 
'developed' to death. They'd been given so much authoritative and contradictory 
advice that they had their instincts trampled. I haven't seen that happen 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago playwright Roger Rueff goes further. He calls South Coast "playwright 
heaven." Rueff, 37, never had a play produced before South Coast premiered his 
"Hospitality Suite" in 1992. At the end of last season the theater promptly 
gave him another premiere for his second play, "So Many Words." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in January, South Coast offered Rueff his first commission before it 
even learned that "So Many Words" had been named the 1993 winner of the Ted 
Schmitt Award by the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle. That accolade honors the 
best play to receive its world premiere in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, part of the reason I call South Coast playwright heaven has a lot 
to do with something Jerry Patch told me the very first time we met," Rueff 
said from his home in Naperville, Ill., a Chicago suburb. "When I got off the 
plane, he picked me up at the airport. I got into his car, and the first thing 
he said to me was, 'I just want you to know that at South Coast Rep the 
playwright is king.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That meant nobody was going to try to force me to write anything I didn't 
want (during rewrites). He said, 'We're going to be very, very frank with how 
we feel. But ultimately the decision is yours. Nobody is going to piss and moan 
if it doesn't turn out the way they want.' That really relaxed me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some playwrights have objected to their treatment, though. Ellen McLaughlin 
did it most conspicuously in 1988 when South Coast canceled a scheduled world 
premiere of her play "Infinity's House" on the grounds that she hadn't done the 
rewrites they wanted. She cried foul in the press. But South Coast stuck to its 
decision, although it meant returning a $64,000 grant from the Fund for New 
American Plays that was to help finance the production. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast also has been criticized for the fact that the theater has never 
produced the work of an African American playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Benson: "I must confess we've never had an agenda to go out and find 
black writers. . .the way we have, say, with Hispanic writers." But that may 
change. "It's something we're going to have to take a look at," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some agents sniff that South Coast is too parochial about its role 
as a not-for-profit theater. Despite its evident success, they would like it to 
follow the lead of the Taper, the Old Globe and La Jolla when it comes to 
participating in the commercial arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The artistic directors of those theaters often work in New York, directing 
plays they first staged at home. This has earned them a following among 
commercial producers, who not only can give new plays an extended life on the 
stage but can attract lucrative offers from other media. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper's Gordon Davidson just directed an Off Broadway production of 
"Unfinished Stories," which opened Feb. 16. He initially directed it at the 
Taper in 1992. The Old Globe's Jack O'Brien is directing "Damn Yankees" on 
Broadway, with an opening date set for Thursday. He directed it last fall at 
the Old Globe. La Jolla's Des McAnuff won the 1993 Tony for directing "The 
Who's Tommy" on Broadway, after staging it at La Jolla the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmes and Benson have never directed at any professional theater except South 
Coast. And though they are pleased when a play first mounted in their theater 
gets a second production elsewhere, the play must make the journey on its own. 
They do not involve themselves or the theater's resources in becoming a 
launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really knows who those two gentlemen are," said one agent who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "They don't have a strong image in the business. 
Everybody knows who Gordon Davidson is. They know the Old Globe is Jack 
O'Brien. They know who Des McAnuff is." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Peretzian, a William Morris agent in Los Angeles, concurred. "South 
Coast is happy to stay in its little corner," said Peretzian, who sold the 
movie rights to Craig Lucas' "Prelude to a Kiss" for $1 million. "They put on 
fine productions for their community. But, of course, Craig's play didn't sell 
until it went to New York." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Emmes flatly rejects the imputation that unless South Coast 
helps serve commercial interests it is doing anything less than it should. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get involved with commercial producers, you end up four-walling your 
theater," he said. "The money people come in and tell you to get lost. It 
becomes the out-of-town tryout. All you have to do is turn out the lights when 
you leave. We've never sought validation in New York, and we don't need it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Emmes and Benson are also opposed to staging co-productions with other 
nonprofit theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inevitably," Emmes said, "decisions are taken not for the best production 
here, but for the best production wherever it's going. That's not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no rule is made to go unbroken. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast's most ambitious project for next season will be the world 
premiere of Lucas' "God's Heart," to be done in cooperation with Lincoln Center 
Theater in New York. The Lincoln Center company, which was instrumental in 
developing the play, will stage the subsequent production. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmes and Glore have attended recent workshop readings in New York, and Glore 
has been giving Lucas advice on the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Benson: "We're excited about working on another premiere with Lucas. Our 
relationship with Craig is a prime example of what we always wanted South Coast 
to be -- the artistic home for great writers. It will be a great way to 
celebrate our second 30 years."*

ARCHITECTURE; REVIEW; PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED; GIVEN THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND 
RENOWN OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, AND THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS SINCE HE 
DIED, IT'S SURPRISING THAT HIS MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART 
BREAKS SO LITTLE NEW GROUND

 Ask any American to name the most famous architect he or she can think of and 
chances are good that the answer will be Frank Lloyd Wright. Chances are, in 
fact, that his will be the only name you get. Which is just the way Wright 
would have wanted it. He was a formidable figure with a Barnum-like flair for 
publicity, a turbulent personal life, and a seemingly endless, phoenix-like 
career: He was born in 1867, began working in the 1880s, appeared washed up in 
the 1920s, made a stunning comeback in the 1930s, and was still at it, more 
famous than ever, when he died in 1959. He designed nearly 1,000 buildings, 
about half of which were built. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Wright was a big-thinking iconoclast whose best buildings 
still surprise us: the iconic and ever-controversial Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum, the innovative headquarters for S. C. Johnson & Son in Racine, Wis., 
and the extraordinary Edgar Kaufmann house in Pennsylvania, better known as 
Fallingwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was the first architect to "break the box" of traditional architecture. 
His early Midwest houses, designed mostly for middle-class, progressive 
clients, revolutionized the single-family house and anticipated International 
Style modernism. His own houses in Wisconsin and Arizona, both called Taliesin, 
seamlessly integrated architecture and nature. Wright designed an atrium hotel 
long before John Portman, and a passive solar house in the 1940s. This country 
had never seen his like before, and probably never will again. But now, 40 
years after Wright's death, what have we learned from the legend? 
</P>
<P>
 An ambitious presentation of the architect's work can be found in the 
exhibition "Frank Lloyd Wright: Architect" at the Museum of Modern Art through 
May 10. Organized by Terence Riley, chief curator of the museum's Department of 
Architecture and Design, and Peter Reed, assistant curator, in cooperation with 
the Frank Lloyd Wright Archive in Scottsdale, Ariz., it is, as Ed Sullivan used 
to say, a really big show. It covers 190 of Wright's built and unbuilt designs 
from all points in his long career. The visitor can pore over 350 drawings, 
many by Wright himself, 30 scale models, 126 photographs, architectural 
fragments such as leaded windows, sculptures and decorative concrete blocks, 
and six full-scale reconstructions of walls from various Wright buildings, 
including one from the Storer house, one of Wright's "textile block" concrete 
houses built in Los Angeles in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 There are wonderful things here: a plaster model, long believed lost, of 
Wright's Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, a huge, elaborately ornamented building that 
survived the city's devastating 1923 earthquake only to succumb to the wrecking 
ball in 1968; a cutaway model of the S. C. Johnson offices, showing the soaring 
central space supported by slender concrete columns whose lily-pad-like 
capitals seemed to support nothing but a ceiling of pure light; lush pencil 
drawings in Wright's own flowing style; a lovely photograph made in 1896 by 
Wright of "Romeo and Juliet," an elegant windmill he designed for his aunts in 
Wisconsin. The wall reconstructions remind us how fearlessly imaginative Wright 
was (although not always entirely successful) in his attempts to solve building 
problems in new ways and to experiment with new building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright used to joke that he would just shake designs out of his sleeve, and 
this show more than amply illustrates the breadth and variety of the 
architect's output. But its emphasis on quantity exacts a price in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum bills the exhibition as "the first critical examination of Wright's 
architecture achieved with full access to the archives of the Frank Lloyd 
Wright Foundation." The latter contains the largest collection of the 
architect's drawings anywhere, and it, as the keeper of the Wright flame, has 
long eyed outside scholars and critics with suspicion. Full access, however, 
does not seem to have turned up much that broadens our view of Wright's work, 
and the show's position throughout is, in fact, one of uncritical acceptance 
with surprisingly little examination of even that material that has been 
available to us for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's career as a whole has been examined over and over again -- indeed, it 
has been the subject of numerous exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, whose 
relationship with Wright was always a contentious one that reflected the Modern 
movement's ambivalent view of his significance. This exhibition signals 
Wright's rehabilitation among Modernists (although he never fell out of favor 
with the rest of the world), and while its sweep is impressive, I left, after 
three visits, wishing that the museum had chosen to examine fewer projects 
under much closer scrutiny. We've seen the big picture many times before, isn't 
it time for some close-ups? 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanly and elegantly installed, the exhibition is arranged in a roughly 
chronological sequence and divided into sections that at the same time address 
key issues in Wright's career. But each section is explained by only a single 
text panel that describes a given period and its issues, and makes passing 
references at best to the individual buildings that embody those issues. The 
buildings themselves are described largely by the drawings, models and 
photographs. And in this case a picture is not worth a thousand words. 
</P>
<P>
 This reliance on purely visual imagery is, paradoxically, a problem in 
architecture shows. Since they cannot present an actual building, but only a 
representation of it, how a building is explained and interpreted becomes 
important. Architects (and, it seems, curators of architecture shows) tend to 
take for granted that floor plans, sections and elevations make perfect sense 
to everyone when, in fact, they often make sense only to architects. But 
architects make up only a part of this exhibition's intended audience, so 
shouldn't this show speak as eloquently to those outside the profession as to 
those within it? Although the brochure and audiotape tour that accompany the 
exhibition offer some background on Wright and helpful hints on how to read a 
floor plan, this is information that should be included on the text panels. 
(And although it is abundantly and handsomely illustrated, the show's hefty 
catalogue contains essays that are likely to appeal mainly to those with an 
academic interest in Wright.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, images alone cannot convey the history of a given design, and in 
Wright's case these stories are often fascinating. His relationships with his 
clients (even the non-romantic ones) were the stuff of legend themselves, and 
have been covered in numerous books, including Wright's compelling (and often 
self-aggrandizing) autobiography, a copy of which, annotated by Wright himself, 
sits enticingly open in a display case, with nothing to indicate that it is one 
of the more fascinating artifacts of Wright's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, this is a show that perpetuates Wright's myth without analyzing 
or, better yet, deconstructing it. It is neither fully enlightening for the 
casual viewer, nor does it offer many surprises for the serious scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's personal life was a tabloid reporter's dream, with three marriages, a 
mistress and an out-of-wedlock child, to name a few of the most sensational 
episodes. The exhibition politely sidesteps most of this material, perhaps out 
of deference to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, which can't bear to hear ill 
spoken of "Mr. Wright." But more on Wright's life would have been welcome, 
since the work and the life remain inextricably bound. 
</P>
<P>
 His groundbreaking early work in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park and his 
published designs for affordable, efficient houses brought Wright worldwide 
renown, but his abrupt departure for Europe with his client's wife in 1909 (he 
left a wife and six children behind) nearly destroyed his career. Wright's 
romantic designs for the first Taliesin, in Wisconsin, reflected his renewed 
interest in the landscape and ornament after the increasing abstraction of the 
Prairie buildings, as well as his brief period of happiness with his paramour, 
Mamah Borthwick. She and six other people were murdered at Taliesin in 1914 by 
a deranged servant who then set fire to the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the elaborately ornamented Imperial Hotel (the work on which 
afforded the grief-stricken Wright a comfortably remote haven), his experiments 
with the patterned concrete block houses of the early 1920s, and the presence 
of a few adventurous (and wealthy) clients like Aline Barnsdall, for whom he 
designed the well-known Hollyhock house on Hollywood Boulevard, these were lean 
years for Wright, personally and professionally. (He also had a disastrous 
second marriage, to an actress named Miriam Noel, the denouement of which 
precipitated yet another scandal in Wright's life.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the decade of the 1920s was one of his most 
inventive periods, for, as the exhibition suggests, Wright, unfettered by the 
demands of a thriving practice, felt free enough to design some of his most 
visionary projects, many of them in the West and Southwest. San 
Marcos-in-the-Desert (an Arizona resort for Albert Chandler), a Death Valley 
desert compound for A. M. Johnson, the Lake Tahoe Summer Colony and Doheny 
Ranch Resort (none of which was built), opened up a new world for Wright, and 
two of these projects gave him his first glimpse of the desert landscape that 
would change his work radically, inspiring designs with strong diagonal 
compositions and non-rectilinear geometries.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright later designed his own desert compound, Taliesin West outside 
Scottsdale, Ariz., where five years earlier, in 1932, he had established the 
Taliesin Fellowship -- part school, part extended family and part benevolent 
dictatorship. Wright had also tied the knot one last time, with Olgivanna 
Hinzenberg, a woman several decades his junior with whom he had a daughter, 
born before he was legally free of Noel, thereby causing the aforementioned 
brouhaha. It was Hinzenberg who finally restored stability to Wright's life; 
she worshiped, cosseted and protected him -- like a dragon at the gate, her 
detractors would say -- from those who wanted a piece of the great man. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1930s on, the arc of Wright's reputation continued upward. The '30s saw 
the creation of Fallingwater, Wright's greatest house. With its abstract, 
planar composition, rugged materials and gravity-defying siting, Falling-water 
was simultaneously a Modernist icon and critique of that movement. 
</P>
<P>
 There was too much texture, too much feeling in Wright's work for the 
Modernists' rational tastes. And he, in turn, sneered that a house shouldn't 
look like a machine, in response to Le Corbusier's dictum that a house is a 
machine for living. Indeed, Wright's own Usonian houses, conceived as 
affordable, custom-designed dwellings for suburban families of modest means, 
were warm, intimate buildings that hugged the landscape and opened toward it, 
turning their backs to the ever-busier streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's later years saw the creation of more grand-scale (and flamboyant) 
urban designs that mixed commercial, residential and civic uses, like the 
Mile-High Illinois, a technological tour-de-force skyscraper for Chicago that 
was, of course, never built, and the also-unbuilt Pittsburgh Point project. 
(One of Wright's major civic designs, for Marin County, was indeed realized.) 
His fascination with natural motifs such as the spiral produced gems like the 
V. C. Morris shop in San Francisco and culminated in his design for the 
Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in his 90s, Wright's star remained undimmed. It's hilarious to watch him 
steal the show from a young callow Mike Wallace in a 1958 television interview. 
He tells Wallace, who keeps a cigarette burning, Edward R. Murrow-like, 
throughout the interview, "You shouldn't smoke those things. They're bad for 
your health." (This interview can be seen in New York at the Museum of 
Television and Radio, and it would have been wonderful to include in the Museum 
of Modern Art show, since it conveys what a master of the news media Wright 
could be.) 
</P>
<P>
 The question of what to make of this remarkable career is not, in the end, 
answered by the exhibition. The curators proclaim at the start of the show, "At 
the close of the 20th Century, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright continues 
to reflect the most enduring of American cultural and societal values -- a 
strong sense of common destiny and an equally passionate exaltation of 
individual liberty. . . . Wright's architecture is the work of the most 
creative, prolific and influential architect of modern times." In theory, 
Wright made much of his populist, and acre-of-land-for-everyman politics, which 
he formally outlined in his design for Broadacre City. But in practice (and 
this seems borne out in the exhibition, since these projects are covered in the 
greatest depth) it was the individual with the liberated checkbook -- Edgar 
Kaufmann, Herbert Johnson, Solomon Guggenheim -- whom he exalted the most 
passionately. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to downplay his contributions to middle-class housing -- the 
Usonian designs indirectly heralded the arrival of the suburban ranch house. 
And his Broadacre City and mixed-use projects demonstrated how shrewdly he 
anticipated the automobile's decentralizing effect on American cities. However, 
while Wright was certainly prolific, it's hard to see much evidence of his 
influence on contemporary American architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riley's essay for the show's catalogue, he states: "The values reflected in 
his work must be reformulated yet again if they are to have any impact on the 
current needs of American society." But he doesn't propose how this is to be 
accomplished, possibly because Wright never really got that far himself. He was 
a showman who often got his designs built by the sheer force of his 
considerable will; he was never a consensus builder. He preferred to maintain 
the myth of the romantic individualist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Wright was a tangle of contradictions, most of which have yet to 
be sorted out. But surely we now have enough material to go on; how long do we 
have to wait for an in-depth, clear-eyed assessment of his architectural and 
cultural contributions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Lloyd Wright: Architect" offers us, in its staggering amount of visual 
information, a feast for the eyes. But in its unwillingness to dig deeply into 
the issues behind Wright's work, the exhibition leaves the mind wondering why 
it's still hungry.

</P>
<P>
 Talmadge had taken a drive north out of Atlanta with a businessman named 
Julian Foster, who had offered to sell her the famous movie facade for 
$375,000. Talmadge, the former wife of ex-Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.), thought 
a restored Tara would make a fine tourist attraction to complement her 
plantation-style house in Lovejoy, Ga., where she hosted private parties. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't pay much attention to the route they took that day, but did notice 
that Foster had turned off the 400 Highway at the Alpharetta exit and "for the 
next 15 or 20 or 30 minutes we were on country roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster eventually pulled to a stop in front of a hog barn, swung open the barn 
door, and there it was -- a "terrible looking pile" of lumber, old doors and 
papier-mache brick that time had just about eaten away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Tara," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, people unfamiliar with its history often wonder whatever happened 
to Tara. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention Tara in print here in Los Angeles and you're likely to still get phone 
calls from readers saying Scarlett's house can be seen along Highway 138 as you 
drive toward Lancaster from Lebec. Or, it's this big house in Glendale they 
seem to think was once used in "Flamingo Road." Or, they hazily recall hearing 
somewhere that it burned to the ground long ago -- not unlike Atlanta itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even MGM itself spread legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Former tour guide David Bowen recalled that MGM guides were trained to say 
that a Southern mansion that existed for years on the old MGM backlot was 
Twelve Oaks -- the Ashley Wilkes homestead from "Gone With the Wind," even 
though Twelve Oaks never really existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they just did it for the tourists," Bowen said. "They wanted to have 
something interesting to show them." 
</P>
<P>
 The legend continued after The Times recently published an old photograph of 
that Southern mansion being bulldozed, using information given years ago that 
identified the movie facade as Twelve Oaks. That prompted several readers to 
note that the mansion in the photograph was, in all likelihood, one seen in the 
1962 film "Sweet Bird of Youth." 
</P>
<P>
 MGM officials, after conducting several days of research, concluded that the 
mansion in fact never appeared in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not Twelve Oaks or Tara," said an MGM spokeswoman. "Twelve 
Oaks was a false-front facade on the sound stage on the old Selznick lot (it 
was also shown, in a long shot, as a matte painting). Therefore, this was 
definitely not Twelve Oaks. Tara was a separate set on the Selznick lot. We 
think this is one of the sets on Lot 2 on the MGM lot." 
</P>
<P>
 As any Hollywood historian knows, the remains of Tara left Hollywood 35 years 
ago and wound up in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 They were trucked there in 1959 with all the hoopla the Peach State could 
muster. Gathered on the steps of the state capitol that day, the governor 
spoke, a band wearing Confederate uniforms played "Dixie," women stood in hoop 
skirts and someone read a letter from Vivien Leigh. Even the moving-van drivers 
got into the act, receiving as partial payment a kiss apiece from the reigning 
Miss Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Foster had brought the disassembled movie set to Georgia with plans to 
erect a Tara Plantation on a 300-acre site 15 miles south of Atlanta. As he 
envisioned it, Tara would be a re-creation of a bygone way of life, "absolutely 
devoid of any carnival atmosphere" and aimed to appeal to students of 
antebellum Georgia life. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than three decades later, his dream has yet to be fulfilled. Although 
"Gone With the Wind" remains a big part of Atlanta's allure, there is nothing 
really to see when it comes to the settings and characters made famous in 
Margaret Mitchell's novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people go West, they are looking for cowboys," Talmadge said. "When they 
go to Atlanta, they are looking for Tara and Scarlett and Rhett." 
</P>
<P>
 But what they find isn't much. 
</P>
<P>
 The front doorpiece of Tara -- carefully restored in 1989 to coincide with the 
50th anniversary of the movie's release -- is now at the Atlanta History 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dismantled in storage," said Tommy Jones, director of restoration for 
the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, who worked on the restoration. "I 
could have it back up in a couple days, but it ruined my back taking it down 
the last time." 
</P>
<P>
 The bricks that made up Tara's columns are said to be owned by an anonymous 
Los Angeles collector. The rest of the facade is owned by two women -- 
Talmadge, who has some pieces on her property, and Carolyn Ashworth, who owns 
an upstairs window and two shutters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reluctant to say where it is because it has become so valuable," said 
Ashworth, who operates a tour of antebellum homes in Newnan, Ga., called 
Mansions & Magnolias. "It had to go underground. I bring it out if I have a 
party or big tour, but it's very difficult to haul around. It takes two men to 
carry it. It's said that this is the window that Hattie McDaniel stuck her head 
out of, but I can't prove that." 
</P>
<P>
 How these women came to own Tara is a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty, I'll tell you what," Foster said that day in 1979 when he pulled up by 
the hog barn. "This man (who owns the farm) is going to sell this property and 
I've got to move this thing. I'll sell this to you for . . . $175,000." 
Talmadge begged off. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, her phone rang. It was Foster. He said he desperately had to 
move Tara. What would she give him? 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can afford on it is $5,000," she said, "and only if a restoration 
architect says he can do something with it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take it," Foster replied. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Foster died suddenly and Talmadge learned from Foster's widow that he 
had never confided to anyone -- even to her -- where he kept Tara's remains. 
The widow wondered if Talmadge could remember where he had driven her that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said I was probably the only living person who knew where it was," 
Talmadge recalled recently. "But I hadn't paid any attention to how we got 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Talmadge decided to contact a policeman she knew and ask if he could help her 
retrace the drive she took the day near Alpharetta, Ga., when she came upon the 
hog barn and the lumber pile that was Tara. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I don't want you to go get arrested for looking in people's barns,' 
" Talmadge recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up a map and we drove from sunup to sundown for four days," 
Talmadge said. "We couldn't find anything. So, I came home and I hired an 
airplane and flew over Alpharetta for a full day. But everything looked 
different from up there. I came home that night and called Mrs. Foster and I 
told her what the problem was. I said, 'I can't spend the rest of my life 
looking for Tara.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as Talmadge was about to leave her house for a final day of traversing 
country roads, the telephone rang. It was Mrs. Foster. She had found a canceled 
check and believed it identified the owner of the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out we had been within three miles of it," Talmadge said. "After I 
found it, I took the policeman with me to haul it away. He had a horse trailer, 
but you couldn't pile a third of it in there, so we had to get an 18-wheeler." 
</P>
<P>
 Talmadge took Tara back to her own house -- a white-columned, plantation-type 
mansion in Lovejoy, Ga., built in 1836 -- that she says is supposed to have 
been the inspiration for Twelve Oaks in Margaret Mitchell's novel. As Talmadge 
tells it, a woman named Arie Crawford, who lived in the house until dying in 
1935, spoke of her grandmother shooting a Yankee soldier dead on the front 
steps. ("But I heard she killed two Yankees instead of one," Talmadge said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Talmadge also has the ancestral home of Margaret Mitchell's grandparents, the 
Fitzgeralds, standing in a cow pasture on her property. She said the house was 
supposed to have been the inspiration for Tara. 
</P>
<P>
 But the author's nephew, Joseph Mitchell, said there never was a historical 
Tara south of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fitzgeralds lived in that area and their home might have played some 
general imaginative spark (for the novel), but nothing down there looks like 
Tara or Twelve Oaks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Garrett, Atlanta's official historian ("It doesn't pay anything, but 
I still am"), said years ago that he received a letter from Mitchell herself 
asking him not to identify any houses around Atlanta as being inspirations for 
Tara or Twelve Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said they were figments of her imagination," Garrett recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not in dispute is the movie facade itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Rooney, head of exhibits at the Atlanta History Center, recalls going to 
Talmadge's house in 1989 to begin restoring Tara for the half-century 
re-release of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney said Talmadge had stored both the Fitzgerald house and Tara inside a 
barn. "We had to fish through pieces of the Fitzgerald home along with pieces 
of the Hollywood movie set," he said. "They were all in a barn covered with 
cobwebs and dirt. It was sometimes confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 It cost $8,000 to restore the front entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing will never be reconstructed, in my mind, because the set was 
not made of durable materials," Rooney said. "What Betty has really are the 
bones. There is some framing timber that was part of the corners, I think, but 
I think the fenestration of the house is what Betty has. Doors and windows. 
Openings. Shutters." 
</P>
<P>
 Talmadge said she had everything appraised in 1992 and was dumbfounded at what 
she was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what he appraised it at?" she said. "One-point-two million dollars. I 
said, 'You're crazy!' He said, 'No, Mrs. Talmadge, it is the most famous movie 
facade in the world.' I said, 'Oh, my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ashworth said that if Talmadge's pieces are worth $1.2 million, her window and 
shutters could be worth $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashworth, in fact, once had possession of all of Tara when she was involved 
with a nonprofit corporation that wanted to build a "Gone With the Wind" theme 
park. When money for the project fell through, however, Betty Talmadge 
repossessed the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, though, Ashworth came to own the window and shutters. She had 
telephoned a real estate salesman "on a whim" looking for financial backing and 
mentioned that she had all the pieces to Tara except for a window and two 
shutters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started laughing and he said he knew where it was," Ashworth recalled. "He 
said he had them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What had happened, I think -- I really don't know the whole story -- but 
Julian Foster let somebody borrow this window probably in 1960 for promotional 
purposes," Ashworth said. "I think it was passed around from person to person. 
It never was returned. Of course, Julian Foster was dead by that time." As part 
of her tour of Southern mansions, Ashworth now offers tourists the opportunity 
to have their pictures taken from the window and shutters from the facade.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the front entrance of Tara, Ashworth doesn't consider it very 
authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it has been totally destroyed," she said. "It's a brand-new 
door. Before, it was rotting in places, but it had the look, the nostalgia that 
people wanted to see. . . . I have pictures she (Talmadge) doesn't know I have 
-- the way it looked prior to the restoration and the way it looks now -- and 
it now looks like a brand-new door." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashworth said she has no papers to verify that what she has is really Tara. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no papers," she said. "But all anybody would have to do is look at 
the wood (and know it was Tara)." 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "We do have the documentation from when it left Hollywood."

HENRY CISNEROS AND THE POLITICS OF AMBIVALENCE; THE GREAT LATINO POLITICAL HOPE 
HAS TWICE CHOSEN HUD OVER ELECTORAL POLITICS. WHERE'S HENRY'S FIRE?

<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry G. Cisneros, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is standing 
in a muddy tent city in the San Fernando Valley, talking to a TV reporter. It 
is Week 2 of post-earthquake reality in Los Angeles, and the secretary has been 
in town for most of the aftershocks, doing what he clearly likes to do best: 
turn the wheels of Big Government. His sleeves are rolled up, his collar is 
open, and his hands are tucked inside the pockets of a khaki jacket. His sad 
eyes look intently into the television camera, and he speaks easily into the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, it was Cisneros who broke the news of the earthquake to a 
still-sleeping President Clinton, jet-lagged from his whirlwind European tour. 
The HUD secretary had been in a Washington TV studio, waiting to do a Martin 
Luther King Jr. birthday segment on CBS' "This Morning," when Los Angeles 
shook. He phoned the White House and then delivered to the world Clinton's 
first response to the disaster. The President "would immediately begin talking 
with the appropriate federal emergency officials and put them into action," 
Cisneros said. Within hours, he and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena were 
dispatched to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Cisneros has been all over quake-shattered L.A. He has confabbed 
with both of California's senators, with Gov. Pete Wilson and L.A. Mayor 
Richard Riordan; wheeled and dealed to free up emergency HUD housing vouchers, 
toured South-Central and visited shelter after shelter. In English and Spanish, 
the language he had to relearn, he has chatted with quake victims standing in 
water lines and living out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, the secretary looks every bit the classic politician, 
cruising for photo ops, mining every opportunity to meet and greet -- running 
hard. But up close, in the glare of the TV lights, something is wrong with this 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, for instance, Cisneros has none of the calculated polish that 
burnishes most politicians. He's wearing the same blue slacks he's had on for a 
week (he packed in a hurry and has stayed longer than he planned), and there is 
neither a bodyguard nor an advance man in sight. Standing in front of the 
camera, he speaks in the form of public-service announcements, not flashy sound 
bites. Shelter is available, Cisneros says earnestly; take advantage of it. He 
is behaving like he's doing a job, not campaigning for one. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a new Henry Cisneros. Just six years ago, he was the bright light in 
New West politics, a young, brainy fast-tracker with media flair. The four-term 
Latino mayor of San Antonio, some said, might even have White House potential. 
Then he bowed out of the political high life, an almost willing victim of his 
own tragedies. His third child, John Paul, had been born with a 
life-threatening congenital heart defect, and Cisneros had confessed, in a 
wrenching mea culpa, to an image-destroying extramarital affair. He retreated; 
it wasn't until another Los Angeles calamity, the riots of 1992, and the 
political ascendance of Bill Clinton, that the tug toward public service 
overcame his acquired aversion to the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 46, he's back, but the transformation is startling. The country's 
first Latino with presidential potential, a man whose charisma once outshone 
his ambition, has been reborn as a glorified civil servant. He has twice turned 
down chances to pursue a Texas Senate seat, an office he had a good chance of 
winning and one that would have thrust him back onto the fast track. Instead, 
he has chosen to run HUD, historically one of the lowest-profile and 
least-effective Cabinet agencies. The new Henry Cisneros seems to be an 
oxymoron: a politician who won't run, a star turned bureaucrat. Where's Henry's 
fire?  
</P>
<P>
 "I BELIEVE AMERICA IS IN TROUBLE, AND I BELIEVE HUD IS AT THE CORE OF it." 
From the confines of a coach-class airplane seat, Cisneros' voice punctuates 
each word, his right hand slashing the air. "We're dealing in an area that is 
our potential killer -- gangs, the loss of our youth, central city problems, 
race and class divisions. And, in four years, I think I can do a lot about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros is shuttling home to Washington after a short tour outside the 
Beltway, doing his duty as a Clinton Cabinet member. It is mid-November, and on 
this day, he has participated in the 15th anniversary celebration of the 
Mission Park housing development in Cambridge, appeared at two fund-raisers for 
Boston-area Rep. Martin T. Meehan (whose arm he twisted on behalf of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement), offered advice to the newly elected Boston 
Mayor Tom M. Menino, submitted to a grilling by the Boston Globe editorial 
staff and delivered a speech (to housing developers at the Urban Land 
Institute) and a pep talk (to his own Boston HUD troops). At 8 p.m., he's still 
more than willing to discuss business, setting out what he hopes to accomplish 
in his return to public life and, not incidentally, defending his decision to 
take on HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, urban problems have been escalating while HUD's budget 
has been shrinking. Not surprisingly, it has become increasingly unable to 
serve its major purpose: housing the poor. In 1974, HUD had about 14 million 
units to shelter an estimated 8.9 million low-income households. By 1993, the 
number of HUD units had shrunk to about 10.6 million, while the number of 
households needing assistance had risen to 14.3 million. For fiscal 1994, HUD 
has a budget of nearly $25 billion (not counting $500 million in emergency 
earthquake relief money). Yet according to the General Accounting Office, the 
agency faces, among other bills coming due, $20 billion in immediate repairs on 
its housing stock.  
</P>
<P>
 The department has also been coping with a scarred reputation. In the 1980s, 
11 high-level Reagan appointees -- including three former undersecretaries and 
the executive assistant to Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. -- were indicted and 
convicted for influence peddling, and one private escrow agent was dubbed 
"Robin HUD" for embezzling an estimated $6 million in government funds. As one 
close friend of Cisneros put it, "HUD is not a steppingstone to anything other 
than an appearance before the grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration made a clean sweep, appointing Jack Kemp to head the 
agency, but its moves to safeguard HUD from more corruption, and its basic bias 
against social welfare spending, only made matters worse when it came to yet 
another lingering problem: HUD has a bureaucracy so leaden that even where 
money has been appropriated, it's difficult to get it spent.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get written permission from Washington just to drive the agency car 
from San Francisco to Sacramento," says Art Agnos, former mayor of San 
Francisco and current western regional administrator for HUD. "Employee 
initiative is not encouraged here. You are rated for the number of times you 
pick up the ball without dropping it, not how many hits you've had." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the very beginning that there were serious management problems 
that could not be dealt with with Band-Aids," Cisneros says. He was so eager to 
begin the daunting effort to make the department work that in February of last 
year he beat his friend, Vice President Al Gore, to the punch. Three weeks 
before the formation of Gore's National Performance Review, known as 
"Reinventing Government," Cisneros launched his own campaign called 
"Reinventing HUD." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros' reinvention scheme sounds like a New Age blend of the technocratic 
and the socially conscious. Instead of the typical organizational pyramid -- 
CEO on top, the lowliest worker at the bottom -- Cisneros says he wants to 
create "the right-side-up company," where the most important person is the one 
who meets the public. "That's a pretty damned interesting concept, you know," 
he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He oversees 13,500 employees in 71 field offices at HUD, and Cisneros has 
asked all of them for suggestions on how to streamline the organization. He has 
also appointed a "management excellence team," composed of 10 staffers, to act 
as a clearinghouse for bottom-up ideas. The first major change: Ten regional 
operations -- bottlenecked intermediaries between field offices and Washington 
headquarters -- will be eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros is not limiting HUD's "reinvention" to the New Democrat ideal of 
efficiency in government, however. He is also pushing for philosophical 
renewal, a return to the liberal tenet that big government can work. On the 
shuttle from Boston, Cisneros runs through his top five priorities in wonkish 
style: neatly outlined and prioritized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assisting the homeless," he begins, snapping open his pinkie from a closed 
fist. "Improving public housing." The ring finger pops out, and then two more 
fingers: "Expanding housing opportunities. Opening housing markets." Finally, 
the thumb unbends. "And empowering communities." Then, as if to indicate that 
his task is done, he slowly glides his open hand, palm downward, away from his 
body in an awkward, theatrical gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic flourishes and reinvention claims notwithstanding, Cisneros' 
priorities don't seem all that different from his predecessor's. Jack Kemp also 
spoke of assisting the homeless, improving public housing and expanding housing 
opportunities. But, says Cisneros, under Kemp's watch, HUD only marked time. 
According to the conventional wisdom, the secretary, a contender for the top 
spot in the Republican Party, was Bushwhacked. "Jack Kemp worked in a Bush 
Administration that was thwarting every idea at every turn and was totally 
disengaged from a domestic agenda," Cisneros says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp wasn't even able to get his boss to sign a bill financing economic 
development zones, the secretary's pet project, which would have offered 
businesses willing to locate in distressed urban areas a sizable reduction in 
capital gains tax. Perhaps Kemp's biggest achievement, aside from restoring the 
agency to some measure of respectability after the corruption scandals, was to 
set in motion tenant ownership of public housing, making it possible for some 
of HUD's clients to purchase the units they lived in.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton -- "a President who cares about a sense of community and a domestic 
agenda," says Cisneros -- ran for office promising to continue Kemp's tenant 
ownership program. It is a measure of the weight Cisneros carries at the White 
House, as well as his differences with Kemp, that he discarded the program 
almost as soon as he was sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am generally laudatory of the job that Kemp did," Cisneros says, "even 
beyond what is probably wise, considering he may be the Republican nominee in 
1996. But it's not realistic to think that large public-housing developments 
can be sold to people who live in them and saddle them with the deferred 
maintenance cost." He insists that Kemp's program was aimed at ultimately 
taking government out of the business of housing the poor, a responsibility 
that Cisneros says Washington can't avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he insists, HUD has not abandoned the goal of tenant home 
ownership. The secretary rarely fails to mention it in his public appearances, 
and he knows the statistics of falling home ownership in the U.S. by heart. The 
agency, he says, is exploring other methods -- making refurbished FHA 
repossessions available, using housing vouchers to cover not just rent but 
mortgage payments and creating no-down-payment government home loans.  
</P>
<P>
 Of all of HUD's priorities, dealing with homelessness has consumed most of 
Cisneros' attention. "I think there's been an unspoken effort to hide the 
problem, to sweep it under the carpet as though it doesn't exist," he says. 
"But it's a problem so large in our society that we can't just simply hide it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, his idea is to get the government more involved. To that end, 
Cisneros asked Congress in 1993 to make four amendments to his budget, dou 
bling the expenditure on homeless programs by shifting money from other 
projects. For 1995, the agency's total appropriation could increase to $29.5 
billion (one of only a handful of increases Clinton is asking for) and homeless 
expenditures could nearly double again, to $1.5 billion. With the money, 
Cisneros plans to step up a "continuum of care" -- funding permanent housing, 
temporary shelters, job placement programs and mental-health and drug treatment 
for the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 For all his emphasis on homelessness, Cisneros made his biggest splash in 1993 
with priority No. 5, "empowering communities." In September, he went into the 
town of Vidor, Tex., famous for its Ku Klux Klan connections, and personally 
took charge of a public housing project where black families had been harrassed 
and forced to leave. In January, HUD ordered armed guards to accompany blacks 
moving back into the Vidor projects. And Cisneros has also campaigned hard 
against home-loan redlining. With the cooperation of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, HUD 
and the Justice Department are setting up sting operations to target problem 
areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Such actions have earned him a reputation as the Clinton Administration's 
chief defender of civil rights. "At one Cabinet meeting, I laid out what I 
thought ought to be the values of our joint community strategy," Cisneros says. 
"These values included a commitment to reducing the spatial separations in 
American society: race, income and class. The President was very, very 
sympathetic. I was sitting right next to him, and I asked him: 'Do you like 
it?' And he said: 'Do I like it? It's what I ran for office to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The National Journal, in its November "Cabinet Scorecard," cited Cisneros as 
one of the "emerging stars" on the Administration's team -- the President's 
"Hispanic on the spot" and a "good soldier" on issues close to Clinton's heart. 
He got high marks for assembling a first-rate team and for his hard stand on 
desegregation. Paul Leonard, of the Washington-based Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities, a watchdog agency for the poor, credits his "effective 
agenda" and a "head on" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros also has his share of critics. The National Journal knocked his 
"vague" message. Others say he can be long on symbolism and short on substance, 
and they talk about his first year at HUD as an exercise in headline grabbing 
-- sleeping in a dilapidated subsidized housing development in New York; 
attending the funeral of a homeless District of Columbia woman who died at 
HUD's front door. "Henry's just like every other career politician who has 
never done anything else," says Doug Harlan, a former political foe in Texas. 
"He's always looking for the cheap way up." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, even among HUD's jaded ranks, Cisneros seems to be 
working his old, charismatic magic. At Boston's Tip O'Neill federal building, 
Cisneros walked in late to his meeting with northeastern HUD staffers. With 
rain dripping off his hair and suit, he had 20 minutes before his next 
engagement, and his audience was not feeling charitable. Cisneros was there to 
talk about "reinventing" their office and, ultimately, shutting down the 
regional operation. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood behind the podium for less than two minutes, just long enough to 
apologize for his tardiness, then swiftly moved off the platform to stand at 
the front of the first row. Yes, he said, his hands were tied -- everyone had 
to absorb budget cuts. "Some of you may be reassigned," he told the audience. 
"None of you will be losing your job involuntarily." Then he hit his stride. "I 
want to get to the point where we are doing real things," he said, "housing 
people who need housing, who ought to not be living in the squalid conditions 
they're in. I want to fix that on our watch. At the end of this time, when you 
go to a cocktail party and people ask you where you work, you'll say 'I work at 
the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,' instead of 
having to avert your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Cisneros, playing to a skeptical, then enamored, crowd. One 
employee stood up and said: "I am more encouraged than I've ever been. I've 
worked at HUD for 21 years, and this is the first time I've ever even seen a 
secretary." The audience burst into loud applause, and Cisneros, his face 
suffused with a missionary glow, was off again into the New England rain. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS A LITTLE IRONIC THAT Henry Cisneros is in charge of America's housing. 
Throughout his years in Texas politics, first as a San Antonio City Council 
member, then as mayor, his record on housing was spotty, some would say dismal. 
In 1986, during Cisneros' third term as mayor, a study by the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities determined that San Antonio's housing problems were among 
the worst in the nation. For 44% of the city's poor, shelter was overpriced and 
woefully substandard, and in the years that Cisneros held office, the 
availability of low-cost units declined precipitously.  
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros admits that housing and many other "neighborhood" issues were a low 
priority for him as mayor. "I ran for office with a very clear agenda: jobs and 
economic development," he says. "I believed that the best social program we 
could put together was a growing economy." Cisneros worked to improve San 
Antonio's infrastructure, including sewers and sidewalks, but his emphasis was 
on flashier projects: new office buildings, shopping centers, a biotech 
research park, a $125-million Sea World and the $186-million, 65,000-seat 
Alamodome. It amounted to a swift kick from small town status to city stature 
for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also just about the only "progressive" political platform that stood a 
chance in San Antonio. In 1981, when Cisneros ran for mayor, Latinos alone 
could not elect a candidate, despite their growing political clout. The 
conservatives who ran the town opposed change at every turn, which meant that 
not only Mexican Americans but also anyone with new ideas, including those who 
wanted to share in the '80s economic boom, were out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros turned out to be a winning coalition candidate for San Antonio's 
shut-out factions. For Anglo yuppies, there were his impeccable credentials: 
advanced degrees in urban planning and public administration from Harvard's 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy School of Government and George Washington University, 
a stint as a White House Fellow and as an assistant to Elliot Richardson, 
Richard M. Nixon's secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. He ran for and 
won a seat on the San Antonio City Council in 1975, at the ripe old age of 27, 
under the banner of the Good Government League, a slate representing the city's 
pro-business moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latinos, Cisneros was one of their own, son of George, a military civil 
servant, and Elvira Cisneros. He grew up on Monterey Street ("a Norman Rockwell 
experience," says Cisneros, "except that (everyone) had brown faces"); he 
skipped fourth grade at Catholic school and made good at Texas A&M and beyond. 
He could comfortably shoulder the aspirations of the well-off and the less 
affluent in the Mexican American community, even if he did have to refresh his 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He was by no means a radical. "I always viewed Henry Cisneros as very capable 
and very committed," says Ernesto Cortes, who founded Communities Organized for 
Public Service, a highly touted neighborhood-issues group. "But I knew he was 
not going to identify totally with the have-nots. No one has ever defined Henry 
Cisneros as an activist." 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes often found himself at odds with Cisneros' development policies. COPS 
successfully battled Cisneros' efforts to construct a nuclear power plant 
outside San Antonio in the early 1980s but lost the fight over the Alamodome, 
which many San Antonian critics consider more a monument to Cisneros' ego than 
a boon to their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes can criticize the man he calls "a worthy adversary and a good friend," 
but he won't lay the blame for San Antonio's housing woes on Cisneros. "It's 
because of 100 years of neglect," he says. Paul Leonard at the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities agrees. "The main reason for San Antonio's low-income 
housing problem is that San Antonio has a much higher proportion of low-income 
people than most cities," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cisneros says that if he were to do it over again, he would have made 
housing a top priority. "If I had stayed longer -- and, under normal 
circumstances, I would have liked to have stayed 10 or 12 years instead of 
eight," he says -- "I would have started to build that social platform based on 
the accomplishments on the economic front."  
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances surrounding Cisneros' final years as mayor of San Antonio 
were definitely not normal, at least not for a Catholic Mexican American in a 
socially conservative city. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1987, Cisneros had what looked like a charmed life. His home number and 
address were listed in the phone book, and reporters often stopped by his house 
on West Houston Street (the same house where his grandparents had lived) 
without an appointment. His personal life, with his wife, Mary Alice -- they 
met when they were teen-agers -- and his two daughters, Teresa Angelica and 
Mercedes Christina (then 16 and 12), was an open book. He was elected in 1981 
and then breezed through three reelection landslides. A fifth term seemed a 
certainty, and he was seriously considering running for governor or senator. 
But his personal and political fortunes began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 10, 1987, the day before Cisneros turned 40, his son, John Paul, named 
in honor of the Pope, was born with a serious heart defect. He wasn't expected 
to survive childhood. John Paul was the boy all of San Antonio knew Cisneros 
had longed for. The family was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other whispers as well. The 39-year-old wife of a wealthy local 
jeweler, who had been working on Cisneros' possible run for the Texas 
governorship or the U.S. Senate, was said to be much more to the mayor than 
just his political fund-raiser. When a local newspaper columnist wrote 
obliquely about his knowledge of an extramarital affair involving an unnamed, 
well-known public figure, the whole city knew he was talking about Henry. 
Perhaps because the strain of keeping secrets was alien to Cisneros, or because 
his guilt was weighing too heavily on him, he finally admitted his deep love 
for the woman. "I guess human beings just aren't made of plastic and wiring and 
metal; they are made of flesh and blood and feelings," Cisneros said.  
</P>
<P>
 During the height of the rumors, he had announced that he would not run for 
the Texas governorship or the U.S. Senate. Nor would he seek reelection as 
mayor. The only thing that mattered to the tortured Cisneros now was his 
family. Mary Alice soon filed for divorce. But Catholic San Antonio -- or 
rather, Mexican San Antonio -- somehow saved the marriage. According to the 
Washington Post, Cisneros received hundreds of letters, some in support, some 
vitriolic, from his loyal constituents. Many offered the same advice: Don't let 
tu hijito die. Por Dios , fix your marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 ON A PLUMP COUCH IN their new, rented house in Washington, Cisneros and 
6-year-old John Paul are engaged in a minor battle of wills. Mary Alice has 
just served a chicken dinner, and now she and Cisneros are trying to talk to a 
reporter while John Paul -- " mijo " is what his father always calls him -- 
vies for their attention. When order is restored, Cisneros works his way 
through the story of his life. Even with dozens of photographs chronicling his 
political career decorating the room, he manages to be convincing when he says 
that, after 1989, he had no plans to return to public life. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, I was beginning to have some of the security associated 
with income," he points out. As mayor of San Antonio, Cisneros was paid only 
$58 a week plus expenses; he supplemented this with speaking fees around the 
country. "I can't begin to tell you how tight things were." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left office, he started earning an income in the multiple six figures 
from television and radio programs, corporate lecturing, board memberships and 
his investment firm, the Cisneros Asset Management Co. -- which handled 
investments for government, colleges and labor unions. "It was going to really 
amount to something. So I wasn't sure that I wanted to be involved in politics 
at all."  
</P>
<P>
 Not that he had abandoned that world completely. Cisneros stayed in touch with 
Latino political organizations, and in 1991, he organized a conference of 300 
Mexican-American leaders and the new president of Mexico, his old Harvard 
classmate Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He also indulged in another kind of 
armchair politics. Late at night, he immersed himself in one civilization or 
another, reading everything he could get his hands on. He investigated ancient 
Greece, the Aztecs, China, Mesopotamia, the British Empire. It is a habit that 
continues: "I study the accumulated effect of culture," Cisneros says. "It 
gives me a whole different take on humankind and our place in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The way he tells it, it was a crisis in American civilization that drew him 
back to politics. When the Los Angeles riots broke out in April, 1992, he 
telephoned his friend Mayor Tom Bradley, a condolence call of sorts, he says. 
He ended up having a long conversation with City Councilman Mike Hernandez. "He 
told me, 'This thing has the potential of going into a black and Latino thing. 
I don't know how bad it's going to be, but we may need your help.' I was there 
by 5 o'clock the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 When Cisneros arrived at Burbank airport, he was picked up by Bradley staffers 
and given a tour of the city. It was a bit of an epiphany. "The sky was orange. 
It was like 'Apocalypse Now,' " he remembers. "It was unbelievable, man. If 
Mayor Bradley (had) said: 'Henry, drop what you're doing, sever your business 
relationships. I want you to be deputy mayor of Los Angeles and help us work 
this out,' I'd have done it."  
</P>
<P>
 Bradley didn't ask, but Cisneros' political juices had begun to flow again. 
Then when his friend, actor Edward James Olmos, led several hundred 
broom-toting Angelenos on a mediagenic cleanup after the violence had subsided, 
Cisneros made up his mind that, like Olmos, he too had to act. "I don't know 
where Eddie got this idea, but it was bril liant," Cisneros says excitedly, 
exaggerating the emphasis as he always does when he wants to make an important 
point. "It was Gandhi-esque. To take a symbol that people would understand, a 
broom . . . a clean sweep. Because when you're cleaning up, it's over, you're 
not tearing down anymore. It was just bril liant. That's when I knew that I 
would put what I was doing on the back burner." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros returned to San Antonio and turned up the heat; as campaign senior 
adviser, he immersed himself in Bill Clinton's presidential run. He started out 
barely knowing the governor of Arkansas -- they had met on several occasions -- 
but he became one of the Clinton camp's busiest pitchmen.  
</P>
<P>
 In late October of 1992, when Clinton's victory was a near certainty, Cisneros 
was asked by Warren Christopher to join the transition team. Christopher told 
him,"You better think hard, because he's going to ask you to be on his 
Cabinet." Within days, Cisneros was mentioned in news stories as a likely 
appointee for either transportation or commerce. Finally, Christopher called to 
ask what Cisneros wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren, I've thought about this," Cisneros remembers saying. He'd just spent 
a few days mulling his revelation in L.A. "I don't know what the President is 
thinking. I don't know whether he really wants me. But if I were to go in, I 
think I'd like it to be at HUD." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got complicated. Clinton agreed that Cisneros was the man for HUD, 
but Texas Gov. Ann Richards wanted Cisneros to accept appointment to Lloyd 
Bentsen's Senate seat (Bentsen had been tapped by the new President for the 
Treasury Department). Cisneros, in the middle of a political tug of war, spent 
long days on the phone and torturous nights pondering the choice on his own. In 
the end, he decided against diving back into the political fray headfirst. He 
declined the offer to be the third Latino senator in U.S. history and instead 
chose HUD, a comeback path of least resistance. If Richards had appointed him 
to the Senate, he explained, he would have faced a special election for the 
seat later in the year, around the time that John Paul was scheduled for 
open-heart surgery. His family obligations, he said, came first. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's operation was a success, and at about the same time, Cisneros' 
political resolve was once again tested. The Senate seat he had turned down was 
won by Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican. But in 1994, it would be up for 
grabs again in the general election, and three separate private polls taken in 
October showed that Cisneros could beat any contender for the Democratic 
nomination. Hutchison, meanwhile, was in trouble, facing charges, of which she 
was later found innocent, that she had used public employees and state-owned 
computers for campaign purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Gore reportedly told Cisneros that the opportunity was too good 
to pass up. Clinton, nervously eyeing a possible Republican majority in the 
Senate in 1994, wasn't standing in his way. And once again Ann Richards begged 
her pal to run for the seat she had all but gift-wrapped for him. Latino 
leaders throughout the country urged Cisneros to enter the race, anxious to see 
one of their own elected to the Senate. Even Mary Alice wanted her husband to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-November, Cisneros said: "I have my own internal calculations as to how 
the elections would play out, and I'm not the best candidate." He was concerned 
about money: $5 million was a lot to raise so quickly. And there was concern 
that Hutchison could be exonerated and politically boosted by her claims that 
she was the victim of a Democratic vendetta. But Cisneros agreed to meet with 
his Texas supporters in December. "For a couple of days, I listened to friends 
who laid out various scenarios. But," he claims, "I never seriously entertained 
the notion." On Dec. 14, Cisneros announced that he would stick with HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Harlan, the old San Antonio Republican foe, isn't surprised that Cisneros 
did not run for the Senate. Even as he was winning reelection by landslides, 
Harlan says, he always acted as if he were going to lose. "He's a scaredy cat," 
Harlan says. "He has very little confidence in his electoral ability." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a little too close to all the bulls- - - with the girl," admits 
a Cisneros political ally back in Texas. "He's got a beast out there he's not 
dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros assiduously avoids responding to such speculation. He says it was 
political smarts, not cowardice, that made him say no. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is Cisneros' political future? In Texas, there is a deja vu quality to 
the talk -- it might as well be the heady '80s again. At the December meeting, 
a 1996 run for Phil Gramm's Senate seat was openly discussed. So was a run for 
the governorship in 1998. But one possibility that used to be on Cisneros' list 
(although he has publicly denied it), reportedly no longer comes up: the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, someday it will be possible to see a Latino or a Latina become 
President," he says for the record. "But I'm not that person. I don't think 
it's something that's going to happen in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters are not so sure. Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National 
Council of La Raza, says that Cisneros probably has a better chance than any 
other Latino to land in the White House. "He needs ratification at the polls," 
says Yzaguirre. "He needs it for political reasons and for his own personal 
self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Intellectually, Cisneros acknowledges what a win at the polls means, and he 
recognizes that every time he runs away from electoral office, he also runs 
away from the big prize. "You don't have power when you're reporting to one 
person, even if it's the President," he says, sounding like a man with second 
thoughts. "There's more power in the people sending me and my being responsible 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Cisneros is nothing if not indecisive. He claims not to know if he 
will remain in politics, much less take another electoral plunge. "I don't have 
a sense of what is the next thing I can do," he says quickly, as though he's 
been asked the question a million times. "But I'm not the slightest bit 
worried. I've never failed to provide for my family, and in one fashion or 
another -- it may be teaching, it might be in business, it might be in writing, 
or it might even be in politics -- I will." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN HENRY CISNEROS was a student at Texas A&M in the 1960s, he learned, he 
says, "the most important lesson in my life." It started with a guy named Al 
Tijerina. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros was a freshman, a member of the ROTC Corps of Cadets, and Tijerina, a 
senior of Mexican descent from San Angelo, Tex., was one of his unit leaders. 
He was also Cisneros' chosen role model. "All of us, even those who came from 
the most conservative, segregated, discriminatory backgrounds in Texas, were in 
awe of Al Tijerina," Cisneros says. "He was seen as the highest you can attain. 
I remember deciding, 'I can do this. I can do this.' "  
</P>
<P>
 And over the course of the next four years, Cisneros did do it. He rose 
through the ROTC ranks, won awards, got elected to class office and ultimately 
headed out of Texas for Harvard, Washington and beyond. But it was what 
happened at Texas A&M, Cisneros says, that made all the difference: "I've never 
had such a clear experience of setting out to try something very hard and 
achieving it. I never stopped to wonder what it would have meant for my 
personality if I had failed." 
</P>
<P>
 The meritocracy of ROTC, and the way accomplishment evened the playing field 
at Texas A&M, is what sticks in Cisneros' mind. "You were promoted, you were 
rewarded, and you had the respect of your peers, strictly speaking, on three 
criteria: What are your grades? What is your performance in the cadet corps? 
And what is your performance on the athletic teams? My (high school) 
classmates, Mexicanos who were better than me at grades, went to other 
universities where they were judged by other criteria: what fraternity you 
belonged to, who your father was or how you fit into the hierarchy of the Texas 
power structure. They all, it seems to me, came away with the (feeling) that 
society had put them in their place."  
</P>
<P>
 These days, the place Cisneros has chosen for himself may have something in 
common with the meritocracy he cherished at Texas A&M. As secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development, he can tell himself that it is substance, not image, 
that got him there and keeps him there -- to a place where the challenges are 
specific and success measurable. A place where he can do well and do good . 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton gave me a chance I thought I'd never have," Cisneros says. "I 
enjoy what I'm doing. I feel a real commitment to it. The earthquake bore that 
out. (I could have been) down in Texas campaigning for a Senate race instead of 
trying to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an unguarded moment, he underlines the point one more time. "Did you 
ever see the movie 'The Mission'?" he asks. "Remember Robert De Niro, when they 
load him down?"In the film, De Niro's character enacts a brutal penance, 
carrying a heavy load like a punished pack animal to a mountaintop Jesuit 
monastery.  
</P>
<P>
 "He refuses to let anyone help him," Cisneros explains. "And only when he gets 
to the top can he just completely relax, have peace. He's absolved himself. 
Sometimes that's how I feel."

UP AGAINST THE WALL; FOR THE ARTISTS OF BERLIN, THE WALL NEVER REALLY FELL. AND 
AS THE ART SCENE MOVES EAST, ENVY AND CONTEMPT HEAT UP A STRANGE COLD WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Back when life had a taste and texture, back when it had a spirit and a rhythm 
of its own, then Rainer Tschernay could create. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when he didn't have to sell his paintings, back before money, money, 
money became the point to everything, then he could work on his crude 
sculptures in his East Berlin studio. He could draw and paint landscapes. Then 
he could see clearly. Back before the Wall came down. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Wall came down, "Raw" Warzecha had found his niche. Back when West 
Berlin's Kreuzberg was an island of Turkish immigrants and punk artists near 
the Wall and nobody cared if you owned a building or just lived in it; back 
before the Frankfurt suits came with their bulging wallets and the Wall was an 
immutable fact of life, then he could paint. Now, it's not so easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the abandoned buildings, the squats, are disappearing; rents have gone 
through the roof, everybody's fighting eviction and the art scene has moved to 
East Berlin. Who has the head, really, for art? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was certainly better before the Wall came down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Wall fell, I had the feeling that they just opened the zoo. That 
there were all these wild animals on the street," says Christopher, a 
33-year-old west Berliner who hangs out with the Dead Chickens, a "Wessie" 
cyberpunk performance art group. He recalls how the "Ossies" jammed the center 
of west Berlin, gaping at the wealth of a consumer society. Christopher, who 
makes crude handcrafted jewelry and will not give his last name because he 
hates his father, has met his cousins in east Berlin only once since 1989. He 
can't relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can his friends, the Dead Chickens. They are a hot young group on the 
West Berlin scene, exhibiting their monster-sculptures in the prestigious Raab 
Gallery and performing in art festivals around Europe. They make wild, 
horrifying costumes that move mechanically and explode on computer-controlled 
cue and ooze blood, brains and green liquid while they play ear-splitting 
noise. Very underground. Very subculture. You know: nukes and punks and heavy 
black make-up. Very, very Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many artists from West Berlin, including Warzecha, the Dead Chickens were 
evicted from their squat in Kreuzberg, which is now an area of prime real 
estate. As Kreuzberg becomes yuppified, artists have increasingly moved 
down-market, to the east. You might think that the Dead Chickens would have 
found kindred spirits among the young, anti-art artists of the East, 
particularly since the Dead Chickens now work in a huge basement in East 
Berlin.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Dead Chickens find East Berlin's subculture . . . boring. Dated. 
"Pathetic," says Breeda C.C. (her only name), an artist who creates many of the 
Dead Chickens' costumes. "Some of the artists I find very slow, I must say. 
Their films are slow, very -- poetic, very heavy. Full of senses, slow, gray. I 
can't explain it. Too heavy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyper-political," says Nils Peters, 26, another Dead Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do, it's more sarcastic," Breeda insists. "What they do is very 
serious . I saw this performance art in Dresden -- you know, people sitting 
around a fire wearing bandages, eating mushrooms." She rolls her eyes. "It was 
so . . ." pause . . . "depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS CONFUSED, CHAOTIC, work-in-progress of a city, the 
artists in east and west Berlin do not get along. The don't mingle with their 
formerly inaccessible peers, they don't share or hang out or communicate. 
There's no connection. Four years after reunification, Germany finds itself 
plunged deep in economic recession, battling record postwar unemployment -- 16% 
in the east -- and struggling to comprehend a frightening resurgence of violent 
fascism among its restive youth. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that the 
chasm between east and west Germans is as wide as it was before the heady, 
history days of November, 1989, when they were no longer divided by cement and 
electrified wire. 
</P>
<P>
 But here in Berlin -- with its centuries of collected artistic wealth, with 
its historic role as a haven for painters, musicians, actors and the avant 
garde and its ever-vibrant cultural scene (no less than two orchestras, three 
operas and about 50 cabarets) -- the division seems odd. Artists, a group you 
might suppose to be curious or at least non-judgmental, grumble and snipe and 
criticize each other. Instead of exploring what for so long was just out of 
reach, they have turned in on themselves, living -- as much as possible -- as 
they did before the Wall came down, in enclaves, in cocoons of friends, 
contacts and odd exhibition spaces. Like other Germans confronting the sudden 
end of decades of division, the artists of east and west Berlin regard one 
another -- for the most part -- with mistrust and distaste and contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's two extremes meeting," says Pontus Carle, a Swedish painter who 
frequently exhibits and sells his work in both east and west Germany. In the 
east, he says, the artists work more intuitively -- a function, perhaps, of 
having lived under a state that judged art for its political correctness rather 
than its quality, while in the west a more rational, capitalistic mind-set 
prevailed. "In the east, the problem was freedom, not competition," he says. 
"In the west, you would never want to introduce a fellow artist to a collector 
-- there's always competition." 
</P>
<P>
 For many westerners, it is a question of experience. Sure, they were 
interested in East Berliners at first, but then they found that beyond a 
superficial common ground -- language, nationality, age -- what did they share, 
really? What could they learn from those who were so isolated so long from 
Western culture? Many say that they find their eastern artistic peers to be 
dated, provincial, extremely defensive and unjustifiably lofty. 
</P>
<P>
 For many easterners, it is a question of money. Money that no longer comes so 
easily. Money that westerners flaunt with such arrogance. Money they are 
embarrassed and resentful that they need, now that state-guaranteed employment 
is a thing of the past. But there is more. Oh, say the east Berliners, those 
smug, superior Wessies. Oh, their commercial disposable, superficial art. The 
art that easterners created during their isolation was, they feel, purer 
somehow. Undiluted. Conversations with dozens of east Berlin artists share this 
common undertone: Whatever they gained in freedom of movement and conscience 
with the fall of the Wall, they say, they lost in freedom from worry over 
income, competition and output. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Wall was up, this was a creative island. I had nothing to do with 
the Stalinists and one could concentrate on art and poetry," says Maximilian 
Barck, an intense 31-year-old east Berliner who publishes art books and heads 
an artists' group called Herzattacke (Heart Attack). "In the last 10 years of 
the GDR (German Democratic Republic) there was a vacuum; there wasn't much 
pressure from the state. West Berlin artists had to pay rent for an apartment, 
studio, sell paintings. We didn't have that fear. We had free time; we were 
autonomous." 
</P>
<P>
 Barck is the epitome of the east German intellectual, spewing references to 
French philosopher Michel Foucault, Canadian writer Marshal McLuhan and 
Austrian painter Edward Munch in a single phrase, raging something about 
"mystical post-structural thinkers" and categorically condemning the ethic of 
profit and consumption that dominates the art world he discovered in 1989. In a 
torrential discourse, he makes distinction between real artists -- like himself 
and a few, rare others that he has met from the West -- and the mass of Western 
artists who, in his view, rack empty brains and emptier souls for salable 
ideas. To him, their work isn't art at all, it's a corrupt product of market 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone from the dictatorship of Stalinism to the dictatorship of 
money," he says, chain-smoking in a book-lined study of his sunny apartment. 
"It's a question of which one you can get away from more easily." Before 1989, 
Barck was officially a philosophy student, and worked a few hours a week at a 
pet store. Otherwise he consecrated himself to art. Then he paid 100 ostmarks 
(about $25) for the spacious apartment that housed his family. Now, Barck 
spends much of his creative time hustling his work, and he can barely afford 
the rent -- 650 deutsche marks, about $360 -- for the same apartment but has at 
least found a benefactor -- from West Berlin -- for Herzattacke. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer Tschernay is one of those artists. He wanders in, mid-conversation, 
barefoot, his face barely visible beneath a halo of shoulder-length frizz, 
glasses and a beard, sits down and helps himself to a cigarette. He is right at 
home. That's one thing about the art community in East Berlin: It is a 
community. There is an easy generosity and a camaraderie that seems to have 
long disappeared from society in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "In West Germany art has a different concept; the attitude is one of producing 
art for money. They produce art to be sold," says Tschernay, who used to teach 
art in his spare time, back when he had spare time. "Whereas in the east, by 
concentrating on art, by remaining true to our work, groups like Herzattacke 
have brought new ideas to the market." He says categorically: "Eastern art has 
more integrity than Western art." 
</P>
<P>
 BUT IS IT ANY GOOD? Well, that depends on whom you ask. If they often paint in 
the dark palette and aggressive brush strokes of German expressionism, east 
Berlin artists tend to follow two stylistic schools, abstract expressionism and 
expressive-style figurative painting. There are few other genres. A glance at 
catalogues and art galleries around the eastern part of the city shows that 
conceptual art -- art as an idea or a point of view rather than a creation -- 
never penetrated the Berlin Wall, and that the media and technology revolution 
that informed so much of contemporary art in Western Europe and America over 
the past 20 years never came to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, perhaps, east Germany's generous social conditions -- despite 
the repressive political situation -- allowed many mediocre artists to pursue 
their work in blithe ignorance of their talent, or lack thereof. Tschernay, who 
is now painting rainbow-colored abstract canvases and making sculptures out of 
objects like GDR matchboxes, wouldn't last long in a truly competitive artistic 
environment. And indeed, he may not. 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain -- but perhaps doesn't excuse -- the attitude of some west 
Berliners. "When I go to the underground (east Berlin) galleries, 95% of the 
stuff is just shit, 5% is OK and even then I don't know if (the artists) have a 
chance," says Volcker Diehl, the owner of an exclusive gallery just off West 
Berlin's Kufurstendamm, the fashionable shopping district. Diehl shows 
top-rated international artists such as Markus Lupertz, Helmut Middendorf and 
John Noel Smith. He still visits galleries in east Berlin, though not as often 
as he did just after the fall of the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it is just badly made; there is no idea of form, color and 
composition. They have no idea of a line in relation to two points, up or 
down," he says. "Or else it's just a copy. Sometimes I'll see something fresh, 
original -- it won't change the world, I don't expect an artists to change the 
world tomorrow -- but I expect something authentic and personal. Then I can 
respect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Diehl picks up a recent catalogue of work by Herzattacke artists. "For 
instance," he says, pointing to a geometric design, "this looks like Vasarely." 
He flips to a page of brown-and-black abstract images. "This looks like 
Kandinsky. It's pretty horrible," He turns the page to an unsigned drawing of a 
crucifix, and eye, a moon. "This is really bad," he groans. "This composition 
is really horrible. It's so obvious -- a moon, death, with an eye on top. It's 
like -- oh God -- this is for someone who's 15." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists who long ago defected to the West from the former East Germany tend to 
be even harsher in their judgments. The most successful among them -- Anselm 
Kiefer, Georg Baselitz or R.L. Penck -- have become giants in the contemporary 
art world. Baselitz, whose exhibit at New York's Museum of Modern Art opened in 
December and who recently had a show at the Pompidou Center in Paris, left East 
Berlin in 1956 when he was in his 20s and the Communist regime was at its most 
doctrinaire. The Wall was not erected until 1961, but Berlin was divided by 
armed guards and barbed wire. In his youth, Baselitz says, he could paint only 
what the state ordered, could exhibit and sell only through official, state-run 
organizations. So he left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artistically, it was a completely unreal situation," Baselitz says in a phone 
interview from his studio in Holle, near Hanover in western Germany. "Everyone 
lived off subsidies; for an artist it is not good, this getting money without 
making an effort. Everything you earn should come from your work," he says. 
Baselitz is equally condemning of the young generation's work. "It is 
impossible to compare them with what happened in France, the rest of Germany, 
or in America. They had nothing. No information, no material. How do you expect 
a young artist to create without having an idea of what is happening 
elsewhere?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so critical. Indeed, many artists, gallery owners and 
collectors in Germany say they expect the most interesting art in the coming 
years to come from places like east Berlin. The turmoil -- the shock of 
suddenly confronting everything in the Western world -- will certainly produce 
something exciting, particularly at a time when western cynicism over art 
seemingly reached its height. Like painter Klaus Killice, a 34-year-old east 
Berliner who since 1989 has devoured everything he can about the world he 
missed; his work has evolved dramatically, and Germany's prestigious "Art" 
magazine recently named him among a handful of the country's most promising 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 But even among lesser east Berlin talents there is something of this new 
energy -- like there is in east Berlin society -- something that hints at raw 
emotion and internal chaos. Something immediate and personal and . . . wild. 
</P>
<P>
 AN ENORMOUS, BLACKENED BUILDING with the odd sculptures on top dominates the 
skyline of Mitte -- literally "middle" -- a neighborhood of east Berlin that 
was once and soon will be again its business and commercial center. This 
hulking edifice -- Tacheles -- pulsates with sound from the street-level Keller 
Bar, where heavy metal music and heavier metal sculptures dominate the space. 
The sensations intensify as you walk up its four stories. Nearly every square 
inch is covered in graffiti and sound emanates from everywhere and nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor has a large performance area, with bleacher-like seating and 
two-story walls covered, on this day, with blue, geometrical paintings; someone 
is doing sound checks. On the third floor there are artists' studios -- 
cubicles divided by crude wooden planks -- and their equally-spare apartments; 
metallic dust and the sick whirring of an electric saw issues from one area, 
while the smell of spaghetti sauce wafts, a few feet away, from another. Next 
floor up is a loft-like exhibition space, on this day featuring the work of a 
Chilean artist, Juan Enrique Gabler: textured canvases in earth tones and 
collage-like works combining photos and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacheles is random and crude; it embodies the chaos and the creativity of 
post-Wall east Berlin. Like everything else here, this building has a history. 
A luxury department store in the 1920s, Tacheles was bombed during World War II 
and, like many buildings in east Berlin, never repaired. After 1989, a few 
artists came to squat: painters, along with Berlin's classic assortment of 
musicians, punks and anarchists and who have similarly commandeered dozens of 
run-down buildings and apartments in the east. But Tacheles quickly became a 
real cultural center. It now gets city, state and European Union funding, 
though its future is far from guaranteed: The building occupies prime real 
estate in east Berlin's burgeoning commercial center. An even more certain 
destruction awaits the area's other squats, city officials say, as Berlin 
prepares for its new role as Germany's seat of government by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment, here is where it is happening, in Mitte, with its 
galleries and avant garde restaurants, and farther east in Prenzlauerberg, with 
its lofts, squats and neighborhood cafes. But isn't it odd? These new east 
Berlin neighborhoods, pulsating the rhythm of change, have imposed their own 
kind of apartheid. Eigen und Art, a gallery owned by east Germans on the trendy 
Auguststrasse, exhibits exclusively east German artists. Kunstwerke, a 
west-owned gallery practically next door, exhibits and donates space 
exclusively to westerners, showcasing conceptual art. A few door down, 
Wohnmaschine exhibits Ossies; across the street Kunstwerke's second building 
give space to Wessies.  
</P>
<P>
 There are those who try to breach the persistent divide. Like Romen Banerjee, 
a talented, energetic young painter from west Berlin who organizes group shows 
and tries to include eastern artists. He says: "There is a west lobby and an 
east lobby and they don't trust each other. There are circles of people who 
help each other and they don't want to let others in, in east and west both." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Laura Bruce, an American painter who was welcomed into an artist's 
compound in eastern Prenzlauerberg; all her friends are east Berliners though 
her husband Edmond, an easy-going mathematician, is west German. "I think that 
right now the interesting stuff is going on in east Berlin. There is this 
incredible change, this incredible opening up. But this transition period is 
really tough," she says, admitting that her neighbors are often circumspect 
around her husband. "West and east -- they were taught they were each other's 
worst enemy for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 So. It turns out that 40 years does make a difference. It turns out that 
decades of socialist and capitalist acculturation does establish different 
values, different expectations, different ways of thinking. It's not a question 
of habit and familiarity. Though it's that too. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, they grew apart. Children were born and raised and knew nothing 
but the Wall; people died and were buried with their memories of another 
Berlin, Germany became two countries. Berlin became two cities; West Berlin, of 
despair and fear of nuclear holocaust. Punk, black city of cabaret and heavy 
metal. Graffiti, Pershings and John F. Kennedy. Art and avant garde and 
anarchy. And then east Berlin, of neat streets, empty plazas, cool restraint 
and communism. Child care and free abortion. Spies and swaps informers and 
defectors and Checkpoint Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 After 1989, everyone was curious. Westerners ventured east, easterners 
explored the west, and all rejoiced at what they had in common. For a while. 
But slowly they also saw that their lives would have to change. Berlin would 
become a capital, and there would not be room for the draft-dodger or the 
jewelry-maker; there would be bills -- big bills -- to pay and no more easy 
money for the pet store poet. 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S ONLY 8:00 AND HALF OF THE ARTISTS FROM HERZATTACKE ARE already swaying 
unsteadily amid clouds of blue-gray smoke. This isn't that unusual -- they 
drink often and smoke always -- but in fact tonight is a special occasion, the 
first exhibit of the group's work in a brand new space donated by their west 
German benefactor, Peter Jander. 
</P>
<P>
 A builder still in his 30s, Jander has made a fortune since 1989 redoing the 
ruined facades of east Berlin buildings, enough to take over a block-long 
office and donate the first floor to Barck and his buddies. Barck is ebullient, 
slapping backs and spouting verse; Tschernay has donned shoes for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The show varies widely, both in style and quality; two rooms are devoted to 
Pontus Carle, the successful Swedish abstract expressionist, who befriended 
Barck, and another room to the promising work of an east Berlin abstract 
painter, Mikos Meininger. But another section displays surrealist paintings of 
birds and brain stems by the easterner Thomas Weber that are technically solid, 
but unoriginal. 
</P>
<P>
 They are surviving, the artists of Herzattacke, though not all have come 
through this period unscathed. Klaus Bendler, a painter/photographer wrapped in 
an overcoat and an alcoholic fog, has twice attempted suicide since 1989, the 
Barcks say. Once he tried to hang himself and Barck rushed to his apartment and 
cut him down. Everyone in east Berlin has heard of other successful suicides of 
artists and of others who -- in fearful panic -- destroyed all of their work 
when the Wall came down. Since the night of this opening, Bendler has checked 
into the psychiatric wing of east Berlin's Charity Hospital. It has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easterners have an inferiority complex," says Swedish painter Carle. "They 
have had a very hard time dealing with the new situation: All the criteria, the 
frame of reference they had before has changed. They don't want to open up to 
the west. On the other hand, it strikes me that in east Berlin there is a kind 
of closeness between artists that you don't see anymore in the west," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This western style of living -- we're not used to it," says Sybilla Barck, 
Maximilian's wife. "We really think that in east Berlin there is more real art, 
with a base of expression. In the west, a painting may technically be very 
good, very chic, very modern. But it has no spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Western gallery owner Diehl scoffs at this attitude, but he doesn't write off 
eastern artists indefinitely. "It's difficult. I'd say the chance that 
interesting, young, new art will start over there is much better than anywhere 
else in Germany. But if it will happen, we'll have to wait of a couple of 
years," Diehl says. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take time, this reunificiation business. It will come in increments; 
it is already beginning. One of the Dead Chickens, Henryk Weiffenbach, has a 
girlfriend from east Berlin. A step. West Berlin's Peter Jander has committed 
himself to investing in the artistic future of Herzattacke, whatever it may be. 
Another step. Andreas Rost, a sincere 27-year-old with some photos at the 
Herzattacke show, wants to study from photography experts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is afraid, in a certain sense. But we have to go through it, we have 
to be stronger, I accept that," says Rost. "I'm living that right now. We 
always had a roof over our heads, something to eat. But we were in an 
ideological straitjacket. Our writers, our painters -- where are they?" he 
asks. "Now we will see who is strong enough to make it."

THE TROUBLE WITH MALE-BASHING; IT USED TO BE A POLITICAL STATEMENT, BUT NOW

 CROSS THE LAND, THE MANTRA IS REPEATED: My husband left me because I'm fat. I 
can't get any dates because men like girls, not women. Well, I'm sorry but I'm 
not going to dress like a slut, no matter what the magazines are saying. I 
dress for me, not some guy who's out for what he can get. Did I tell you that 
my boss smokes a cigar? He's a pig, but you know what? The 20th Century is 
almost over and I don't think the male pig is going to survive. They're going 
the way of the woolly mammoth, then we'll see who's whistling now. What can I 
tell you? Same old story. Men are all after one thing. And you know what? I've 
finally figured them out. They don't really like sports, they just watch TV as 
a way of avoiding women. And why do they always leave the toilet seat up? Such 
a simple thing, but no matter how many times you say it, you can't drum it into 
those little brains of theirs. Of course, you know where their brains really 
are. In their pants. That's where a man does all his thinking. Down there, but 
it's not his fault. That's the way nature made him. Haven't you figured that 
out by now? By the way, have you ever thought about what would happen if men 
got pregnant? You better believe they'd find a way to get rid of labor pains. 
They are all a bunch of babies anyway, couldn't possibly t ake care of the real 
thing. Hey, no wonder the country's such a mess. Liberty and justice for all, 
yeah, right. Ever check out the population of Capitol Hill? In case you haven't 
noticed it's the mother of all men's clubs. Maybe I should say father. You know 
what I mean. By the way, just for the record, I believe Anita Hill. Lock him up 
and throw away the key! But, of course, that's not what happened. Well, you 
know what? Why should women have to put up with filth in order to make money 
and have a lot of credit cards? I guarantee you, men never had to. That's 
because they have the buddy system. Spelled B-U-D-D-Y, which is a man's name of 
course. How come women don't have the Shirley system, I ask you? Well? Good 
question, right? Hey, the dice are loaded and the dealer works for the house, 
is the answer. That's why I Betty Broderick. That's why I'm writing in Lorena 
Bobbitt for President. Whoops, I forgot, Hillary's already got the job. Thank 
the Goddess! She's a lot smarter than that dim-bulb hubby of hers. Did you hear 
Gennifer Flowers is writing a book? At last the world will know -- the most 
powerful man in the world is an SOB! By the way, my heart goes out to Mary Jo 
Buttafuoco. Too bad she didn't have Joey whacked . . . .  
</P>

 FRANKLY, IF I WERE A MAN AND HAD TO LISTEN TO THIS STUFF all the time, I'd 
probably (a) get into serious substance abuse; (b) take hostages in a fast-food 
restaurant, kill five, then self; (c) never ever think of not leaving the 
toilet seat up, or (d) run away and join the circus. As it is, I'm a woman, and 
although, with the exception of (c), I've connsidered the previous options for 
different reasons and often am drawn to (d) because I think being shot out of a 
cannon would be a lot of fun, I am disheartened by the wave of male-bashing 
that continues to wash across the land, building in its fury as each day 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 What's driving this gale-force emotional tsunami? The foul, prevailing winds 
of our time: television talk shows featuring discussions that require angry and 
resentful people who can communicate only via microphones; carpetbagging 
experts on the self-help circuit who exploit gender differences in order to 
peddle facile opinions (often involving never-the-twain explanations for male 
and female behavior, such as the recent, cute and best-selling Men Are From 
Mars/ Women Are From Venus origin theory), and the popular modern religion -- 
blame thy neighbor. (In the '80s, a corollary of the latter phenomenon was 
"blame Ronald Reagan," which I suppose was a particularly rarefied form of 
male-bashing, although plenty of men indulged in it as well. Personally, I'm 
still blaming my parents, but as far as I remember, they didn't molest me, so I 
haven't yet killed them). 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the matter at hand. Before you say, "Why isn't feminism on this 
list?" let me explain why it's not. As far as I'm concerned, the term has been 
rendered useless over the years, pounded into oblivion by those who have 
managed to make vast numbers of people believe that it means the female version 
of the Third Reich (as in human air bag Rush Limbaugh's use of the term 
feminazi ), or "weird, anti-male philosophy espoused by disgruntled, 
non-orgasmic women with no sense of humor." (Incidentally, why doesn't anybody 
ever criticize other disgruntled and possibly non-orgasmic groups, such as the 
NAACP or Republican Party for not having a sense of humor?) 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, the early stage of the women's movement (to use a less loaded 
term) was certainly a channel through which female anger was expressed and 
validated, and the wave of male-bashing that rages today has been, pardon the 
expression, facilitated by that movement. But so have a lot of other 
non-rage-related manifestations, including everything from Women in Real Estate 
to the Children's Defense Fund. But at some point, among some women, the anger 
became not a catalyst for a change, but a social tic. Even if Ms. magazine 
issued a general retraction for the entire women's movement, male-bashing -- 
the stalking horse of what has become the conventional world of gender politics 
(more on this later) -- would rage on. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish I could say that the Neanderthal comment "Men are jerks" had gone the 
way of the dress shield, but I can't. In any given group of women, the remark 
generally goes uncontested, cutting across class and racial lines faster than a 
trip to a 7-Eleven. Twenty years ago, the sentiment carried a political 
justification; "Men are jerks" or "Men are pigs" was shorthand for a world view 
that questioned those in power, who were mostly men. Today, it's shorthand for 
a world view that makes a wide range of behaviors the exclusive province of the 
male sex, including everything from sitting in bars all night to having 
extramarital affairs. But this kind of social shorthand creates a Cliff's Notes 
version of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be acceptable to routinely state that black people, or women for that 
matter, are jerks? Or pigs, no less? Not in most circles. But if you believe 
that in the beginning was the Word, as I do, then it follows that words define 
the world (that's why the ancient Hawaiians had more than 200 words for surf, 
for example, and not one for waffle iron). To consistently bash men invokes a 
landscape of problems, of partners who couldn't possibly be responsible for 
their own actions, of negative expectations that are fulfilled time and time 
again: "Didn't I tell you he was a jerk?" "Don't say you weren't warned!" and 
"What did you expect? They're all a bunch of jerks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Is this kind of unrelenting anger healthy? Certainly, emotional cataclysms are 
just as productive as those that happen in nature; in "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" Martha took George apart for the same reason that Yellowstone burnt 
down: to start over. Yet, judging from the trail of tears tread on the talk 
shows, where on a daily basis women weigh in on everything from men who sleep 
with their mothers-in-law to men who can't make their own beds, today's social 
disaster has left in its wake not a phoenix rising from the ruins but a legacy 
of stranded and overturned relationships that characterize our terrain just as 
surely as the jackknifed big rigs we read about in the papers every day. 
</P>
<P>
 People wonder if talk shows are an accurate mirror of what's really going on, 
and I'm afraid they are. One of my friends recently left her husband because he 
did not make as much money as she did. "Why do I have to pay for everything?" 
she often said to the knowing nods of many of her female friends. In other 
words, even given the changes of the past 20 years, it is still socially 
acceptable for a woman to earn less than a man, or even nothing, but a man with 
a low income is viewed by many successful women as defective or powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tales get worse. "My wife and I were trying to have a baby," another 
friend told me. "When we found out that the infertility problem was mine, she 
left me." Outside of gothic novels and robe-clad areas of the world where 
scion-production is paramount, I have yet to hear of a man leaving a woman 
because her eggs are less than Grade A. But maybe that's because they're all 
just a bunch of jerks. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on a more public note, we must consider the case of Lorena Bobbitt. For 
those of you who have been sidetracked in recent months by the travails of 
Michael Jackson, or perhaps even by life itself, Lorena Bobbitt is the woman 
who, acting in retaliation against an alleged incident of marital rape, waited 
for her husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, to fall asleep. Then, in a state of 
temporary insanity, she sliced off his penis and drove off with it in the 
family car, eventually tossing the fleshy symbol of Western civilization in a 
neighbor's yard like a flyer from a new Thai restaurant. And so materialized 
the trials of John Wayne and Lorena, the down-and-dirty equivalent of the 
legendary Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs tennis match. What actually happened 
in the Bobbitt bedroom? Legally speaking, nothing; both parties have been 
acquitted. But Lorena Bobbitt has attracted more attention than a manifestation 
of Christ on a taco. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of faces, should Lorena's face be on a stamp? Judging from the number 
of women, not to mention proud, placard-toting members of the Latino community, 
who appeared outside the courthouse in Manassas, Va., every day and applauded 
her every appearance, the answer is, move over Amelia Earhart and Marianne 
Moore, make way for the female avenger. Indeed, Lorena Bobbitt is a sad parody 
of a comic book heroine, wielding a kitchen knife like a housebound She-Ra by 
night and returning to life as Betty Crocker by day. I say "parody" because she 
was not defending the rights of others when she acted against her husband; she 
was acting on her own behalf against a dozing aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems clear that Lorena Bobbitt was battered by her husband, and I have 
great sympathy for anyone who endures physical brutality. But the elevation of 
her to the level of role model serves only to belittle those battered women who 
have left their abusive husbands without resorting to mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the breaking of this story, the radio talk-show 
telephone boards were aflame with opinions. It wasn't difficult to guess who 
was going to say what. In perhaps the most predictable -- and embarrassing -- 
broadcast time warp devoted to this topic, the painfully not-funny KFI gabfest 
host, Stephanie Miller, lightheartedly asked listeners to phone in and answer 
the question whether Lorena Bobbitt should have cut off her husband's penis? 
Results: women say men are jerks; men are sleeping on their stomachs from now 
on and an author calls to plug her new book, "It's Always the Man's Fault." 
</P>
<P>
 LET'S SEE IF WE CAN QUICKLY RECAP 2,000 YEARS OF WESTERN HISTORY and get to 
the bottom of this. As I recall, the whole thing started when the war-loving 
Romans conquered the peace-loving Greeks. All hail Caesar! who put his face on 
a coin and thus became the first to equate being a (white) man with money. Then 
some really big, hairy guys called Huns took over until they were displaced by 
people with funny hats who called themselves Popes and institutionalized the 
"my way or the highway" philosophy that years later was to inspire both Frank 
Sinatra and Sid Vicious alike. At some point a linebacker-sized man named 
Charlemagne, who was apparently a good swimmer and probably a heckuva football 
player, too -- but football had not yet been invented, as another big guy named 
John Madden was not yet around to yell, "Hey, wait a minute!" -- conquered some 
ineffectual men known as the Lombards and ruled the Saxon Empire (forerunner of 
Saks Fifth Avenue, although there was no shopping, just plenty of looting), 
until the Anglos went off and ruled the world. Down to the sea in ships and 
Hail Britannia! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not forget Columbus, who sailed from Italy or Spain, depending on which 
male historian you believe, to what is now called America, where he found a 
bunch of other guys who were already living here and gave them some trinkets, 
which paved the way for subsequent arrivals of guys who conquered the guys who 
were already living here. Some time later, ensuing generations of the 
conquerors carved the faces of four of their heroes onto some American rocks, 
which became famous for being the location of "North by Northwest," a movie 
made by a weird guy named Alfred Hitchcock, who in spite of his weight and 
double chin was considered attractive because he was a guy who made movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the 1950s: Along came beatniks, bongo-playing folk who wore black and 
said it all by referring to men as "Daddy-O." This was also the time of "Father 
Knows Best," which was actually one of the first public acts of male-bashing as 
it really meant "Father Knows Less." A few years later a guy named Bob Dylan 
"plugged in," and a lot of people pumped up the volume and got mad at Dad. The 
Dad in the White House was bombing Hanoi, the Dad in the university dean's 
office was ordering other Dads to tear-gas students, the Dad in the classroom 
was teaching Dad's warped version of history, and the Dad at home was playing 
golf with all of the other Dads. Well, all right! Two-thousand years after 
Greece tanked and Rome did the end-zone victory dance, women picked up their 
marbles and left the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did they go? Workshops mainly. Study groups. The library, to investigate 
a lost history. Or, as some prefer, herstory. Living rooms, to start 
organizing. The streets, to show what they could do. On journeys that were 
inward bound. One result -- slogans that summarized the new way of looking at 
the world: "Sisterhood is powerful" and "The personal is political." These 
slogans were, and in many ways still are, emblematic of the sea change which 
has affected modern life in the late 20th Century. By talking with their 
sisters about their personal lives, women have indeed found common ground and 
-- again, here comes another expression that needs to be pardoned -- empowered 
themselves as a political group. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why we have the phenomenon of gender politics. Or, to use the 
buzz-phrase used by groups who want to discredit other groups -- 
"special-interest groups" -- in this case, women, whose special interest is 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly gender politics has resulted in many positive changes for women over 
the past 20 years. There has been the historic Roe vs. Wade decision, which has 
eliminated back-alley abortions. There has been vigorous anti-rape legislation. 
There has been the doctrine of "equal pay for equal work," which although not 
yet fully in practice, is now part of every discussion on social policy. There 
has been the election of many women to political office at every level of 
service around the country. And there has been the appearance of women with 
what passes for opinions in beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is a negative side to gender politics. Single-issue politics, 
regardless of what group is organizing around which issue, is ultimately 
divisive, weakening the foundation of the body politic like a degenerative hip 
ailment. Single-issue politics is also boring, and more important, oblivious to 
the fact that everything is connected. Gender politics has put forth an 
us-vs.-them philosophy that serves only to continue the baring of fangs and 
keeps everyone in their own caves. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, half of Saskatchewan has been chopped down to service supposedly 
pro-environment women readers who are convinced that the world's problems 
derive only from sexual differences. These trees now appear in the form of such 
books as "Toxic Men," "The Dance of Anger" and "Co-Dependent No More." In the 
recent and highly touted "Fire With Fire," Naomi Wolf (although generally 
advocating an "inclusive feminism") writes about women who are afraid to speak 
out about women's issues because they work in a company town. "Even seemingly 
powerful women are not free of this constraint," she states. "Callie Khouri, 
the screenwriter of 'Thelma and Louise,' said to me that despite her success, 
she was apprehensive for her career after having 'come out' as a feminist. She 
added sadly that a whole stratum of Hollywood women at the top of the power 
pyramid are secret feminists who dare not show their beliefs too openly." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is that no one in Hollywood shows their beliefs too openly for 
fear of saying the wrong thing. That's why the remark of preference is "I love 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was another recent bestseller, "You Just Don't Understand," a book 
that attempts to bridge the gap between the sexes, but actually serves only to 
widen it. In it, anthro-author Deborah Tannen puts forth the idea that men and 
women speak two different languages, and that each sex would do well to try to 
decode the language of the other. I don't dispute Tannen's research. However, I 
do take issue with the basic concept. Everybody speaks his or her own language, 
and it takes months, even years, to learn to read the hieroglyphics of those 
around you. One man's grunt may be another's arf; I find some of the women I 
know more inscrutable than many of my male friends. To reduce the problems a 
man and woman may have communicating to the general one of gender difference 
rather than to explore them as the more complicated one of personality 
difference is demeaning to everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Tannen's sound-bite analysis of profound relationship rifts is perfect 
for a country predicated on a history that says happiness is not a result of 
selfless activities but an exit ramp on the freeway that you can locate with 
either a foot or car pursuit; let's buy all these self-help books and treat the 
opposite sex like cute people from a foreign country with whom we should 
exchange a handy phrase-decoder ring and then we'll all be . . . happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads to the question: If Betty Broderick had read "You Just Don't 
Understand," would she have chosen not to murder her ex-husband and his new 
wife? Would Anita Hill have translated the infamous "pubic hair on the Coke 
can" remark of Clarence Thomas as perhaps simply a bizarre example of 
glossolalia involving soft drinks, rather than sexual harassment? Who knows? 
The fact is, gender politics has given rise to the canonization of these women 
at the expense of others who are challenging society in more imaginative ways. 
Women who celebrate double-murderer Betty Broderick fail to take into account 
that she was not forced to put her husband through law school, nor was she 
forced to remain in the unhappy marriage and drive a BMW and live in La Jolla 
and shop in Newport Beach after he had become a prominent attorney. There's 
always a choice, and Broderick made hers. 
</P>
<P>
 And since the public spectacle of the Clarence Thomas hearings, in which Anita 
Hill testified about sexual harassment, there has followed the so-called Anita 
Hill effect -- a phenomenon that resulted in a flurry of corporate seminars on 
how to treat co-workers of the opposite sex (why have incomprehensible 
instructional videos replaced the Golden Rule?) and a wave of bumper stickers 
that dismiss half the world's population with the smug proclamation: "They just 
don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 I am not saying I am in favor of sexual harassment in the workplace, or any 
other place for that matter. Yet I feel that in the unfettered pursuit of 
gender politics, women have made a grave mistake in not examining broader 
issues, such as that of office harassment in general. What men have had to put 
up with over the years to rise through the corporate and bureaucratic 
marketplace, frankly, is just as odious to me as sexual harassment. But men 
have not lobbied against such wage-slave requirements as mandatory lying to 
cover up company crime, mandatory company retreats, mandatory obsequiousness 
toward higher-ups, mandatory cocktails with the boss's brother-in-law, and so 
on. Maybe they should. However, in their fight against sexual harassment, women 
have failed to take into account that power always resists a challenge, and 
change is always met with resistance. If women could stop taking the general 
unfairness of the workplace so personally, they would find allies rather than 
enemies among their fellow worker-bees. But politics makes strange bedfellows, 
or perhaps I should say that bedfellows make strange political alliances, and 
unfortunately men have been overlooked in what should be a double-pronged war 
against what Tom Wolfe once described as the practice of "making them jump" in 
the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? IF, AS GENDER POLITICS WOULD HAVE IT,the personal is 
political, then it is also sociological and physiological and anthropological. 
Male-bashing -- ironically, a result of women becoming more assertive and 
therefore "manly" -- has got to stop. Revenge may seem sweet, but as anyone who 
ever got even by short-sheeting a bed can attest, being jolted awake by an 
unordered 3 a.m. triple-cheese-and-pineapple pizza delivery can only lead to 
the end of the world if there's no one there to share it with you. Or as Mom 
always said: "Two wrongs don't make a right." "I suppose if everyone jumped off 
a cliff, you'd do it, too." "Why don't you just march right over there and 
shake hands?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the Arabs and Israelis can do it, if the Crips and Bloods can do it, then 
so can men and women. It's time for women to pick up their marbles and return 
to the playground. But what about deadbeat dads, domestic violence and 
discrimination in the workplace? Explaining such behavior away by simply saying 
that men are jerks who are occasionally dangerous misses the point and adds to 
the problem. Alas, we all possess the jerk chromosome. But there's only one way 
to end a state of siege, and it's no secret that women can increase the peace 
with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 And if there are some women out there who don't buy that argument, here are a 
few others: Men scare other men off. Men give piggyback rides. Men invented 
baseball. Men smell like men. Men build big fires. Men get upset when they 
lose, and as the late New York Yankee manager Billy Martin (one of my favorite 
men) liked to say: "If losing doesn't matter, why do we bother to keep score?" 
And finally, even though they always leave the toilet seat up, men invented the 
toilet (sorry, gals, the inventor was Thomas, not Thomasina, Crapper). 
</P>
<P>
 So how about it? It's time for a new mantra. I think I know what it is. To 
paraphrase a recent popular query: "Can't we all just get it on?"

STAGE WATCH: THEATRE CORP. EXPANDS TO NEW AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. of America, which operates the Pasadena Playhouse and Glendale's 
newly restored Alex Theatre, continues to spread its wings -- to Riverside and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The company begins managing the 1,462-seat Riverside Municipal Auditorium on 
Tuesday. Because of limited fly space, Theatre Corp. won't take its Pasadena 
plays or its Alex musicals there. Instead, the company will book the hall to 
others. The city of Riverside has pledged $500,000 in capital improvements and 
will receive 25 cents from each ticket sold, as well as 5% of non-performance 
rentals. The city and Theatre Corp. are continuing talks regarding the Fox 
Theatre, another Riverside venue that might eventually host Theatre Corp. 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, assuming negotiations are completed, those Theatre Corp. musicals 
will play the new 1,800-seat Thousand Oaks Civic Auditorium. It's expected to 
become the fourth link in the circuit that starts at the Alex and goes to the 
Spreckels in San Diego and the Warnors in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. edged out the Theater League, the Kansas City- and Phoenix-based 
company that brings such fare as "The Sound of Music" and "Les Miserables" to 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium, for the Thousand Oaks deal. "We opted to go with 
someone who's more progressive, more innovative," said Harry Selvin, the 
programming subcommittee chairman of the commission that runs the Thousand Oaks 
center. "We felt some of the more modern shows would be accepted more than the 
dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Alex series is on the cutting edge of contemporary art. Its first 
three shows include the venerable "Mame" as well as two new musicals based on 
old properties: "Sayonara" and "Fame." However, since the Theater Guild has 
booked the Pasadena Civic, its shows have all been very familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Theatre Corp. will bring in six shows for two weeks each, while 
Theater League was proposing four shows, one week each, according to Tom Mitze, 
executive director of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks hall won't be ready in time to host the first or second 
series of Alex shows. But the third series will arrive in January, 1995, said 
Mitze. He also expects Theatre Corp. to present a special inaugural musical in 
November. Titles aren't yet known. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. reports early Alex shows are doing well. "Sayonara" attracted 
more than 20,000 theatergoers to the Alex, filling 81% of the seats. "Given 
that we had an earthquake, I'm very pleased," said Theatre Corp. Chief 
Operating Officer Lars Hansen. There were 13,605 Alex subscribers at last 
count, plus nearly 7,000 at the Spreckels and 4,800 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Theatre Corp. will pay $5,000 a week in rent, plus 5% of the 
gross between $200,000 and $300,000 and 10% of the gross over $300,000. 
Although the parties have agreed on basic terms, said Selvin, conclusion of the 
three-year deal was delayed by the earthquake and the Alex's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 OH SUSANA: Santa Susana Repertory Co., formerly of Simi Valley, is expected to 
become the resident professional company in the 400-seat Forum Theatre at the 
new Thousand Oaks Center. Artistic director Lane Davies plans to do "Man of La 
Mancha" (Sept. 16-Oct. 29), "A Christmas Carol" (Dec. 9-23), a to-be-announced 
play (Feb. 24-March 19, 1995) and "Little Shop of Horrors" (April 21-May 21, 
1995). He'll use a thrust stage, reducing capacity to 349 to qualify for an 
Actors' Equity's Small Professional Theater contract. 
</P>
<P>
 YET ANOTHER 'PHANTOM': "Phantom" fanatics, look out for Version No. 4. 
Riverside Civic Light Opera will present a "Phantom of the Opera" with a book 
by Bruce Falstein and songs by Lawrence Rosen and Paul Schierhorn, opening 
Friday for two weekends. It follows -- and shares a set with -- the Bakersfield 
Civic Light Opera production of the same show, which closed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Phantom" was commissioned by New York real estate mogul Abe Hirschfeld, 
and played at his Miami Beach Clarion Castle hotel for four months in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside production, at Landis Auditorium in Riverside Community College, 
lacks an Actors' Equity contract; this qualifies it as community theater, as 
opposed to a professional production. 
</P>
<P>
 A BITTER WOMAN?: Diana Gibson, who runs the Cast Theatre in Hollywood, is now 
on stage as well as off. She has taken over the role of the landlady, recently 
vacated by Ellen Ratner, in Justin Tanner's dark comedy about apartment life in 
L.A., "Bitter Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Most L.A. theater observers know Gibson only as a producer. But she took 
acting classes once a week throughout childhood. She appeared in dozens of USC 
productions on campus and at the Edinburgh Festival -- John Ritter played her 
son in 12 different productions. She even got her Equity card in a production 
of "Feiffer's People." So she's now expected to pay herself the token 
reimbursements required under Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan.*

GRAMMY TIME; GRAMMY'S CLASS CONTENDERS (AND THOSE THAT COULDA BEEN) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Classical Grammys have traditionally been a popularity contest, signifying 
approval by recording industry professionals -- members of the National Academy 
of Recordings Arts and Sciences -- less of the year's artistic best than what 
sold the most and/or was most soothingly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year's 35th Grammy awards, this column tended to be a collection of 
gripes, doggedly piling irony upon irony over the presumedly conflicting 
interests of commerce and art that govern the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, either because of my inability to invent new lyrics for the old, 
minor-key song or because real change had taken place, a kinder perspective 
emerged here. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Grammy, now 36, reflects a mild downturn again, with the omission 
from the list of a too-vast-to-enumerate number of artistically, sometimes even 
commercially viable productions in a year when the recording industry expended 
more than the usual effort on behalf of non-safe repertory and significantly 
boosted gifted, commercially untested performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the industry's relatively visionary activity -- insufficiently 
reflected by the Grammy finalists -- may have resulted from its realization 
that we don't really need 67 CD versions of "Pictures at an Exhibition" (though 
that didn't preclude the release of versions 68 through 74). 
</P>
<P>
 Enough. Onward, to a clear-eyed appraisal/summary of what was offered to the 
National Academy membership, with the occasional, teary-eyed lament for what 
was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting it out in the apples-and-oranges best classical album category are 
Anne-Sophie Mutter's darkly impassioned performance, with conducting and 
orchestral playing to match by James Levine and the Chicago Symphony, of the 
Berg Violin Concerto (Deutsche Grammophon); Michael Tilson Thomas' insightful 
presentation of Debussy's "Martyre de Saint-Sebastien" (Sony), and the Baroque 
grandeur of "Venetian Vespers" from British period forces under Paul McCreesh 
(Deutsche Grammophon), the last constituting heartening evidence of the 
antiquarians' acceptance by the slow-moving Grammy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there's a strong Bartok program, "Cantata Profana" and "The 
Wooden Prince," alas, indifferently led by Pierre Boulez (Deutsche Grammophon), 
and a weak offering by the usually irresistible mezzo Cecilia Bartoli of 
18th-Century Italian songs (London). The latter, in an act of illogic evocative 
of Grammy's worst old days, fails to top its own category, best vocal 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion? For me, a Berg-Debussy toss-up, but with a gut feeling that in a 
year in which he has achieved such visibility and respect, Tilson Thomas will 
win, despite his obscure repertory and Mutter's decolletage. 
</P>
<P>
 Best orchestral performance combatants include the above-mentioned "Wooden 
Prince," some nice but unnecessary favorite Barber with David Zinman and the 
Baltimore Symphony (Argo), and Debussy handsomely done by Boulez and the 
Cleveland Orchestra (Deutsche Grammophon) in a virtual repeat of material that 
years back won them a Grammy on another label.  
</P>
<P>
 My prize-winner, but unlikely to be that of the National Academy masses, is "A 
Portrait of Charles Ives" (EMI), mixing some of his crankiest and loveliest 
pieces, done to a delectable turn by Ensemble Modern under Ingo Metzmacher. And 
there's more tractable Ives from past Grammy favorites Leonard Slatkin and his 
Saint Louis Symphony (RCA). 
</P>
<P>
 The fainthearted oracle speaks: Barber could sneak in, to no one's utter 
dismay or palpable excitement, as the Boulezes and Iveses cancel each other 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best opera recordings offers challenging choices while omitting two personal 
favorites, Monteverdi's "Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" (Harmonia Mundi) and 
Rossini's "Il Turco in Italia" (Philips), and ignoring the operatic kingpins, 
Verdi, Puccini, Mozart and Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there's the first recording of Britten's 1953 "Gloriana," with 
non-stellar performers under Charles Mackerras (Argo); a La Scala production of 
Gluck's majestic "Iphigenie en Tauride," Carol Vaness in the title role and 
Riccardo Muti conducting (Sony), and Valery Gergiev directing his Kirov Opera 
ensemble in another non-favorite, Prokofiev's "War and Peace" (Philips). Oh 
yes, and John Adams' "Death of Klinghoffer" (Elektra/Nonesuch) got enough 
negative publicity to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leaves Handel's "Semele" (Deutsche Grammophon) as potential favorite, 
starring beloved-by-Grammy Kathleen Battle, her stock among the membership 
undoubtedly boosted by her burgeoning Baddest Girl of Opera reputation. The 
recording's winning potential is enhanced by the presences of Marilyn Horne and 
Samuel Ramey. A less obvious asset is John Nelson's erudite and vital 
conducting of excellent British instrumental and choral forces, proving that 
stylish presentation of Baroque opera can be achieved on modern instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Best choral performance includes the previously noted "Martyre de 
Saint-Sebastien" and "Venetian Vespers" as well as Roger Norrington and his 
Schutz Choir of London scraping the barnacles off Brahms' "Ein Deutsches 
Requiem" (EMI), while Leonard Slatkin, the Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra 
attack and partially subdue the bloat of Vaughan Williams' "Sea Symphony." 
"Cantata Profana," still unsatisfactory, shows up again here. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner? (Wishful thinking?) Debussy again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the instrumental soloist with orchestra competition, my favorite, Mutter's 
Berg (teamed with a glum work by one Wolfgang Rihm), is up against one of the 
few repertory works in contention anywhere, Brahms' D-minor Piano Concerto 
zestfully played by Stephen Kovacevich (EMI). Then, too, Richard Stoltzman 
expertly serves up Copland's over-recorded Clarinet Concerto (RCA), while the 
not-yet-starry-enough-for-Grammy violinist Gil Shaham offers the concertos of 
Tchaikovsky and Sibelius (Deutsche Grammophon). 
</P>
<P>
 There's some irony in the sudden popularity of Leon Fleisher, snubbed by 
Grammy when he was one of the world's top two-handed pianists. Now, bereft of 
the use of his right hand, he is nominated for Sony recordings here and in the 
soloist-without-orchestra category for his playing of works written 
specifically for lefties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the all-alone category, Bach's French Suites are sent bye-bye by 
pianist Andras Schiff (London); Barber's piano music is played by John 
Browning, a master of the idiom (MusicMasters), and the rare Concerto for Solo 
Piano by 19th-Century eccentric Charles-Henri Alkan is dazzlingly delivered by 
Marc-Andre Hamelin (Music & Arts). 
</P>
<P>
 The likely winner is none of the above, but pianist Richard Goode, long a 
favorite of East Coast cognoscenti and now attracting a much wider audience. 
Goode's entry is the final installment of his splendid traversal of the 32 
Beethoven sonatas (Elektra/Nonesuch). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was miffed by the exclusion from the chamber music finalists of the smashing 
set of Haydn's Opus 64 Quartets by the Kodaly Quartet (Naxos) and the Tokyo 
Quartet's sumptuous Britten and Barber (RCA). But the Emerson Quartet's 
steelier Barber, with the two Ives Quartets, is in the running (Deutsche 
Grammophon), as is a sizzler on the same label, the two Prokofiev Sonatas from 
violinist Gidon Kremer and pianist Martha Argerich, while veterans Janos 
Starker and Rudolf Firkusny clock in with their Martinu cello-piano sonatas 
(RCA). 
</P>
<P>
 The real chamber head-to-header involves starry ad hoc groups: Itzhak Perlman, 
Pinchas Zukerman and Lynn Harrell having their lusty ways with the Beethoven 
String Trios (EMI) and the quartet of Isaac Stern, Emanuel Ax, Jaime Laredo and 
Yo-Yo Ma expending too much obvious effort to suit the sexy elegance of Faure's 
Piano Quartets (Sony). 
</P>
<P>
 The best classical vocal performance list includes Anne Sofie von Otter's 
superbly poised Grieg recital (Deutsche Grammophon) and a treasurable 
collection of live performances by the late Arleen Auger (Koch). 
Sentimentalists are targeted by "Farewell to Salzburg," a lieder set from 
70-year-old Christa Ludwig (RCA), while Sylvia McNair chirps her way through 
some Mozart and Handel (Philips) and Gabriela Benackova (with Firkusny) essays 
songs by Czech masters (also RCA). 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous by their absence are two releases which seemed surefire finalists: 
the shattering performance by Jessye Norman of Schoenberg's "Erwartung" 
(Philips) and Roberta Alexander's heavenly Barber recital (Etcetera). 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to lament as well the absence among the finalists in various 
categories of Sibelius' grandiose "Kullervo," with Esa-Pekka Salonen leading 
the Helsinki University Chorus and L.A. Philharmonic (Sony); the magical score 
for "The Tempest," also by Sibelius, from the Lahti Symphony under Osmo Vanska 
(BIS); the Chopin Ballades stunningly played by an inspired original, pianist 
Nikolai Demidenko (Hyperion); and Kyoko Takezawa's soaring, searing Bartok 
Second Violin Concerto, with Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony (RCA).*

GRAMMY TIME; HIS ROSE GARDEN WAS FULL OF THORNS; MANY ARTISTS HAVE PEAKED WITH 
GRAMMY GLORY, BUT NONE MAY HAVE HAD THE TALENT OF JOE SOUTH -- OR AS TRAGIC A

 When Joe South's "Games People Play" won a Grammy in 1970 as the song of the 
year, it was more than a moment of glory for the songwriter. It was the first 
time a hard-edged -- for its time -- rock entry had won in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennon and McCartney's ballad "Michelle" had been named best song three years 
earlier, but it fit into the conservative Grammy tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Games People Play" was a biting commentary about misplaced values that 
combined the influences of two of South's musical heroes: the gospel-edged 
country-rock of Elvis Presley and the lyric bite of Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 But South wasn't thinking about rock history when he stepped to the podium to 
accept his award, one of two he won that night. He was just trying to avoid 
falling on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real sad," South, 53, says now, sitting in his music publisher's 
office with his wife of seven years, Jan. "I staggered up and sort of leaned 
against the mike and said something, but I don't even remember. . . . The drugs 
had taken over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many promising young artists have failed to live up to their nights of Grammy 
glory, but none had the talent of Joe South -- or, possibly, as tragic a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his own hits, he wrote "Down in the Boondocks" for Billy Joe Royal and 
"(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden" for Lynn Anderson. He also played guitar 
on such hits as Aretha Franklin's "Chain of Fools" and Bob Dylan's "Blonde on 
Blonde" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of artists who have recorded his songs: Elvis Presley, Deep 
Purple, Harry Belafonte, Lena Horne, Bryan Ferry, Linda Ronstadt and k.d. lang. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three years of his Grammy victory, however, South had withdrawn from 
the record business because of drugs and other personal problems and had moved 
to Maui, where he spent a couple of years "just walking up and down the beach 
and hiding in the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Atlanta, he released his fourth album in 1975, but it was poorly 
focused and didn't sell. A dazed and confused South then dropped out of sight, 
where he has largely remained all these years, quietly hoping to feel strong 
enough to return to the music world. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer-songwriter's problem during his hit years wasn't cocaine or heroin, 
drugs often associated with the rock scene. He was addicted to prescription 
drugs, including the amphetamines and tranquilizers that, he says, had helped 
him block out deep-rooted insecurities for years. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition was so bad around the time of "Games People Play" that South 
wasn't able to follow through on the career steps, including high-profile 
touring and TV exposure, that should have made him a celebrated figure in the 
pop-rock world. 
</P>
<P>
 While his Grammy hit was blaring from radios around the country in the spring 
of 1969, South was playing dives in the Carolinas. There were some impostors 
booking themselves as Joe South and playing bigger rooms than he was, he now 
says ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South was born in 1940 in Atlanta, where his father was a paint and body shop 
worker who loved country music and his mother was a housewife who enjoyed 
writing poetry and short stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Fond of such country stars as Hank Snow and Hank Williams, South (whose real 
name is Joe Souter) started singing and playing guitar when he was around 11 
and landed a weekly guest spot in 1951 on a local country music radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's host, Bill Lowery, who eventually built a recording-publishing 
empire in Atlanta, encouraged South to write songs. By his mid-teens, his 
allegiance switched from country to rock, thanks in large part to the arrival 
of Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to be Elvis," the singer-songwriter says. "Everything about 
him seemed magical. When I first heard 'Baby, Let's Play House,' I dropped all 
the hillbilly music." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1958, South had his own hit record, a novelty titled "The 
Purple People Eater Meets the Witch Doctor" that was written by J. P. 
Richardson, the Big Bopper. 
</P>
<P>
 The song went to No. 47 on the national charts and earned South a spot on Dick 
Clark's "American Bandstand" show. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Atlanta, played clubs and continued to write, but he didn't get 
another record on the charts until 1962 when the Tams, a local R&B group, 
recorded his "Untie Me." It was No. 1 throughout the South for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving shortly afterward to Nashville, where there was a larger music scene, 
South was in much demand as a recording session guitarist. He played on records 
by artists as varied as Simon & Garfunkel and Conway Twitty. 
</P>
<P>
 His most memorable session was Dylan's "Blonde on Blonde." That's South 
playing lead on such tracks as "Just Like a Woman" and "Stuck Inside of Mobile 
With the Memphis Blues Again." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in awe of Dylan because he introduced a whole new language to 
songwriting," South recalls. "Before him, there was this idea that you could 
only use certain words or images in pop songs, but he started putting in words 
that you'd expect to just find in books and in poetry. He opened everything 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 South's songwriting became his strength and he scored Top 10 hits in the late 
'60s thanks to Royal's version of "Down in the Boondocks" and Deep Purple's 
rendition of "Hush." 
</P>
<P>
 With that confidence, he turned to making his first album, which was released 
in 1968. Titled "Introspect," it was an ambitious work that included "(I Never 
Promised You A) Rose Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was South's own version of "Games People Play" that earned him 
international respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, the games people play now  
</P>
<P>
 Every night and every day now  
</P>
<P>
 Never meaning what they say  
</P>
<P>
 Never saying what they mean  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where the hit and the Grammy recognition brought South the validation he had 
long sought, he found it difficult to deal with all the attention -- and it 
apparently drove him deeper into drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could get in touch with me," he says of that time. "I had a problem 
with talking on the phone. . . . Shyness. I dreaded to talk to anybody about 
anything. . . . Don't know why. I guess it was just part of my sickness with 
the drugs and shyness." 
</P>
<P>
 The most crippling moment for him was the suicide in 1971 of his younger 
brother Tommy, who had played drums on the "Introspect" album 
</P>
<P>
 "I blamed myself for (the death)," he says. "I felt like fate had for some 
reason smiled on me, lavished this fortune on me . . . and Tommy never did find 
himself as far as making his fortune in the world . . . and that was partially 
the reason for his suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 After the time in Maui and a failed comeback album in 1975, South couldn't 
shake the depression. His first marriage ended in divorce. (He has a son, 
Craig, 19, who is studying singing and acting in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 By the late '70s, South was written off in the industry. He was widely 
dismissed as a drug casualty and someone who was difficult to work with. He 
shakes his head now in disbelief when he thinks about how many potential 
projects he sabotaged over the years of his erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goose was cooked in the record business and the song business," he says 
now. "Nobody even knew me anymore. I was gone from the scene. I felt like a 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the vigor of his vocals and the slashing power of his guitar work 
during his prime, there's something shy and delicate in South's eyes as he sits 
in his publisher's office, 30 to 40 pounds heavier than in the hit days and no 
longer wearing his hair in a modified Beatles cut. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if South has been through so much that he's hesitant to speak about 
new dreams and goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he and Jan, a social worker whom he married in 1987, were cautiously 
optimistic on this afternoon. He had just checked out of another recovery 
program and felt he was better equipped than ever to make another run at the 
music business. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to name a favorite line from his songs, South turns to "Down in the 
Boondocks," the 1966 hit about a poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks in 
love with an out-of-reach rich girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The line he chooses once expressed South's own underdog story of growing up on 
what he felt was the wrong side of the tracks. The words can now been seen as 
an expression of his hopes of making vital new music: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One fine day, I'll find a way  
</P>
<P>
 To move from this old shack.  
</P>
<P>
 I'll hold my head up like a king  
</P>
<P>
 ...and I never, never will look back  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South was drug-free when the couple met in 1986, but the problems eventually 
resurfaced and he went into a hospital recovery program in the late '80s. 
Things then went smoothly until the relapse last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real sad thing about it is that just around the time of the relapse, Joe 
had gotten active in music again . . . doing some shows around town . . . and 
it bothers me to think of the correlation between his career and his problem," 
Jan says. "I think there's been a tendency on his part to think when he's 
writing that he needs the drugs to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 She looks over at South and he nods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've reached a turning point at last," he says. "By allowing 
chemicals to be a god in my life for so many years, I've cut myself off from 
the things I love about music. It's not the pills that wrote those songs." 
</P>
<P>
 South, who says he'll watch the Grammy telecast on Tuesday, pauses and looks 
at his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got faith that I'll be able to keep at it . . . to express myself again 
in my music. I'd like to get a DAT studio together and record some of my new 
songs. But if I find myself falling back again, I'll just give up the writing. 
I'm not going to let this kill me."*

 AND ONE MORE THING: While the picture of a quake-damaged apartment building on 
the cover of "Sink With California," the new single by veteran L.A. punk band 
Youth Brigade, might seem at first glance like crass exploitation, closer 
examination reveals that it was done with good intentions: A line of type on 
the sleeve notes that half of the proceeds from the record will be donated to 
earthquake relief organizations. Aging punks can have good hearts too.*

GRAMMY TIME; THE TOP 10 & THE BOTTOM 10; YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR OUR OPINION, BUT 
HERE IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Cross and Toto have five Grammy Awards apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, the Who, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, 
combined, have a grand total of . . . one . 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the Stones' 1986 Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mick Jagger told the Grammy audience when accepting the belated lifetime 
honor, "The joke is on you." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot more laughs you can get by looking back over some of the Grammy 
choices. We've come up with our 10 favorite faux pas selections -- records that 
were so far from the creative heart of pop music that they were embarrassments 
the moment they were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also have been times when the Grammy voters chose wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's our vote for the 10 best Grammy choices ever -- and the 10 worst. The 
Best  
</P>
<P>
 10. Paul Simon's "Graceland," record of the year, 1987. The album of the same 
name won as the best album the year before, but this bubbly single was still an 
underdog in the best record competition, having reached only No. 81 on the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Bobby Darin's "Mack the Knife," record of the year, 1959. A bold victory 
for this brash newcomer, who also won the best new artist award, beating out, 
among others, Edd (Kookie) Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
 8. D.J. Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, "Parents Just Don't Understand," best 
rap performance, 1988. It's not that the song is so great -- it's just silly 
fun. But as the first rap Grammy, it deserves some credit. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Marvin Gaye, "Sexual Healing," best R&B male vocal, 1982. Better late than 
never -- this was the great soul figure's first Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Crosby, Stills & Nash, best new artist, 1969. Fellow nominee Led Zeppelin 
was equally deserving, but given the Grammy history, Chicago would have been 
the more expected choice. 
</P>
<P>
 5. John Lennon & Yoko Ono, "Double Fantasy," best album, 1981. It's easy to 
write this off as a sympathy vote, but it was great to see Ono acknowledged by 
the music establishment on any terms. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Temptations, "Cloud Nine," best R&B performance by duo or group, 1968. 
Hardly the best Temptations performance, but -- believe it or not -- this was 
the only Grammy awarded to a Motown act in the '60s, when the label truly was 
"the sound of young America." 
</P>
<P>
 3. George Jones, "He Stopped Loving Her Today," best male country vocal, 1980. 
Jones had long been respected and influential, but his first Grammy award was a 
pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 2. U2, "The Joshua Tree," best album, 1987. A rare case of the album that most 
clearly shaped its time actually winning -- and the competition wasn't slack, 
with Michael Jackson's "Bad" and Prince's "Sign 'O' the Times" also nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Beatles, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," best album, 1967. 
Even with the Beatles' enormous popularity, it seems little short of a miracle 
that the conservative Grammy voters honored such a revolutionary work. The 
Worst  
</P>
<P>
 10. Henry Mancini, "The Music from Peter Gunn," album of the year, 1958. When 
this slight collection -- built around the novelty value of the "Peter Gunn" 
title theme -- beat out such landmark works as Frank Sinatra's "Come Fly With 
Me" and "Only the Lonely" in the first Grammy ceremony, we should have known 
there would be trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 9. The Kingston Trio, "Tom Dooley," best country song, 1958. A campfire 
standard-to-be, sure, but best country song? A folk category was added the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Bent Fabric, "Alley Cat," best rock 'n' roll recording, 1962. This 
instrumental by a Dutch musician was just a step shy of Muzak, but still beat 
-- among others -- Sam Cooke's "Twistin' the Night Away" and the Drifters' "Up 
on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
 7. Anita Kerr Quartet, "We Dig Mancini," best performance by a vocal group, 
1965. Academy voters were still hoping that the Beatles -- whose song "Help!" 
was also nominated -- were just a flash in the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Glen Campbell, "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," best album, 1968. Better 
than the Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" and Simon & Garfunkel's "Bookends," 
which were also nominated? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Christopher Cross, five awards, 1980. Cross' lightweight debut album was 
more distinguished than Pink Floyd's "The Wall"? . . . The lazy song "Sailing" 
was better than "Fame" or "New York, New York"? . . . Cross was a more 
significant new artist than the Pretenders? . . . Right, whatever the voters 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Gale Garnett, "We'll Sing in the Sunshine," best folk recording, 1964. Talk 
about being immune to the changes in pop music. This mellow, quickly forgotten 
entry actually beat Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Jethro Tull, "Crest of a Knave," best hard rock/metal performance, 1988. 
The category was introduced in 1988 to honor the new wave of aggressive rock 
bands, such as Metallica and AC/DC. So you can see why the Shrine Auditorium 
crowd's stunned silence when the winners -- hard-rockers, not -- were announced 
was as deafening as Metallica's performance at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A Taste of Honey, best new artist, 1978. The disco group "Boogie Oogie 
Oogie"-ed over the Cars and Elvis Costello and was never heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Milli Vanilli, best new artist, 1989. There was some talk in the academy of 
adding a "best lip-syncing with dreadlocks" category the next year . . . just 
kidding.

RESTAURANT NEWS: WHEN IN DOUBT, NAME IT AFTER MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When The Lipp opened on Melrose last summer, in what used to be the coffee 
shop Mel 'n' Roses, consulting chef Fred Eric put together a menu featuring 
American classics at recessionary prices. No entree -- even the Thanksgiving 
turkey dinner with fixings -- cost more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers hoped that when Eric left to open his own restaurant in Los Feliz, 
the place would survive. The Lipp hung on another three months after Eric's 
departure, but has now closed. "It got to a point where it wasn't worth keeping 
open," says Eric. "I think it was a combination of the high rent and the 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Eric's Los Feliz restaurant is almost ready to open. One of the toughest 
parts of the process for Eric was coming up with a name. The chef-owner had 
planned to use three horizontal dots, an ellipsis, to denote the restaurant he 
is opening next month. But symbolism didn't do much for rock star Prince's 
career -- and he was already rich and successful. Fellow chefs encouraged him 
to give the place a real name -- "What do you say when you call information for 
the number?," they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After thinking it over, Eric named the restaurant Vida, after his mother. "It 
seemed like a nice thing," says Eric, "and my mom's happy." He's keeping the 
dots too -- they're under the name.  
</P>
<P>
 Vida is located in the space that used to be Duplex restaurant. Eric has 
installed live fish tanks in the kitchen and also plans to use the giant smoker 
that came with the place. Dishes will include things like noodles with 
whitefish, smoked chicken with tortellini, and pressed sandwiches.  
</P>
<P>
 "The food's great, the design's great, the kitchen's great, the crew's great," 
says Eric. "(Vida) is going to be a real boost for the culinary scene." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE CLOSURES: Two more Melrose Avenue restaurants have called it quits. Bruce 
and Katherine Veneiro, creators of the L.A. Garlic Festival, have closed their 
restaurant/jazz club Nucleus Nuance. In the '60s, the place was famous for its 
health food, but the cooking evolved with the times. Eventually angel hair 
pasta and duck with cranberry-papaya sauce co-existed on the same menu with a 
burger called Ra, The Untouchable and the Oak Grove cheese-and-walnut loaf. No 
word yet on the status of the Garlic Festival. . . . Former private chef 
Gaetano Patrinostro -- his clients included Dino De Laurentiis and Tina and 
Nancy Sinatra -- has closed his three-month-old Lupo Ristorante. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THIS SPUD'S FOR YOU: Realtor Steve Karch who owns Carlos and Pepe's in Malibu 
has divided the restaurant in half (and, some customers complain, wrecked the 
panoramic ocean view). One side continues as Carlos and Pepe's, a Mexican 
restaurant; the other half has been remodeled and turned into Alanna's On The 
Beach, co-owned by Karch's fiancee, Alanna Kelly, a model and former "Bud 
girl." Alanna's chef is Guillaume Burlion, who has cooked at Chaya Brasserie 
and L'Orangerie, and before that he was chef to Francois Mitterrand. At 
Alanna's he's cooking things like filet mignon with a crust of golden potatoes, 
paella Alanna, duck Guillaume and angel hair pasta with seafood. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MORE OPENINGS: The Pasta Shoppe's Maria Teresa Endara, who brought fresh pasta 
to Los Feliz 11 years ago, has opened a second Shoppe in Montrose. . . . The 
Biltmore Hotel has opened a European-style cafe with take-out lunches in 
Pershing Square. Biltmore Executive Chef Roger Pigozzi is in charge of the 
menu. Open for breakfast and lunch, Pershing Square Cafe offers salads, gyros, 
tacos, Italian pressed sandwiches and more.*

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: RUSSELL'S: JACKSON ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it first opened, Russell's, a small, romantic cafe on La Cienega 
Boulevard, had a lot going for it: young, rising-star chef Russell Jackson and 
a fine, small wine list. Recently it gained one more attraction: a serious beer 
list.It's true there are lots of places with beer lists longer than a Tarkovsky 
screenplay, but they are normally the sort of places with burgers and ribs and 
boisterous bar scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's is a fairly quiet, civilized room -- the rowdiest patrons might be 
the group of doctors from Cedars-Sinai ("We're foodies!" one boasts) who try to 
out-macho one another with details of their daily exercise regimens: "I do 120 
pushups," says one. "Well, I only do 100," says another, "but I do them 
one-legged." 
</P>
<P>
 And the food, as well as it matches a complex Chimay Ale, is equally suited 
to, say, a California Pinot Noir. Jackson has cooked in several L.A. 
restaurants, including Citrus and Rebecca's, and it's clear he's learned a 
thing or two. His open-faced ravioli, influenced more by New Orleans than 
Milan, is sort of a shrimp etouffee with a tri-colored lid of large, crisp 
ravioli that are too doughy but beautiful to look at. On special one night he 
served baby back ribs, crisp-crusted and tender, on a bed of lentils and 
peppers -- too sophisticated for a brew pub, too delicious to ignore. Not 
everything works as well. In a couple of years, Jackson may become a major chef 
in this town; right now he's one to follow. 
</P>

GREEK INVESTOR TO REFURBISH ONASSIS YACHT FOR $40 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Greek investment broker said Friday he will sink $40 million into 
refurbishing the late Aristotle Onassis' celebrated 325-foot yacht Christina, 
which he bought two weeks ago for $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Blastos, a 28-year-old entrepreneur who grew up in New England, said 
that a two-year refitting project will restore the craft beyond the opulence it 
had enjoyed under its former owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Blastos said the yacht, once visited by the likes of Greta Garbo, Frank 
Sinatra and Sir Winston Churchill, will be decorated with statues of Greek gods 
and fitted with a 24-seat dining room table made of gold, ivory and lapis 
lazuli. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will keep or upgrade all of Onassis' rooms, right down to the gold 
faucets. 
</P>
<P>
 Blastos, who is based in Athens, said he bought the yacht at auction last fall 
and had just finalized the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 The Greek consulate in New York said Friday that after Onassis' death, the 
Christina became property of the Greek state and was used by visiting 
dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 When the craft began to age and became unwieldy, it was transferred to the 
Greek Navy, which was in charge of its sale, the consulate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blastos said the massive two-year refitting project will take place in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be more spectacular than anybody could imagine a boat could be," he 
said, adding that the project would employ thousands of people.

COLORADO TAKES AIM AT REARMING CITIZENS; OLD WEST: DEBATE HAS BECOME SO BITTER 
THAT ONE LEGISLATOR NOW WEARS A BULLETPROOF VEST. GUN PROPONENTS HAVE BEEN 
WARNED THEY CAN'T PERSUADE LEGISLATORS WITH THREATENING LATE-NIGHT PHONE CALLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Colorado, once home of such gun-toting legends as Butch Cassidy, the Sundance 
Kid and Doc Holliday, is caught in cross-fire over proposals to let law-abiding 
citizens carry concealed firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions are strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the Wild West where you walk down the street and you have your 
gun and I have mine and the quickest man wins," said state Sen. Regis Groff. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has become so bitter that a legislator started wearing a 
bulletproof vest. And gun-law supporters have started warning their members 
they can't educate legislators if they keep threatening them in late-night 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just make them more sure that they want you disarmed," the Firearms 
Coalition of Colorado advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Four bills pending before the Legislature would allow anyone who qualifies to 
carry a gun. A fifth bill was killed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen states have laws allowing non-felons to obtain licenses to carry 
concealed weapons, and Vermont simply has no law prohibiting the carrying of 
weapons. Some of the more liberal laws are on the books in Montana, Washington, 
Oregon, West Virginia, Georgia and Florida. Fifteen states prohibit it. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder, including Colorado, require applicants to show a specific need 
for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado allows a law-abiding resident to get a permit to carry a gun, but 
police chiefs and sheriffs have refused to issue them to all but a few, citing 
fear of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not fair, said supporters of proposals to loosen restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe citizens should have to worry about being caught by police 
with a firearm" or being unarmed while facing a criminal, said Jeff Lloyd, a 
member of the National Rifle Assn. and a supporter of one of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Griffin, an analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, 
said she gets about 40 calls a year from legislators who want to know how to 
liberalize gun laws. But she said she gets 400 calls a year on how to make gun 
controls stronger, and most of those calls involve tougher juvenile gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Roy Romer said most residents don't want to return to the days when 
everyone in Colorado was allowed to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some people deserve this kind of permit, and they need to have a way 
to get it," he said. "But I don't want a society where everybody has to carry a 
weapon. I do not want us to become an armed camp." 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Ken Chlouber, sponsor of one of the bills, said opponents are 
trying to impose urban standards on rural constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad guys have got the guns. Let's give the good guys the same 
opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Diana DeGette, whose proposal to raise the legal age of buying a 
gun to 21 was killed in the House, said the trend nationwide is toward gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the gun lobby is beginning to realize that, and they're becoming 
desperate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think carrying a concealed firearm helps solve violence. I don't 
think people in Miami feel safer just because everybody can carry a gun. 
Florida is now fifth in the nation for violent crime," DeGette said.

STAR TREK EXHIBIT OFFERS FAR-OUT SCIENCE TO EARTHBOUND; SAN FRANCISCO: IN 
ADDITION TO EXOTIC MISSIONS, AUDIENCE LEARNS ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY, 
TRIANGULATION AND HOW WAVE FORMS AFFECT THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF RADIO 
TRANSMISSIONS.

<P>
 The planet of Kutta faces destruction from a rogue asteroid. Red-alert sirens 
wail, muffled thuds echo through the room. At the helm of the U.S.S. 
Enterprise, 8-year-old Travis Buck positions a reverse tractor beam that will 
deflect the asteroid and save the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 A schematic on his screen gives the position of the beam and the projected 
path of the asteroid. He presses the blinking "fire" button. Slowly the 
asteroid curves to the right, out of the path of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are a true warrior," says Lt. Worf, security officer in the "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis has saved the inhabitants of Kutta -- and learned a few elements of 
basic physics too. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on a Wednesday morning, the Star Trek: Federation Science exhibit at the 
California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park is full of fans beaming down 
to planets, helping Lt. Gordi LaForge realign the Enterprise's navigational 
computers and zeroing in on a distress signal from a shuttle craft with a 
breached warp core. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, for the science teachers in the audience, they're learning about virtual 
reality, triangulation and how wave forms affect the signal-to-noise ratio of 
radio transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, everyone's having a lot of fun. Travis is here for a special 
birthday present. He's a major Star Trek fan, something that seems to run in 
the family. His uncle has flown all the way from Montana just to spend the day 
at the exhibit with Travis and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both big fans. They collect everything to do with Star Trek," said 
his mother, Kristen Wells. The family drove for more than an hour to spend the 
day at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother called Star Trek a good influence on Travis, who wants to grow up 
and invent warp drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He uses words and concepts that really surprise me. He's a complete science 
buff because of the show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, built around concepts from the Star Trek phenomenon, flows 
seamlessly into intriguing science lessons. Pressurized air-powered rockets 
illustrate the physics concepts of action and reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered around a model of an invading virus, Jason, Zachary and Joshua 
Killmaier fight against time to fit antibodies into the receptor sites at the 
virus' edge. Over them, Dr. Beverly Crusher lectures on the biology of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like a game of air hockey, but when the brothers have vanquished the 
virus, 10-year-old Jason pauses to cogently explain the biological basis for 
their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all into science," said Joe Killmaier, their father. "They all watch 
Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 All across the exhibit, children stare in rapt attention at their screens, 
moving effortlessly between 20th- and 24th-Century science. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so their adult counterparts. Michael Gaylord of San Francisco failed in 
his attempt to save the planet that Travis so ably defended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are relieved of duty!" Lt. Worf barked from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to use these computers," Gaylord muttered.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Away Team section, families line up to enter the transporter room, 
where they're beamed down to an idyllic planet. On a screen, they see their 
images projected into a green world where crystalline entities buzz and bop 
around them like soap bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors get an anti-xenophobia lesson at booths that let them see themselves 
as alien. In a kind of interspecies political training, they peer at busts of 
familiar Star Trek aliens, including Ferengis and Klingons, and manipulate 
light levels until their features merge with the alien. Voila -- instant 
cross-species understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone present pretended that they were there to educate their children. 
Simon and Ginger Bate saved a few planets of their own over the course of the 
morning, but 13-month-old Julian seemed unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly appreciate all the science things here, but I came for the Star 
Trek," Simon Bate said. "We never miss an episode." 
</P>
<P>
 The education exhibit, which was designed by the Oregon Museum of Science and 
Industry in Portland, opened there in January, 1992. Two identical traveling 
Star Trek exhibits will tour throughout this country and Canada. Star Dates and 
Star Sites

SAFE HAVEN; CHILDREN GET RESPITE AND RELIGION BEHIND THE THICK WALLS OF SANTA 
ANA'S HEART OF JESUS RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no tagging allowed on the walls of the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center. 
This, says Sister Eileen Sullivan, is God's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana center's cleanliness is one of the first things youngsters 
notice. Many come from the nearby gang-infested neighborhoods; they are used to 
walls scrawled with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are always impressed by the bathrooms," Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Sisters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart, the retreat 
center offers respite and religion to children and adults. Most hear about the 
center through their local parishes, prayer groups or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are the most frequent visitors. They come for one-day retreats from 
all over Southern California, some from the roughest areas of Santa Ana, 
Compton and East Los Angeles. A few youngsters are already gang members. Some 
have seen older siblings get in trouble with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters lead the children in games, crafts, skits and, of course, prayer. 
In addition to the one-day retreats, they run a Sacred Heart Kids Club and 
Sacred Heart Teen Club. For a few hours after school each week, members enjoy a 
tranquil hiatus from their often-chaotic existences. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the support they find here, the children think they can do better than 
their older brother who's in prison," Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at home or school, trouble in the neighborhood -- the children check 
all of that at the door. The sisters tell their visitors that the center was 
built for them, a safe haven from the world outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the regulars at the Wednesday afternoon Kids Club is Anne, a 
developmentally disabled 12-year-old whose father died several months ago. (The 
names of the children have been changed.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Anne wants us to pray for someone," says Sister Doreen Reinke, the club 
director, during a recent meeting. Anne stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend Michael got shot in the leg while walking home from school with 
me," she says, bursting into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children are no strangers to the perils of drive-by shootings and 
gang life. Later, during craft time, 12-year-old Richard stops coloring long 
enough to offer Anne worldly advice: "Whatever you do, don't wear all black. 
People will think you're in a gang and shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
 There's 11-year-old Juan, who has flunked out of every school he's attended, 
say the sisters. "There's abuse in his background," says Sister Susan Blaschke. 
</P>
<P>
 "In school, there's too much violence. Here they teach you how to handle your 
problems," Juan says. "The nuns don't tell you, 'Don't come anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There's 12-year-old Julie, tall and slender with straight brown hair, whose 
parents are divorced. Her mother, a stewardess, is out of town for a month, she 
tells a sister. She lives with her mother's roommate during these long 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what their background, the children know they are accepted here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't yell at them or tell them they're wrong," says Sullivan, the clubs' 
assistant director. "What we do here is we love them unconditionally. Our 
purpose is that, when they leave here, their hearts will have some hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the children come from troubled environments. Some have happy 
families and comfortable homes. They come to the club because their parents 
think it will be a positive experience. Still, there are enough children 
contending with divorced parents, street fights and abuse to make the sisters 
worry about life beyond their thick, adobe-style walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are dealing with things (adults) never had to deal with in (their 
youth)," Blaschke says. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting away from all that for a few hours a week can lead to noticeable 
changes in even the most hardened youths, Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you treat them like a real person, they start to act like one. They 
start to dress a little different. Their clothes begin to fit them instead of 
being so huge. Their vocabulary changes. They begin to drop the gang language. 
They take little steps. It's a new start." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan, for instance, was highly aggressive when he started coming to the Kids 
Club one year ago. He'd egg on the other children, picking fights and 
disrupting the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinke began meeting with him separately. The two would do projects together, 
such as making crafts or assembling a bicycle. While they worked they would 
talk about getting along with others, about why he'd been expelled from school 
and what he could do differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Juan attends the club meetings faithfully. His hand is the first to 
shoot into the air when the sisters ask questions or seek volunteers for skits. 
When he made it through three trouble-free meetings, the sisters rewarded him 
by taking him to Antonello's (free lunch for the sisters and their charges is a 
standing offer at the upscale Santa Ana restaurant). 
</P>
<P>
 "He had never been to a place like that before," Blaschke says. "I think he 
had about six Shirley Temples." 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns don't preach or punish. If they did, they'd probably scare off their 
charges. Instead they get their message across by singing songs (including a 
rap number about God written by Reinke) and performing skits that can have the 
kids howling as the nuns take the parts of misbehaving children. 
</P>
<P>
 In one skit, Reinke plays a girl who is more interested in watching TV and 
loudly slurping chocolate milk than helping her mother unload 12 bags of 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "What should I have done?" she asks the children. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-year-old Latino boy steps in to take her place and demonstrate how the 
child should act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Mom. Do you need help with the groceries?" asks the little actor.  
</P>
<P>
 The kids applaud. But from the back there's a voice of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have just said, 'Hi, Mom,' " says a dark-haired boy, an apparent 
expert on avoiding household chores. 
</P>
<P>
 The message behind the day's skits, according to Reinke: "Living for Jesus is 
not living for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The skits deal with matters that are both practical and spiritual. When the 
sisters discovered some children were free to play outside until late at night, 
they offered some simple advice: Get inside before dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the children don't have any boundaries or curfews," Sullivan says. 
"There are 11-year-olds playing at 1 in the morning on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The playground is where the sisters often communicate best with the children. 
During a heated game of basketball or whiffle ball, a child might venture up to 
one of the sisters and confide in her about a problem at home or school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a real important time to see we're normal. They'll listen better," 
Blaschke says. 
</P>
<P>
 The day ends on a quiet note, with the children gathered around Reinke inside 
the chapel that's grown dark with the long shadows of twilight. They say a 
prayer out loud and in sign language. Using their hands makes them "less 
antsy," Blaschke says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sacred Heart sisters are Catholic, they hold retreats for adults 
and children from all faiths. The society was founded in Hungary in 1940 by Ida 
Peterfy. Persecuted by the Communists, the sisters fled to Canada in 1950 and 
joined the Los Angeles Archdiocese in 1956 to establish their motherhouse. The 
retreat center began operating in Santa Ana in 1979, and a new expanded center 
opened in January 1992 serves about 1,000 people a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight nuns live at the center's convent and conduct retreats five or six days 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 To belong to the Kids Club, children pay 1 cent, a dollar or whatever they can 
afford each week. The center relies on donations from the community, 
particularly the annual Gentlemen's Haberdashery fund-raiser and fashion show 
that will take place March 17 at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendance of both clubs varies from week to week, depending on how many 
children can make the trip and how many take friends. The Kids Club averages 
about 40 children, age 8 to 12, from all over the county and from all ethnic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The club would be larger except many children have no way to get to the 
center. The lucky ones can ride their bikes or get rides. Some children take 
three buses to get the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked one boy, 'Why do you come?,' " Sullivan says. "He said, 'Because I'm 
accepted here.' "

EACH FEBRUARY, THE FUR FLIES AT THE WESTMINSTER SHOW. THIS HOMAGE TO OUR 
ABILITY TO SHAPE AND RESHAPE ROVER IS A VERITABLE FEAST OF MONEY, SPORT, FUN 
AND POLITICS.; PUTTIN' ON THE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The air is redolent with talcum powder, hair spray, musky fur, wet towels and. 
. . . Do they still call it doggy doo? 
</P>
<P>
 And the noise: the whoosh-blast of hair dryers, some larger than vacuum 
cleaners, the metallic clatter of scissors, clippers and nippers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are barks and BARKS! yips and snorts, and baleful caterwauls. And 
everywhere the chatter of people in a knowing patois: champion this, whelp 
that, sire here and litter there. 
</P>
<P>
 We are backstage at humankind's original laboratory for genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cage doors slam, heavy crates roll down the hallways on push carts. Quivering 
wet noses poke at passersby, and sometimes a sodden pink tongue emerges to 
slurp a nearby face. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the biotech boom, petri dish or the electron microscope, 100 
centuries before discovery of the gene and how to splice it, way back to the 
first faint pages of recorded history, men and women have indulged their 
wildest fancies to shape and reshape the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And once a year, as they have for 118 years, the elite of American dogdom 
gather in New York City to celebrate their feats. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show 1994 -- money, fun, sport, 
glamour, competition, controversy and politics of the most fervent kind. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Americans earnest at play. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not just happen , you know, that there is a Chihuahua and a Saint 
Bernard, a golden retriever and a basset hound, a Chinese crested and a petit 
basset griffon vendeen -- and more than 140 other breeds recognized by the 
American Kennel Club. 
</P>
<P>
 People composed them. 
</P>
<P>
 And what imagination. In all the world, in all history, no other animal has 
taken on such range of shapes, sizes, colors, personalities and function. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," confirms George Padgett, professor at Michigan State 
University's College of Veterinary Medicine. "There is no other species like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, at Madison Square Garden, during two lengthy days each February, more 
than 2,000 dogs and 10,000 people, having invested millions of dollars in the 
quest, meet under the TV lights in seven show rings to answer the question that 
burns in their hearts, if not necessarily yours: Who has the best dog in 
America? 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other sporting event, the Kentucky Derby, has been around longer. And 
probably none has accumulated so much hidebound tradition. There are larger 
shows, but none so prestigious. It's tuxedos and evening gowns, but watch where 
you step. Every dog here has already earned its title as a show dog champion in 
the AKC registry. This is the championship of canine champions, a combination 
Miss America Pageant, Olympics, Chicago livestock exposition and Palm Springs 
country club social. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Roger Caras, author and voice-of-God ring announcer at 
Westminster, to describe these dog people: "At best, they are a strange lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Attention dog experts: Yes, we know you are reading. Yes, we know of the many 
boiling arguments about purebred show dogs. And yes, we will get to them in a 
minute. First, let's poke around the show floor a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 From 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. each day, Westminster competitors await their calls 
to the rings from "benching" areas beneath the grandstands. This is a crowded, 
jostling, aromatic bazaar where breeders and dogs -- and their promises of 
puppies to come -- display themselves to spectators, who have paid up to $57 
for a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Over this din rises a thunderous, truly profound and satisfied snore. Cowboy, 
champion bulldog from Moline, Ill., has lapsed into repose at Row 4A. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snoring? Ha. I'm sharing a hotel room with a lady and her chow. She 
warned me about her snoring. Ha. Back home we sleep with 10 bulldogs. We take 
them with us in our motor home. Come here, Cowboy, give the lady a kiss," says 
Judy Johannsen, Cowboy's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 She is handing out business cards and espousing the merits of these onetime 
fighting dogs, with heads the size of soccer balls and rumps like beefsteak 
tomatoes; with their undershot jaws, smashed-in noses and comically bowed legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I researched for the right breed. I wanted the least aggressive dog I could 
get. I supervise the animal shelter in Moline, and so I looked through 15 years 
of dog-bite records. Not one bite by a bulldog. After that, bulldogs chose me." 
</P>
<P>
 That a dog bred as a ferocious fighter has been transformed into one of our 
most gentle pets underscores the wonders of selective breeding on parade at 
Madison Square Garden. Darwin recognized that creatures evolve by the selection 
of nature. Dogs demonstrate the nature of humans to meddle. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, what does an aging British lord do when he no longer can keep up 
with his setters in the hedgerows? Voila ! He creates a dottering, jowly, 
oversized spaniel with undersized legs and a drowsy disposition. Almost anyone 
can keep pace with the clumber spaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a laid-back dog. So take Jeremy here. When I want to go, he goes. 
And when I stop, he stops. I've got eight clumbers," says Patrick Dionne, of 
Beacon Falls, Conn. Jeremy awakens, rises for a pat on the head, then collapses 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 By one count, there are about 55 million dogs in the United States. And 
Americans spend more than $11 billion per year to feed, groom, shelter, nurse 
and amuse them. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fraction are purebreds registered with the AKC. Even fewer are entered 
at the AKC's 7,000 or so shows each year. Those that make it to Westminster 
have won enough points at other shows to be classified champions that conform 
most closely to specified standards for each breed and that have been 
campaigned hardest on the show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Once here, they compete for three awards, but no prize money. For best of 
breed, there are 148 winners, which then compete within seven groups of similar 
breeds. And those seven winners are entered for judging as the best in show. 
</P>
<P>
 This event started with a brotherhood of wealthy New York bird hunters who 
used to sip sherry at the old Westminster Hotel. To make off-season sport of 
their hunting dogs, they devised a show patterned after those being held in 
England and an earlier U.S. competition in Philadelphia. Nothing -- 
depressions, world wars, winter blizzards -- has stopped it since. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the middle class may be emerging in this milieu, the gentry still 
firmly controls traditions. That means earning your place, slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma Boalbey, whose New York letterhead still carries the GRamercy telephone 
prefix, has been running show publicity for 44 years. New York Times dog 
correspondent Walter R. Fletcher covered his first Westminster as an assistant 
reporter in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be my last," he says as he is shuttled by wheelchair from the press 
room to the judging ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter, you've been saying that every year for 10 years," remarks a junior 
colleague, a cubbish 60 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition at Westminster is an intriguing brew of three ingredients: dog, 
handler and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog must not only be a specimen that meets the breed's written standards, 
but also must have that elusive quality that dog fanciers call "showiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Look! Look at that poodle! She's asking you to give her the award. You may 
have a perfect dog, but she's got to ask you to give her the award.  
</P>
<P>
 From her box seat in the second row, Barbara Weisberg of Apex, N.C., explains 
why the ink-black standard poodle champion, La Marka Nina Oscura from 
Burlington, Wis., is about to be judged best non-sporting dog -- better than 
the black miniature poodle or the bichon frise, keeshond, bulldog, schipperke, 
Tibetan terrier, chow chow and a handful of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you see? She's very showy, and that's the name of this -- it's a dog 
show. Look at her move!  
</P>
<P>
 Could it also be that the judge, Jacklyn E. Hungerland of Carmel, has a soft 
spot for poodles? She is, after all, president of the Poodle Club of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg fixes us with a cold stare. 
</P>
<P>
 Only an outsider would be so coarse as to suggest that kind of clumsy 
politics. No, in dogdom, the sharp elbows and helping hands are exquisitely 
more subtle and may take a lifetime to fully appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 Show judge Nigel Aubrey-Jones, of Franklin Center, Quebec, joins us ringside 
for a discussion of dog-show politics: 
</P>
<P>
 There's very little, really.  
</P>
<P>
 But so many people say otherwise, we explain. Newcomers who try to handle 
their own dogs say they almost always lose to the better-known, 
better-connected professional handlers. And owners who advertise in dog 
magazines seem to do a little better than those who don't. And so on and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot expect in any field for people with less experience to triumph.  
</P>
<P>
 But this is about dogs, not people, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to camouflage one's shortcomings is to cry politics. The 
percentage of ignorance is far greater than the percentage of true knowledge.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Labrador retriever is the AKC's most popular breed, and the golden 
retriever is not far behind. How come these breeds never win best of show at 
Westminster? 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a belief -- and it's wrong, of course -- that a dog can't 
have a brain and be good looking, both. The thought is, if he's got brains, 
he's ugly. And the pampered show dog is beautiful but has got to be stupid.  
</P>
<P>
 But wait, isn't the poodle one of the smartest dogs? . . . Oh, never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more important criticisms of AKC shows, questions not so easily 
answered and that cloud the happy life of today's dog fanciers: Troubles lurk 
in the much-manipulated canine gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many of today's purebred dogs are genetic time bombs," says Larry Shook, 
author of the book "Puppy Report" and of a forthcoming series in Dog World 
magazine, "Dogdom's Moral Showdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is this: Purebred show dogs are bred almost solely to conform to 
appearance standards. Their working characteristics are of no consequence, 
their temperament only a matter of casual consideration, their genetic health 
and soundness in increasing doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 German shepherds are prone to hip problems, collies to eye disease, Dobermans 
to bleeding disorders, bulldogs to a variety of ailments. The list is 
unpleasantly long. 
</P>
<P>
 These show dogs are the prototypes of the breeds that come and go in the 
public fancy. And when a specific type catches on, the demand for puppies is 
met by breeders good and bad. The only real incentive to produce sound animals 
is pride, and that has not proven satisfactory to a growing number of critics. 
There is even significant worry within the AKC. 
</P>
<P>
 Even ring announcer Caras opened Westminster this year with a warning to those 
shopping for a pet. Good puppies, he said, "do not come from puppy mills and 
pet shops." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics such as Shook go further, saying that even buying the offspring of 
champions is "canine roulette." 
</P>
<P>
 "And statistically, you have a good chance of losing. You lose with staggering 
vet bills. You lose with the tragic early loss of a pet you have grown to love. 
You lose when your puppy grows up aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 If dog buyers did their homework, he adds, the problem would go away 
overnight. "Or," he says, "if the AKC would require that dogs can't be 
champions unless they are certified free of genetic disease, or can't even be 
registered without such screening." 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries have instituted stronger health safeguards, and pressure is 
mounting here for greater screening. The AKC is also besieged by public 
objections to ear cropping and tail docking. And a host of other complaints 
make dog shows no different than many other American endeavors of the '90s -- a 
rat's nest of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it remains nothing short of a marvel what people have produced from the 
elastic genes of the wild wolf during the last 10,000 -- or maybe more -- 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are dogs at Westminster that weigh barely more than a pound (Chihuahua) 
and some nearly 200 pounds (mastiff). Some tell you where they are from (Irish 
setter, Tibetan terrier), and some don't (the Labrador retriever is from 
Newfoundland). Some can hold three tennis balls in their mouths (golden 
retriever). Some are all-American dogs (Chesapeake Bay retriever, Boston 
terrier), and some are exotic foreigners (shiba inu from Japan, Ibizan hound 
from Egypt). 
</P>
<P>
 There are dogs with dreadlocks. And dogs with hair, dogs with fur, and dogs 
with neither. Such as the lap dog known as the Chinese crested, which can be 
entirely naked except for oddly tufted feet, head and tail. 
</P>
<P>
 Say, does that dog need suntan lotion? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well as a matter of fact he does get a tan," explains Victor Helu, from 
Bethpage, N.Y., who handles the Chinese crested called Cheesecake. "Look here 
at this picture -- that's him in the spring. You see he's very light. Now here 
is a picture of him in September. You see how dark he's gotten?" 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there also are dogs who suffer discriminatory stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it true that the Afghan is the dumb blond of dogdom? 
</P>
<P>
 This must be a sensitive question, because Afghan owner David would rather not 
give us his last name. But, he answers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, five times out of 10 it will sit if you tell it to." 
</P>
<P>
 So, who won Westminster? 
</P>
<P>
 If you missed the finals on cable television, the seven dogs brought into the 
ring were a fawn-colored boxer (working group), a German shepherd that was the 
nation's winningest show dog in 1993 (herding), the black standard poodle 
(non-sporting), a black and tan Norwich terrier (terrier), a Pekingese (toy), a 
parti-colored cocker spaniel (sporting) and a Norwegian elkhound (hound). 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 minutes, judge Walter F. Goodman of Miami, wearing a tuxedo jacket 
embroidered with dogs, lined the seven champions abreast and faced them like a 
general beholding troops. This is the Year of the Dog by the Chinese calendar, 
and the winner would be the American dog of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman's hand rose and snapped to a point . . . the 4-year-old Norwich 
terrier, Chudley Willum the Conqueror, owned by Ruth Cooper of Glenview, Ill., 
and Patricia Lussier of Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 They received the coveted silver bowl trophy of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 And Willum? 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, he was sighted nibbling chicken off a fork at Sardi's.

CONDO Q & A: SBA ASSISTANCE OFFERED TO UNIT OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our condominium association needs more information about the Small 
Business Administration(SBA) loans that are available for the association or 
for our individual unit owners. Must the association determine whether to apply 
for an association loan or levy an emergency assessment and allow the owners to 
apply for their own individual loans if they need assistance? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The SBA will not approve an association loan and then fund the 
individual owners' applications also. 
</P>
<P>
 Your association must move quickly because the filing deadline for SBA loan 
applications for physical damage to homes, personal property and businesses is 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA's "Unit Owner's Fact Sheet" about disaster loans for condominiums and 
other common-interest developments includes the following information: Special 
Eligibility Rules for Developments 
</P>
<P>
 Eligibility rules for developments are different from the rules for other 
forms of real estate, because the association generally has the responsibility 
to maintain and repair the common elements, and it determines how the repairs 
will be financed. To fund the repairs, an association may use its own 
maintenance fund, or borrow funds from the SBA. An association may also choose 
to pass a "one-time" assessment (due in one payment) against all unit owners 
for their proportional shares of the common element damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unit owners can apply to SBA for home loan funds up to $200,000 to cover 
individual unit repairs and "one-time" assessments, which are for disaster 
repairs only and which do not duplicate SBA loans to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 If the common element damage exceeds SBA's maximum business loan amount of 
$1.5 million, the association may apply to borrow $1.5 million from SBA and 
pass a one-time assessment against the owners for the rest of the funds needed 
to repair the damage. Unit Owner Loan Eligibility 
</P>
<P>
 Unit owners may apply to the SBA for funds up to $240,000 to cover: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Uncompensated damage to personal property ($40,000 maximum); 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Uncompensated damage to the unit, excluding common elements, which are 
the responsibility of the association ($200,000 maximum); 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- "One-time" assessments passed by the association for damage to the common 
elements (also included in the $200,000 maximum). 
</P>
<P>
 All loans are subject to the SBA's lending limits. Insurance and other 
compensation for your loss will be deducted from the loan after the 
compensation is received. SBA will require a mortgage or deed of trust on your 
unit, if your loan exceeds $10,000. To Obtain Funds to Restore the Common 
Elements 
</P>
<P>
 If SBA loan funds are needed too pay for the restoration of your development's 
common elements, there are two different ways to obtain the funds: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Association Loans. Your association may apply for a loan to restore the 
common elements, even if it doesn't own them, because the governing documents 
give it the responsibility to restore the common elements damaged by the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 To repay SBA, your association will generally be required to levy a special 
monthly assessment against all the units in your development. (SBA prefers that 
disaster-related assessments be kept separate from general improvement or other 
assessments.) SBA generally requires an assignment of the proceeds of the 
special assessment as collateral for SBA's loan. If your association actually 
owns the common area, SBA may require a deed of trust or mortgage against the 
common area as additional collateral.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, your local financial institution may be able to supply a "bridge 
loan" until the SBA funds are received. The California Trade and Commerce 
Agency is providing state loan guarantees to financial institutions that 
provide loans to businesses so that they can continue to operate until the SBA 
loan is funded. 
</P>

guaranteed loan program, contact your local financial institution or:

</P>
<P>
 2 -- Unit Owner Loans. Your association may decide not to apply for an SBA 
loan. Instead, the association may decide to levy a one-time special assessment 
against each unit. As a unit owner, you may be eligible to borrow the funds to 
pay for the one-time assessment, subject to SBA's loan limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Special conditions may be required prior to commencement of repairs, to ensure 
that all the funds necessary to complete the project are available and to 
facilitate orderly disbursement of construction funds. Details Needed About 
Your Project 
</P>
<P>
 SBA can quickly process your loan application for funds to repair or replace 
your uncompensated personal property losses. However, before SBA can determine 
your loan amount for unit repairs and common element assessments, if any, SBA 
must know the course of action you and your association will take. SBA must 
know if the structure will be rebuilt or if the owners will relocate. SBA also 
needs to know the expected total project cost, so that they can determine the 
viability of the project and confirm that there are enough funds available, 
from all sources, to complete the project. Information Needed to Begin 
Processing Your Loan 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- An SBA Disaster Home Loan Application (form is provided by SBA). 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- A listing of your damaged/destroyed personal property (form provided by 
SBA).  
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Complete copies of your last two years Federal Income Tax Returns. If 
they are unavailable, SBA will assist in obtaining them from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Details of any insurance coverage or claims. A copy of a deed to your 
property, or a copy of the title policy you obtained when you purchased your 
property, is not required to file your application, but SBA may request this 
later. Information Needed From Your Association 
</P>
<P>
 Your association should submit a list of the names and phone numbers of the 
members of the board of directors and the elected officers, a list of unit 
owners who are members of the association, a copy of the special assessment 
resolution (if it has already been passed), and a copy of the face sheet of the 
association's insurance policy. SBA's Loan May Not Be Used to Upgrade Your 
Property 
</P>
<P>
 SBA's loans are for disaster related repairs only. SBA's loans may not be used 
to upgrade your property or make additions to it. However, SBA's loan can 
include assessed costs to comply with building and safety code requirements. 
Furthermore, your loan can be increased by as much as 20% for mitigation to 
protect your property from a future disaster of a similar nature. If Your 
Development Will Not Be Rebuilt 
</P>
<P>
 You, the unit owner, will be viewed by SBA as being forced to relocate. You 
are eligible for the replacement value of your personal property, your unit and 
your share of the common area, minus any insurance recovery you have received, 
subject to SBA loan limitations and your ability to repay the SBA. You should 
submit a relocation proposal for SBA review when you know where you would like 
to relocate. All relocation proposals must be approved by the SBA. You should 
make any purchase contract "subject to SBA approval" to protect yourself if 
your proposed relocation plan is unacceptable to SBA. If You Do Not Want to 
Participate in the Restoration of Your Development 
</P>
<P>
 You will be viewed by the SBA as choosing to voluntarily relocate. When you 
voluntarily relocate, you are only eligible for an amount equal to the 
uncompensated loss of your personal property plus the cost to repair your unit. 
You are not eligible to use your proportional share of the cost to repair the 
common elements of relocation if the association has voted to restore your 
development. Current Interest Rates for SBA Loans 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates are determined by formulas set by law. Currently, the 
applicable interest rates are 3.625% on loans to unit owners and 4% for 
condominium associations and other common-interest developments. 
</P>

BOOK REVIEW; MAKE SURE INSPECTION IS COMPLETE, ACCURATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Home Buyer's Inspection Guide" by Warren Boroson and Ken Austin (John 
Wiley & Sons, New York: 1993, 219 pages, $17.95.)  
</P>
<P>
 The trend is for most home buyers to make their purchase offers contingent 
upon a satisfactory professional inspection of the residence.However, as this 
new book explains, there is more to inspecting a home than just hiring a 
professional inspector and reading his or her report. 
</P>
<P>
 Authors Warren Boroson and Ken Austin emphasize the best way to choose a 
qualified professional inspector and how to be certain the inspection report is 
complete and accurate. The authors explain that many so-called professional 
inspectors are incompetent, as shown by the horror stories included in the 
book. Incidentally, co-author Ken Austin is president of Home Master of 
America, the largest home-inspection company, so he speaks with authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book's emphasis is placed on inspecting the components of a house 
and what problems to anticipate, I found the early chapters on how to select a 
qualified inspector and what to expect in a well-written inspection report to 
be the most interesting. Also, the pros and cons of home warranty policies are 
thoroughly explained. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an excellent book to read before starting the search for your perfect 
dream home. It shows home buyers how to ask the right questions before making a 
purchase offer. Also, it makes prospective buyers capable of spotting obvious 
defects. The book is filled with photos, red flag checklists, illustrations and 
suggestions for proper home maintenance. In summary, it should be required 
reading for home buyers. On my scale of one to 10, this book rates a 10.

YOUR MORTGAGE; UNTANGLING THE MESS REFINANCING MADE OF YOUR 1993 INCOME TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the biggest refinancing boom of the century -- stretching from 
early 1992 through last December -- large numbers of unsuspecting homeowners 
could be heading for tax trouble April 15. Many of them could also be 
overpaying on taxes, thanks to an easy-to-miss write-off that could shave their 
1993 bills by hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure you're a fully informed refinancer, here's a tax season update on 
issues that top accountants say even sophisticated homeowners misunderstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the easy-to-miss write-off that's most commonly ignored by the new 
wave of refinancers: Those non-deductible "points" you've been capitalizing 
from your previous refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of homeowners across the country have refinanced not just once in 
the past several years, but twice or even more. They refinanced their 10% and 
11% loans from the 1980s when mortgage rates dropped into the low 9s. Then they 
refinanced again -- probably during 1993 -- when mortgage rates hit the 7s or 
even below. 
</P>
<P>
 On each of their refinancings, they typically paid mortgage points to the 
lender. Each point is the equivalent of 1% of the mortgage amount and is 
collected during the loan closing process. Under federal tax law, points on 
refinancings of principal residences generally cannot be deducted in the year 
of the transaction. Instead they must be capitalized -- that is, deducted pro 
rata over the life of the loan. For example, if you paid three points on a 
$200,000 30-year refi loan, you could only write off one-thirtieth of the 
$6,000 a year, or $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you refinanced in late 1991 and deducted $200 a year in points on your 
1991 and 1992 federal income tax returns. If you then refinanced that loan in 
1993 to catch last fall's historic low rates, you generated the deduction 
that's so easy to miss: You now write off the $5,600 you've been carrying in 
undeducted points from the 1991 refinancing on your 1993 return. And if you 
were fortunate enough to walk away with one of 1993's plum refi prizes -- a 
zero-point mortgage at an attractive rate -- you won't need to start 
capitalizing points again on the new loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brief piece of advice on refi points: If you can show that a portion 
of the proceeds of your refinancing was used to make substantial improvements 
on your home -- like adding a deck, a new kitchen or bathroom -- then part of 
your refi points may indeed be deductible April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you refinanced the $100,000 existing loan on your $200,000 house last 
year, replacing it with a $150,000 new mortgage that cost you three points 
($4,500) at closing. You pulled out the extra money to finance an addition to 
the home that cost you $50,000. In the IRS's eyes, $50,000 of your $150,000 
refi loan now counts as "acquisition indebtedness" -- the tax equivalent of 
purchasing part of a brand new home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, you can now write off one-third ($1,500) of the $4,500 in points 
-- that is, the same ratio as the $50,000 improvements bear to the full 
$150,000 loan amount. The $3,000 balance of points must be capitalized over the 
30-year loan term, like any other refi. 
</P>
<P>
 A third and final item of widespread confusion among 1993 refinancers, 
according to accountants: 
</P>
<P>
 The federal ceiling on mortgage interest deductibility. Basically the rule 
works like this: When you refinance, you can't deduct your mortgage interest 
payments on loan amounts that exceed your original "acquisition indebtedness" 
plus $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? Never heard of that? Join the crowd. Here's what it means. 
Acquisition indebtedness is the loan amount you borrow to "acquire, construct 
or substantially improve" your home. Say you buy a house for $200,000 and take 
out a first deed of trust for $100,000. Your acquisition indebtedness, for 
federal tax purposes, is $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As you pay off the principal amount over the years, your acquisition 
indebtedness declines. If you've paid back $10,000 of the $100,000 principal, 
your acquisition indebtedness stands at $90,000. Acquisition indebtedness can 
also increase, if you borrow funds that are used to expand or improve the house 
substantially, as in the $4,500 points example above. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax problem for refinancers arises when they go for mortgage amounts that 
exceed the formula of acquisition indebtedness plus $100,000. For example, say 
you bought a home for $300,000 in 1982 with a first mortgage of $200,000. In 
1988 you refinanced for $300,000, based on a property value of $500,000. Last 
year you decided to refinance again -- this time for $400,000, rather than miss 
out on 1993's bargain-basement rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the bad news: You won't be able to write off the interest on about 
$100,000 worth of the new loan. That's because your acquisition indebtedness is 
below $200,000 -- the balance on the original 1982 loan -- and you've already 
taken out the maximum $100,000 home equity debt via the 1988 refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line on multiple refis: Before writing off your mortgage interest 
as you've always done in the past, check your acquisition indebtedness math. 
You could find yourself on the wrong side of IRS's deductibility rules.

'ANGELS' HELP CHILDREN IN GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Common Ground also administers a gardening program for children with the help 
of volunteers called "Gardening Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The program was started in 1989 by Rachel Mabie, youth gardening coordinator 
for Common Ground. Before joining the agency in 1988, Mabie had been a Peace 
Corps volunteer in Central America where she trained the local people in how to 
start vegetable gardens. She decided to find out if any schools in Los Angeles 
would be interested in gardens for their students. The response was immediate 
and gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
 She installed gardens at Dixie Avenue School in Sherman Oaks and 118th School 
in Los Angeles. Then she realized she needed help. An appeal went out for 
adults who could volunteer two hours a week with children, and the first 
Gardening Angels were trained and put into action in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are 50 schools from Sylmar to San Pedro and West Los Angeles to San 
Gabriel with children's gardens, and another 25 on a waiting list to be 
included in the program as soon as volunteers are available. More than 5,000 
children have participated in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of this program is that it's more than just a gardening 
experience for the kids, although that's important, too," Mabie said. "Teachers 
include the gardens in the learning process and use them as hands-on means for 
teaching math, word skills, science, even history." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the program also depends on dedicated teachers willing to 
assume overall responsibility for the gardens, which can be raised beds or 
containers, depending on the school layout and available area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardening Angels provide support, but the children are expected to do the 
actual planting and maintenance. Common Ground also provides written materials 
to help the teachers prepare classroom lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 More than vegetables are growing in these gardens, Mabie feels, because the 
children learn about team effort, patience, responsibility and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process teaches the kids patience, a trait especially needed in a society 
of immediate gratification," she said. "They also learn about nurturing and 
caring for living things." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Harris agrees. She's one of the original Gardening Angels and a strong 
supporter of the program, so much so that she's inspired her 17-year-old 
daughter to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris became involved while tending a plot at the Mar Vista Gardens in Culver 
City. She applied to Common Ground to become a master gardener, but switched 
when she learned of the newly forming program and after training was assigned 
to Stoner Avenue Elementary School in Culver City where she assists the fifth- 
and sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 She loves gardening, but she also enjoys working with the children and seeing 
their progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the boys hang back at first -- they think gardening isn't macho. But 
they change their minds when they see the other kids having fun," she said. 
"Girls who don't want to get their hands dirty or break nails also grab 
shovels, hoes and rakes after watching the others." 
</P>
<P>
 The children also learn some hard lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some months after the garden was installed and the crops growing, vandals tore 
out the plants and damaged the raised beds. The children were upset at their 
wasted efforts, but Harris assured them the garden could be replanted. But the 
vandals struck again, this time destroying the beds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was sterner with the youngsters. "I warned them the vandalism had to 
stop or Common Ground would pull out. I figured some of them knew who was doing 
the vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 The school repaired the damage, Harris helped the children replant, and that 
was the last of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice yearly the garden beds are harvested. The children share their produce 
with their family, schoolmates, and sometimes with local food banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Levy, a Gardening Angel at the San Pasqual Elementary School in Highland 
Park, remembered a particularly plentiful harvest of cabbage. "We made enough 
coleslaw to serve the whole school of 350 students," she said.

 PAGE TURNING: Heavy metal is dead and BAM magazine is going upscale. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Adkins, the new publisher of BAM -- the free, California-oriented rock 
magazine -- has set a May timetable for a redesign of the 17-year-old 
publication.The San Francisco-based biweekly has been viewed as a last refuge 
for the big-hair, pop-metal set for some time. A flashier graphic style and 
editorial content targeting Generation X are on tap for the new version. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to change as trends change," says Adkins. "I think the magazine has 
been wrongly identified as a heavy-metal magazine, largely due to the success 
we had in that market several years ago when it was a dominant force in music. 
The magazine has changed, but the graphics haven't." Bruce Haring

'CROOKED' ADMINISTRATORS BLED SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read Bill Lewis' rebuttal (Letters, Feb. 20) to the two parents who 
complained about the situation in the Orange Unified School District, and I 
think Mr. Lewis missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange does not have too many administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 It has too many crooked and incompetent administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators who, over the past six years, engaged in multimillion-dollar 
construction fraud. Administrators who were fired and their six-figure 
contracts paid off. Administrators who have proven their inability to manage 
the district by continuing to lay off employees each year, despite the fact 
that all of the other school districts in Orange County, facing exactly the 
same state budget problem, have been able to balance their budgets through 
attrition, minimal cuts to student services and -- a concept that is obviously 
foreign to the Orange board -- effective management. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis' bizarre statement that taxes are the root cause of the lack of 
money for education suggests to me that he should take a remedial economics 
course before attempting to balance his own checkbook, let alone handle the 
finances of a large school district. 
</P>

 * I just read Orange school board member Bill Lewis' letter. Interesting. 
George Bush, Pete Wilson and Bill Clinton raised taxes and that caused the 
current financial crisis in the Orange School District. So let me get this 
straight. The fact that I have $5 less in my wallet this year is the reason 
that essential school employees are being laid off? Stupid me. I thought it was 
the fact that former district administrators siphoned off millions of dollars 
in fraud and embezzlement.

FOE AND FRIEND JOIN FRAY OVER STATE SEN. LEWIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Orange County Republican Majority Coalition fully supports the Times 
editorial ("It's Time to Stop the Witch Hunts," Feb. 20) asking state Sen. John 
Lewis (R-Orange) to work more diligently on county business and less on 
personal political battles. John Lewis' behavior is an embarrassment to all 
Orange County Republicans. Lewis' "ideological cleansing" -- purging mainstream 
voices from the party -- is indicative of an agenda pursued by Orange County's 
GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the GOP leadership is headed away from mainstream Republican values, 
it is no wonder the normally strong Orange County Republican vote has split in 
recent elections. The county's GOP leadership needs to distance itself from the 
vindictive, shallow and embarrassing behavior of politicians like Lewis. If 
not, the Democratic Party will be headed for even more election day victories.

<P>
 * You criticize Sen. Lewis in paragraph one because he doesn't engage in "the 
real work of a legislator: introducing bills, lobbying for their passage, 
getting them signed into law." Then you spend the rest of the editorial 
complaining that he does. Which is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Could it not be that Sen. Lewis found it necessary to "win passage of a bill 
making it easier to remove (Henry W.) Wedaa from his post" (on the Air Quality 
Management District board) because it is nearly impossible to get these 
bureaucrats off commissions once they're seated? 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't it also be true that Sen. Lewis' opposition to Rosemary Thakar is 
based on the belief her ideological point of view is in opposition to the views 
of the constituency of Sen. Lewis' district? 
</P>
<P>
 John Lewis has represented my area for many years. He consistently wins by 
landslide margins precisely because he acts as the majority of the district's 
voters thinks he should. When the term limit kicks in and forces him out, our 
district will be impoverished to the extent his successor is not like him.

ANGELS TO DISADVANTAGED NEED ASSISTANCE; * QUAKE HAS EATEN INTO GROUP'S SUPPLY 
OF BLANKETS, CLOTHES; PUBLIC HAS CHANCE TO HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it seems that there really is such a thing as a guardian angel. In 
the mid-1980s, reports on the homeless inspired a retired minister from Anaheim 
Hills, Raymond Fico, and his wife to give up holiday gifts and instead buy 250 
cotton and polyester blankets for the disadvantaged. Fico designed a shiny 
silver polyurethane blanket that also can be used as a poncho or a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts spread to the formation of the nonprofit Covering Wings Inc., 
which has provided more of these durable coverings for the homeless. Since that 
time more than 260,000 blankets have been given away and the campaign has 
spread to more than a dozen states, to Mexico and to parts of Europe and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't been the end of it. Moved by the displacement of people close 
to home during the Northridge earthquake, Fico, known affectionately as the 
"Blanket Man," depleted his warehouse of blankets and clothes to assist many 
thousands. Filling his van with 1,000 survival blankets, he actually patrolled 
the streets with his son-in-law in affected areas, passing out coverings to 
people who had set up shelters in deserted lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fico estimated that he and his associates had given out about 
18,000 blankets to earthquake victims. As a result of publicity about his 
efforts, he was able to buy more blankets, socks and sweat shirts with the 
generous contributions sent to his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake relief effort is still being carried out, but to meet the 
demand, it was necessary to go into a supply that originally was intended to go 
for Orange County's homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is still trying to replenish that supply and meet a real need for 
the county's homeless population. Fico and Covering Wings Inc. (P.O. Box 17984, 
Anaheim Hills, Calif. 92817-7984, (714) 968-3358) have shown a caring attitude 
and have been a vehicle for the true neighborly spirit that exists in our area.

TAKING RIGHT TACK ON MINORITY CONCERNS; * SCHOOL REACTS WITH SENSITIVITY TO 
PARENTS' CLAIMS THAT CHILDREN WERE MISTREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New ships put to sea for shakedown cruises to spot problems and solve them. 
New schools can undergo similar turbulence, as Aliso Viejo Middle School is 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the Capistrano Unified School District appears to be taking the proper 
steps to meet the concerns of some parents about treatment of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The school opened in October. A month later, a group of African American and 
Latino parents complained that minority students had been harassed, falsely 
accused of being gang members and ridiculed by teachers in front of classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials wisely responded by assigning a committee to investigate. A 
founder of a group called African American Parents and Concerned Citizens of 
Orange County, which led the call for an investigation, took the right tack in 
saying the organization was not looking to "make everything in this world a 
black/white issue." She said parents were merely concerned about their 
children, which is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's 800-student population is 87% white, 6% Latino, 4% Asian and 3% 
black. The principal, Cheryl Lampe, was brought in from Hawthorne Intermediate 
School in Los Angeles County, where the student population is nearly 80% black 
and Latino and where she received high marks from minority parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month a group of Aliso Viejo parents expressed support for Lampe. But one 
backer of the principal wisely suggested that if district policies can be 
misunderstood they should be revised. 
</P>
<P>
 This month the district superintendent, James A. Fleming, said the 
investigating committee's report led him to conclude that there was no evidence 
of racism or discriminatory treatment at the school. But Fleming did not stop 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 He said better communication might have prevented misunderstandings and in 
some instances more sensitivity could have been shown. The district also plans 
to hire a mediator to bring Lampe, teachers, staff and concerned parents 
together to talk over their differences. Fleming said he had asked countywide 
minority organizations to advise the district on how to improve relations among 
ethnic groups. Lampe plans on getting students from Hawthorne together with 
their counterparts from Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are all good ideas, and reflect the right recognition that Orange County 
is becoming more diverse. Those changes can cause problems that must be 
overcome to reap the benefits of diversity.

20-YEAR DEBATE CAN WAIT A LITTLE LONGER; * QUESTION OF BONES COMES BEFORE BOLSA 
CHICA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 20 years of debating the fate of the Koll Real Estate Group development 
planned for the Bolsa Chica wetlands area, some new uncertainty has appeared in 
a proposal that was looking like a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the Seal Beach City Council has gone on record against the 
development that will contain more than 4,000 homes, citing an increase in 
traffic along Pacific Coast Highway. And the host council in Huntington Beach 
decided to call on the county to produce a new environmental impact report, 
citing a host of perceived problems with the existing one. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that, perhaps nothing was quite so dramatic as the debate over the 
discovery of about 20 concentrations of bones, and the acknowledgment this 
month by the Orange County coroner's office that it will be months before a 
determination can be made on whether these are human or animal remains. 
</P>
<P>
 While it would be better to have an answer sooner than later, this matter must 
be resolved satisfactorily before anything is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Native Americans argues that the 7.4-acre site parcel may once have 
been a prehistoric burial site. And the revelation in news reports last month 
that an archeologist working for the Koll Real Estate Group found the bone 
fragments in 1992 raised new, as yet unresolved, questions about the 
development. Last week, the City Council voted to ask for a grand jury 
investigation into Koll's handling of the bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be necessary, but neither would it be acceptable to proceed with 
development until questions about the bones are answered. While state law does 
not rule out the destruction of Native American cemeteries, it obviously would 
be a terrible injustice and violation of sacred land, even if done 
inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
 It should never come to that. The project should be reconfigured if necessary 
to ensure protection of the site. Or, if these are animal bones, let the 
project go forward as may be appropriate. At the very least, development plans 
should err on the side of respect for the history of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Public pressure alone may persuade the county to require big changes in the 
project, in order to save it. The best approach for now is to determine as 
quickly as possible what the site actually is. Beyond that, the best advice is 
to go slowly on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 One question is why it has taken so long for the confirmation of bones, one 
set of which is believed to be about 8,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office has acknowledged the existence of a map that came to 
light last month, even though a forensic anthropologist hired by the office 
examined the bones found there in 1992. Judy Myers Suchey, a faculty member at 
Cal State Fullerton, said that the handful of bones she had seen were very old, 
about 8,000 years old, and were of interest to archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents point out that no mention of the find had been made in the 
county's draft environmental impact report released last year, and it has 
fueled concern. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, there is no reason to doubt the credibility of Tom Mathews, 
director of planning for the county's Environmental Management Agency, which 
oversaw preparation of the EIR. He said that the discovery was not mentioned in 
the document because there had not yet been any scientific confirmation of its 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 What the county must do is be certain that it closely monitors the 
investigation to be certain that the questions about the bones are properly 
addressed.

MEASURING UC'S RADIOACTIVITY ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While I appreciated the opportunity to explain the need for a low-level 
radioactive waste disposal facility in your article ("Trying to Solve Problem 
of Dangerous Wastes," Feb. 22), it is important to clarify that the University 
of California has not "launched an ad campaign urging approval" of such a 
facility. Moreover, UC has not paid for any advertisements, although it 
maintains an institutional membership in the California Radioactive Materials 
Management Forum, which was one of the ad sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 The university uses radioactive materials in many scientific research, 
teaching, and patient care activities. For example, they are used in the 
research, diagnosis, and treatment of many human health disorders, including 
communicable diseases (such as AIDS and herpes), neurological ailments (such as 
Alzheimer's) and nearly every type of cancer. In many applications, radioactive 
assay techniques are the quickest, most sensitive, and in some cases, the only 
way to confirm a diagnosis. It is also worth noting that the university has 
implemented aggressive source reduction measures (substituting non-radioactive 
or shorter half-life materials wherever feasible) to minimize the amount of 
radioactivity and the volume of radioactivity and the volume of radioactive 
waste that needs to go to a permanent disposable facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for calling the public's attention to this important issue.

DEPORTATION BEATS INCARCERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After attending a neighborhood meeting with the Santa Ana city manager and a 
Santa Ana police captain as guest speakers, I find the (City Council vote) for 
a new Santa Ana jail is treating the symptom and not the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Immigration and Naturalization Service Western Regional Commissioner 
Harold Ezell has stated at least 50% of Santa Ana arrests are (of) illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Save Our State (SOS) initiative, which is obtaining signatures at a 
record rate, is passed and implemented, illegal aliens will be homeward bound 
as their taxpayer-supported free medical, schooling and housing will expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement will be required to report immigration status to the state and 
INS for deportation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, overcrowding and jail requirements will tumble at least 50%, saving the 
city of Santa Ana taxpayers another unnecessary tax increase.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON EDUCATION; PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF CHOICE OFFER 
OPTIMAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE; PROGRAM GIVES PARENTS OPTIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR GREATER COMMITMENT TO THEIR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES A. FLEMING, James A. Fleming is superintendent of the Capistrano 
Unified School District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in his State of the Union message last month, referred to 
Goals 2000, our national plan for improving education. He said this plan "will 
empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like . . . more 
public school choice." 
</P>
<P>
 His challenge to schools is to experiment with creative ideas such as public 
school choice while, at the same time, guaranteeing our customers -- our 
students and their parents -- an education that will prepare students for 
success in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students excel in science and mathematics. Others have a keen interest in 
the performing arts. There are students who want to learn more about the 
environment, while others enjoy expanding their communication skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students thrive in a technologically rich educational setting. Others 
prefer the nurturing environment of a strongly child-centered staff. Some 
students want the continuity of a year-round school program. Others want the 
academically challenging environment of a Gifted and Talented (GATE) Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 32,000 students in Capistrano Unified School District not only come 
in all shapes, sizes and colors, but with a myriad of interests, needs and 
abilities as well. Our school district's Public Schools of Choice Program will 
allow and encourage the exploration of individual wishes, skills and aptitudes, 
while doing so in an environment in which all of Capistrano's students continue 
to receive a fully enriched and solid core educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of choice is as American as apple pie. That is why it is an 
appropriate new endeavor for public schools. Choice is a very popular term 
these days, and that's understandable. It reflects the democratic principles 
upon which this great nation was founded and has prospered. All of us want to 
be able to take control of our lives and exercise options about what we do in 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 We choose our supermarkets, the type of automobile we will drive and where we 
live. Why not also choose the public school our children will attend? Public 
Schools of Choice gives parents options and the opportunity for the ultimate in 
parental involvement. After all, parent buy-in and support are essential 
factors toward a student's success in school. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for students and their parents to understand that the public 
schools offer something for everyone. Schools throughout Capistrano Unified as 
well as all of Orange County provide a comprehensive array of programs and 
services to meet the needs of a multitude of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some schools even specialize in, and focus on, a particular area of 
the curriculum. Public Schools of Choice gives students a chance to participate 
in those specialized schools, even if those schools are not located in their 
immediate neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of any Public Schools of Choice Program, all parents exercise a 
choice, even if they choose their "home" school. Research tells us that most 
parents will probably select their neighborhood school, the school serving 
their children's attendance area. This is where their children's friends are. 
It is the school with which they are already the most familiar, and one that 
friends and neighbors living in close proximity to each other can rally around, 
get behind and support. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we recognize that some parents will choose a school other than their 
home school, for a variety of personal or educational reasons. Our Public 
Schools of Choice Program gives parents a chance to make those choices on a 
space-available basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has mandated that all school districts in California implement an 
open enrollment policy, beginning next September. I am pleased to report that 
our school district is already well on its way to doing just that, since we 
have been discussing choice and planning for it for some time as a part of the 
development of our school district's strategic plan, Capistrano 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Our community is buzzing with excitement regarding CUSD's Public Schools of 
Choice Program. We have prepared choice program catalogues. We also are holding 
evening meetings to provide even more information for interested parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Families who would like to get a firsthand look at schools other than their 
home school will have the opportunity to do so during a two-day open house in 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the moment of decision will be before them. During a two-day period, on 
March 11 and 12, Capistrano Unified parents who wish to place their children in 
a school other than the home school will be asked to submit their choice 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 It is anyone's guess exactly how many people will exercise choice and where 
they will choose to apply. Whatever happens, I am confident that our school 
clients -- parents and children -- will appreciate being provided with many 
options and opportunities to consider as, together, educators and parents 
collaborate to provide an optimal educational program for each and every child 
in our school district. 
</P>
<P>
 I am equally as confident that parents throughout our county will make a 
greater commitment to their children's education as all Orange County school 
districts enter a new era of parental choice in public education.

ASSIMILATION BREAKS CULTURAL BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am responding to your article, "Activists Stress Chicano Studies, 
Concerted Push for More Latino Teachers," (Feb. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 I am a first-generation American whose family migrated legally in the early 
1900s from northern Europe. Our family embraced the opportunities and education 
available to everyone. I just can't imagine them demanding their culture and 
language to be superimposed over the history and language of their adopted 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sick and tired of a few whiners (40) who attended a conference at Cal 
State Fullerton that want more teachers from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 They also cry that it is hard for Chicanos to succeed in college because of a 
cultural barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't they realize the cultural barrier exists because the Chicano students 
have put it up themselves because they insist on their Mexican history, their 
language and their culture and reject the American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 I must remind them of the millions who have migrated to America and have 
assimilated and yet retain their own culture without demanding to change or 
pull down our American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also advise the young male student to listen up in his college 
classes. The syllabus is not passed out to blond, blue-eyed students only. 
</P>
<P>
 From my own college experiences, the instructor handed them out to everyone 
and went over it in excruciating detail. 
</P>
<P>
 I am angry at The Times, which gives a quarter page for a handful of 
troublemakers. I am also angry at the administrators who cave in to terrorist 
tactics from Chicano activists like MEChA. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers better wake up and demand that our education institutions teach the 
American story that includes all people in relationship to their contribution 
regardless of their country of origin, hire the best qualified teachers 
regardless of their nationality and teach all classes in English only.

PARENTS KEY TO GOOD EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Comments on your story on Santa Ana's fundamental schools ("3 Santa Ana 
Schools Stir Praise, Controversy," Feb. 21): I am a parent of a Greenville 
student. The difference between fundamental schools and the others in the 
district boils down to one thing: committed parents -- parents committed enough 
to camp out for a place in line, to make the often difficult transportation 
arrangements to get their kids to school, to help out in the classroom and with 
activities, to teach their children how to read and speak English at an early 
age and to be part of an active and vocal parent-faculty organization. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents were the children of immigrants, and my wife's parents were 
immigrants. Both our sets of lower-middle-class parents busted their butts to 
send us to Catholic schools, which were the best option at the time, and then 
spent the additional time necessary to make sure that we put as much into our 
education as they did. We do the same for our kids. 
</P>
<P>
 You can sit back and moan, like Nativo Lopez does, about how the system 
stinks, or you can work the system to your best advantage, like the fundamental 
school parents do. Race has nothing to do with it. Economic status has nothing 
to do with it. It's purely a matter of initiative. If you truly want the best 
for your kids, then you will have to make an extra effort. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the astounding difference in test scores, that's pretty simple. In an 
English-speaking society, kids and parents contractually committed to working 
hard in English will always outperform those that aren't. If you expect to get 
ahead in an English-speaking country, then you better have the most fundamental 
of all tools -- command of the English language. You could not ask for a better 
illustration of the farce of bilingual education than the one provided by the 
test-score table in the article.

SCHOOL UNIFORMS NOT A SOLUTION TO GANG PROBLEMS ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I want to take issue with your editorial stance, "Much Too Uniform?" (Feb. 
22), in which you, reluctantly, approve of school uniforms in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This topic has become very popular of late, and I find myself wondering if I'm 
the last bastion in favor of freedom and self-expression. Am I the only baby 
boomer who fought against school dress codes in the '60s? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, today's proponents of school uniforms pretend that a rigid dress 
code will protect their children from gang violence. This is a fantasy. My 
son's district already has strict rules regarding appropriate school attire! If 
the current rules do not protect our children from gang influence, how will a 
uniform do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we so naive that we will, willingly, fool ourselves into believing that 
the gangbangers won't come up with other methods of determining gang 
affiliation? How about yellow socks? What about a green pencil in their 
pockets? Hang a bandanna from their belts? 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will kids be creative enough to dodge the dress code, but how can 
parents fall into the pit that uniforms will be less expensive? Your editorial 
hinted at the possibility of "donations" to provide low-income children with 
school uniforms. I'll buy the theory that children need to be well fed to 
perform well in school; and I'll allow my tax dollars to provide breakfast and 
lunch for low-income children. But "donations" will soon translate into 
providing low-income children, through tax dollars, with uniforms for school. 
And, what happens to the family that changes school districts, mid-term, or as 
you suggested, simply changes schools? A new uniform? I can't see how this 
would decrease my school-dress expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, this entire dialogue is designed to transfer parental 
responsibility to the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that too many parents do not see their children go off to school 
-- or return. They don't attend PTA meetings; they don't participate in 
parent-teacher conferences; they want the public school system to be their 
built-in baby-sitter. Parents who care about the welfare of their children can 
provide their own "neutral coat of arms" to protect them from clothing that 
"might otherwise make them targets." 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the school districts should be invested with the power to enforce 
the rules that they already have regarding appropriate school attire, and 
parents should look farther than the end of their noses for a solution to gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 LYNN HARKINS

<P>
 * It appears that the idea of wearing uniforms to school is coming full 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the turn of the century, girls who could afford it vied with each other 
in the matter of dressing stylishly. School officials decided that this was 
unfair to the girls who could not afford fancy clothes; it would make them feel 
inferior, and this was undemocratic. So, in Glendale High, at least during the 
1920s, girls wore middy blouses, with navy blue ties and navy blue pleated 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I went to high school in the early 1940s, the dress code had been 
relaxed to simply requiring skirt and blouse (or sweater set) and oxfords, 
usually saddle shoes. This allowed some self-expression while preventing a 
dress war. We did not feel put upon at all. Then, in the heyday of the civil 
rights movement, teen-agers started complaining that dress codes violated their 
civil rights, and school officials caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, dress codes are again being considered, although the current reason, gang 
violence, is more pressing than the reason for instituting dress codes in the 
early part of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the matter comes down to which is more important: the civil right 
of youngsters to be safe in school or the civil right of teen-agers, who have 
not yet learned self-discipline, to do what they want with no regard for the 
safety, rights or welfare of others.

DISSENTING OPINION ON D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On Feb. 19, The Times printed a stinging indictment of the Orange County 
district attorney's office (editorial, "How Not to Conduct a Trial"). Because 
the Gionis case was not heard in my court, it would be inappropriate for me to 
address the outcome of that case, but The Times' statement: "This case should 
remind prosecutors of the need to follow the rules," cannot be left 
unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Having sat as a jurist in Orange County for 18 years, I have heard hundreds of 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Without exception, the men and women of the district attorney's office have 
conducted themselves ethically, courteously and professionally, both to myself 
and the jurors. Never have I had to remind a prosecutor to "follow the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be properly prepared on complex issues of law, these dedicated 
public servants frequently spend evenings and weekends buried in a case file 
instead of enjoying their families. 
</P>
<P>
 To leave the members of our community with the impression that these lawyers 
are legal rogue elephants, trampling on the law, is a gross distortion of the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 What they do deserve is a heartfelt thank you.

DO GUNS TEMPT INNOCENT TO CRIME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If Father John-Paul Hopping (Letters, Feb. 20) prepares his homilies and 
teaches doctrine with the same muddle-headed logic and faulty theology 
evidenced in his letter, the bishop should remove him for incompetence. His 
espousal of the National Rifle Assn.'s familiar canard -- "Guns don't kill; 
people do," may qualify him for the post of chaplain of that noxious 
organization rather than associate pastor of a Roman Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
 His letter asserts that, unless we first reform all criminals, nothing will be 
accomplished by banning guns, because the urepentant criminals will continue to 
kill people with "metal rods" and knives! Nonsense! It's possible to escape 
and/or survive a knife attack, but when the assailant is wielding an Uzi or an 
AK-47, your chances of survival are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic doctrine has always held that we should avoid objects and occasions 
that can tempt us to sin, and, in some instances proscribed their use -- e.g. 
Index Librorum Prohibitorum, Humanae Vitae (contraceptives). 
</P>
<P>
 Because guns tempt many into committing crimes -- which are indeed sins -- the 
state's ban on such weapons would certainly conform to church doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Father Hopping next presides at the funeral of a gun victim, perhaps he 
should use as the theme of his eulogy a different slogan -- "Guns don't die; 
people do!" 
</P>

 * Who are they trying to fool? The "gun control" activists are deceiving you. 
They want you to believe that the "Goods for Guns & Services" programs will 
eliminate violent crimes. It won't! 
</P>
<P>
 They measure the success of these programs by how many guns they collect from 
law-abiding citizens. They are missing the point. Criminals are not going to 
turn in their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you disarm the law-abiding citizens, the violent criminals have free run 
of our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Make criminals fear the justice system. Lock them up. Throw away the key. This 
is the way to reduce crime. But please don't take away our constitutional 
rights to defend our homes.

 "I'd love to," the entertainer said when asked by David Foster, then president 
of Colgate Palmolive, about the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tennis, of course?" she asked, referring to her then-favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's golf," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very good sport about it," he recalled Thursday. "She became a 
pretty good golfer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore, who died Thursday in Beverly Hills, Calif., at age 76, became a major 
figure in women's golf through the tournament that carries her name. It began 
in 1972 and is now one of four major championship events on the LPGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shocked right now," said Jim Webb, LPGA deputy commissioner. "We are 
deeply saddened by Dinah's passing. She's been our biggest supporter and 
willing to do anything to help our association. She is an honorary member of 
our association." 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman did more for women's golf than anyone in the history of the 
sport," said Mike Manuche, executive director of the Nabisco Dinah Shore 
tournament. "She was only a fair golfer, but she loved golf so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a good tennis player, but started to play golf and fell in love with 
it. She became a golf addict," Manuche said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament was the Colgate Dinah Shore from 1972 through 1981, then became 
the Nabisco Dinah Shore. It will be played March 24-27 at Mission Hills Country 
Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "The golf tournament is the highlight of my year," Shore said in a 1989 
interview. "I live it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the game of golf, she said, "It's like starting that first cigarette. 
It's a faithless love, but you hit four good shots and you've started your day 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 When Amy Alcott won the Dinah Shore in 1991, Shore helped her celebrate by 
jumping into a pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tournament's prominence, many women considered it one of the 
sport's premier events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get it on national television," recalled Foster, who said the 
purse for the first tournament was $110,000 and that previous high purse for 
women had been $50,000. The purse this year will be $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore was doing a show called "Dinah's Place" on NBC when she was approached 
about the golf tournament. Her place in show business history is secure. So is 
her place in women's golf.

THE SUMMER GAME IS UNDER WAY; SPRING TRAINING ARRIVES AND IT'S NOT A MOMENT TOO 
SOON

 Baseball comes not a moment too soon this year. It comes as Americans above 
the Mason-Dixon line are ready to scream at the next snowflake, as Californians 
dig out from their latest Biblical plague, and as everybody is sufficiently 
comatose from alpine racing and Tonya vs. Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, 1994, is here. It may not look like baseball in recent times: There 
are six divisions and eight playoff berths, a Sunday opener, more day games and 
no expansion teams; Michael Jordan in spikes and Nolan Ryan, George Brett and 
Robin Yount in retirement. But some things do not change: fresh air and sun, 
youth and laughter, ball and bat. These gifts are handed down, generation to 
generation, parent to child, winter to spring. 
</P>
<P>
 So sit back, kick up, and let your mind travel. The summer game is under way 
in Florida and Arizona. Temperatures are in the 70s, landscapes are green, air 
is fragrant, and a soft breeze is licking your face. 
</P>

 Not quite four months have passed since Joe Carter took Mitch Williams deep. 
The National League champion Phillies -- tough, combative, and game to the 
bitter end -- felt as if they were TKO'd on cuts. Now they want to get it on 
again. Veterans Lenny Dykstra, Darren Daulton, Dave Hollins, Pete Incaviglia 
and John Kruk showed up at the Clearwater camp before last Thursday. Only 
Daulton was due in on the 17th; the others could have come in as late as next 
Wednesday. But they couldn't wait to get back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was gone by popular demand, traded to Houston. In his place is 
bearded reliever Doug Jones, a quiet, cerebral type who seems content on his 
first day to observe the Phillies' regulars from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jimmy Cliff's tune, "I Can See Clearly Now," playing on the clubhouse 
radio, Manager Jim Fregosi convenes his first spring interview. Fregosi is 
brought right to the point: his bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's your closer?" a Philadelphia reporter asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jones has had past success -- he's done it before," Fregosi says. "I'd like 
to keep (Larry) Andersen and (David) West for set-up. I'm not saying Doug is 
the closer. Let's see how it goes. There's an old adage: Whoever is hot gets 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 36, is a veteran of eight major league seasons with Milwaukee, 
Cleveland and Houston. His ERA has been erratic, but his saves are the bottom 
line. He has 190 of them, and if you exclude 1991, when his role with the 
Indians was less defined, Jones has averaged 34.4 over his last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says experience has taught him to pitch within himself, more easily 
accomplished with a high-scoring team such as the Phillies. He says he has 
learned to pitch with his head as much as his arm, thanks to advice from Steve 
Carlton and Don Money, both past teammates. He describes himself as a control 
pitcher who changes speed on his fastball and changeup to keep hitters 
off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your style doesn't leave much room for error, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Very little," Jones says. "I have to be on top of my game to be effective." 
</P>

 Boys love baseball. This politically incorrect observation is not meant to 
offend girls. It does not scientifically refute a trendy theory that baseball 
has been abandoned by youth. It simply recognizes what is. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the first morning of spring baseball, 15-year-old Ryan Sherman 
arises, brushes his teeth, gulps his cereal and dashes out his front door. 
Normally, Sherman would head for Sarasota's Riverview High School, where his 
ninth-grade teachers have grown accustomed to his blond hair and bright-eyed 
face. This morning, he makes a beeline for Ed Smith Stadium, where the White 
Sox train. At 8:15 a.m., he pops a small padlock on a gate in right field. At 
8:45, he seats himself along the first-base line, trying to blend in with 300 
reporters and 34 TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Won't you get in trouble?" I ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, my Mom is here," Ryan says. "She snuck in with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moms love baseball, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and moms also love Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:15, His Airness strolls through an outfield gate, carrying three bats 
over his shoulder. He wears Chicago's black jersey, No. 45, and black Nike 
high-tops custom-fitted with cleats. As Michael settles into the batting cage 
for his initial cuts, one of the reporters jostling for position is Thierry 
Marchand, a writer for L'Equipe, Europe's largest daily sports newspaper. 
L'Equipe's headquarters is in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "French sports fans are very happy to see Michael back in business," Marchand 
says. "Everybody in France cares about him. L'Equipe named him Greatest Athlete 
in the World last year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the French understand baseball?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," Marchand says. "The main thing is that Michael is playing." 
</P>
<P>
 "What if France's best soccer player decided to become a race car driver?" I 
say. "Would the French fans take him seriously?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, people would think it was a big joke," Marchand says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see what you mean," he says. "But you have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Careful? " 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Michael Jordan. You don't know what he is capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours Michael hits, fields, throws and runs. Taking fat pitches from 
coaches, he pounds many into the dirt, pops many into the top of the cage, and 
lines a goodly number into the outfield. It appears that if Michael learns to 
hit, he will do it as a spray hitter. His speed from home to second is 
impressive. His outfield glove could be made serviceable, but his arm is weak. 
One can only wonder about his ability to chew, spit and scratch his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the other players," Ryan says. "Nobody is paying attention 
to them." 
</P>
<P>

 Spring is embodied in a rookie, tall and strong and optimistic. When the 
Braves open camp at West Palm Beach, clambering up the dugout steps and 
breaking into a lazy trot, the cries from the stands are not for Glavine, 
Maddux, Smoltz or Avery. No, they are for a young man with broad shoulders and 
piercing dark eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Javy, you're the man this year! Good luck!" 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Lopez smiles. "All right!" he shouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 23, is the man. The Braves have handed him the catching job, with 17 
major league games under his belt, allowing veterans Damon Berryhill and Greg 
Olson to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one measure of Lopez's promise is a non-athlete hovering close to the 
action. Thomas C. Lynch, promotions director for Neumann Glove Co., happily 
points out Lopez's equipment: wrist bands, batting gloves and catcher's mitt, 
all Neumann products. Neumann is trying to break into the baseball equipment 
market; the company is counting on television closeups of Lopez and his Neumann 
equipment for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Javy is only a rookie, and already he's the one the fans want," Lynch says. 
</P>

 Another two-sport Jordan is playing baseball, really playing. The morning 
after "the circus," Brian Jordan plants himself firmly in the batting cage at 
the Busch Complex. Cardinals hitting coach Chris Chambliss reaches into a bag 
of baseballs. Nobody else is around. No other players or coaches, no satellite 
trucks or minicams. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 minutes the sound of Jordan's bat on ball shatters the morning silence 
and sends foraging seabirds flapping away in terror. Jordan was a 205-pound 
All-Pro defensive back with the Falcons until he quit football in 1991. He quit 
because baseball offered greater longevity. Still, his swing communicates the 
explosive violence of football. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Jordan hit .309, with 10 home runs and 44 RBIs in just 223 
at-bats. His season was cut short when his left shoulder socket detached, an 
injury first incurred on a football field. Offseason surgery and rehabilitation 
fixed the shoulder. No work was required on Jordan's attitude. He is driven and 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times last season when I swung and my shoulder would drop out of 
the socket," says Jordan, 26. "I had to snap it back in. It was painful. But 
I'm a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 "People think athletes are motivated by money, but I know what motivates me. 
The challenge. I want the ball at the end of the game. I want to be up at the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>

 Each spring clubhouse has an invisible wall. On one side sit the 
major-leaguers. On the other side, the players with minor league contracts. The 
major-leaguers greet one another, discuss golf and investments, open boxes of 
fan mail and grant interviews to reporters. The players with minor league 
contracts watch them, inscrutable and hawk-eyed. Social contact between the two 
groups is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude of minor-leaguers invited to major league camps is typified by 
Jeff Patterson, a businesslike 25-year-old reliever in the Phillies 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to be seen," Patterson says. "If they see you, 
maybe you get a call during the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson put in five professional seasons before getting his first invitation 
to the major league camp. He pitched well for Scranton last season in short 
relief. If the Phillies -- with their weak bullpen -- had ignored him this 
spring, he would have begun to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not labeled a minor-leaguer -- I'm not at that stage yet," Patterson 
says. "That label can really hurt guys. Because they don't take the time to get 
past the label. It's an uphill battle after that."

FOR HARDING, DIFFERENT VENUE, DIFFERENT JUDGES; JURISPRUDENCE: TONYA MAY WIND 
UP IN JAIL. SHE COULD LOSE HER ELIGIBILITY TO COMPETE. OR SHE COULD SKATE AWAY 
FROM ALL OF THE ACCUSATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an eighth place finish in the Olympics, Tonya Harding may face even 
harsher judgment back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Two investigations into her alleged role in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan are 
to be completed in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 She could wind up in jail. She could lose her eligibility to compete. Or she 
could skate away from all of the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. plans a hearing March 9 to determine whether her 
membership should be revoked for ethics violations stemming from the Kerrigan 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal investigation in Portland grinds on in an "orderly and 
professional" fashion, as lead prosecutor Norm Frink puts it. A grand jury has 
been hearing testimony and gathering evidence for more than a month in the 
Kerrigan case, and it is expected to return indictments by March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Frink said that charges could be filed either in Multnomah County in Portland; 
in Wayne County in Detroit, where the attack occurred; or possibly in a federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an open question that has not yet been resolved," Frink said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He obtained a delay in the deadline by the Multnomah County grand jury because 
it appeared unlikely that Harding would be able to cooperate until the Olympics 
were over and the figure skating hearing had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, however, would like to avoid the figure skating hearing altogether. 
Her attorneys have asked for an indefinite delay in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rawlinson, one of her lawyers and the husband of her coach, said in 
Norway that a settlement was possible. That comment drew a sharp reaction from 
John Bennett, the Portland attorney who has been gathering evidence for the 
figure skating association. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has approached me and I know nothing about that, just what I read in 
the newspaper," Bennett said. "I know Mr. Rawlinson does not represent her in 
relation to the United States Figure Skating Assn. and I thought his comments 
were interesting in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlinson has removed himself from the Harding legal team in the figure 
skating investigation, citing a potential conflict of interest because his wife 
is an association member. 
</P>
<P>
 A special five-member panel has found reasonable cause to believe Harding was 
involved with or knew of the plot to assault Kerrigan. The hearing, expected to 
last three days, will determine if Harding's membership should be revoked, an 
action that would disqualify her from the world championships March 22-27 in 
Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a competition in China that provided the genesis for the plot to 
assault Kerrigan, according to Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly. He said he 
and Harding were upset with the low marks she received there in December and 
became convinced that she had no shot at winning the U.S. championship as long 
as Kerrigan was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has admitted he helped engineer the plot that resulted in the assault 
on Kerrigan. She was clubbed above the right knee with a metal police baton 
Jan. 6 in Detroit prior to the U.S. championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding went on to win the competition in Kerrigan's absence, although 
Kerrigan was named to the Olympic team anyway and won the silver medal. 
Harding, who filed suit to stay on the U.S. team after revelations about her 
alleged involvement became known, went to Norway and won nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has pleaded guilty to racketeering in a deal with prosecutors, saying 
that Harding was in on the plot and gave the final go-ahead. She denies any 
prior knowledge. But she admits she found out when she returned from Detroit 
that people around her were involved and that she did not immediately come to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledges she lied during the initial part of her 10 1/2-hour interview 
with the FBI on Jan. 18, then changed her story and implicated Gillooly when 
confronted by her interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying to investigators is itself a crime, but Harding could face more serious 
racketeering or conspiracy charges if the grand jury believes there is 
sufficient evidence to prove she was in on the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly and Harding's occasional bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt, have implicated 
Harding, but both could be shaky witnesses because they have been known to lie 
in the past -- Gillooly to FBI investigators in Detroit, and Eckardt in wild 
claims made on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as hard evidence goes, investigators have a note found in a restaurant 
trash bin that included the name of the suburban Boston arena where Kerrigan 
practices and her practice times. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has said he watched Harding write down the times after she obtained 
the information from a free-lance skating writer in Pennsylvania. Several 
sources have said the handwriting matches that of Harding. The Pennsylvania 
writer also has confirmed that Harding called her to get the information. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was to have been carried out in Massachusetts, but that plan fell 
through, according to those already charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also have telephone records that show several calls to Eckardt 
from Harding's hotel around the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys have said there are reasonable explanations for the 
evidence, although Frink has said he wishes they would tell him what they are. 
</P>
<P>
 A Portland television station also has said Harding has failed two of three 
lie-detector tests, although those results are not admissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has taken a lie-detector test as well, and his attorney, Ron Hoevet, 
has said he would make the results available to the figure skating association 
if asked. Judge Donald Londer has refused to allow Gillooly to go to Colorado 
Springs for the figure skating association's hearing, raising the possibility 
that the session might be switched to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding faces any criminal charges, Weaver has laid the groundwork for 
using the "battered wife syndrome" as a possible defense, a tactic that was 
successful in the Lorena Bobbitt case. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned that possibility during a hearing on Harding's lawsuit against 
the U.S. Olympic Committee that led to her being allowed to compete in the 
Winter Games. Harding also tearfully recalled being beaten by Gillooly during 
her interview on "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung." 
</P>
<P>
 Just where Harding will live when she returns is unknown. She had been staying 
with her friends John and Stephanie Quintero, but the management at the 
apartment building, fed up with all the attention, reportedly wants that 
arrangement to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding apparently has plenty of money to find other living quarters. The 
syndicated TV show "Inside Edition" reportedly has paid her $500,000 for a 
series of exclusive interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Harding and Gillooly both apparently have gotten some of the riches 
that, if his story is to be believed, they so desperately wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Each night prior to the Olympics skating finale, Gillooly could be found on 
another show, "A Current Affair," telling the sordid details of the couple's 
long, stormy relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Olympic drama is over and many Americans may have had their fill 
of the Tonya and Nancy soap opera, she's coming back to reclaim her place 
beneath a cloud of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 More than seven weeks after the whack heard 'round the world, the final 
chapter is far from written.

ANALYSIS; SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE FADES INTO SUNSET -- IS THIS SO BAD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the coupe convertible with running boards on the side, the wide-brimmed 
fedora and the big red-and-white sign saying "Drink Coca-Cola in bottles," the 
Southwest Conference had its day. 
</P>
<P>
 It's done now -- a victim of the need to chase down big television contracts, 
forge alliances with major bowls and compete with the other superconferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Eight is adding Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech and Baylor, making it the 
Big 12, and what's left of the Southwest Conference will be the Little Four -- 
Rice, Texas Christian, Houston and Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 The first instinct is to decry the breakup of the SWC, a Texas tradition 
dating to 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 The intrastate rivalries of the eight Texas schools have been lost because 
they all aren't fighting for the same goal: the host berth in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Four have been set adrift in a new age that demands marketability. 
That means winning, going to bowl games, putting fans in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Is this so bad? 
</P>
<P>
 The SWC does have a glorious past, filled with tradition and names like Doak 
Walker, Earl Campbell, Darrell Royal and Bear Bryant; offenses like the 
wishbone and run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists would prefer to have a little conference neatly confined 
inside Texas, fighting each other on the playing field but banded together 
against the outsiders who want to recruit the state's best players. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, sort of, for almost a century. It doesn't work at all any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston will always be a commuter school; Rice will always have a tiny alumni 
base; Southern Methodist may never overcome the effects of the death penalty; 
Texas Christian and the other Little Four will always be fighting the shadow of 
the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unless something has been left out of the news, the four departing 
schools won't move their campuses to Kansas. They'll still be in Texas. They'll 
still be playing each other, and possibly the Little Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Campbell still played for the Longhorns. The legend of the Aggies' 12th 
Man won't suddenly disappear. It's all still in place. It's just going to be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take awhile for everyone to get accustomed to the new order. 
</P>
<P>
 Several state officials, including those from Houston, have threatened to make 
the deserters pay for splitting up the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
 But the four departing schools made a politically correct maneuver. They have 
alumni in high places if there is any legislative heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M and Texas have strong enough representation to form a protective 
coalition. Gov. Ann Richards and Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock are Baylor graduates. 
State Rep. Rob Junell, chairman of the Texas House Appropriations committee and 
Texas House Speaker Pete Laney are Texas Tech graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris County legislators are especially concerned about the effect on Houston 
to have Rice and Houston left out of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for UH getting its due," said Rep. Debra Danburg, a Houston alumna. "If 
that means taking it out of the hides of the University of Texas and Texas A&M, 
I'll be glad to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen to the Little Four? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they'll take the attitude of Houston football coach Kim Helton, who will 
soon have a $25 million sports complex to promote. He doesn't sound like a man 
ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to win the national championship," Helton said. "We are headed in a 
very positive direction and to exclude Houston from where its headed would be a 
mistake on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 The message is no longer subliminal. Long discussed changes are here and 
mourning the passing of the SWC won't cause Dallas Cowboys fans to tear up 
their season tickets to go watch the Mustangs in Ownby Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner the states' fans realize it's a changing world out there, some of 
the pain may begin to subside.

BITTER NBA RIVALRIES NOW MOSTLY A SWEET MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixers-Celtics. Celtics-Lakers. Pistons-Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when their meetings were anticipated for weeks and even 
months. Players saved their sharpest elbows and scariest glares for their 
biggest rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who played those games remember them with a certain fondness. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees like Kevin McHale, who saw the end of many years of the 
Boston-Philadelphia rivalry and the 1980s version of the long-standing 
Celtics-Lakers battles, bemoaned the absence of rough games late in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it better when we hated each other," said McHale, noting the luster 
is gone from the game when players have the same agents, wear the same shoes 
and make commercials together. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominque Wilkins said the way opponents treat each other has changed in his 12 
years in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that veterans wouldn't talk to you," Wilkins said. "Larry Bird 
wouldn't talk to me my first year. He just stared at me when I tried to shake 
his hand. Guys like Larry, Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bernard King 
really made you earn their respect. You had to be ready to play every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins said it's different today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm friends with a lot of guys on other teams," he said. "But once you tip 
off, there are no friends. That hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The best recent rivalry was Detroit and Chicago. The Pistons beat the Bulls in 
the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before Chicago turned the tables 
in 1991 by beating Detroit en route to the first of three straight NBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those years were tough, but fun," Scottie Pippen said. "We played the game 
the way it is supposed to be played. But we finally learned we didn't have to 
have bad blood to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The best rivalries of the '60s, '70s and '80s are dead now because the only 
thing that sustains a great rivalry is great teams. When the competition dies, 
so does the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the best games today are between Chicago and New York or Seattle 
and Phoenix. It's no coincidence that these four teams met in last year's 
conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bulls-Knicks games are just as intense this year as last year, even with 
Michael Jordan gone," Patrick Ewing said. "They're the defending champions and 
they have what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant, another veteran of the years when the Bulls and Pistons were 
bitter rivals, said no game today "will ever compare with that. But I'm not 
really sorry to see them go. In rivalries like that, you get Bill Laimbeer 
shots and Rick Mahorn elbows. I'm a physical player, but I don't want to have 
to wear pads or helmets." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix guard Kevin Johnson said today's best rivalries might not be as tough 
as in past years because different teams are rising to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes four or five years to build that tradition of a great rivalry," 
Johnson said. "There's been a changing of the guard in the NBA. We're starting 
to build a real tough rivalry with Seattle, but it takes time." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Wilkins, Johnson said, "I don't want to see kissing between opponents 
before the game, but I don't see anything wrong with being friends afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good teams make rivalries," Johnson's teammate, Charles Barkley, said. "The 
Celtics and Lakers are still rivals, but it's not as big because the teams 
aren't as good. When teams are bad, you can't hate each other as much. You just 
feel sorry for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley was in Philadelphia when the 76ers-Celtics rivalry was still strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the two teams hated each other, he said, "Hate is too strong a word. 
In those days, Larry Bird would tell me I couldn't stop him and I would say he 
couldn't stop me, but there was no vindictiveness between us. Now there's 
something evil in the trash talking."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Manager Neil Smith of the New York Rangers said he has signed U.S. 
defenseman Barry Richter and will assign him to Binghamton, N.Y., of the 
American Hockey League.He also intends to sign center Todd Marchant. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his speed, he's got a chance," Smith said. "I think we can make a 
checker out of him." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Smith said he's not interested in signing Peter or Chris Ferraro, 
even though Peter was the Olympic team's top goal scorer in pre-tournament 
play. The Ferraros' size -- each twin is 5 feet 10 and 175 pounds -- makes them 
questionable pro prospects. HELENE ELLIOTT

AUTO RACING; EARNHARDT: DRIVERS GET FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever there is a death or serious injury in racing, questions arise about 
how a driver can strap himself into a race car knowing the possible 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly was on a lot of minds last week after fatal crashes in practice 
for the Daytona 500 took the lives of Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr. Bonnett was 
a veteran with 18 Winston Cup victories, and Orr was a rookie trying to make 
the jump to the big time of stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, a six-time Winston Cup champion and one of Bonnett's closest 
friends, said, "I think you can always lull yourself into a false sense of 
security, whether you're a race driver or driving down the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens to us when you're in a race car and you've got all the rollbars 
around you and you're strapped in. But the impact that can happen and did 
happen (to Bonnett), there's nothing in the world that would have saved you." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Earnhardt a racer, but all three of his children from a previous 
marriage are racing on short tracks in North Carolina. That includes his sons, 
23-year-old Kerry and 21-year-old Dale Jr., and 19-year-old daughter Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm concerned about them. But I'm more concerned if they were out being 
subjected to drugs and violence, shootings, anything like that. I'm more 
comfortable them doing their hobby right now, driving a race car. They're going 
to race and I'm going to race." 
</P>
<P>
 HOOSIER WILL TRY again this weekend at Rockingham, N.C., to gets its new 
radial racing tires up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daytona 500 was a publicity disaster for the small Lakeville, Ind., 
company that manufactures only racing tires and is taking on tire-making giant 
Goodyear in the Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
 Their superspeedway tire was labeled too slow and not stable enough and, after 
a great deal of controversy, complaint and sniping, Bob Newton, president of 
Hoosier, gave his contract drivers permission to switch to Goodyears for the 
season-opening race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew there would be good days and bad days," said three-time Winston cup 
champion Darrell Waltrip, one of only a handful of series regulars to sign for 
the season with Hoosier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to go to a race somewhere down the road and the guys on 
Goodyears are saying that the Hoosiers have us covered this week. We knew that. 
It's too bad it happened in the first race. We would have liked to get off to 
an equal start so we didn't have this controversy early one. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's going to be this way all year," Waltrip added. "Tires will be the 
story everywhere you go. It's David vs. Goliath, and it's going to take a while 
for things to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 TRAVELING WEEK AFTER week is tough on the body, and Will Lind, a longtime 
member of Richard Childress Racing, which fields cars for Dale Earnhardt, has 
decided to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lind, a veteran mechanic and all-star tire changer, told Childress recently 
that the Daytona 500 would be his last race with the pit crew. He plans to 
continue working for Childress at the team's shop in Welcome, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it was time to re-evaluate things and come off the road," Lind 
said. "There is a lot of pressure in this business, and there's a lot on us 
because of the success we've had. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a lot (of pressure) on ourselves to remain successful, but a lot of 
things have happened over the past two years to make me think," he said, citing 
the deaths last year of Davey Allison and Alan Kulwicki, the resignation of 
former crew chief Kirk Shelmerdine, and even the retirement of basketball 
superstar Michael Jordan. Then there was the death of Neil Bonnett during 
practice for Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all makes you think," Lind said. "I wouldn't trade the last 10 years for 
anything. I still want to win. In fact, if someone gets sick, I'll be back at 
the track to help. I still have the desire, that's not it. I guess I just want 
to step aside before I lose that desire." 
</P>
<P>
 RICKY RUDD WAS about as proud of his eighth-place finish in the Daytona 500 as 
he's every been of a racing performance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the racing debut of his new Rudd Performance Motorsports team, which 
was little more than a dream when he announced its formation in August at 
Michigan International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big learning experience," he said. "This car never went to the 
wind tunnel and we missed the balance on the car. Throughout the race, we 
pretty much got that figured out, then we didn't quite have the right front 
springs on the car. All in all, though, it was a good day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a learning curve ahead of us. Already, I think we're ahead of the 
game, at least from where some folks thought we would be. We finished the race, 
the guys did a professional job getting and keeping the car together, and the 
motor ran good." 
</P>
<P>
 JUST LIKE LAST year, when Dale Jarrett beat Dale Earnhardt in the Daytona 500, 
there is a tie for the Winston Cup point lead following the opening event. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Earnhardt tied Jarrett by getting a five-point bonus for leading the 
most laps, 1994 runner-up Ernie Irvan did the same against winner Sterling 
Marlin. Those two go into Sunday's race at Rockingham, N.C., tied with 180 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan hopes the comparisons continue, since Earnhardt went on to win the 
season championship.

PREP WRESTLING; CALVARY CHAPEL QUALIFIES EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section Masters' wrestling meet at Fountain Valley High Saturday 
was merely another stop for Santa Ana Calvary Chapel as it looks to win its 
second consecutive State title. 
</P>
<P>
 By qualifying a meet-high eight wrestlers for next weekend's State tournament 
at the University of Pacific in Stockton, the Eagles put themselves in an ideal 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely peaking right now," said Dane Valdez, who won the 125-pound 
title, beating Temecula Valley's Mark Perryman, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez was one of four Calvary Chapel wrestlers to win championships. Brother 
Shane Valdez won at 119 pounds, Joshua Holiday at 145, and Tim Bonebright at 
152. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben De Leon of Ontario Chaffey prevented Joe Calavitta from winning another 
championship for the Eagles. De Leon defeated Calavitta, 11-4, at 103 pounds to 
earn his second consecutive Masters' title. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the closest championship matches of the evening, Vincent Virgen of 
Buena Park beat Teak Sato of Orange El Modena, 12-8. Virgen was ranked second 
in Orange County this season, and Sato was second in the state last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Steven Abas of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs had to settle for third 
place at 112, he set a national record for takedowns in a season. Abas got his 
329th when he beat Lakewood's Brian Gilland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bell High, bolstered by five individual titles, won its second consecutive 
City Section crown with 185 1/2 points at Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Gonzalez (112 pounds), Ramsas Ochoa (145), Frank Ordorica (171), Jesus 
Orozco (189) and Adolfo Padilla (heavyweight) won for the Eagles. Orozco was 
voted the outstanding wrestler for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills El Camino Real finished second with 163 points and won three 
titles: Andy Becker (103), Casey Lee (119) and Rick Ullman (152). Canoga Park 
finished third, winning two titles.

SANTA ANITA; SEMILLON SURGES FROM LAST, WINS SAN MARINO HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Mitchell recently called Semillon the best horse he has ever trained, and 
the colt did nothing to change that assessment at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-2 favorite in the $82,200 San Marino Handicap, Semillon trailed his six 
rivals for most of the 1 1/4 miles, then surged to win going away under Eddie 
Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining unbeaten in three American starts for owner Lady White, the 
4-year-old son of Rousillon won by 2 1/4 lengths in 2:00 3/5 and he now looks 
ready to tackle Bien Bien and Fanmore in the San Luis Rey and/or San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Semillon had to survive a stewards' inquiry for an alleged incident in the 
stretch, but no change was made. Memento Mori, who was running in a $6,250 
starter handicap race as recently as last September, finished second, a nose in 
front of Alex The Great. 
</P>
<P>
 Itsallgreektome, making his second start after being away for 14 months, 
finished last as the 2-1 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really showed me he was a good horse today," Delahoussaye said. "They said 
in Europe that he couldn't go 1 1/4 miles -- he only ran a mile -- but the way 
he ran today, he could be any kind of horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got wiped out at the start, but if we had been five lengths closer, he 
would have kicked on anyway because he is very relaxed. He came from last on a 
course where horses haven't been doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he accelerated the last quarter mile after that bad start and slow 
pace (1:11 2/5 for six furlongs), he showed me he could be a top horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, primarily a claiming trainer who had stakes success with Johnny's 
Image, Distant Ryder and Speedratic, says Semillon is getting better each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so good right now it scares me," he said. "We're going to have to sit 
down with the owners and figure out our next plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Second in his comeback race on Jan. 17, Itsallgreektome was well positioned 
throughout by Kent Desormeaux, but when it became apparent he was beaten, 
Desormeaux virtually eased the 7-year-old gelding late in the stretch. He wound 
up about 18 lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt great on the track," said Desormeaux. "He absolutely galloped around 
there, but I just think it wasn't his day. Maybe it was something he couldn't 
tell us, but I can say from a rider's standpoint that the horse is absolutely 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inactive since winning the Yellow Ribbon Invitational as a 16-1 shot last 
November, Possibly Perfect is the 2-1 favorite for the $112,300 Buena Vista 
Handicap today. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Bobby Frankel, the 4-year-old Northern Baby filly has won four of 
six since arriving from France. In her two defeats, Possibly Perfect was second 
to Hollywood Wildcat in the Del Mar Oaks and was third behind Tribulation and 
Miami Sands in the Queen Elizabeth at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux will ride Possibly Perfect, who worked seven furlongs in 1:25 1/5 
on Feb. 19 preparing for the one-mile Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail out, the rest of the field includes San Gorgonio Handicap winner 
Hero's Love, Zoonaqua, Pracer, Gumpher, Skimble, who is also trained by 
Frankel, Vinista and Lady Blessington. Waitryst was scratched Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien, the beaten favorite in the San Luis Obispo Handicap last Monday, 
might run in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery and trainer Paco Gonzalez are 
considering running the Manila horse in the 1 1/4-mile race, which might 
attract as many as 11 starters. Bien Bien would be switching to the dirt in the 
Big 'Cap and he has not been very effective on that surface, winning only once 
in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're serious about running," Gonzalez said. "If the weights are right, and 
if he doesn't draw an inside post position, then I think he'll run. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of (the San Luis Obispo) really good and he's training very well 
on dirt. I really think there is a good chance he's going to run." 
</P>
<P>
 The probable starters in the Santa Anita Handicap are Kissin Kris, The Wicked 
North, Region, Nonproductiveasset, Diazo, Myrakalu, Stuka and Hill Pass. Other 
possibles beside Bien Bien are Megan's Interco and Slew Of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana will carry high weight of 123 pounds when she tries for her second 
victory in the Santa Margarita a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten by a nose by Supah Gem in the Santa Maria in her first start of 1994, 
Paseana will be spotting four pounds to La Canada winner Stalcreek, 10 to 
Sensational Eyes and eight to Alysbelle, who was a nose behind Paseana in the 
Santa Maria. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita Handicap will be televised by ABC. It will be shown live in 
the East and delayed locally. . . . Fly'n J. Bryan, unbeaten in two sprints, 
will run in the San Rafael Stakes a week from today rather than ship to Oaklawn 
Park for the Southwest Stakes six days later. . . . Jockeys Eddie Delahoussaye 
and Kent Desormeaux each won twice Saturday.

 Women are in the workplace to stay. They want careers, not jobs. They want 
tough assignments. They want pay equity. They want to be judged on their 
performance rather than how they "fit in." They want benefits that facilitate 
balancing home and work. They want to behave like women and not be judged 
incompetent because they don't act like men. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of these requests, male executives find their work environment 
charged with sexual static. The source -- working with women as peers and 
bosses -- creates feelings among men of confusion and discomfort. Unlike static 
on the radio, the sexual static generated by women is difficult to avoid. 
Consequently, like Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady," men ask, "Why can't a woman 
be more like a man?" 
</P>
<P>
 As women pursue new opportunities outside the home, men see their 
opportunities dwindle inside the office. They are being asked to remove their 
unearned knapsack of privilege and climb the corporate mountain like those who 
historically had none. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves white males disoriented; they have never had to think much about 
the advantages contained in that knapsack. Many men feel the rules have changed 
in the middle of the game and that work is a male construct under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing control in politics, sports and the family," one male executive 
complains. "Our last stand is work. It's the only place we still call the 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 All men worry about workplace changes, particularly those that affect them 
personally. They feel victimized by sexual harassment laws they don't 
understand and by affirmative action guidelines they feel provide women with 
their own knapsack of privilege.  
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging gender differences as a source of sexual static is a first step 
toward lessening their negative impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards for measuring success historically have been based on male 
attributes, and that is why it is important to talk about gender differences. 
Men and women are different -- in the way they communicate, in the way they 
motivate others, in the way they exercise power and in the way they allocate 
their time. Denying differences is counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 The second step toward minimizing sexual static is for men to understand how 
their assumptions and expectations of women color their workplace interactions. 
Women, for their part, need to be patient. This does not mean accepting sexual 
discrimination or harassment in the many forms it takes. Rather, it means being 
sensitive and understanding as men struggle with the fact that their roles are 
changing, often without their consent. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of gender role flux is brought home to Americans daily. Hot-button 
notions -- "gender war," "white male outrage," "women and power" and "family 
values" -- permeate books, periodicals and television. Discussions in 
boardrooms and living rooms are alive with heated arguments, as well as 
attempts to find answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no easy answers -- no magic bullets, no one-minute solutions, no 
proven formulas. Every organization has to test its own atmosphere and measure 
the sexual static that exists. Once measured, its sources need to be located 
and actions taken to minimize its impact. This means modifying male and female 
behavior, as well as organizational policies and procedures. Minimizing sexual 
static requires men to admit that shedding their knapsack of privilege strikes 
at the heart of male self-esteem. If women can do what men can do, what does it 
mean to be male?  
</P>
<P>
 Today, men find themselves facing not only a major restructuring of work that 
creates uncertainty about their economic future, but also a redefinition of 
maleness that speaks to their personal psyches. If the assumptions I have 
articulated are correct, what's needed is less combat between men and women, 
not more. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women will have to work together to invent and accept new roles. That 
implies becoming comfortable with gender differences -- seeing them as a 
resource, not a problem, and valuing them, rather than using them as common 
fodder in a gender war.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: DMV TAX BREAK VARIES BY COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Q: I know that at least some portion of the annual automobile registration 
fees we pay to the California Department of Motor Vehicles is tax deductible. 
The only problem is that I can't figure out what the correct amount is. Can you 
help? -- M.H . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Every year, the Department of Motor Vehicles sends out about 33 million 
renewal notices for automobiles and commercial vehicles registered in the 
California. Those registration renewal forms clearly note that the "license 
fee" is the only portion of the charge that may be claimed as an income tax 
deduction. As a taxpayer, it is in your best interest to retain these forms 
when they arrive to aid in the preparation of your tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you didn't keep the forms, you may call your local DMV branch 
office to get this information. Have your license plate number available for 
prompt service. The precise amount you may claim as "license fee" deduction 
varies because each county is entitled to levy its own road and improvement 
assessments that are not tax deductible. Further, these charges may change from 
year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the current amounts residents of Southern California may deduct on 
their 1993 tax returns: Owners of non-commercial passenger vehicles registered 
in Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside counties may deduct all but $35 of the 
annual renewal fee for each vehicle. In Orange County, you may deduct all but 
$36. In Ventura County, you may deduct all but $34. Present Tax Basis on 
Community Property 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am a recent widow. My husband had a revocable personal trust that is now 
irrevocable. I had a similar trust. However, we signed a legal document 
reaffirming that the property in each of the trusts was community property. I 
have been told that because of my husband's death, the tax basis of the assets 
in my trust were reset as of his date of death. If that is true, I am anxious 
to give my children and grandchildren the full amount of the gifts I am 
entitled to make this year. Please advise: Will my gifts carry a capital gains 
problem? -- M.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Our experts say that if the assets in your revocable trust were in fact 
properly characterized as community property, their tax basis was reset as of 
your husband's date of death. In this case, any gifts you make of these assets 
at this point would carry little or no capital gains "problems" since their tax 
basis has been stepped up to their value as of your husband's death, thus 
eliminating any untaxed appreciation they accumulated over the years. Expenses 
in Lawsuit May Be Deductible 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I sold a home in 1992 and was sued by the buyer in early 1993. Although I 
ultimately prevailed, my legal fees amounted to $9,500. Since this money was 
paid in 1993, may I deduct it as a miscellaneous expense on my 1993 income 
taxes? The home in question was a non-rental second home, not my primary 
residence. -- N.N.R . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your ability to deduct the legal fees hinges on the reason for the lawsuit 
and whether you reported a taxable gain on the sale. If you were sued because 
of a matter relating to the sale of the home and you reported a taxable gain on 
the sale, you are entitled to deduct your legal fees as a miscellaneous 
itemized deduction. If you reported a loss on the sale, your legal fees are not 
deductible. Taxable Profit on Sale of Refinanced Home 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I refinanced my mortgage last year and rolled all the costs and points into 
the refinanced loan. Later in the year, I sold that home and purchased another. 
Is my taxable profit the difference between the sales price and the original 
purchase price or the sales price and the refinanced mortgage? Also, what loan 
costs are tax deductible on my 1993 tax return? -- R.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your potential taxable profit on the sale is the difference between the 
sales price and your original tax basis in the home. If this was the first home 
you purchased, your tax basis would be your purchase price plus the cost of any 
permanent improvements you made to the home. If it was not your first home, 
then your potential taxable profit would be based on the difference between the 
sales price and the taxable basis you had when you purchased the home plus the 
cost of any permanent improvements you made to that home. The amount of the 
refinanced mortgage is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, because you sold your home within the same year you refinanced the 
mortgage on it, you are entitled to deduct the entire amount of the points you 
were charged for the refinancing. If you had not sold the home, the points 
would have to be amortized over the life of the loan. Weigh Enjoyment Against 
Tax Saving 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife and I own an out-of-state vacation home that we want to give to our 
son and daughter-in-law because we are no longer able to use and maintain it. 
We paid $10,000 for it and it is now worth about $24,000. We know we can make a 
gift of the house by using the $10,000 per person gift limit each taxpayer has 
every year. But what tax basis are we passing on to our son and his wife? -- 
R.A . 
</P>
<P>
 A: The vacation home carries your original tax basis which is probably the 
$10,000 you paid for it. If you waited until your death to make the bequest, 
the home would be valued as of your date of death, eliminating the potential 
taxable appreciation the house has enjoyed. However, you would be wise to weigh 
the relatively modest taxable increase you are passing on against the enjoyment 
your son's family will no doubt have in the house and the freedom from 
responsibility that you and your wife stand to gain by getting rid of it.

GREEN THUMBS; COMMUNITY GARDENS ALLOW LOW-INCOME ANGELENOS TO GROW THEIR OWN 
FOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Dardick is a Los Angeles free-lance 
writer.

<P>
 Vernell Tyler proudly showed a visitor her 10-foot-by-20-foot garden plot, 
filled with turnips, (varieties of both roots and greens), cabbage, lettuce, 
mustard greens, collards and beets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love getting my hands into the dirt and eating good," she said with a broad 
smile on her face. Hers is one of 30 such raised beds in the community garden 
at Nickerson Gardens in South-Central Los Angeles. Enclosed by a sturdy 
chain-link fence, the beds are surrounded by carefully tended grass pathways. 
Two peach trees and one apple tree line one of the fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler is one of the thousands of low-income Los Angeles residents who are 
growing and harvesting their own vegetables, herbs and fruit through the 
efforts of the Common Ground Garden Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening is the most popular outdoor activity in America, according to a 
recent Gallup Poll. But these community gardens provide more than a leisure 
activity for people whose local markets don't stock much of a selection of 
fresh, good quality produce. Community gardens give low-income people the 
chance to grow fresh vegetables at a fraction of the cost of purchasing them 
and also transform vacant, trash-filled lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor people can't come to the gardens, so we bring the gardens to them," said 
Brenda Funches, program manager for Common Ground. "Our focus is to eliminate 
hunger and poor nutrition while teaching them how to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground is part of the UC Cooperative Extension, founded in 1913 in an 
era when cooperative extensions were the means for land-grant universities to 
provide their research to farmers. Common Ground serves Los Angeles County, and 
it is the oldest and largest organization promoting community gardens here. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shift in population and focus, now the efforts in this region are 
tailored to an urban populace, unlike most other California counties where 
Cooperative Extension still serves agriculture.  
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old Los Angeles urban garden program is one of 23 nationwide and 
is funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Common Ground has started 
more than 100 community gardens in low-income areas of Los Angeles, Lynwood, 
Inglewood and Long Beach. Common Ground operates 12 community gardens and 
provides support to another six. Four more are scheduled to be built with the 
L.A. Partnership for a Drug-Free Community. These will serve low-income 
families affected by substance abuse. Common Ground also provides technical 
assistance to other organizations (L.A. Food Bank and Metro Farms) and cities 
in L.A. County with community gardens. There are more than 100 such gardens in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the efforts of 10 staff members and a corps of volunteers, more than 
26,000 adults and children have harvested fresh produce, learned skills and 
enjoyed friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics of the program are few, some of the hardest to persuade can 
be the people whom Common Ground is trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Juanita Randall, a longtime resident of Nickerson Gardens, is quick to admit 
that she was one of the worst doubters five years ago when the community garden 
was installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a waste of time, that it wouldn't work," she said. "I was 
worried about the kids stealing the food." 
</P>
<P>
 But she changed her mind when she saw the benefits of the garden, the surge of 
neighborhood cooperation. She now serves as the treasurer for the local garden 
club that administers the community garden. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, vandals have hit the Nickerson Garden plots, as they have at some of 
the other gardens, but the community gardeners are usually able to pinpoint the 
troublemakers and change their actions and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids stopped hassling us when they saw how good this is for the 
neighborhood," Randall said. "We love to give our surplus away if people will 
just ask us." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the community gardens produce enough to take care of the gardeners, 
their families, friends and even the neighborhood homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherl Hopkins, a longtime Common Ground employee, did a study to determine how 
much a garden plot could produce. He harvested 585 pounds of vegetables, grown 
for three months and picked at their best edible size. After replanting the 
garden bed, he obtained similar results three months later. In all, he 
harvested one ton of produce in a year. Estimating a value of 50 cents a pound, 
he figured that $1,000 worth of fresh vegetables can be grown in a typical 
10-foot-by-20-foot garden plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the average person doesn't know how to garden as intensively, so a 
conservative estimate is that the harvest will be half that," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drives around Los Angeles, Hopkins eyes the many empty, weed-choked or 
debris-strewn lots. "I think there are enough vacant lots in Los Angeles that 
if all were in (crop) production, they could feed the city," he said. "People 
don't understand how much produce you can get out of 150 square feet of dirt 
and what minimal effort it takes to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 riots, Common Ground started a computer database of vacant lots 
in Los Angeles. To date, the community garden land bank contains 2,500 parcels 
in an area bordered by the Hollywood Freeway on the north to Imperial Highway 
on the south, west to La Cienega Boulevard and east to Long Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of vacant land in Los Angeles, this is just the tip of the 
iceberg," said Funches, who is supervising an effort to contact these property 
owners to ask that they make their land available for community gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hopkins, the easiest part of establishing community gardens is 
planting the vegetables. The challenge is obtaining the land, bringing in 
water, getting the lumber needed to build the raised beds and, in some cases, 
chain link for fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started in 1977 with an annual budget of $250,000 and a staff of 40," 
Funches said. "Now our base allocation is $112,000 and we have a staff of 10." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Common Ground relies heavily on donations and volunteers. Last 
year, the Burpee Seed Co. donated 1 million packets of seeds and promises more 
when needed. Kellogg's donated 9,000 bags of soil amendment and Miracle-Gro 
donated 1,000 cases of fertilizer and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Common Ground began specialized training programs 17 years ago, more 
than 1,000 people have volunteered as master gardeners, master food preservers, 
gardening angels (who teach children) and master composters. In exchange for 
training, they commit to 40 hours of volunteer service teaching adults or 
children the skills of gardening and food preserving. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground also holds free or low-cost workshops on vegetable gardening, 
food preservation, composting and community problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are a mix of ages and ethnic cultures. Roman Valdez of 
Wilmington became a master gardener two years ago at the suggestion of his 
father, who had completed the training. Valdez works for an aircraft company 
and does part-time gardening work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a master gardener is fulfilling and also a constant education because 
the (Common Ground) staff is so knowledgeable," he said. "I'm always learning 
from them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez volunteers at the 22nd Street Garden, where he helps with soil 
preparation, weeding, watering and general maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volunteers are the lifeblood of these programs; we'd be dead in the water 
without them," Funches commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground has set up guidelines to ensure the success and longevity of its 
gardens. A garden club, formed by the site's users, is recommended. Each 
participant pays a yearly fee of $25 for water. While master gardeners are on 
hand to help with the common areas, each participant is responsible for the 
maintenance of his or her plot and is expected to help keep up the common 
pathways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that by empowering the people involved and making them responsible 
for their gardens, they'll continue once we've gotten them started," Funches 
said. In early efforts, after Common Ground staff moved on to other gardens, 
often the community gardens failed from lack of participation by local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Common Ground estimates more than $4 million worth of vegetables and 
fruit have been grown to date, the agency wants to expand its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see low-cost housing built that includes community gardens into 
the plans," Funches said. "We can help developers and architects with the 
layout, if they'll contact us." 
</P>
<P>
 One ambitious project already designed and ready to be built when funds are 
available is Uhuru (Swahili for freedom). Common Ground, the Watts Health 
Foundation and L.A. Harvest, a clearinghouse for nonprofit agencies, formed a 
coalition to develop a 2.5-acre site as a large community garden and vocational 
training area to serve South-Central L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.7-million, 2.5-acre site will consist of a 60-plot community garden, 
orchard, greenhouse, municipal park, community center and market garden for the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from nearby schools, including 102 Street Elementary School and 
Jordan High School, will be encouraged to participate in the garden, and the 
plan is for teens to receive vocational training enabling them to find jobs in 
the green industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to break ground when we've obtained $1 million in cash, and we hope 
that will be early next year," Funches said. "We've already received pledges in 
plants and materials from green industry companies who are supportive of this 
project." Starting Community Garden 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground offers these guidelines for starting a community garden: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Speak with your neighbors to find out who wants to participate in a 
community garden. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Find a vacant lot in your neighborhood. It must have at least six hours 
of sunlight daily, not possible if tall buildings or trees shade the property. 
The soil should also be considered. If the parcel was used as a parking lot, 
the soil can be so compacted that it will be difficult to work and could also 
contain toxic material. Common Ground will advise you how to contact the owner 
for permission to use the property. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Water must be readily available. In cases where structures stood, water 
meters or pipes are usually in place. In some cases, meters have to be 
installed and the cost can be several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- A staff member or volunteer from Common Ground will meet with you and 
your neighbors to explain how to design and maintain a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Common Ground will also provide seeds, and lists of recommended plants, 
growing, irrigation and pest-control techniques. What You Can Do to Help 
</P>
<P>
 Common Ground needs the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Lumber for raised beds; garden tools such as rakes and shovels; garden hand 
tools; garden hoses; wheelbarrows; soil amendment. Cash donations are needed to 
pay for water for the community gardens. More volunteers are also wanted. For 
information about volunteering or donating to Common Ground, call (213) 
744-4341.

BRUINS GET LOSING OFF THEIR CHESTS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER A BUMPY TWO-GAME 
STRETCH, ED O'BANNON SPARKS A 103-88 VICTORY OVER STANFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let the good times roll, UCLA said Saturday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion, 
where the Bruins returned to those thrilling days of a month or so ago and 
crunched Stanford like a team caught between one of those chest bumps by the 
O'Bannon brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, there were gobs of good will, not to mention several sighs of 
relief after UCLA scored a 103-88 victory to end a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving on," Tyus Edney said. 
</P>
<P>
 All it took was a semi-rout of a team that lost its best player on fouls with 
12:01 left in a nine-point game. But, hey, who cares? Certainly not the Bruins, 
who after four losses in eight games had been studying their own shortcomings 
long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Saturday was a time for dunks and blocked shots and fast breaks and sharp 
passes, not to mention a couple of perfectly executed chest bumps celebrated by 
Ed and Charles O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to Ed O'Bannon's game than possibly bruising his sternum. 
He scored his season-high of 28 points and 19 rebounds in 35 minutes of the 
type of aggressive play that has seems to have been lost for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Ed O'Bannon plays basketball the way he can, we are a lot different 
basketball team," Bruin Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the Bruins are 19-4, 12-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference and hoping 
that Arizona trips up sometime soon and that they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anyone else, O'Bannon made sure the Bruins wouldn't stumble against 
the Cardinal, 7-7 in the Pac-10, and reduced at this stage of the season to 
spoiling things for somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are so hard on UCLA down here," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery told 
reporters afterward. "It's incredible. They'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, and if UCLA does continue on its winning ways, then it's probably 
going to be up to Ed O'Bannon to keep things on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is our key," center George Zidek said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon couldn't have been much better, although he probably would tell you 
it's a lot easier going against 6-foot-7 Andy Poppink of Stanford than, say, 
Lamond Murray of Cal, as he had to do last time out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, O'Bannon did what he is supposed to do, which is to show everybody 
else the way. Edney knew before the game that O'Bannon had it together. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see it in his eyes he was ready to play," Edney said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon already had 15 points and eight rebounds at the half, but UCLA's lead 
was only 43-40. Stanford was still hanging close, trailing by 57-53 when the 
game changed for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon scored on a 15-footer from the right baseline, hurried Brent 
Williams into a miss, then dropped in a layup on a breakaway, assisted by 
Edney. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver's three-pointer made the score 64-55 when Knight poked Edney for 
his fourth foul. It was 68-59 after a Knight drive through the middle when 
Knight picked up his fifth foul, chopping Edney in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight was gone. As the O'Bannons playfully pointed Knight toward the bench, 
Stanford's hopes went with him. Soon it was 80-67 on a rebound basket by Ed 
O'Bannon, then the Bruins withstood a six-possession scoreless streak because 
Stanford did not manage a point in the same span. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver's three-point play after an offensive rebound and yet another 
breakaway, this one finished by Ed O'Bannon, and the score was 85-69 with 4:39 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 It was over. Besides breaking out a seldom-seen full-court press, from then on 
the Bruins spent most of their time perfecting the art of fouling while 
Stanford majored in missing free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon fouled out for the Bruins, but it 
didn't matter much because Stanford missed 21 of 46 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery wanted to find someone to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's the free throw coach?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Harrick and his staff became the mental coaches. They had put 
together a highlight film of early season romps, then contrasted it to how the 
Bruins had been playing recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't playing the way the team was early in the season," Ed O'Bannon 
said. "It was very frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hugging and jumping around and high-fiving. But we saw it was us. It 
was our team. We just wanted to get back to it."

USC'S KIDS STEAL SHOW, UPSET CAL; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE NEW BACKCOURT OF 
HARRIS AND BOSEMAN KEYS WINNING SURGE IN OVERTIME, 86-78. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California might own UCLA, but Jason Kidd and the Bears met their match 
Saturday against USC and its new backcourt of Burt Harris and Stais Boseman. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting No. 17 Cal a 14-point lead seven minutes into the second half, 
the Trojans decided to stop watching and play some basketball themselves by 
tying the score in regulation on a three-point buzzer shot by Harris before 
defeating the Bears, 86-78, in overtime at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a sophomore point guard, played the game of his career in scoring 23 
points, including two key three-pointers in the final nine seconds of 
regulation. Boseman, a freshman guard, scored 13 points and keyed the Trojans' 
second-half defense against Kidd with three steals and one blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that no one gave us a chance to win . . . . not the media . . . . not 
the fans . . . . nobody," said USC senior Mark Boyd, who scored five of his 16 
points in the final nine minutes. "No one in their right state of mind would 
have bet on us after we lost to Stanford and they beat UCLA." Playing for 
respect is what sparked the Trojans in the second half, because with nearly 
half of the crowd of 6,123 cheering for Cal throughout the first half, USC at 
times looked like the visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
 With Lamond Murray scoring 11 points and Monty Buckley adding 10, the Bears 
dominated the last 11 minutes of the first half to take a 33-22 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 USC appeared completely overmatched in shooting only 27% and scoring a 
season-low 22 first half points. That's when USC Coach George Raveling decided 
to match Boseman against Kidd in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did against UCLA on Thursday, the Bears started the second half fast, 
but then lost their concentration as USC went on an 11-0 run to close within 
55-51 with five minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Trojans battled Cal basket for basket. Boseman came up with 
two steals from Kidd, and when Boyd scored on a rebound follow of a Boseman 
miss, USC trailed by only 65-63 with 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Harris took over with a three-pointer sandwiched between four free 
throws by Kidd to set up the dramatic regulation finish. With the clock running 
inside eight seconds, Harris dribbled around picks set by Tremayne Anchrum and 
Boyd to launch a shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he let it go, I was screaming at him because I saw Brandon Martin open 
and I knew I was, too," Boseman said. "Then when he made it, all I did was go 
over and hug him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' shot seemed to take the life out of Cal, which needed a victory to 
keep its hopes of finishing in a first-place tie in the Pacific 10 Conference 
with UCLA and Arizona alive. In overtime, USC outscored the Bears, 17-9. 
</P>
<P>
 A key in overtime for USC was its ability to foul out Murray, who finished 
with 22 points, and 6-foot-11 freshman Michael Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "In overtime, we went to work on each guy," Raveling said, whose Trojans 
improved to 13-11 overall and 6-9 in the Pac-10. "We wanted them to guard our 
guy in a one-on-one situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the USC locker room, it was clear that the Trojan heroes were Harris and 
Boseman, who complemented each other offensively and defensively down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game was good for my confidence in that I was playing against Kidd," 
Harris said. "When I took the shot (at the end of regulation), it felt good. 
Because there really wasn't any time, there wasn't any pressure. It was just do 
or die." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for USC, it was a do.

NHL ROUNDUP; CAPITALS BEAT POWERLESS PANTHERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers, two weeks ago golden in their bid for a playoff spot in 
their first season of existence, have become tarnished, with the Washington 
Capitals doing much of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams played a home-and-home series on Thursday and Saturday, 
Washington winning both games, the last, 4-2, at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The victories put the Capitals four points ahead of Florida and in seventh 
place in the East. Eight teams make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers have lost five of their last six games, chiefly because of a 
powerless play. They have scored on only two of their last 30 power plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely been costing us games," Florida's Scott Mellanby said. "They 
had two power-play goals tonight. That's what wins you games in the league -- 
and that's what loses you games." 
</P>
<P>
 Calle Johansson and Mike Ridley scored the power-play goals for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 3, New York 1 -- Goaltender Andy Moog won for the 299th time in leading 
the Stars at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was marred by a head injury to the Stars' scoring leader, Mike 
Modano, who was checked so hard by the Rangers' Mark Messier that his helmet 
flew off and his head struck the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Modano lay on the ice for five minutes before being taken to a hospital 
because of a cut on the back of his head. He was conscious and moving before 
leaving the arena, but attendants reportedly dropped him as his stretcher was 
being lifted into the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 11, Ottawa 1 -- Brendan Shanahan had three goals and two assists as 
the Blues set team records for offense and biggest margin of victory and handed 
the Senators their worst home loss, 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Toronto 0 -- Patrick Roy stopped 39 shots for his seventh shutout 
of the season as the Canadiens won at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Buffalo 3 -- Jaromir Jagr scored twice in the third period at 
Pittsburgh, where the Penguins also got a goal from Mario Lemieux. His back was 
well enough for him to play for only the second time in the last six games, the 
eighth time in 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 2, San Jose 0 -- Chris Osgood made 22 saves for his second consecutive 
shutout at Detroit, and the Red Wings extended their dominance over the Sharks 
to 9-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 1, New Jersey 1 -- Michael Nylander scored on a rebound in the third 
period as the Whalers rallied at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, Tampa Bay 1 -- Jyrki Lumme's short-handed goal in the third 
period helped the Canucks win at home.

KINGS' WINLESS STREAK REACHES EIGHT AS THE FLAMES ROLL, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winless streak gets a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose's hair gets a little grayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky's patience gets a little shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances for a playoff berth get a little slimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings lost to the Calgary Flames on Saturday night, 4-2, before a sellout 
Saddledome crowd of 20,230 to extend their streak without a victory to eight 
games spread over a nightmarish two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blown leads, missed shots, dumb penalties -- you name it, the Kings have been 
guilty of it in going 0-6-2 to drop their record to 21-33-8, five points behind 
the San Jose Sharks and three behind the Mighty Ducks in the battle for the 
eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Kings have 22 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to start playing like the team that we were last year," wing Luc 
Robitaille said. "We are that team." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the uniforms are the same, but there is little else that resembles the 
club that made it to the Stanley Cup Finals a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, the Kings got 53 shots, including 18 in the first period, 
against the Edmonton Oilers and had to settle for a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the Kings didn't get 18 shots in the entire game. They wound 
up being outshot, 48-16, including 20-3 in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kings were still in the game in the final period against the Pacific 
Division-leading Flames, who improved to 32-22-10. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a couple of King shots hadn't hit the cross-bar, the game might have 
turned out differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The first cross-bar clanger was by Robitaille in the second period after the 
Kings escaped the first 20 minutes tied at 1-1 despite being outshot, 18-6. 
</P>
<P>
 German Titov's 22nd goal was matched by Gretzky's 32nd, and the 797th of his 
career, leaving him four short of Gordie Howe's career record. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second Gretzky goal in as many nights on what should be a glorious 
run to the last significant offensive mark held by anyone other than No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gretzky is finding it increasingly difficult to enjoy his personal triumph 
while team experiences failure after failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoren Fleury's 26th goal and Al MacInnis' 22nd moved the Flames to a 3-1 
lead in a second period totally dominated by Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 But King wing John Druce made it a one-goal game 8:39 into the final period 
when he batted Robert Lang's pass out of the air into the net for his sixth 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Druce had a chance to tie the score late in the period, but his shot also 
found the cross-bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating to the other end, Kelly Kisio found himself open for the potential 
winning goal. Given no choice, Druce hooked Kisio, drawing a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the power play, the Flames got their clincher, Robert Reichel scoring 
his 32nd goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kings' hope for a postseason spot gets a little weaker. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Star defenseman Mark Tinordi suffered a broken leg last week when he 
skated into the boards a stride ahead of the Kings' John Druce. Although it 
appeared Tinordi lost the footing on his left skate, Druce was given a boarding 
penalty. League Vice-President Brian Burke subsequently gave Druce a call, 
asking if Druce had meant to harm Tinordi. No way, Druce replied. Burke told 
Druce that he would have been suspended if he hadn't given that answer. "I 
wouldn't want to have that happen to anybody," Druce said Saturday of Tinordi's 
injury, "my team, the other team, anybody." . . . King defenseman Charlie Huddy 
suffered an ankle bruise Saturday when hit by a puck. The ankle will be X-rayed 
today.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE STORM

 Here are some more gems from Henry Beard's "Mulligan's Laws," purportedly 
promulgated by the man who invented golf's do-over shot: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's often necessary to hit a second drive to really appreciate the first 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your straightest iron shot of the day will be exactly one club short. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you really want to get better at golf, go back and take it up at a much 
earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's as easy to lower your handicap as it is to lower your hat size. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Golfers who claim they never cheat also lie. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The only way to find a ball sliced deep into the woods is to hit a 
provisional, 260 yards down the middle of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas about 
the golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No matter how badly you're playing, it's always possible to play worse. 
</P>

 Last call: In his book, "Calling The Shots, My Five Decades in the NBA," Earl 
Strom recalls Pat Kennedy, a colorful referee in the early days of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days," writes Strom in collaboration with Blaine Johnson, "games 
were absolute rodeos, impossible to control. But Kennedy was so outlandish, he 
stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time, though, when Kennedy was left speechless. Lester Harrison 
was coach and owner of the Rochester Royals. A Royal hit a jumper and was 
fouled. As Kennedy blew his whistle, he was bumped, breaking off a piece of the 
whistle. It got stuck in Kennedy's throat and he collapsed on the floor, 
fighting for air. Lester ran out onto the court, got down on his hands and 
knees right over the stricken Kennedy and said, 'Pat, Pat, before you die, tell 
'em the basket counted.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Add Strom: Now 66, Strom, one of the best and most colorful referees, recently 
underwent four hours of surgery for a malignant brain tumor, and is taking 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled through the surgery probably better than anyone his age could've 
hoped to come through it," said his wife, Yvonne. 
</P>
<P>
 Along for the ride: Carlos Leon, who presses shirts for a North Miami dry 
cleaners, needed to get off work, so he said he had a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The "appointment" was to ride a horse at Gulfstream Park last Monday. He 
climbed aboard 25-1 shot Stormy Lord and won the race -- his first victory as a 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started learning to ride last year," the 30-year-old Peruvian said. 
"It's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time rider can't carry a whip, but Stormy Lord won by 1 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Was his boss angry? "No, I think it's fantastic," the boss replied.

 In his two previous races, Stormy Lord had lost by a combined 40 lengths.

FORMER CHAMPION WALCOTT DIES; BOXING: HE LOST SIX TIMES IN BIDS FOR THE 
HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE, BUT WAS ITS OLDEST WINNER AT 37. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody lost more heavyweight championship fights than Arnold Cream, better 
known as Jersey Joe Walcott, and nobody was older when he finally won the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott, who died Friday night at 80, lost six times for the title. Two of 
them were memorable bouts with Joe Louis, the first of which many thought 
Walcott won. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the finest technicians in heavyweight boxing history," said 
Eddie Futch, who trained Louis. "He was a credit to the game and a good man 
after he retired. I was always happy to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Arnold Raymond Cream in Merchantville, N.J., on Jan. 31, 1914, Walcott 
was a little more than 37 years, six months old when his time finally came. On 
July 7, 1951, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, he knocked out Ezzard Charles with 
a left hook in the seventh round to become champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott had lost a 15-round decision to Charles four months earlier, and 
reporters called the rematch the "Why Fight?" Why was Walcott getting a title 
shot after having failed four times to win the crown? 
</P>
<P>
 He beat Charles again before losing the title on Sept. 23, 1952, to Rocky 
Marciano. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thought Walcott won his first fight with Louis. On Dec. 5, 1947, at New 
York's Madison Square Garden, Walcott knocked Louis down in the first and 
fourth rounds, but Louis kept the title on a 15-round split decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgusted, Louis started to leave the ring before the decision was announced. 
"He really thought he had lost that fight," Futch recalled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott knocked Louis down in the rematch on June 25, 1948, at Yankee Stadium, 
but Louis knocked him out in the 11th round, then retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott lost 15-round decisions to Charles at Chicago in 1949 and Detroit in 
1951 before the Pittsburgh knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a rematch with Charles on June 5, 1952, then defended against the 
unbeaten Marciano at Municipal Stadium in Philadelphia. Walcott knocked down 
Marciano in the first round and led on points after 12 before being knocked out 
in the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano knocked Walcott out in the first round in the rematch, May 15, 1953, 
at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott retired with 50-18-1 record and 30 knockouts in a career that began in 
1930. He was elected to The Ring Hall of Fame in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great fighter," said Angelo Dundee, who trained Muhammad Ali, among 
others. "You have to remember, he fought at a time when you fought only the 
best. He knocked out a lot of great fighters." 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott also was a referee. His most famous assignment was the fight in 
Lewiston, Me., in 1965, when Ali, then Cassius Clay, won for the second time 
against Sonny Liston. Liston went down in the first round and was counted out 
by the timekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused, Walcott let the fight continue. But Nat Fleischer, founder of Ring 
Magazine, shouted to him and he stopped the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Walcott also served as chairman of the New Jersey State Boxing Commission, 
retiring in 1984.

 Little, who hadn't fought in more than a year, upset the plans for a 
Nunn-Nigel Benn unification bout this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Benn followed the script, retaining his World Boxing Council title with a 
unanimous decision over Henry Wharton. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by the challenger's aggressiveness early on, Nunn wore down his 
opponent in the middle rounds, but Little found a late second wind that secured 
him the points in a split decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trained to pressure him," Little said. "I put the pressure on and 
worked the hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges scored it 115-112, 116-114, 113-115, in Little's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Little has only five knockouts on the way to a 22-12-2 record. Nunn is 42-2 
with 27 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Benn is 38-2-1 with 32 knockouts. Wharton is 17-1-1 with 12 knockouts.

GOLF / PGA AT SAN DIEGO; LOWERY SHOOTS 66 TO MOVE INTO LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Lowery, an unfamiliar face in an unfamiliar place, shot a 66 Saturday to 
take a one-shot lead after the third round of the Buick Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before has he been the leader going to the final round of a PGA Tour 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to make birdies," he said. "These guys aren't going to back 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lowery, a 33-year-old journeyman from Alabama, has plenty of company. 
Three shots separated second-round leader David Toms from second place Friday, 
but those same three shots blanketed 10 players after Saturday's round. Toms 
had an even-par 72 and slipped into a four-way tie for second with Craig 
Stadler, Ronnie Black and Kirk Triplett. 
</P>
<P>
 Also within three shots of Lowery, who stands at 15-under 201, are Hal Sutton 
and Lennie Clements at 203 and Payne Stewart, Bob Estes and Mark Wurtz at 204. 
</P>
<P>
 These contenders figure to be a hungry bunch, at least when it comes to 
tasting victories. Six of the 10 -- Lowery, Toms, Triplett, Clements, Estes and 
Wurtz -- have never won a tour event. Stadler is a local who has never won at 
home. Black has not won in 10 years. Sutton has not won since 1986. Even 
Stewart has had a bit of a dry spell, winless since the 1991 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 For Toms, the 27-year-old from Louisiana, the day started like he was going to 
have this tournament in his bag by sunset. He made a 35-foot putt to birdie the 
first hole and a 15-foot putt to birdie the second. He was at 16 under and no 
one was an imminent threat. Lowery, playing two groups ahead, also birdied the 
first two holes, but that got him only to 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began to come undone for Toms on the third hole, when he had a 
three-putt for a bogey. He was haunted by three-putts before he was finished, 
four of them, all for bogeys, his first of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets you wondering whether you have to hit it dead-center to get it into 
the hole," he said. "I had three of them lip all the way around the hole and 
come back looking right at me. Tomorrow, the course owes me. They have to lip 
in rather than lip out." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lowery, Stadler and Black were stalking him. Both Stadler and Black 
had shares of the lead during the back nine, but Stadler rode a rollercoaster 
ride out of the lead and Black lost his share with a bogey on the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery was 14-under as he went to the 13th green and, behind him, Toms was 
bogeying the 10th and Stadler the 12th. Lowery's second shot on the par-five 
13th skipped over a bunker and rolled onto the green toward the pin. The crowd 
gasped, but it stopped three feet short. He missed the eagle putt, but he had 
caught Toms for a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glancing at the leaderboard," he admitted, "because my goal was to be 
leading when I finished today." 
</P>
<P>
 Another birdie on the 15th hole got him to 16 under, but he missed the green 
from the rough next to the par-three 16th hole and settled for a bogey. He 
finished at 15 under and left it for the last two groups to shoot at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Toms nor Black could get the birdie they needed on 18 to tie. Stadler 
and Triplett birdied the 18th, but those birdies got them to 14-under. Stadler 
had been firing and falling back for the last nine holes, carding three 
birdies, three bogeys and three pars. 
</P>
<P>
 "My round was fun at the start," Stadler said, "but boring at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Black was perplexed by his 69, which followed rounds of 65 and 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played better today than the first two days," he said, "and had my worst 
score." 
</P>
<P>
 He would have equaled Friday's 68, and tied for the lead, but for a succession 
of difficulties on the 17th. His tee shot found the right rough and his second 
shot carried wide into a downhill lie in deeper rough. He chopped at the ball 
and barely made the green, leaving him with a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, having accomplished his goal of leading after Saturday's round, 
obviously has a new goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll be all keyed up," he said, "dealing with nerves, the situation, 
the golf course. I'll deal with it. Heck, I'd be nervous trying to win a club 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot of company in the same situation with the same feelings.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; THE CLIPPERS: A TEAM ONLY AN OWNER COULD RUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only one question remains in Clipperdom: 
</P>
<P>
 Who has the movie rights to this season? 
</P>
<P>
 We'll call it "Buffalo Chips," the saga of a brave organization's battle to 
win while retaining its amateur standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is the NBA, where everyone is allowed and, indeed, aspires to 
be professional, so you can see what a challenge our heroes face. 
</P>
<P>
 How about the last 10 days? 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper pops off. They suspend him. Danny Manning wears a sweatband with 
Harper's No. 4 around his ankle. Manning plays his last Clipper game while 
Donald T. Sterling, Elgin Baylor and Andy Roeser sit in the front row, going 
over Elgin's notes on trade proposals during the game while the P.A. system 
plays appropriate tunes like "Free, Free, Set Me Free" and "Already Gone." 
Someone retains a sense of humor, a handy thing among the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning is then traded for Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Clippers acted happy. First they pretended they could sign 
Manning, now they're pretending it doesn't matter. Since they've just exchanged 
a 27-year-old for a 34-year-old who can become a free agent, too, it can't be 
counted as a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, the Clippers can sign Wilkins. At his age and salary -- $4 million 
-- there won't be many bidders for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they'll have to pay through the nose for his 35th, 36th and 37th 
years, but that's the direction they decided to go. I'd have taken one of the 
offers with young players and No. 1 draft choices, since the present cast isn't 
close to competing for a championship. Morale suffers in the absence of hope, a 
lesson the Clippers might have learned this season but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not quibble about small things. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're ever to rise above the joke stage, the organization must create a 
new atmosphere to replace the current one as the NBA's Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggestions for Sterling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sell the team. This is Clipper fans' real fantasy but a non-starter. 
Sterling claims never to have sold anything in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Move it to Anaheim. Amazing as it is, someone still wants the Clippers. 
Actual attendance would do a lot to cheer the players up, rather than the 
present practice of padding the count by 1,500 to 2,000 a game. This won't 
happen soon since Donald features himself an L.A. kind of guy, but it's still 
the way to bet after the Clippers are forced to acknowledge that the window of 
opportunity has closed on their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Professionalize it. See if this sounds familiar: Put your trust in your 
people or hire new people you can trust; establish a hierarchy; withdraw from 
operational involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never suspect an organization that functions so poorly could be made 
up of so many capable, people. Baylor, the general manager, is a good 
basketball man. Roeser, the head of the business side, is a bright guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The roster of former Clipper executives reads like a who's who of sports 
administration: Alan Rothenberg, the well-connected lawyer who now runs U.S. 
soccer; Arn Tellem, now a heavyweight agent whose client list includes Bo 
Jackson; the widely respected Carl Scheer, and Harley Frankel, who worked on 
Bill Clinton's transition team. As Clippers, they were reduced to voices 
competing for attention in the asylum choir, victims of the owner's genius for 
avoiding any tough choice until he has to convene an 11th-hour ad hoc 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Clipper front-office people you feel for. The players are well 
compensated. The fans can change channels. Clipper employees smash their heads 
against the walls of their Little Shop of Horrors every day in the belief it 
can make a difference. They're up to 12 years (two cities, three GMs, eight 
coaches, 10 50-loss seasons) under Sterling and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Donald protests he's a good businessman and this morass doesn't reflect on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of evidence supports the first claim -- he made a fortune from 
scratch so he must have done something right -- but not the second. He's the 
franchise's one constant in 12 farcical years. 
</P>
<P>
 In business, his tenacity served him well, but in basketball, it kept him from 
learning from his mistakes. He won't even acknowledge he's in charge. He's 
merely the kindly paterfamilias, forever forgiving his bungling charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers rose by sheer weight of lottery picks and lost them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Moses, Manning led them through the desert but wasn't allowed to enter 
the Promised Land. 
</P>
<P>
 He left them as he found them. 
</P>
<P>
 In last place. THE SHEARER AND THE SHORN 
</P>
<P>
 Manning for Wilkins:  
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers held a fire sale. The customers jammed the doorways and climbed 
all over themselves trying to get in on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks aren't out of the woods. They have to sign Manning, and despite his 
good manners, they've never been on his short list. Short-term, this figures to 
disrupt their miracle season because teams need time to adjust to major 
changes. Manning and Kevin Willis are both low-post players who will have to 
learn to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Hawks were in a bind, too. They didn't want to spend $5 million a 
season to tie their young roster to the aging Wilkins. Now they can pursue 
Manning with an edge -- they alone can offer big money up front. 
</P>
<P>
 If they lose him, they will have his $3.25-million slot to pursue Horace Grant 
et al., and can get on with their rebuilding program. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando, still believed to be Manning's preferred option, can open a 
$1.6-million salary slot this summer, enabling the Magic to offer a 
$21-million, seven-year contract with a one-year termination clause, then 
re-sign him next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's friends say privately what they've said publicly: He will make his 
decision on where he wants to be and would take the short money for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Jeff Malone and a No. 1 pick to the 76ers for Jeff Hornacek.  
</P>
<P>
 How is Chicago's Jerry Krause going to explain this one? 
</P>
<P>
 Bull players ripped him for not upgrading Michael Jordan's old No. 2 guard 
position. Now the Jazz beats him to Hornacek, a fine player who can also play 
the point, giving up only sagging Malone and a draft choice, now projected as 
No. 20 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone was unhappy, on the outs with Coach Jerry Sloan and had so irritated 
Karl Malone, the Mailman vowed privately never to play another game with him. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to hand it to the Jazz. They make a mint, they talk poor-mouth, and 
every time the posse closes in, they think of something. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls' Stacey King to Minnesota for Luc Longley.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Krause wasn't idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago reporters will miss King, who popped off as if he were a real player, 
when he wasn't threatening to set records for having two-foot set shots 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentle Luc will look impressive in layup lines alongside another 7-foot 
non-contributor, Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks' Frank Brickowski to Charlotte for Mike Gminski and a future No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dunleavy gets rid of the mercenary free-agent-to-be Brickowski for a pick 
and takes Gminski, whom he'll cut when his contract runs out at the end of the 
season, leaving a $2-million salary slot. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is the Hornets' big move to get a power forward, let's just say 
Brick's no Horace Grant. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 The Brat Pack rides again: Christian Laettner cursed Timberwolves assistant 
Bob Weinhauer last week, upset that Weinhauer had told Marlon Maxey he had 
messed up a play. Laettner has cursed at two Minnesota assistants, two referees 
and has been suspended twice. . . . Said Weinhauer: "This is very disappointing 
but not surprising. What this does is show he has no respect for anybody." . . 
. Said Timberwolves General Manager Jack McCloskey: "(Laettner) is definitely 
not easy. I knew it wasn't going to be easy but I didn't think it would be this 
hard." . . . This year's No. 1 pick, Isaiah Rider, has missed four practices -- 
two excused, one unexcused, one to shoot a commercial -- which Coach Sidney 
Lowe forgave. Rider has been told he will be suspended for the next one. . . . 
Pals again: The Nets signed power forward Derrick Coleman to a $30-million, 
four-year deal making him the NBA's highest paid player ($7.5 million to Larry 
Johnson's $7.4 million). The cost is high and the player is prickly, but after 
losing Mookie Blaylock, Chris Dudley and Terry Mills in budget crunches, the 
Nets finally wised up. . . . Oops: The report that the Lakers offered Elden 
Campbell, a No. 1 pick and either Doug Christie or Anthony Peeler for Coleman 
was groundless. It's impossible under salary-cap rules.

NBA ROUNDUP; MANNING PLAYS, AS FERRELL LEAD HAWKS PAST 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Danny Manning era started on a positive note Saturday night, with him 
sitting on the bench in Philadelphia, watching the man who replaced Dominique 
Wilkins, Duane Ferrell, score 21 points to lead the Atlanta Hawks in a 118-102 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs Manning? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Hawks believed they did, enough so that they traded Wilkins, their 
franchise player, to the Clippers for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy and excited to be here and want to make as big a contribution as I 
can," Manning said. "This team really moves the ball and if you're open, you 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was open enough to get nine shots, hitting five for 10 points in 25 minutes 
as a reserve to help send the 76ers to their ninth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had too many turnovers because I think I was trying to rush too much, but I 
think I'm going to like playing here," said Manning, who also had six assists 
and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrell led eight Atlanta scorers in double figures in his second game of 
holding the fort until Manning is ready to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone, obtained by the 76ers from Utah for Jeff Hornacek and Sean Green, 
had 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some basic things that I've been doing for years," said Malone, a 
10-year veteran. "Spoon (Clarence Weatherspoon) and I ran some two-man games 
and I was getting my jump shot. It turned out pretty good for me, but we still 
have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 95, Houston 85 -- Karl Malone recovered from a slow start to score 28 
points in Houston, leading the Jazz to their fifth consecutive triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets led, 76-75, with 8:43 left, but John Stockton's basket started an 
11-1 run that put Utah ahead, 86-77. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek, obtained in the Jeff Malone trade with Philadelphia, scored 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 96, Chicago 86 -- Reggie Miller scored 12 of his 21 points in the 
third quarter when the Pacers built a 17-point lead at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the third in five home games for the Bulls following a 17-game 
winning streak at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rik Smits scored seven of his 19 points in a 14-4 run that sealed the 
victory for the Pacers, who have won 12 of their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 110, Dallas 99 -- Tyrone Hill matched his career high with 24 points 
and grabbed 12 rebounds as Cleveland overcame an early 16-point deficit at 
Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers, who played without injured starters Brad Daugherty and Larry 
Nance, extended their winning streak to a season-high six games. 
</P>
<P>
 But they lost reserve guard John Battle because of a dislocated elbow in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 105, Detroit 100 -- Steve Smith and Grant Long led a balanced attack 
with 18 points apiece as the Heat rallied from a 14-point third-quarter deficit 
at Auburn Hills, Mich., to win their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Shaw had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Rony Seikaly 13 points and 15 
rebounds for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 115, Washington 100 -- Vin Baker and Blue Edwards each scored 21 
points at Milwaukee as the Bucks snapped a three-game losing streak by beating 
the Bullets, who lost for the sixth time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Don MacLean led Washington with 30 points and Tom Gugliotta had 22 points and 
14 rebounds. Rookie guard Mitchell Butler scored a career-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 104, San Antonio 96 -- Clyde Drexler, in a horrible shooting slump 
most of the season, sank five three-pointers and scored 32 points for the Trail 
Blazers at Portand.

 The dominant bobsledders of the last decade -- Gustav Weder of Switzerland I 
and Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany I -- were applying the heat as Harald Czudaj of 
Germany II took a slim lead into today's final two heats of the four-man 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place Weder, 32, has already won the gold in two-man and won the 
gold in two-man and a bronze in four-man in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-place Hoppe, 36, won silver in four-man in 1992, silver in both 
four-man and two-man in 1988, and gold in both four-man and two-man in 1984.

 He has also won seven world bobsled titles, and still competes in motocross, a

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't all that warm a homecoming for Damon Stoudamire, so he decided to 
answer rudeness with rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire, who played high school ball up the road in Portland, was booed 
every time he touched the ball in the first half at Eugene, Ore., then made the 
go-ahead basket with 45 seconds to play in ninth-ranked Arizona's 75-71 victory 
Saturday over Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Reeves hit two free throws with nine seconds to play to clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire broke a 71-71 tie with 53 seconds to play, driving the length of 
the court and hitting a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to run a play, but it was my option to take it all the way," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had led all scorers with 13 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the crowd got loud, the coach (Lute Olson) would call the play for 
me," Stoudamire said. "He did it a couple of times, and I was able to hit the 
shots when we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire finished with 21 points. Reeves had 25, including seven of 
Arizona's last 11. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth consecutive victory for the Wildcats (23-4, 12-3). Oregon 
fell to 9-14, 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona St. 80, Oregon St. 60 -- Stevin Smith had 22 points and Mario Bennett 
scored 19 to lead the Sun Devils at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (13-11, 8-7) never trailed, but there were six ties early before 
Bennett hit a free throw and two rebound baskets to start a 10-0 run to a 27-17 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-place Beavers dropped to 6-17, 2-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Anderson led Oregon State with 20 points, 17 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington St. 75, Washington 51 -- Fred Ferguson scored 17 points and 
freshman Nathan Erdmann added a career-high 16 in his first start to lead the 
Cougars at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hill and Mark Hendrickson added 10 apiece as Washington State (17-9, 
7-7) gave Coach Kelvin Sampson his 100th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Woods had 18 points to lead Washington (5-18, 3-11).

 New Mexico State, which began the week ranked 25th in the nation, suffered its

 Irvine (7-17 overall, 4-12 Big West) led by as many as 14 points in the second

1/2 minutes to hold off the Aggies (19-5, 11-4). JOHN WEYLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State couldn't stop Glenn Robinson when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, who can? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, the nation's leading scorer, had 14 of Purdue's final 17 points and 
finished with 30 to lead the 14th-ranked Boilermakers to a 71-66 victory 
Saturday at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first half a couple of my shots weren't falling, but as they got closer 
they just started to fall," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (23-4, 11-4 Big Ten) saw its 16-point halftime lead cut to one before 
Robinson took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it was our fault because we always go out there and . . . think 
we're going to run over them, especially at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahsaan Carlton scored 23 points for Penn State (11-12, 4-10). 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions cut Purdue's lead to 56-55 on a three-pointer by Carlton and 
two free throws by John Amaechi with 5:47 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Robinson scored nine points in a row for Purdue to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 91, Auburn 81 -- Corey Beck and Clint McDaniel each made two 
free throws down the stretch at Fayetteville, Ark., in the Razorbacks' 10th 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (22-2, 12-2 Southeastern Conference) led by as many as 15 points 
early in the second half, but Lance Weems' three-pointer cut it to 83-77 with 
2:19 to play. The Tigers (10-14, 3-11) had a chance to get closer, but Wesley 
Person missed a baseline jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, coupled with Florida's loss to Vanderbilt, put Arkansas on top of 
the SEC race. Auburn had won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 North Carolina 78, Florida St. 75 -- For the second time in a week, the 
Seminoles tried a four-guard lineup against North Carolina, and the Tar Heels 
responded with their frontcourt making all 23 of their baskets at Chapel Hill, 
including Rasheed Wallace's 15-footer with 1:23 to play that helped secure the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (23-5, 10-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) trailed the Seminoles 
(12-13, 5-10) the entire first half, then started the second with a 16-5 run to 
a nine point lead. The Tar Heels shot 78.3% in the second half, with Eric 
Montross scoring 18 points on seven-for-seven shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Connecticut 78, Pittsburgh 66 -- Donyell Marshall, Donny Marshall and

14-2) won their first outright regular-season championship in the Big East.

 Eric Mobley scored 21 point to lead Pittsburgh (13-12, 7-10), which dropped 
its seventh in a row for the first time since 1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Missouri 99, Oklahoma 83 -- Reserve Mark Atkins tied his school record 
with seven three-pointers as the Tigers clinched the Big Eight title at Norman, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri (22-2, 12-0) won its ninth Big Eight championship under Coach Norm 
Stewart and needs victories over Kansas State and Nebraska for the third 
unbeaten season in conference history. Kansas was the last to do it, in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri has won 12 in a row and 21 of its last 22. Oklahoma (14-10, 5-7) has 
lost three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Kansas 106, Colorado 62 -- Richard Scott returned to his pre-injury 
form with 18 points and the Jayhawks set a school record with 72 rebounds at 
Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado (10-14, 2-10) had only 29 rebounds in losing the 78th of its last 79 
regular-season road games in the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who injured his shoulder Jan. 24, helped key first-half runs that put 
the Jayhawks (22-6, 7-5) in command. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Louisville 85, Notre Dame 82 -- Freshman DeJuan Wheat hit four 
consecutive free throws in the final 25 seconds of regulation, then came up

Bend, Ind.

 The Irish (10-17) led, 82-78, on two free throws by Ryan Hoover with 1:15 left 
in overtime. Greg Minor pulled Louisville (22-4) within one point on a 
three-pointer, then Wheat stole the ball and passed to Tick Rogers for a 
fast-break layup with 23 seconds to go.

 Vanderbilt 82, No. 16 Florida 78 -- Billy McCaffrey scored 31 points, 
including two free throws with nine seconds left, for the Commodores at 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Seckar hit a free throw with 11.7 seconds left to put Vanderbilt (14-10, 
7-7 Southeastern) ahead, 80-78. He missed his second attempt, but Vanderbilt 
got the rebound and McCaffrey made the game-clinching free throws.

 Dan Cross scored 21 points for Florida (22-5, 11-3).

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; UCLA LOSES WILLIAMS AND GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA's women's basketball team lost a winning streak and one of the nation's 
best basketball players Saturday night when Stanford beat the Bruins, 94-82, 
before 7,005 at Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Williams suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury with 5:21 
left in the first half and spent the rest of the game on the bench, her right 
knee bagged in ice.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled the Cardinal, which has won seven in a row and 10 of its 
last 11, to keep pace with Pacific 10 Conference leader USC, which beat 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have three games left and lead the Pac-10 at 13-2. Stanford, with 
four left, is 11-3. UCLA, with three left, dropped to 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a senior All-American, fell and landed awkwardly after a rebound 
attempt and was helped off the court. Ted Nichols, an orthopedic surgeon who is 
Stanford's team doctor, said the injury showed signs of being a damaged 
anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier said UCLA doctors would examine Williams' knee today. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The injury was a blow to both Williams and her team. The 6-foot-1 center was 
coming off a 43-point, 15-rebound night at Berkeley Thursday night, where UCLA 
defeated Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she was helped off the court Saturday, she had scored only two points 
and had two rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Stanford led, 37-24. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bruins regrouped in the minutes after Williams' departure, Stanford 
went on a 10-2 run, and took a 47-32 halftime lead.  
</P>

 The Cardinal seemed to be off to another rout when Christy Hedgpeth's 
back-to-back three-point baskets extended Stanford's lead in the second half to

Jalewalia, who scored 23, took charge.

ACTION, NOT ANGER, WILL KEEP BUSINESS IN L.A.; VENTURA COUNTY EFFORT REFLECTS 
NEED TO LOOK AT BIG PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could be viewed as a common-sense approach to Southern 
California's continuing economic woes or as scavenger-like opportunism at its 
worst, Ventura County officials have set up a coalition to attract 
quake-ravaged businesses from the San Fernando Valley. The coalition plans to 
spend $30,000 to promote and assist the effort, running ads in Valley 
newspapers and on Valley radio stations. It will also offer a toll-free 
telephone line, a fast-track permit process and other relocation assistance to 
Los Angeles businesses mulling temporary or permanent relocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed Partners in Action coalition insists that its goals are to be 
a good neighbor and to keep in Southern California those businesses that might 
be considering an out-of-state or out-of-region move. "This is not aimed at 
stealing businesses," said coalition spokesperson Dana Weber Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley boosters are outraged, saying that efforts to lure firms and merchants 
to cross the county line could destroy the Valley's economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are my neighbors, God forbid what my enemies might do," said Ben 
Reznik, chairman of the Earthquake Recovery Task Force for the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. "They're thinking very selfishly. If they were thinking 
about the region, they wouldn't be doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The anger of Reznik and others is understandable, but Los Angeles and Valley 
officials had better get used to the new competitive climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the argument is weakened considerably when one considers that the new 
leader of VICA, the Valley's premier business group, expects to move half of 
his manufacturing firm out of the state this year. "I'm not willing to 
jeopardize my business to stay in California," said Walter W. Mosher Jr., VICA 
chairman and president of Precision Dynamics Corp., located in the city of San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision apparently has less to do with the quake and more to do with the 
workers' compensation problems and government regulations that Mosher says are 
steadily driving manufacturers out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that localities and the state have to respond in 
kind in what has become an increasingly competitive environment. In that 
regard, perhaps the following rules of thumb should apply. If a business can't 
be persuaded to remain in Los Angeles, it would be best if it could be 
persuaded to stay somewhere within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of that, a move somewhere within the regional economy would be the 
next-best thing. And it would be far better if that business stayed somewhere 
in California rather than crossing state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 On a local level, Santa Clarita has taken a series of steps, shifting from 
what was already an aggressive campaign to attract new employers to the 
short-term, post-quake goal of simply keeping what it already has. 
</P>
<P>
 It is doing so by waiving permit and inspection fees for quake reconstruction 
or repair projects and by keeping those businesses apprised of disaster-relief 
programs. Santa Clarita has also applied for state grants to set up an 
assistance center for businesses with long-term problems resulting from the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 There also needs to be more of the kind of effort put forth by the city of 
Palmdale. It produced a major local campaign to keep Packard Bell Electronics 
Inc. in the area when the computer firm was being wooed by Salt Lake City and 
Portland, Ore. Los Angeles quickly fell out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not going to be enough to claim that other jurisdictions are unfairly 
trying to capitalize on the Northridge quake or hope that businesses look at 
something other than their bottom line when out-of-state cities come calling. 
Palmdale and Santa Clarita are setting the right example.

 * I have been reading articles on the so-called "help" that mortgage companies 
are extending. I know it is not nice to bite the hand that is feeding you, but 
who is feeding whom? 
</P>
<P>
 Our mortgage company has been so nice as to give us a three-month forbearance. 
Then, in the fourth month, they want double payments! It is obvious that they 
haven't a clue to what is going on here. Our out-of-state mortgage company 
supposedly hasn't sent a representative to California to even get a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it break mortgage companies to make 30-years-and-three-month mortgages? 
Would they not make a couple extra bucks in interest? Are only the out-of-state 
mortgage companies the ones with these grand ideas to help earthquake victims? 
Should we clue them in that it only took 15 seconds to wreak havoc on more than 
half a million people and that will take years before we fully recover? 
</P>
<P>
 We know where to go for disaster relief for food, clothing and shelter, but 
what about the havoc our mortgage companies are adding?

 * I'm very happy that the Federal Emergency Management Agency hired an 
additional 700 inspectors. This was done to accommodate the more than 300,000 
calls for assistance in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 They were flown in from all over the country for a 10-hour seminar in San 
Mateo on Feb. 5 and given $5,000 worth of computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the computer communications for receiving caseloads were entirely 
inadequate for transmitting the information needed to support the inspector. In 
fact, some of these instruments did not even have the software needed to 
receive the caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
 While I appreciate the fact that the government has acted as quickly as it 
has, it would appear to me that after the many disasters that have besieged the 
country, the bugs should have been worked out of the system.  
</P>
<P>
 As I understand it, the programs on the computers work fine for floods and 
hurricanes but not earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a disaster situation, it would be better to service the people first and 
worry about the computer program later. Paper forms may take longer, up to 33% 
according to the article, but they still work -- and more efficiently than a 
computer that doesn't work at all.

SOLVING A DILEMMA OF A DIFFERENT STRIPE; MAKING SKUNKS TURN TAIL AND RUN MAY BE 
EASIER THAN YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem with city dwellers confronted with trespassing wildlife, humane 
society experts say, is that people are unable to think like the animal they 
are trying to control. That might be the case in a Studio City neighborhood, 
where folks are enduring an invasion of skunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how can these meek little critters stroll past watchdogs and through the 
pet door at the back entrance in search of Alpo or Fancy Feast? Well, imagine 
yourself in some crime-ridden neighborhood, and everyone there knows you have a 
natural supply of the most heinously potent pepper spray known to humankind. 
Better yet, you can spray it accurately to a distance of six feet. Well, who's 
gonna mess with you ? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's that kind of confidence that has led the skunks on bold nocturnal 
excursions into homes on Laurel Terrace and Viewcrest Road. Well, perhaps it's 
that and the fact that the only things attracted by skunk spray are, well, 
other skunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the skunk wars have taken on extreme proportions. Those insistent 
on keeping pet doors have gone as far as installing doors that only open when 
they receive an electronic signal from the pet's fancy collar. That apparently 
worked fine for one Southern California couple, until an odd glitch in the 
electronics meant that the feline in question was inadvertently setting off the 
garage door opener as well as the burglar alarm several times a night. And -- 
you guessed it -- the skunks got in through the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 There are cheaper and more effective methods. Skunks don't like the smell of 
mothballs. Spread several of them around outside the house and your problem 
might be solved. If that doesn't work, the same ammonia that chases you out of 
the house on cleaning day will do the same for the skunks. A few soaked rags, 
strategically placed, ought to do the trick. Perhaps the skunk problem is just 
a matter of common "scents."

COMMENTS BY SYBERT SEEM HYPOCRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After his Feb. 15 announcement that he is running for the 24th Congressional 
District seat, candidate Richard Sybert went right on the attack, saying, "Tony 
Beilenson is a Westside liberal -- he's not from the Valley." He indicated that 
candidate Bob Hammer is not fit for congressional office because he has not 
voted in every election. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I certainly don't defend Mr. Beilenson's liberal voting pattern and 
elitist attitude. But excuse me, Mr. Sybert, if I find your criticism of 
Beilenson a bit hypocritical. Are you from the Valley? And how many times have 
you voted in the 24th District? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need this type of mudslinger in our nation's highest legislative 
body. We need someone who will focus on the issues. I suggest to all of you in 
the 24th District who agree that Rep. Beilenson is too liberal and too elitist: 
Look closely at Messrs. Benhard, Hammer and any others who show up.

GREED KEEPS CANYON OAKS PROPOSAL ALIVE

 * The opinion piece by Alexander Cockburn ("Speculation vs. Democracy in

16 years.A grandiose real estate scheme would destroy the headwaters of Topanga

 This project does not fit any of the 10 goals of the area plan and is opposed 
by the vast majority of our canyon residents. 
</P>

 It is unfathomable to me that such an urban-style development could even be 
considered for this rural and mountainous terrain. It is greed that keeps this

MONORAIL IS BETTER THAN AT-GRADE TRAIN OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A Feb. 6 letter from one of your readers contains several glaring 
misstatements with regard to the proposed elevated line over the Ventura 
Freeway. The writer supports yet another alternative, an at-grade light-rail 
system through the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 State law and strong community opposition prohibit the construction and 
operation of an at-grade train through this corridor. The action by the state 
guarantees that residents of the East Valley will never have to suffer the 
inconvenience, safety hazards and destruction of an at-grade system. 
</P>
<P>
 The density of development along Ventura Boulevard supports the freeway 
alignment because of its proximity to entertainment centers, restaurants and 
business within a short distance of the proposed Ventura Freeway line. 
</P>
<P>
 The most environmentally safe, aesthetically pleasing alternative must be 
selected. Monorail provides passengers and the community with such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 As a dual-track transit way, the elevated line would be able to service the 
community with technology that has been proven around the world without a 
single passenger fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reader incorrectly states that monorails are used exclusively as 
transportation to airports or through amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Monorails are in revenue-generating service in over a dozen cities worldwide. 
In Orlando, Fla., a monorail system serves more than 150,000 passengers daily. 
In Japan, more than 211,000 passengers enjoy a quiet, comfortable ride every 
day without the squeal of steel-on-steel operation of the light-rail 
alternative.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; EFFORT TO SIPHON OFF DWP MONEY UNCAPS A WELL OF FEARS; MAYOR 
RIORDAN'S PROPOSAL COULD LEAVE EMPLOYEE PENSIONS SERIOUSLY UNDERFUNDED. SOME 
OBSERVERS THINK HIS REAL MOTIVE IS TO PRIVATIZE THE MUNICIPAL UTILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON FURGATCH, Leon Furgatch is a retired manager of community relations and 
educational services for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until the earthquake and the heroic efforts of Department of Water and Power 
employees to restore service to the prostrate city, it was difficult to find 
anyone who had a kind word for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP's fall from grace began last summer with the controversy over a new 
two-tier water rate structure that angered Valleyites in particular. This was 
quickly followed by a strike, a catering scandal and the rippling effect on 
other city employees, who requested me-too raises at a time when the city was 
gripped in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfortunate sequence of events has not only endangered the DWP employees' 
security in an indirect manner, it has placed the entire concept of municipal 
utility ownership in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 This was demonstrated in November by the ease with which Mayor Richard Riordan 
moved to alter the DWP's employee retirement plan to divert pension money to 
help fulfill a campaign promise to hire more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the DWP needed friends in high places, no one was willing to 
step forward to oppose the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the employees have been in a state of alarm because the majority 
are not covered by Social Security and the news media have been rife with 
stories about underfunded plans that leave employees with little or no pension 
when they retire. 
</P>
<P>
 The money the mayor seeks is in addition to the 5% gross revenues the DWP 
voluntarily transfers to the city every year as a substitute for taxes it would 
pay if it were a privately owned utility. This year it will contribute $122 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the pension money, the mayor has adopted the recommendation of Dennis 
Tito, an appointee to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners, to make two 
seemingly minor changes in the way the DWP contributes to its retirement plan. 
The city does not contribute tax money, as some people believe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan presently uses a conservative method of calculating its investment 
assets, based upon their purchase price. The stated asset value is used to 
determine the pension contributions; the higher the value, the less the DWP 
must contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito, who owns a pension consulting firm, wants the asset value to reflect 
current market value. Since many of these assets have appreciated from their 
original purchase price, their current value would be reflected in a larger 
pension fund, and the DWP could cut its contributions accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of this is that it would create a paper gain only, and it would 
place the plan at greater risk. Most of these assets are stocks and bonds, 
which are subject to wild swings on Wall Street. In a bear market, the reduced 
DWP contributions could leave the plan seriously underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito also wants to change the way the DWP sets aside pension money during the 
employee's entire career. His proposal would delay payments until the employee 
is closer to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two suggestions were adopted, the DWP's pension contribution would be 
reduced by an estimated $40 million a year. Instead of going back to 
ratepayers, the money would pay for police salaries and, ironically, their 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents the 
largest group of employees, is preparing to challenge the legality of such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial vote on this issue is expected this week. The mayor would seem to 
have the winning votes, since four of the seven DWP Retirement Board members 
are political appointees and subject to dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 If he succeeds, and assuming an adverse financial market in the future, the 
DWP will have to make up any monetary losses to keep the retirement plan 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, the crisis could occur long after the mayor leaves office, and there 
is no assurance that a future administration will raise rates to eliminate the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 What is troubling about this idea is that the DWP has earned a reputation for 
providing low-cost water and electricity since it was founded as a municipally 
owned utility in 1902. Its rates are still among the lowest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mayor has spoken repeatedly about introducing private-sector 
efficiencies into government to obtain more money without raising taxes, the 
reality is that he is attempting to take money from the till. 
</P>
<P>
 This is uncharacteristic for a person with his successful business background, 
and it raises a suspicion that his real intent is to weaken the city utility so 
it can be privatized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Be that as it may, and giving him the benefit of the doubt, there are now 
rumors that the mayor may drop the pension fight and look elsewhere for police 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that is frequently mentioned is his newfound respect for city 
employees, many of whom placed themselves at risk to rescue the city from the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumor may be wishful thinking on the part of the employees, but it has 
introduced a new element of suspense into the showdown meeting.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW; TACTICS THAT INSURERS EMPLOY IN

 An alert and intelligent 70-year-old man whom I've known for more than 30 
years has recently been having increasing difficulty with heart, liver and 
kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
 His unpredictable episodes of critical illness often precipitate a paramedic 
run to his home, followed by treatment in the emergency room and then the 
intensive care unit. Each episode brings him to the brink of death. So far, 
each time he has responded to treatment and been able to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday night he became confused, fell at home and injured his 
knee. He was brought to the emergency room, where he was found to be in 
multi-system failure. He had fluid in his lungs and abdominal cavity, kidney 
and heart failure and a host of other problems. He was hospitalized and 
treatment was started. Because it was Saturday night, the pre-admission report 
required by his insurance carrier could not be made. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, I was at the hospital seeing a patient when the insurance 
carrier's pre-admission review nurse called my office demanding to know the 
diagnosis, the treatment plan, the intravenous fluids by name and rate of flow, 
the medication by name and dose, the anticipated length of stay and the home 
care needs. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of interrogation goes beyond the need of an insurer to determine 
whether hospitalization should occur. It interferes with the doctor's ability 
to render care and breaches the patient's right to privacy. With the patient's 
written permission, any information necessary to the review process is readily 
available in the patient's chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrusion by health insurance carriers into the patient-doctor-hospital 
relationship has become onerous and counterproductive. I have no objection to 
review aimed at preventing fraud and overuse of expensive services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, prior authorization requirements, length of stay limitations and 
other prerequisites set by an insurance company can coerce physicians into 
giving less than optimal care and pressure them into discharging patients from 
the hospital too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the patient was treated in a timely and appropriate way, and 
after a few days in the hospital and a short stay in a skilled-nursing unit, he 
has returned to his wife and family. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived at my office later that morning, I attempted to return the 
pre-admission nurse's call. My office staff left messages on her voice mail. 
But our calls were never returned. A couple of days later, the patient received 
a letter threatening non-payment for the hospital stay because it had not been 
authorized by the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactics such as these should not diminish the treatment of patients by doctors 
and other care givers, but they do. They also influence how patients seek care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, this patient cannot afford his insurance deductible amount, which 
is large because of his high-risk medical status. So during the first part of 
the year -- when his deductible has not yet been met -- he waits until the last 
possible moment to schedule medical appointments. More timely visits could 
result in preventive treatment, which might avert some of his emergencies. 
Letters from his insurance company threatening not to pay for services unless 
pre-authorized add to his reluctance to call for help when it's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The above is just one example of how boldly the insurance carriers are 
manipulating medical care. In the name of cost control, they decide to which 
doctors and hospitals patients can go, which medicine they will pay for, how 
long a patient may stay in the hospital, how many visits to a specialist will 
be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are often delays and rejections regarding special patient needs and 
expensive tests or procedures. This results in a telephonic logjam and a paper 
blizzard that has forced many medical offices -- including my own -- to hire 
extra personnel just to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all this, there is no proof that insurance-company-managed care 
has actually saved money. Small wonder! As President Clinton pointed out, the 
administrative overhead of our present insurance-carrier-dominated health care 
system has risen to upward of 40% of the premium dollar. So where is the money 
going? Not for patient care! 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come to adopt a single-payer system that will eliminate the 
so-called health insurance carriers whose administrative superstructure, 
interference with the good practice of medicine and enormous overhead expenses 
are destroying what President and Mrs. Clinton acknowledge is the finest health 
care in the world. We don't need micromanagement; we need universal coverage.

YOUTHS COULD MAKE A FATAL MISTAKE IF THEY'RE DRESSED TO KILL; ADVICE FOR

 I support the Burbank public schools' efforts to impose a reasonable dress 
code on students by banning gang clothes. I know something about the subject, 
because when it comes to gangs, I've been there. 
</P>
<P>
 I was raised for part of my life in the housing projects of Mar Vista Gardens. 
If you weren't loosely affiliated with a gang, you had big trouble. I never 
went through a full-scale initiation and made the gang my whole life. But I 
went as far as I had to to get out of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice High School, I went through the whole series of gang symbols: 
khakis, Sir Guy shirts, spit-shined French toes, short hair combed straight 
back and, of course, tattoos. I'm not proud of it because that's not what I 
want for my children or grandchildren. But I guess I'm what they call a 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing the way I did got the attention of the wrong people, such as school 
disciplinarians. Our dress identified us. You received that attention whether 
you were a gangbanger or not, and I was! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a 10th-grader, some guys took a couple of shots at me and a friend 
when we were coming back from a party, dressed for the occasion. If we'd been 
dressed as anything but cholos, it probably would not have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago I saw a TV show on gangs and guns in schools that showed me 
that clothes still make the gangster. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience were all students, and the panel were all gang members. The topic 
was innocent kids being shot and killed. A boy in the audience stood to ask a 
question something like this: "Two friends and myself came out of church one 
Sunday. We were standing on the steps talking when a car pulled up with several 
guys in it. They pointed guns at us and yelled out their gang name, then drove 
away without shooting. Why would they do something like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's answer was, "You were probably on the wrong side of town." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy: "We go to church there every Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel: "They must have thought you belong to another gang and were 
infiltrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy: "But I don't belong to any gangs and have done nothing to make them 
think so." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel: "Hey man, look at the way you're dressed. I would think you were a 
gangbanger also." 
</P>
<P>
 This is how gang members think. Maybe the schools should get a copy of this 
show and present it at an assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that has changed since my youth is the weapons. We used tire irons 
and bicycle chains. Today's gangbangers use guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, at 19 years old, I decided my life was going nowhere and enlisted in 
the Army. When I got married and started having kids, I decided my kids were 
not going to take the route I had. I have six boys and two girls. Their mothers 
and I took a lot of interest in their schooling. We stressed respect for not 
only others but for themselves, and we believe part of that is how they dress. 
</P>
<P>
 I said a long time ago that if I work hard enough and show them that I care 
how they present themselves, they will go a lot further than I have. My kids 
didn't dress like gangsters, and they weren't considered gangsters, and they 
were allowed to lead a normal childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, a gang outfit is not a fashion trend. What it is is a quick ride to 
their eternal rest. Wake up! Take control! Force your children to live beyond 
the age of 18, whether they like it or not.

ANTEATERS GIVE AGGIES A HARD TIME; BASKETBALL: BROWN SCORES 39 POINTS IN UC 
IRVINE'S 95-87 UPSET OF NO. 25 NEW MEXICO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Where is downtown Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
 For Chris (Downtown) Brown, it's anywhere beyond the 18-foot nine-inch arc 
that signifies the zone for a three-point goal. And Saturday night in the Bren 
Center, it ranged to about two yards beyond as Brown scored 39 points -- 
including nine three-pointers -- and UC Irvine upset New Mexico State, 95-87, 
in front of 2,112 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving new meaning to the phrase "lost weekend," the Aggies, who began the 
week ranked No. 25 in the nation, suffered their second setback in as many 
days. And Irvine, the Big West's last-place team, came away with only its 
second victory in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (7-17 and 4-12 in conference) led by as many as 14 in the second half, 
but the Aggies (19-5, 11-4) pulled to three (84-81) with 3:22 remaining and 
then two (89-87) with 1:08 left. Brown drilled a three-pointer, made a rare 
layup and two free throws in the final 2 1/2 minutes as the Anteaters pulled 
off the upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter if we were in a zone or playing man-to-man," New Mexico 
State Coach Neil McCarthy said. "And he was covered on most of those shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown got the opening tip and drilled a three-pointer with only six seconds 
elapsed off the clock. It was the beginning of another long night for the 
Aggies, who lost by one point Thursday night at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever get mad at Chris for taking a shot," Irvine Coach Rod 
Baker said. "Every time he puts it up, it has a chance to go in. And there's no 
place on the floor that's safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine point guard Lloyd Mumford, who had 10 assists and passed up a couple of 
layups to sling the ball out to Brown on the perimeter, tried to appear miffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, he's taking away from my game," Mumford said, unable to keep a straight 
face. "I'd get all the way to the hoop and think, 'OK, I got to give it up,' 
and I'd kick it out to Chris. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was making the shots. He's a special kind of shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown made 12 of 25 from the floor and all six free throws and the Anteaters 
needed them all because the Aggies ruled the backboards, 55-37. New Mexico 
State had 16 offensive rebounds in the first half, the reason they trailed by 
only eight points (37-29) after shooting 29% from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't get 16 offensive rebounds in a week," Baker said, "but 
that's what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Anteaters -- who had not beaten a ranked team since they upset 
16th-ranked UNLV, 99-98, on Feb. 4, 1989 -- usually do is blow leads. They were 
up by 11 in the second half against the Titans and lost by six. They had a 
12-point lead over Utah State Feb. 10 and lost by two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had that feeling when they started closing in," Brown said. "I thought, 
'Damn, we can't let this happen again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the Anteaters somehow avoided their patented el foldo act. New Mexico 
State trailed by one, 55-54, with 12:59 left to play. But Irvine, thanks to two 
powerful follow dunks by seldom-used reserve Shaun Battle, increased the margin 
to 11 on a Brown three-pointer with 9:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when the Aggies closed for a final run at avoiding the upset, Brown and 
the Anteaters' full-court press prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to just go for it with the press and we got them to take a few 
quick threes," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is a hard team to figure. Thursday night, Brown had nine 
three-pointers, the Anteaters shot 56% from the field and they lose to the 
Titans, a team that then had won only six times all season. Saturday night, 
Brown makes nine threes and the Anteaters shoot 49% from the floor and they 
beat a team with 19 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just it," Baker said. "I don't know from night to night what we'll 
get. Nothing surprises me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to guess that the Aggies, who had won 13 in a row against Irvine, 
were surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we came out figuring we would beat them," McCarthy said.

DIVISION I-AA BOYS' SEMIFINALS; THIRD-SEEDED SANTA ANA VALLEY'S RALLY COMES UP 
SHORT OF TIME, VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 La Crescenta Crescenta Valley guard Richard O'Neill was near tears after 
leading his team to a 69-67 upset of third-seeded Santa Ana Valley on Saturday 
in a Southern Section Division I-AA boys' basketball semifinal game at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 An overflow crowd jammed the gymnasium and watched Olujimi Mann put on a 
clinic. He finished with 30 points, including eight three-pointers, six 
assists, four steals and two blocked shots for Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neill, who had 27 points, and Crescenta Valley (19-9) survived a furious 
Santa Ana Valley comeback and had enough of a cushion to weather Mann's 35-foot 
three-pointer at the buzzer. Crescenta Valley will play Long Beach Poly in the 
finals Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 For Crescenta Valley (19-9), it was the second consecutive upset after ousting 
top-seeded Fontana on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted this so bad," O'Neill said. "This is the greatest feeling I've ever 
had. We played great . . . this is our dream season." 
</P>
<P>
 Six-foot-four forward Brock Jacobsen had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and 6-9 
center Blake Jacobson had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Crescenta Valley, which 
used strong inside play to neutralize Santa Ana Valley's fast break and 
pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley out-rebounded Santa Ana Valley, 43-19, shot 52% (26-50) from 
the field, and made 15 of 16 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, Crescenta Valley held Santa Ana Valley to two-of-12 shooting in 
the first quarter to take an 18-8 lead. Crescenta Valley also held Santa Ana 
Valley scoreless for the first three minutes of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Santa Ana Valley had its chances in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson Henderson made a three-pointer with 2 minutes 3 seconds remaining to 
close the gap to three points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana Valley missed its next five shots and Mann took none of them. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill made both ends of a one-and-one and Jacobsen scored on a layup to push 
the lead to 69-62 before Darnell Adamson, who had 16 points and six rebounds, 
scored on a rebound to make it 69-64 with nine seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann stole the ball off the press and made his three-pointer, but Santa Ana 
Valley's rally ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, even though you're down 14 points in the fourth quarter, this is the 
(Southern Section) semifinals," Santa Ana Valley Coach Rich Prospero said. 
"This is no time to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made 186 three-pointers this season coming into this game and everyone was 
contributing. But tonight, we were a one-man team, literally."

HEADS' UP PLAY WINS FOR NEWPORT HARBOR

 Gina Heads got warm just in time on a cold Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 12 seconds later would have been too late for the Newport Harbor 
girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads was three for nine from the free-throw line before making two foul shots 
in the waning moments to help the Sailors sink Newbury Park, 43-41, in a 
Southern Section Division III-AA semifinal at Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (22-6) plays Brea-Olinda in Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads made only two of seven free throws before the fourth quarter. She tied 
the game, 41-41, by converting one of two free throws with 2:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was a little stiff in the beginning and my shots were flat," said 
Heads, who finished with seven points. "I wasn't getting up on my toes." 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (23-5) led throughout the first half and held a 30-23 advantage 
at the break. Newport Harbor held the Panthers scoreless for the first 3:58 and 
the final 4:06. 
</P>
<P>
 Genevieve Evarts led the Sailors on a 7-0 run to tie the score, 30-30, in the 
third period and nailed a 12-foot jumper at 2:18 to give Newport Harbor its 
first lead of the game, 34-33. MIKE GLAZE

DIVISION II-AA GIRLS' SEMIFINALS; WOODBRIDGE AIDED BY WEAVER'S EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea was to take Angela Burgess out of the game, and Ollie Martin's game 
plan did that Saturday night for Ocean View: Burgess did not score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the defense of his top defender, Alison Juroe, held 
Woodbridge's leading scorer, Jamie Oenning to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Every coach in the semifinals would think they could beat the Warriors with 
that scenario. Every coach but one -- Woodbridge's Eric Bangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? Because this is a total team," Bangs said after his top-seeded Warriors 
advanced to Saturday's Southern Section Division II-AA final with a 49-38 
victory over Ocean View at Irvine High. "I knew somebody would step up. That's 
the way it's been all year." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, someone stepped up from the bench. Lisa Weaver, a junior who has 
battled a knee injury her entire varsity career, took the place of Burgess and 
scored 12 points and pulled down six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of trouble stepping up in big games, sometimes," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time. Weaver showed that the Warriors' talent doesn't end with the 
starters. She carried Woodbridge late in the second quarter with Burgess in 
foul trouble. With the score tied at 13, she took a nice pass from Melanie 
Pearson to score inside, then scored easily off Oenning's inbounds pass and, 
after Oenning's 17-footer, Weaver again scored inside off a Pearson assist. 
That made it 21-13, giving Woodbridge the cushion it needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors remained unbeaten (28-0) and move on to their third section final 
in seven seasons. They will play Hemet at Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday. Hemet 
beat Cerritos Gahr, 41-37. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we win or lose, it doesn't matter," Bangs said. "Besides Brea-Olinda, 
how many teams can go 28-0? It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a nine-game winning streak for Ocean View (23-5), which got 
13 points from Dustine Yamamoto. The Seahawks shot 42% from the field this 
season, but made only 10 of 55 (18%) against Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything right defensively ourselves," Bangs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View pulled to 36-34 with 3:09 left, but Pearson (nine points) drove to 
the basket and made a four-foot jumper, and her drive to the basket moments 
later made it 42-35. Erin Stovall (15 points) made six of seven free throws to 
close it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has shown a lot of heart the whole season," Oenning said. "When 
we're not playing well, we dig down deep within our character -- 28-0 says it 
all."

DIVISION IV-AA GIRLS' SEMIFINALS; DESPITE ROBINSON, SANTA YNEZ BEATS COSTA MESA 
IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa senior Heather Robinson played an outstanding game, but Santa Ynez 
was a little better. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored 36 points, 19 in the second half, but missed a free throw with 
10 seconds left that would have given the Mustangs a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Robinson fouled out without scoring a point as the Pirates went 
on to an 83-75 overtime victory in a Southern Section Division IV-AA semifinal 
Saturday at Lompoc High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (24-4) led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter (35-23) 
and by nine (51-42) with 5:07 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson almost single-handedly brought Costa Mesa (19-7) back. She scored 
12 third-quarter points, including a three-pointer that brought the Mustangs to 
within 55-54. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, baskets by Robinson and Erin Brown again cut the Pirates' lead 
to 69-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ynez's Kacie Scoggin was fouled with 10 seconds remaining, but missed 
the front end of a one-and-one situation. Robinson grabbed the rebound and was 
immediately fouled by Kristi Rohr, who had 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 71-70, Robinson who had made all seven free throws until then, made 
the first but missed the second, forcing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ynez will play its sixth consecutive IV-AA final and second in a row 
against Playa del Rey St. Bernard. DAVID FELTON

 Jessica Eggleston scored 31 points and grabbed 20 rebounds to carry Cypress to 
a 52-39 victory over Troy in a Division II-A quarterfinal Saturday, putting the 
Centurions in the Southern Section semifinals for the first time in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston, the county's leading scorer with a 29.5-point average, scored four 
consecutive baskets as the Centurions (26-3) outscored the Warriors, 15-4, in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy (20-6) stayed with Cypress behind the efforts of point guard Dinah Shah 
and center Jennie Gadd, but in the end, it was Eggleston who made the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been our leader all year, so what happened tonight doesn't surprise 
me," Cypress Coach John Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't one of our better games, but we had a great fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston scored 15 of the Centurions' 25 first-half points and kept the 
Warriors from getting second shots by controlling the boards. Gadd, 6 feet 3, 
tried to contain her Cypress counterpart, but was saddled with her third foul 
with 23 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, which will play San Bernardino on Tuesday at a site to be determined, 
never has won a quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always lost this game, but this year we were seeded for the first time 
and got a better draw," Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to advance though, all of our players will have to contribute, 
not just Jessica." 
</P>
<P>
 Shah led Troy with 11 points. Gadd added seven points and seven rebounds.

DIVISION I-A GIRLS' SEMIFINALS; OSEGUERA GIVES MATER DEI A LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leticia Oseguera's legs shook incessantly as she watched the game in fear from 
the Mater Dei bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout Monarch senior center was strapped with three first-half fouls -- 
and the belief she had failed her team in the Southern Section Division I-A 
girls' basketball semifinals. But encouraged by her teammates at halftime, 
Oseguera broke out of her funk and promised to make the most of the game's 
final 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Goal met. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera scored all of her 18 points in the second half -- including making 
two crucial free throws late in the fourth quarter -- to help propel Mater Dei 
to a 65-62 victory over Cerritos on Saturday night at University High, and into 
its first girls' basketball title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew my teammates were looking for me to score," Oseguera said. "I was 
scared because I was on the bench for so long, so I really wanted to do 
everything I could after halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast League champion Mater Dei (24-3) will play defending division 
champion Ventura Buena (23-2) in the finals Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
Cerritos, which finished third in the San Gabriel Valley League, ends the 
season 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs also defeated the Dons, 62-46, Dec. 7 at Mater Dei. This time, 
however, they needed a big, late lift from their best player. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera was at her best in the third quarter, scoring 14 of the Monarchs' 17 
points. Oseguera, who also led Mater Dei with seven rebounds, made two 
important free throws with 1 minute 18 seconds remaining, which gave the 
Monarchs a 63-56 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The free throws helped Mater Dei regain its composure in the face of a fierce 
rally by Cerritos, which upset second-seeded Channel Islands in the second 
round, 55-53. Led by standout Iowa-bound forward Shannon Perry (29 points, 11 
rebounds), the Dons outscored the Monarchs in the fourth quarter, 16-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a dream come true," Mater Dei first-year Coach Mary Hauser said. 
"We thought we had a real shot at winning as long as we held on to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a great run (in the fourth quarter), so we just tried to keep the 
girls relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Melody Peterson scored 22 points and had seven steals for the 
Monarchs, and senior guard Adrienne Botana scored 15.

DIVISION III-A GIRLS' SEMIFINALS; FRESHMAN RESERVE LEADS SAN LUIS OBISPO PAST 
ESTANCIA 
</P>

<P>
 San Luis Obispo reserve freshman center Yolanda White scored 18 points and 
grab 14 rebounds, leading the Tigers to a 50-42 victory over Estancia in a 
Division III-A playoff girls' game Saturday night at Cuesta College. 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo (17-10) advances into the championship game Saturday against 
Northern League rival Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo scored the first 11 points of the second quarter to break an 
8-8 tie and never trailed afterward. San Luis Obispo led at the break, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia, which finished 21-5, closed the gap to four points late in the third 
quarter on a three-pointer by Jenny Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings and Laura Czingula each scored 12 points for Estancia. No other 
Eagles scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaymee Muriset had 10 points also for San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were outrebounded, 37-18, and shot only 37% from the floor (16 of 
43). 
</P>
<P>
 "We executed well, we just missed a lot of shots we normally make," Estancia 
Coach Rich Boyce said. "Our girls gutted it out, but it was just not meant to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia, which tied for second in the Pacific Coast League, upset 
third-seeded Rancho Alamitos, 51-44, Wednesday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia had beaten Bellflower, 63-60, in the first round Feb. 19. ERIC

SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS WRESTLING MEET; CALVARY CHAPEL, EL MODENA EXCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the middle of the mass confusion called Masters, you couldn't find anyone 
pressed for time more than Calvary Chapel's John Azevedo and El Modena's Alan 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Served them right. You qualify that many wrestlers into this tournament, you 
can expect to watch your fair share of matches. 
</P>
<P>
 And watch they did. Between them, the coaches saw their wrestlers square off 
51 times throughout the day-long Southern Section Masters meet at Fountain 
Valley High on Saturday. More then once, Azevedo and Clinton would have to 
position themselves on the side of the mat so they could watch two matches 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time well spent. Four-time section Division III team champion and 
defending State champion Calvary Chapel, which had qualified eight wrestlers 
for this meet, had four tournament winners and advanced all eight to the State 
championships Friday and Saturday in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Dane Valdez (125 pounds), who won his second consecutive meet title, 
were Calvary Chapel teammates Shane Valdez (119), Josh Holiday (145) and Ed 
Mosley (152). Freshman Joe Calavitta was second at 103, Mauricio Mora took 
third at 135 and Danny Robinson (140) and Matt Van Hook (171) finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles outdid their 1993 output, when six wrestlers qualified for State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get eight to state, and we did," Azevedo said. "We would have 
liked to have Mora win, but overall, everyone wrestled real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Division I team champion El Modena didn't have such lofty numbers, but it was 
a successful day for the Vanguards. Like last season, El Modena qualified four 
wrestlers for State, but this season, the four qualifiers placed higher at 
Masters. Senior Juan Alvarez won the 135-pound division, Teak Sato was upset at 
130 and took second. Defending Masters champion David Wells made it to the 
140-pound final before he forfeited because of a bruised back, and Chris Jaime 
finished fifth at 145. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys did a great job," Clinton said. "We've been peaking this last 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel and El Modena boasted the numbers, but other area athletes won 
championships or had finishes that will help their seeding for the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 130-pound final, Buena Park's Vince Virgen was shocked when he upset 
Sato, the State runner-up in 1993, 12-8. Virgen has been wrestling at 135 all 
season but dropped down a weight at the league meet and has been undefeated in 
the new class since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous," Virgen said. "I knew what a good wrestler he was. I don't 
know what happened. Something clicked." 
</P>
<P>
 As it did with Canyon's Darryl Christian, the section champion at 140. He 
added the Masters title to his resume when Wells forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual section champion Terry Tuzzolino of Capistrano Valley was the 
winner in the 171-pound class by forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Masters champion Wali Sibrie of Buena Park finished third at 
heavyweight and Huntington Beach's Eric Escobedo was third at 189. Santa Ana's 
Ronald Hernandez (130) was third and Roger Santiago (103) was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-nine county wrestlers qualified for Masters, and more than half -- 31 -- 
advanced to State. At 130, 140 and 171 pounds, half the section's eight 
representatives were from the county.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; WINNING END TO GOOD SEASON FOR CHAPMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman completed its most successful season in six years by rallying past 
Dominican, 78-71, in nonconference men's basketball Saturday at Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, in their first season without any players on athletic 
scholarship, finished 17-8, the most victories since they went 17-12 in 
1988-89. The .680 winning percentage is the best since 1983-84, Walt Hazzard's 
final season, when Chapman was 22-6 (.786). 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in front of a homecoming crowd of 1,237, the biggest of the season, 
the Panthers trailed by nine points, 60-51, with 11 minutes remaining. But less 
than four minutes later, they took a 64-63 lead when Stefan Mumaw took a pass 
from Brian Wood and slammed it through. 
</P>
<P>
 The game tightened from that point until Wood made a driving layup at 2:33, 
and Umahl Anderson put in a rebound with 1:40 to give the Panthers a 74-69 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumaw had a team-high 16 points and nine rebounds, and Anderson had 14 points 
and nine rebounds for Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominican, an NAIA Division I team from San Rafael, is 4-24. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman 94, UC Santa Cruz 52 -- Melissa Starr had 18 points and 12 rebounds 
for the Panthers (6-18), who finished the season winning two in a row and three 
of their last five. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big West Conference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 CS Fullerton 85, Nevada 59 -- Autumn Hollyfield had seven three-pointers and 
25 points to lead Fullerton (5-19, 4-12). 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State 69, UC Irvine 66 -- Jinelle Williams set a UC Irvine record for 
most rebounds in a game with 23, breaking the record of 22 set by Chari Graham 
during the 1983-84 season. The Anteaters are 3-20, 2-13; San Jose State 14-10, 
9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 In track and field: 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara sweeps -- The Santa Barbara men scored 142 points, ahead of 
Cal State Fullerton (112) and UC Irvine (94) in the men's competition, and the 
Gaucho women scored 132, ahead of Irvine (104) and Fullerton (52) in the first 
meet on Fullerton's newly repaired track. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia 4-0, Pacific Christian 0-2 -- Stephanie Viola threw a no-hitter in 
Game 1 for Concordia (3-1). MARTIN BECK

 Cal State Fullerton used timely defense and the first complete game of Chad 
Rolish's career to defeat Oklahoma, 4-1, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers 
Baseball Classic Saturday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolish (4-1), a senior left-hander, retired the side in order only once, in 
the fifth inning, but kept Oklahoma off-balance with a variety of off-speed 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (14-2) was held hitless for 4 2/3 innings by Sooner starter Steve 
Connelly but was able to score two runs in the bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell and Jeff Ferguson reached base on walks, and advanced to second 
and third on stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Adam Millan hit a grounder to Connelly, who caught Ferguson 
straying off second. But as Connelly threw to second, Powell broke for home and 
slid in safely under catcher Chris Briones' tag, while Ferguson advanced to 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Hemphill then drove in Ferguson with a sacrifice bunt, giving the Titans 
a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton added a run in the fifth on a two-out triple by Powell and a Brian 
King single. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Titans face No. 1 Georgia Tech at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Anaheim Hilton and Towers Classic game: 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech 5, San Diego 4 (11 innings) -- Nomar Garciaparra's two-run single 
in the bottom of the 11th won it for the Yellow Jackets (6-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern California College baseball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 8, Albertson's College (Ida.) 6 -- Ryan Seidel hit 
his first home run and was two for three with two runs batted in for SCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Beckley (1-2) gave up nine hits over seven innings for SCC (5-6). 
Albertson's College is 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertson's College 11, Concordia 0 (7, time limit) -- Matt Rasmussen had two 
home runs and three RBIs for Albertson's (2-3). GABE LACQUES

 1992-93: South Coast League champion, runner-up at Orange County 
Championships.

 Key newcomers: Nicki Delange, So., LJ, 100LH; Julie Rademacher, Fr., 100, 200.

 Outlook: One of the truest "teams" in the county. While the talent-rich 
Diablos finished second at the Orange County championships last season, they 
placed no one on the Times Orange County's first or second teams. Phillips won 
the South Coast League title in the 100 and 200 meters last spring, and Foster 
finished second in the shotput and third in the discus. Beth Merkle was the 
county runner-up in the long jump, 400 and 300 hurdles last season. Mission 
Viejo has won 11 consecutive league championships. "I am hoping for some 
surprises," Almond said.

GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD / 1994 PREVIEW; WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: George Varvas (13th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: Fifth at the Orange County Championships, fourth in the Sea View 
League finals, 6-1 league dual meet record. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Wendy Brown, Sr., HJ; Angela Burgess, Jr., SP, DT; Julie 
Snyder, Jr., 800, 1600; Meisha Wilson-Duval, Jr., 100, 200, 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Frannie Simmons, So., 400; Erin Stovall, Fr., LJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: A team that isn't hoping for a repeat of last season. After finishing 
fifth at the Orange County championships and 6-1 in its Sea View League dual 
meets, the loss of Wilson-Duval to injury before league finals spelled the 
quick demise of the Warriors. The talented sprinter was the county runner-up in 
the 100 (12.75 wind-aided) and 200 (25.68 wind-aided) as well as third in the 
400 (59.74). Burgess, one of the standouts on the Warriors' outstanding 
basketball team, finished third in the discus at the Orange County 
championships and fourth in the shotput. Brown tied for fourth in the county 
high jump, and Stovall is one of Varvas' diamonds in the rough in the long 
jump. Simmons and Snyder will solidify the middle-distance races for the 
Warriors.

GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD / 1994 PREVIEW; BOWMAN JUMPS AT CHANCE TO SHINE FOR 
NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though she competes in only one event, Newport Harbor junior Tina Bowman is 
busier than the rest of her track and field teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of school at 2 p.m., she rushes to basketball practice where she works out 
from 2:15 to 4:30. Then she hustles to join Sailor teammates at the high jump 
pit until 6. From there, she leaves to practice with the Orange County 
Volleyball Club until 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had more time to myself, but I really am glad that I'm doing what I 
am," said Bowman, the defending Sea View League and Southern Section Division 
II high jump champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her daily grind, Bowman has already put in a busy prep year. She 
played a key role on Newport Harbor's volleyball team, which finished 
undefeated in the Sea View League but lost to league rival Corona del Mar in 
the Southern Section Division I and State finals. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also a forward on the Newport Harbor girls' basketball team, which 
finished second in league to undefeated Woodbridge and entered the Division 
III-AA playoffs with a 19-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her favorite sport? "I think it's a tie between volleyball and track," 
Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball is my least favorite of the three, because it's the one that I 
contribute least to the team," said Bowman, who was in Coach Shannon Jakosky's 
seven-player rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably better at track and volleyball, so, of course, I like them 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest day of Bowman's track and field career came at last season's Mt. 
San Antonio Relays, where she jumped a personal best 5 feet 9 1/4 inches to win 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "That day really got me excited," she said. "I had been stuck on 5-8 for so 
long (the height she reached in winning the section title). . . . I could make 
5-6 no problem, then I would choke every time the bar would get there." 
</P>
<P>
 As with most athletes who juggle three sports, Bowman isn't really sure where 
the future will take her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'll take a scholarship wherever I can get it," Bowman laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Newport Harbor Coach Eric Tweit: "Since she got such a late start in 
athletics (eighth grade), she is still learning and managing to get by on her 
athletic ability." 
</P>
<P>
 It's Bowman's natural ability that is brought up, no matter who is speaking or 
what sport is being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is probably a borderline (NCAA) Division I volleyball player, but 
definitely has Division I talent in track," said Rick Foster, the jumps coach 
at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tweit: "She does well because she is a very, very competitive young lady. 
I have never seen her compete poorly in a big meet when it counts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors may be counting on Bowman more this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need to make more use of her," said Tweit, suggesting she may 
be adding hurdles to her repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to see her run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendship and competition drive Bowman, who is best friends, main rival and 
part-time coaching confidant of teammate Misty May, The Times Orange County's 
volleyball player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's easier to listen to her (May) when things are going badly in 
practice instead of Coach Foster," said Bowman, who finished last June's State 
meet in third place in the high jump, one place behind May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having Misty around has made things easier for both of them," Tweit 
said, "because they always have someone out there on the infield and are never 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes things a lot more comfortable for both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Goals are something that are often reviewed on the high jump apron at Newport 
Harbor, with Bowman and May eyeing the six-foot barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could legitimately have two six-foot high jumpers this season," Tweit 
said. "And if it doesn't happen this year, my guess is that it will next year." 
</P>
<P>
 "That is definitely my goal," Bowman said. "Every jumper wants to make six 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 One way to help reach that goal, Bowman has learned, is through relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We soul stretch at the beginning of practice," said Bowman, who describes the 
"stretching" as nothing more than lying on the high jump mats and relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the key to high jumping. If you're tense, you're going to miss."

GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD / 1994 PREVIEW; EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Karen O'Bric (fourth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: Sunset League champion, 7-0 in league dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Erin Bailey, Sr., 800; Sonya Bryant, So., SP, DT; Janndee 
Evans, Sr., 1600; Jeannie Formosa, Jr., 1600, 3200; Jennifer Formosa, Jr., 
1600, 3200; Suzanne Gates, Jr., HJ; Sara Griffiths, Sr., SP, DT; Elyse 
Homberger, Jr., 3200; Shauna Itri, So., 800, 1600; Julie Koudelka, Sr., 400; 
Tami Letterman, Jr., 100, 200; Kelly Marshall, So., 400; Kerry O'Bric, So., LJ, 
TJ, 300 IH; Marie Philman, So., 100 LH, DT, SP, HJ; Carrie Quinn, Sr., 800, 
1600. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Karen Anderson, So., 400; Kerrie Wright, Jr., 1600, 3200. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: As deep a team as there is anywhere (102 girls showed up the first 
day of practice a year ago), the Chargers show no signs of letting loose their 
hold on the Sunset League. Philman and O'Bric, the leaders of the girls' 
basketball team, cover the field events and hurdles while Letterman and 
Marshall head the sprint corps. Homberger was fifth in the State 3200 meters 
last year. The State Division II champion cross-country team will only help on 
the track.

 Coach: Eric Tweit (15th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: Sea View League champion, Southern Section Division II champion, tied 
for third in county championships, fifth in State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Tina Bowman, Jr., HJ; Mandy Clayton, Jr., 100 LH, 300 LH, LJ,

</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Variety is the Sailors' spice of life, with Heads (volleyball, power 
lifting), Bowman (volleyball, basketball) and May (volleyball) leading the way. 
Heads was fourth in the State meet shotput (43-6) and sixth in the discus 
(139-6). May jumped 5-10 to finish second as a sophomore, and Bowman, the 
defending county champion, was third (5-9) at the same meet. Clayton is an 
all-around threat.

 Coach: Al Britt (14th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: Orange County champion, won 18th league title in school's 22-year 
history last season by taking the Empire championship in 1992, Southern Section 
Division II runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Carrie Caulkins, Jr., 1600; Inshirah Jones, Jr., 100 LH, 300 
LH; Kristy Kierulff, Jr., HJ, LJ; Kelly O'Connor, Jr., LJ, TJ; Heather Perrin,

</P>
<P>
 Key newcomer: Lynnette Anderson, Sr., HJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Aztecs' track and field program is so consistent you can set your 
watch to it. Esperanza scored in eight of 15 events at the section finals a 
year ago and returns the bulk of its county championship squad. Section 
1600-meter champion Caulkins led the county's most formidable trio with 
distance mates Pugmire and Titus in cross-county last fall. Jones leads the way 
for the Empire League champions in both hurdle events, having run 15.63 and 
46.4. Kierulff, the State champion in the high jump as a freshman, has a best 
of 5-10, and O'Connor was third in the section triple jump at 36-7 last season.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; GOLDEN WEST WINS TO EARN STATE

<P>
 Golden West earned its eighth consecutive berth in the women's State 
basketball tournament with a 70-53 victory over San Diego Mesa Saturday at 
Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress and Orange Coast, also in the Orange Empire Conference, will join the 
Rustlers in the tournament, which starts Thursday at Solano College in Suisun 
City. Golden West plays Merritt in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Deana Itow, a freshman guard, had 22 points, 15 in the first half, as Golden 
West opened a 33-23 halftime lead. Mesa got no closer than six in the second 
half and that came with 14 minutes 44 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole Quinn made two baskets and Julie Murdent added another and the 
Rustlers were ahead, 43-31, with 13:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, normally a reserve, started the second half because of an injury and 
scored eight of the Rustlers' first 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn was playing in place of Katie Miner, who hurt her knee diving for the 
ball in the first half. Miner, with her knee taped, played the final 11:12 of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa, using its trademark press, tried to force Golden West to panic, but Itow 
and sophomore guard Kristin Brun were able to get the ball up court with little 
trouble much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing is that we handled their press," Golden West co-Coach Dave 
Stricklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdent, despite second-half foul trouble, finished with 13 points. Michelle 
Kravick had nine before fouling out and Brun had eight. Brun also had a 
team-high 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In other women's playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 70, Ventura 64 -- Jennifer Johnson scored 24 points and Sara Works 
scored 22 and grabbed 12 rebounds as the Chargers (24-9) reached the State 
tournament for the first time. The Chargers play Butte in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura finishes at 25-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 59, Riverside 53 -- LeAnn Kazmer had 20 points, including making 
12 of 16 free throws, as visiting Orange Coast (21-12) earned its second 
consecutive trip to the State tournament. Orange Coast plays San Mateo in the 
first round. Riverside finishes 21-12. 
</P>
<P>
 LA Harbor plays Lassen in the other first-round game. STEVE KRESAL

up the Point Mugu Naval Air Reserve Squadron VFA-305. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the times when the workaday world ends for White, Rainey and 
Sullivan and they turn into aerial warriors -- leaping willingly into the 
exacting and often dangerous world of naval aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years and at least two grueling active Navy sea tours under 
their belts, many of the pilots in the reserve squadron said they joined it for 
the same reason: a chance to pursue airline jobs while testing themselves and 
their flying skills in the F/A-18 Hornet -- one of the Navy's fastest, most 
lethal fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 But along with that opportunity, comes the reality that one day their unit may 
be activated and the simulated bullets and missiles they now dodge in training 
might be the real thing. The squadron, in its 24-year history, has yet to be 
ordered into combat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fight like we train and train like we fight," said Rainey, 40. "It's an 
old saying, but it really holds true for us. We're not bloodthirsty, but we 
would be ready if we were deployed. It's something that we have trained for 
virtually our entire military careers." 
</P>
<P>
 'Carrier Quals' 
</P>
<P>
 VFA-305's Lt. Craig McCartney settled back into the canvas seat of his F/A-18 
fighter and sucked in the oxygen flowing through the mask around his face. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney and others in the squadron recently flew from Point Mugu for three 
days aboard the Kitty Hawk off San Diego to perform their "carrier quals" -- 
carrier qualifications required annually to remain aviators in the Navy 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 All around his jet -- now straining at full throttle and struggling to break 
free of the Kitty Hawk's powerful steam catapult -- crew members scrambled to 
perform last-minute checks in preparation to vault him and the $40-million 
aircraft off the ship's bow and into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his tinted helmet visor, McCartney looked out to sea as he mentally 
prepared for what was about to happen. As he anxiously waited for the explosive 
force of the launch, a giant rooster tail of jet exhaust from his engines 
spiraled skyward after hitting a steel jet blast deflector that had been raised 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a little more time than it takes to blink, McCartney, a Port Hueneme 
resident known by his call sign "Beatle," would be crammed into the back of his 
seat by the violent lateral G-forces of a catapult launch. 
</P>
<P>
 In that same time frame -- about two seconds -- he and his aircraft would 
accelerate from 0 to more than 160 m.p.h., leaving him, briefly, more in the 
role of passenger than pilot. It was a role that after more than 300 "cat" 
shots he still doesn't savor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You set the throttle forward, salute the chief and hold on to the towel 
rack," said McCartney, a 34-year-old full-time reservist -- one of four in the 
squadron.  
</P>
<P>
 Once jettisoned aloft, the gray-colored F/A-18s, replete with the squadron's 
black wolf "Lobo" insignia, must eventually come back to the ship -- a 
procedure that demands exacting precision from even the most experienced 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 During the exercises, Hornets belonging to the squadron would orbit around the 
carrier as it steamed ahead at no less than 30 knots. One by one, the jets 
maneuvered into precise position in order to land on the carrier's wind-swept 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Safest Wire 
</P>
<P>
 From less than a mile out, McCartney radioed the landing safety officer that 
he was "calling the ball" -- a message meaning he had aligned his aircraft with 
a set of shipboard lights that, if followed correctly, would guide him to a 
safe landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for McCartney on the Kitty Hawk's 550-foot landing ramp was a series 
of four steel arresting wires an inch in diameter and set toward the ship's 
stern in approximate 50-foot intervals. The wires were all that stood between a 
safe landing and possible disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 With its landing weight exceeding more than 30,000 pounds and its speed in 
excess of 150 m.p.h., McCartney gently lowered his fighter to the deck's 
surface. His goal was to catch the "3-wire," which has been deemed the safest 
wire for a Hornet's tail hook to catch. 
</P>
<P>
 As his Hornet finally touched down, the tail hook hit the first wire instead 
of the desired third wire. As his wheels hit, the carrier's deck filled with 
the smell of burned rubber and several hundred feet of the arresting wire 
wildly whipped out behind the plane. Seconds later, and about 300 feet farther 
down the deck, McCartney's jet came to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try for the 3-wire," McCartney said. "A 1-wire means that you were that 
much closer to running into the ship and catching a 4-wire means that you were 
that close to going flying again. But because the deck is constantly moving and 
other factors, catching any wire and landing is generally a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 An area on the stern section of the flight deck called a "round down" -- an 
extension of the flight deck rounded over to help lessen the impact of a plane 
crash -- shows the scars of where pilots didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the two extremes -- the scars on the round down and the aircraft 
that bolter," McCartney said. "It just proves that you can't afford to have a 
bad day out here." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the squadron pilots, as demanding as day carrier landings 
are, night carrier landings may be the single most difficult thing to master in 
naval aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no peripheral vision and if it's really dark you cannot distinguish 
the ship from the sea or the horizon. All you can see are the faint lights that 
ring the edge of the flight deck and you can't see those until almost right 
over them," said Rainey, who has completed more than 150 night landings in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the others in the squadron, virtually every night carrier landing is 
an event that is carefully stored away in the pilots' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me just say this, every gray hair I have on my head is a result of night 
carrier landings," McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Haven 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous place on the ship is probably the flight deck itself, 
squadron members say. The only safe haven there is the ship's "island" or 
conning tower where the bridge and air traffic control operations are directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Awash in great waves of heat, jet exhaust and noise, the deck of the Kitty 
Hawk is off-limits during flight operations to all except those personnel who 
are absolutely needed. Even during "low intensity" carrier qualification 
exercises, Navy officials admit that crew members are regularly blown off the 
deck by an aircraft's jet wash. Noise levels recorded near the catapults 
regularly exceed an ear-damaging 140 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally curious first-time visitors to the ship by nature immediately seek 
the refuge of the lower quarters the moment they step off a transport plane and 
onto the flight deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will walk off the (transport) and they'll immediately get tunnel vision 
toward that hatch," said Steve Sewell, VFA-305's former commander. "It's their 
bodies reacting instinctively toward the hostile environment they've found 
themselves in." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an instinct that the pilots themselves follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're out of your airplane, you essentially have no business being on 
that deck," McCartney said. "There are plenty of guys who are around today 
because someone reached out and grabbed them before they were sucked into a jet 
(engine) intake. To say that it's a dangerous place is a heck of an 
understatement." 
</P>
<P>
 But along with the dangers of jets moving around the ship's flight deck, 
incoming aircraft that are damaged or that have injured pilots present just as 
deadly a danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the flight deck of the Nimitz one evening when an aircraft crashed 
into the island. I had been out of my aircraft for no more than 15 seconds when 
I looked back and saw that the front of my plane had been sheared off and was 
on fire. Nineteen people died in that accident and they died just like that," 
Rainey said, snapping his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Camaraderie 
</P>
<P>
 But in the face of such overt danger, VFA-305's pilots said they love being a 
part of the squadron, some citing patriotism, some citing the simple thrill of 
flying a machine faster than most people can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say the reserve squadron allows them to spend time with their 
wives and families. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an important part of the decision," Rainey said. "In the active 
Navy, life on families can be very, very difficult. By moving to the reserves, 
I was able to do a lot of different things -- start my airline career, continue 
to fly with the squadron and spend time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, especially those who served long years in the active Navy, say they 
remain in the reserve because of the level of camaraderie that only pilots of 
their skill share. 
</P>
<P>
 "This unit is a big family. We all look out for each other and are concerned 
about how one another is doing," Sullivan said. "I would be lying if I didn't 
say it's a complete rush to fly the aircraft we do. When this all goes away I 
know that it's going to leave a big void in my life."

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; SCRAMBLE FOR 2 SEATS MAY REALIGN POLITICS IN 
EAST COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors now up for grabs, at 
stake in elections this year will be the entire balance of power in the east 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard's decision last week to join colleague Maria 
VanderKolk in stepping down after one term could also recast city politics in 
Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Moorpark, as officials from each of these cities 
line up to compete for the two supervisorial seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole balance of power in the east county is going to change," VanderKolk 
said. "With open seats on three city councils plus two supervisor seats, 
there's going to be a lot of new faces. It's going to be a very interesting 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the same day Howard made her announcement, Moorpark City Councilman 
Scott Montgomery and Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels declared their 
candidacies for the 4th District supervisor's post, representing their two 
cities. Mikels' council colleague Barbara Williamson entered the race last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason is also mulling a supervisorial bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "My options are open," he said. "I'm looking at it. By the end of the weekend 
I should have a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for VanderKolk's 2nd District seat, which covers most of the 
Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme, a dozen possible contenders have taken out 
nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only four have officially announced their candidacies. They are 
Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, former Ventura County Supervisor Madge 
L. Schaefer, taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings and attorney Trudi Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said regardless of who is elected to fill the two 
supervisorial seats, they will be facing many of the same problems Howard and 
VanderKolk wrestled with during their four years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "During our time on the board we didn't see a lot of positive trends in the 
county," VanderKolk said. "It's been a difficult time for everybody in 
California with the recession. And there are a lot of challenges still to 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the toughest challenges facing Ventura County: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dealing with an increasing demand for services, and dwindling sources of 
revenue. During the last three years, Ventura County has trimmed $45 million 
from its budget and eliminated more than 400 positions, as the state has sought 
to shift money away from local governments. County officials said they expect 
more of the same over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a new landfill. The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday is expected 
to approve plans to keep Bailard Landfill in Oxnard open until 1997. In the 
meantime, officials must find a replacement dump to handle the trash of west 
county cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Canyon near Ojai has long been considered a potential landfill site, 
but the city and environmental groups have successfully fought the proposal, 
expressing fears that truck traffic and rotting garbage will foul the air and 
devalue property there. Another possibility is hauling more trash to the Simi 
Valley Landfill, a move that east county officials vehemently oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deciding whether to establish a commercial airport at Point Mugu. The Navy 
said it is willing to share its runway with commercial jets as a cost-sharing 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan said a commercial airport would be an economic boon to 
the county, attracting new businesses. Critics say there are not enough 
passengers here to warrant building a $2-million airport terminal. They also 
point out that recession-battered airlines are cutting back flights, not adding 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The giant Ahmanson Ranch housing project planned for eastern Ventura County. 
The Board of Supervisors, by a 4-1 vote, approved the 3,050-dwelling golf 
course community in December. But that decision could be overturned as a result 
of lawsuits filed by Los Angeles County and some of its cities, which contend 
that the development's environmental impact report did not adequately assess 
how their communities would be affected by traffic and pollution. Ventura 
County Superior Court Judge Barbara Lane could rule on the case as early as 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two new county supervisors will also have to grapple with new air quality 
regulations, increasing incidents of violent crime and the proposed expansion 
of county health services. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to distinguish themselves, candidates in both races are 
emphasizing their experience in and out of government, their professional 
backgrounds and ability to run their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with my business and government experience I can be helpful from a 
financial standpoint," said Schillo, who owns his own financial consulting firm 
and has served nearly 10 years on the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer cites her two decades in city and county government as qualifications 
for the job. Robings recounts his years as a taxpayers watchdog of government 
spending. And Loh, who at age 37 is the youngest candidate in the race, talks 
about the need for new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be going door-to-door to find out what voters want in their next 
supervisor," Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates in the 4th District race are elected city officials, with 
varying degrees of experience. Mikels, who has been endorsed by Howard, has 
served three years on the Simi Valley City Council, and Williamson one. 
Montgomery has been a Moorpark city councilman for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said although her opponents have more government experience, she 
believes she has greater name recognition because of her 14 years as a 
representative of Simi Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no illusions that the customers of this bank elected me to the City 
Council," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the two supervisorial races, officials say they are 
bound to have some impact on city council elections in the east county in 
November. As it stands now, there are two open council seats in both Moorpark 
and Simi Valley and three in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If either Williamson or Montgomery are elected supervisor of the 4th District, 
a special election would be called to fill the winner's vacancy. If both were 
to lose, each would retain their council positions. 
</P>
<P>
 This would not be the case with Mikels, whose term on the Simi Valley City 
Council expires this year. If Mikels were to get in a runoff for supervisor, 
she would also forfeit the chance to run for reelection to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, putting my hat in the ring is basically an all-or-nothing 
proposition," Mikels said, "because I see it as going to a runoff." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2nd District supervisor's race, Schillo, a 10-year-veteran of the 
Thousand Oaks City Council, is running without risk of losing his council seat. 
A victory, however, would force a special election there to fill his vacancy 
and set the stage for a major shake-up on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there are three seats on the council up for election this November, 
including those held by incumbents Elois Zeanah and Judy Lazar. In addition, 
Councilman Alex Fiore will retire this fall after 30 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore has already expressed fears that his longtime foe, Zeanah, may win 
reelection and sweep one of her allies into office as well, forming a 
three-member majority with Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski to control city 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would cause great problems for the city," said Fiore, who along with 
Schillo and Lazar has often been at odds with Zeanah and Zukowski on growth and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we get the right four people on the council," Fiore said. "So far 
some of the people who have expressed interest in running sound like reasonable 
and rational people to me, so to that extent I'm pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she hopes that the council elections will put an end to the 
divisiveness on the governing panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I hope happens is that the new council will be more tolerant of 
differing viewpoints," she said. "If people respect differing viewpoints and 
are open to debate, then I think good things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simi Valley voters may also be asked to replace Mayor Greg 
Stratton, who is one of five candidates vying for the county 
auditor-controller's job. If he gets into a runoff for the county post, 
Stratton would give up his chance to run for reelection as mayor. Councilman 
Bill Davis has already said he plans to run for the mayor's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems everyone on our council is running for something," Stratton joked.

CAL LUTHERAN SEMINAR OFFERS 1,200 WOMEN A 'RENEWAL DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past five years, Thousand Oaks resident Renate Lee has set aside a day 
to rejuvenate herself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, she was joined by about 1,200 other women at the annual women's 
seminar at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a renewal day," Lee said. "I have the tendency to get wrapped up in my 
daily life. Sometimes it's good to have a look at what women are doing outside 
my circle." 
</P>
<P>
 Women young and old came from around the state to attend the daylong "Creative 
Options" seminar, which offered a wide array of 80-minute workshops run by 
family counselors, educators and activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think women are very eager, anxious and enthused about possibilities and 
options in their lives," said Kathryn Swanson, director of the Women's Resource 
Center at Cal Lutheran, which sponsored the event along with the Thousand Oaks 
branch of the American Assn. of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The day got under way with speaker Betty Friedan, whose talk was opened and 
closed by standing ovations from the cheering crowd. The noted feminist spoke 
to the packed auditorium for more than an hour about the "mystique of age." 
</P>
<P>
 Women and men, she said, should embrace their later years as a time of growth, 
change and a sense of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you obsess with being young, it diminishes the possibility of moving into 
future stages of growth," Friedan said. "You are part of an ongoing stream of 
life, not only through your children and your grandchildren, which is a great 
joy, but also in the trees we plant . . . and in the causes we embrace." 
</P>
<P>
 After her speech, Friedan said seminars such as the one at Cal Lutheran were 
events that encouraged women to continue changing and moving ahead in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a hunger and a need for new thinking and new vision," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said Friedan was one of the highlights of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really liked what she said about being genuine and embracing humanness," 
said Lisa Quigley, 21, a student at the University of California at Davis who 
drove from Northern California with her roommate to attend the event. "I think 
her speech applied to all people of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Coppola, 64, of Camarillo said she came primarily to hear Friedan, but 
attended a workshop on breast cancer out of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a whole list, but I felt I should know about it," she said. Coppola 
was one of about 20 women at the workshop, which focused on prevention -- 
specifically, how to detect lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of breast cancer needs to be reiterated," said Annie Merz, 21, a 
student at Cal Lutheran who attended the workshop. "It's just something 
everyone should know about. Everybody has the attitude that it won't happen to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The breast cancer workshop was one of 75 offered, ranging in topics from gun 
control to career planning and country line-dancing to self-defense tactics. 
The workshops ranged in size from classroom sessions with fewer than 20 
participants to group activities with nearly 50. 
</P>
<P>
 This event was sold out weeks before the registration deadline, Swanson said, 
forcing the organizing committee to return applicants' checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have maxed out at over 1,200 . . . and I would guess we've turned away 200 
to 300," she said, explaining that Friedan was a tremendous draw this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many women, having a day simply to celebrate themselves among other 
women was the real attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "For women to get together and explore their own issues is a way to explore a 
path through a men's world," said 31-year-old Sylvia Deily of Westwood. "It 
inspires me to continue to work."

FUNDING CUTBACKS LEAVE FIGHTER SQUADRON SLATED FOR SHUTDOWN; MILITARY: CLOSURE 
OF THE POINT MUGU-BASED UNIT IS PLANNED FOR DEC. 31. IT'S EXPECTED TO SAVE THE 
NAVY RESERVE $22 MILLION ANNUALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent cruise aboard the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk may be one of the last 
for a Point Mugu-based Navy reserve fighter squadron unless funding for the 
unit is restored before the end of the year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The squadron, VFA-305, which flies F/A-18 Hornets, has been slated to be shut 
down Dec. 31 following a recommendation in President Clinton's federal budget 
for fiscal year 1995, according to Lt. Cmdr. Bill Yamanaka, a spokesman for the 
Naval Air Reserve headquarters in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamanaka said the unit, with its compliment of more than 100 officers and 
enlisted crew members, is slated to be decommissioned along with the Navy 
reserve's Carrier Air Wing 30, the squadron's parent group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire Navy is taking some big-time cuts, not just the naval reserve," 
Yamanaka said. "The thinking in Washington was at this point in time we no 
longer need this air wing and specifically the squadron that you are talking 
about. Whether we agree with this is not really relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamanaka said that by closing VFA-305, the Navy reserve will save about $22 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the impending closure of the unit -- the only fighter squadron 
currently based at Point Mugu -- hit hard with squadron members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy is struggling to continue to be able to provide a forward presence 
with less and less resources," said Capt. Michael Kellard, commander of Navy 
reserve units at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the reserve forces cost less to operate, the active forces are ready to 
go at a moment's notice. Either way, this is a painful process for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellard said that while the Navy is looking for new personnel, the loss of 
seasoned enlisted crew members and officers, such as those in VFA-305, will be 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of the Naval Air Reserve is in the experience of our officers 
and crew," Kellard said. "Obviously, you can't readily replace experience 
levels like that." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the 22 pilots in the squadron -- about half of them from Ventura 
County -- the closure of the unit will mark the end of their naval aviation 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with it," said Barry Rainey, the squadron's commanding officer. 
"I have some real mixed emotions about this. As the level of tension in the 
world comes down, so should the expenses of the Department of Defense. But I 
also feel that we have a lot to offer because of our experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cmdr. Tom Sullivan, the squadron's executive officer, the unit's 
decommissioning is a concept that's hard to accept.

 "It's very discouraging," said Sullivan. "I've been in the reserves for 10 
years. We are a very goal-oriented unit. Because of that, it's kind of hard to 
proceed knowing that you don't have a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Roger White said he was saddened by the unit's impending closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that what I will miss is the sense of belonging, the sense of 
camaraderie that you get as a squadron member," White said. "I've enjoyed being 
a member, in part, because I know that if my country ever needed me I would be 
able to contribute in a meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although never ordered into combat in its 24-year history, the unit was called 
up and deployed in 1990 when it served as a temporary fighter squadron aboard 
the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary goal of the unit is to provide "adversary" training for fleet 
fighter squadrons. The pilots of VFA-305 fly their Hornets in such a way as to 
simulate the aerial tactics of potential Russian or other Eastern European 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, which has 10 Hornets in its inventory, hosts "Lobo Flag," annual 
multi-service war games held over the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said the squadron's closure is set to take effect Dec. 31, but 
decommissioning ceremonies will be held before then.

 A bar brawl in Fillmore and a street fight in Oxnard early Saturday left two 
men with stab wounds, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Carlos Madrigal, 22, and a friend apparently got in an argument 
with three men inside the Santa Clara Cafe on Clay Street, Ventura County 
Sheriff's Lt. Mike Gullon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the fight started in the bar and moved out to the alley, where 
Madrigal was stabbed in the abdomen. He was taken to Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital for surgery and was in stable condition Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, police officers responded to a call of a fight involving several 
people near Isleton Way and K Street. The crowd dispersed when police arrived, 
but officers detained several men in an alley. One of them, Manuel Barriga, 18, 
had two stab wounds and was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center. He was 
treated and released two hours later, a nursing supervisor said. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; TEACHING ASSISTANTS FACE POSSIBLE LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teaching assistants at the Port Hueneme school district have been informed 
that they could be facing layoffs next year because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 School district administrators notified union representatives at a closed 
meeting on Thursday that the school board would consider a plan to lay off 11 
teaching assistants who work with disadvantaged children in three schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of layoffs is due to reductions in federal money that pays for 
extra teaching assistants and classroom materials in areas with a high 
percentage of families on welfare, said Jeffrey Baarstad, a district spokesman. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the increasing demand for funds in California, there is less money 
for area schools that qualify for the aid, Baarstad said. The Port Hueneme 
district had about $300,000 cut from its allotment, he said. The district's 
allotment is more than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs would eliminate the district's teaching assistants who are paid 
with the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts in the county receiving the federal money also have had 
to cope with reductions in funds, said Carol Krabill, president of the Hueneme 
chapter of the California Schools Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill noted that while both the Rio and Ocean View school districts have had 
cuts, neither has made layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of priorities," Krabill said. "They want to use the money for 
more supplies and revamp the program. They don't want to spend it on people."

<P>
 An elderly Ventura woman lost $1,900 after falling victim to two con artists 
offering to share a portion of their winning lottery ticket, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scheme familiar to law enforcement officials throughout the state, a man 
and woman approached the 69-year-old victim in the parking lot of a Camarillo 
shopping center on Thursday, asking her to help them cash a lottery ticket they 
claimed was worth $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman posed as the ticket holder while the man pretended to be a stranger 
approached randomly in the parking lot. Once the victim agreed to help cash the 
ticket, the couple persuaded her to withdraw money from her bank as a show of 
good faith before they split the lottery jackpot. All three then went to her 
bank, where the victim withdrew $1,900 in $100 bills. The woman then feigned an 
illness and asked the victim to buy medicine for her at a pharmacy. Just as she 
was entering the store, the victim realized she had left her money and purse 
with the man and woman. When she returned to the parking lot, they were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said investigators have no suspects, but are hoping 
to identify the con artists by surveillance photographs taken inside the 
victim's bank. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL MAY REQUEST GEOLOGICAL STUDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to resolve concerns about ground ruptures caused by the earthquake, the 
Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider asking state geologists to 
conduct an in-depth study of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the city would request a safety study from the mines and geology 
division of the California Department of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 State geologists have already made several brief trips to Simi Valley to 
examine fissures and liquefaction at the southeast end of the city, said Diane 
Davis-Crompton, director of the city's environmental service department. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction occurs when a high ground water table combines with fine grain 
soil, causing the ground to crack and sink. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the liquefaction zone follows the path of the Arroyo Simi, a 
usually dry river that curves through the south end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This request is another step in the process of putting things back to 
normal," Crompton said. "So far we've had very good assistance from the state, 
and we're asking for this in-depth study so we can get on with the rebuilding."

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Encino insurance company accused of selling auto insurance that did not 
protect car buyers as promised, has settled a civil lawsuit filed by the 
Ventura County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Western General Insurance Co. was accused of unfair business practices and of 
making false and misleading statements for allegedly selling extended car 
warranties that were not in force at the time of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed after an Oxnard auto dealer went out of business, 
leaving 90 of its customers with worthless extended warranties, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Rebecca Riley of the Consumer and Environmental Protection 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The warranties said buyers were covered by simply purchasing the warranties 
from the auto dealership, Riley said. But since the dealership did not have 
insurance of its own to guarantee the warranties, as required by law, the 
consumer was not protected unless the dealership paid premiums to the insurance 
company, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So often with these kinds of cases, if something like this is going on, you 
don't know until somebody complains about it," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting wrongdoing, Western General agreed to pay $125,000 to 
Ventura County, $30,000 in investigative costs to the district attorney's 
office, $10,000 to the state Consumer Protection Prosecution Trust Fund and to 
reinstate and reimburse those consumers who were cut off from coverage. BRENDA

<P>
 An early-morning fire in Oxnard on Saturday burned the offices of Western 
Farms Chemical Co., causing an estimated $125,000 in damages, Oxnard Fire 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which began about 4:30 a.m. in the company offices at 1015 W. 
Wooley Road, could have been arson, Battalion Chief Terry McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the fire started in the computer room," McAnally said, adding 
that the building may have been burglarized and then set on fire to cover up 
the crime. Western Farms sells fertilizers and pesticides to farmers, McAnally 
said, adding that no chemicals were involved in this fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy it didn't involve any pesticides," McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company offices were badly damaged but not destroyed, McAnally said. The 
fire caused an estimated $75,000 in damage to the structure and $50,000 to the 
contents of the offices. TRACY WILSON

OIL SPILL HALTED SHORT OF RIVER 
</P>

<P>
 Firefighters and a hazardous materials crew from the Ventura County Fire 
Department were able to stop 400 gallons of spilled crude oil from reaching the 
Santa Clara River near Fillmore late Saturday afternoon, a Ventura County Fire 
Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10,000-gallon oil tank owned by Mirada Petroleum overflowed about 3:15 p.m., 
sending a stream of black crude into a nearby drainage ditch, the spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil mixed with water in the ditch and flowed more than a mile toward the 
sensitive habitat along the Santa Clara River before firefighters could dam the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the state Department of Fish and Game, who were taking over 
responsibility for the cleanup late Saturday, expected that all the oil still 
in the ditch could be cleaned up with a vacuum truck by Sunday, the spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill, which was reported anonymously, is still under investigation. No 
damage to wildlife was reported as of late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach representatives of the petroleum company Saturday evening 
were unsuccessful.

HISTORY OF BLACKS IS CELEBRATED IN OXNARD; FESTIVAL: COLLEGE EVENT FEATURES 
AFRICAN AMERICAN FOOD, MUSIC, STORYTELLING, JEWELRY, BOOKS AND CLOTHING.

<P>
 Spirits were high at Oxnard College on Saturday, when about 50 people turned 
out to celebrate Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival featured music and storytelling, along with booths offering 
everything from barbecue and African cuisine to collections of African-American 
clothes, jewelry and books for sale by black-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a great book," said Art Mukunda as a young man picked up "Message to 
the Black Man" by Elijah Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 Mukunda owns Yaweh Books of Oxnard. He had set out some of his wares for the 
event, selling everything from African wood carvings and kofi skullcaps to 
flashy "Afro-centric" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said events like Saturday's are a chance for the small African American 
community in Ventura County to come together and learn more about their culture 
and history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people in this country don't understand their culture," he said. "They 
have to wait until they get to the university level to learn about their 
history. We need to gain understanding of ourselves and have others understand 
us as well. That's the way to avoid stereotyping and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event, the first of its kind at Oxnard College, was put on by the 
college's African American Student Union. Trecie Warren, president of the 
group, said the turnout was a disappointment, but that overall she was pleased 
with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just about the community coming out and celebrating black history," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brightly colored Senegalese dress, P.J. Zywiciel, a flight attendant who 
runs an African Imports store in Ventura, laid out such traditional African 
foods as spiced rice and a Kenyan lamb and turkey stew for all to sample.  
</P>
<P>
 Zywiciel also had a table filled with goods that she sells at her store, 
Precious Appeal, and a rack filled with African-made dashikis and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Senegalese fly-dress," she said, pointing out the flared design of 
her own dress. "It's meant to accentuate the movement of the hips. Senegalese 
woman are proud of the way they move, even when they're carrying something on 
their head." 
</P>
<P>
 As Zywiciel laid out her food, the Oxnard Community Choraliers belted out 
"Let's Go to Jordan" and other traditional gospel songs for the crowd. Choir 
director Sherry El-Hidmi said her group takes every opportunity it can to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outreach," she said. "It's a good feeling knowing that people are 
uplifted by the music. We're singing to ourselves as well, and it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Opiyo Odhiambo, a 26-year-old exchange student from Kenya studying computer 
science, sat back and listened to the music and took in the day's events. With 
a smile and accented English, Odhiambo said even after a year in America, he 
felt a clash between his traditional African upbringing and African American 
tales of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see racism in Kenya. I can't relate to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Odhiambo said he likes the United States but is still getting used to such 
things as raucous celebrations in black churches here and the independence of 
American women. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few things he was getting used to, though. When it came time to 
eat, Odhiambo went for the potato salad, beans and ribs slathered with barbecue 
sauce, instead of the traditional African fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good," he said.

LOWER TRANSIT FARES WOULD ATTRACT RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * When a mass transit system is built with tax dollars to serve a community, 
the cost of building the system should be written off immediately when the 
system is complete. It should not be considered in determining the fare 
schedule.The system serves the community best when it carries the maximum 
number of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of operating the system is essentially the same whether the system is 
operated full or empty. Therefore the fare should be adjusted to attract 
near-capacity ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 No mass transit system can compete with some of the advantages of the 
privately owned automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people will own an automobile whether they need it to commute to work or 
not. The cost of owning and operating an automobile has very little to do with 
the mass transit fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The system serves the community better when it carries 10 passengers at 10 
cents each than one passenger at $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking 10 people out of their cars serves the community much better from the 
standpoint of pollution abatement and traffic congestion.

BURBANK PRINCIPAL'S DEMOTION IS A TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The action of the Burbank Unified School District Board of Education to 
demote Principal Keiko Hentell (Valley Edition, Feb. 19) can only be described 
as appalling, shortsighted and surely vindictive. I have read and reread the 
article to find some basis, however trivial, for her removal. 
</P>
<P>
 I find instead words of praise from the only faculty member and the only 
community person quoted. Given the diverse ethnic composition of Burbank High 
School when Ms. Hentell was hired three years ago -- and "the absence of any 
direction from the board -- she moved forward vigorously to provide a safe, 
nurturing environment for the entire student body. 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Keiko Hentell for almost 20 years, working with her as English 
teachers, teaching advisers, and members of professional organizations. She has 
moved steadily toward a career as an administrator, demonstrating strong 
leadership skills and organizational abilities. She is an extremely competent 
leader: sensitive, well-organized, articulate and, yes, unwilling to settle for 
less than the best for her students. That is grounds for dismissal? 
</P>
<P>
 What a tragedy.

AN APOLOGY IS DUE FROM PAT NOLAN; FORMER GLENDALE ASSEMBLYMAN SHOWS NO 
CONTRITION OVER RACKETEERING CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unrepentant nature of Assemblyman Pat Nolan's recent resignation and 
guilty plea deserves further comment. Nolan (R-Glendale) pleaded guilty to one 
count of racketeering and was sentenced to two years in prison and nine months 
in a halfway house. He became the first Republican in the Assembly to be 
convicted as part of an eight-year FBI corruption investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six years, I have battled. I'm worn out, though I think I would have 
convinced a jury of my innocence," Nolan said. "I now have a great appreciation 
of what Chief Joseph (the defeated 19th-Century Nez Perce leader) felt when he 
said, 'I will fight no more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's it? Is that all that Pat Nolan has to say to us at this point? 
</P>
<P>
 It was Nolan, in 1985, who blocked the annual bill requiring lawyers to pay 
dues to the state bar. Those dues helped pay for legal aid to the poor and for 
information programs to help average folks find lawyers when they needed one. 
And there was Nolan in coast-to-coast fund-raisers last year, amassing 
$522,734, in part for his legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Nolan was among the legislators who attempted to pass a 
little-noticed amendment to a bill that would have made the records of the Fair 
Political Practices Commission confidential, thereby blocking public scrutiny 
of investigations of political malfeasance. The motive was clear: Nolan and 
others didn't want the public digging into the affairs of politicians and 
asking embarrassing questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Nolan tried to block an emergency quarter-cent state sales tax for 
earthquake relief for Northern Californians. At least he won't get the chance 
to try that with Northridge earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Nolan has admitted working with a former legislative aide to extort a 
$10,000 campaign contribution from the Marriott Corp. He has admitted accepting 
two $5,000 checks from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen in a sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 We would have preferred to hear different words from Nolan: an apology to his 
fellow legislators and to his constituents. We're still waiting.

MOST OVERCROWDED SCHOOL ALSO THE MOST DIVERSE; EDUCATION: BELMONT HIGH'S 
LOCATION IN WESTLAKE ATTRACTS IMMIGRANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. 'WE'RE LIKE THE 
ELLIS ISLAND OF LOS ANGELES,' TEACHER SAYS.

 At 12:40 p.m., the race begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of students bolt toward the school cafeteria, forming lines that 
snake around the rows of benches crammed in the busy lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The crush of teen-agers waiting anxiously for their meal come from all over 
the world: Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Korea, Mexico, the 
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Various languages ring through the room as 
students chat with friends and pick up trays of fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Belmont High School -- the Los Angeles Unified School District's most 
overcrowded school and also one of its most diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like the Ellis Island of Los Angeles," said Tony Feliz, the school's 
music director. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile west of Downtown near Beverly Boulevard and Loma Drive, Belmont 
has about 4,200 students -- making it the largest high school in California, as 
well as one of the largest secondary schools in the country. Compounding its 
problems, Belmont's 14.7-acre campus is the smallest for a high school in the 
Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding is just one of the obstacles students and staff confront daily. 
Because the surrounding Westlake neighborhood consistently attracts immigrants 
from around the world, the school has a steady and heavy flow of students 
hoping to enroll or planning to leave before completing the semester. Many do 
not live with either parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont students represent 50 countries and communicate in more than 30 
languages, and most speak English as a second language. Nearly three-fourths of 
the school's population meet poverty standards qualifying them for free or 
reduced-priced lunches. And the campus is also in one of the city's most 
violent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone, any one of those factors could prove overwhelming. Together, they mean 
unique challenges that Belmont's students, staff and faculty must find 
innovative ways to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we the largest school in California, but we're probably the 
largest immigrant entry port for students in California," said Augustine 
Herrera, who is in his first year as principal of Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of getting an education, there's a lot of pressure for students to 
earn a living and help their families survive. We have to make sure school is 
relevant to students and that they consider it a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said his staff is now establishing long-range goals for the school, 
which will address such problems as transiency and language differences. The 
school is also looking for new ways to relieve overcrowding, although it is 
already on a multitrack, year-round calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the multitrack plan, a third of the student body is always on vacation, 
leaving 2,800 students on campus at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three years, Herrera said, the school will change its curricula 
to cater to its large immigrant population. Although algebra, biology, health, 
world history and career planning classes already are taught in Spanish, the 
school may add more classes in that language to help students with limited 
English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont's new curricula will not be patterned after educational programs in 
suburban schools because its needs and strengths are different, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the school may create more programs such as the International Studies 
Academy, which began in 1989 and is designed for honor students interested in 
learning about different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we also need to be honest with students who come from other countries 
and are expected to complete all the course work in four years," Herrera said. 
"They need to be told when they come in as freshmen that it's probably going to 
take them more like five years to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont opened in 1923 with about 500 students. The main building was rebuilt 
in 1967, and construction on another major addition began in 1990 and is 
expected to be completed in June. The school's mostly white student population 
grew steadily during the 1930s and 1940s, but then its attendance started to 
dwindle in the 1950s. The school board considered closing the school, but 
ultimately decided not to. 
</P>
<P>
 About two decades after trustees made that crucial decision, large numbers of 
mostly Latino immigrants flocked to Pico-Union and Westlake to take advantage 
of affordable apartments, and the school began to grow. Today, about 85% of 
Belmont's students are Latino and 13% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the massive influx of immigrants, the school board is considering 
constructing another high school in the area. Although some residents and 
community groups are opposed to building a new school so close to an existing 
one, school officials say they must do something to relieve the overcrowding at 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,900 students who live within Belmont's attendance boundaries are bused 
to San Fernando Valley schools because of the overcrowding, while another 600 
students are attending other schools to take advantage of various voluntary 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Area students who normally are bused to El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills, which has been closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake, are not in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belmont should be the focal point of the community, but it's not," said Vicky 
Castro, a school board member whose district includes Belmont. "That's because 
(so many) kids living in the area are going to other schools. The lack of space 
prevents the school from having any magnet programs, so students have to go to 
other schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Belmont's multitrack calendar, students face long lunch lines and 
crowded classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as the teachers and staff try to make the best of the situation, you 
can't teach 50 students in one class," said Chris Van, who graduated from 
Belmont last year and is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Teachers gave me personal attention because I sought it out, but they 
couldn't give it to everyone because there were too many students in each 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior William Estrada said he was forced to come to school during his 
vacation because certain college preparatory classes were not offered on his 
track due to limited space. 
</P>
<P>
 Academically, Belmont lags behind other schools. Its average Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores are 378 in math and 299 on the verbal portion, compared to 
the district average of 432 math, 355 verbal, and the national average of 478 
math, 424 verbal. Its dropout rate, Herrera estimates, is between 25% and 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although large class sizes appear to hinder students academically, Assistant 
Principal Rosa Morley believes the school's low test scores are linked more to 
the fact that so many students speak English as a second language, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to have realistic expectations for our students," she said. "Even 
though their scores are lower, this does not prevent them from achieving. In 
time, they'll catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 History teacher John Lachner said teachers do their best, but have trouble 
juggling jobs as educators and surrogate parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many students live with relatives, or we get into the 'cousin' phenomenon, 
where students live with whoever they include in the broad definition of 
cousin," said Lachner, who also works in the school's attendance office. "This 
requires teachers to spend a lot of time nurturing their students because these 
kids are lost in the shuffle at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the school operates as if it has a revolving door also poses 
problems. Although no transiency rate figures are kept, Lachner said he had 
enrolled 20 new students that day and checked out almost as many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable. They come, they go, they go back to El Salvador, they come 
back," he said. "This requires a lot of flexibility on the part of teachers. 
It's impossible for teachers to set a schedule in July because classes change 
so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the students Lachner enrolled came from South Korea and spoke no 
English. They were sent to Feliz's music room after lunch to learn how to play 
the violin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens all the time," Feliz said. "But I use the same techniques that a 
teacher would use for students who can't hear. Everything has to be visual." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont is often considered an underdog when compared to schools in more 
affluent areas, but some students achieve despite the odds, and consider the 
school's diversity extremely beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first when I came to MIT, I felt inferior because a lot of people here 
went to big prep schools, and I came from an inner-city school," Van said. "But 
I found out that although the other students probably have more book knowledge 
than me, Belmont gave me a taste of the real world. The other students here 
aren't as open-minded as me because they haven't been exposed to as many 
different cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Through teamwork and perseverance, the school also has earned a name for 
itself in areas outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is particularly proud of its boys' and girls' cross-country teams, 
which respectively have won 11 and five City Section championships. There are 
few individual stars on either team, but Belmont consistently wins the team 
event because so many of its runners place near the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run together because we want to make the team look good," said senior 
Yolanda Gomez, who is one of the best runners on the girls' team. "We're like a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the team's success, few parents watch their children run, 
reflecting the school's general lack of parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents are busy with jobs that don't allow them to take time off," said 
cross-country coach Alex Carmona. "A lot of our parents, especially parents of 
girls, don't know what cross-country is. They're concerned about their kids 
getting home late, so I often call them and try to convince them that allowing 
their children to run is worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 When the school holds a community meeting, usually fewer than 100 parents show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 When Feliz arrived at Belmont 11 years ago, the band had 20 members. Today, 
the school's 95-member band and flag corps are major contenders in various 
competitions. Last year, the flag corps took first place in the Southern 
California competition, while the drum line won the same event a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We compete with schools with tremendous programs," Feliz said. "Our kids were 
flabbergasted when they went to compete and saw parents of other kids grooming 
uniforms and polishing shoes. But we've developed the confidence that winning 
is not out of our reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Feliz said he once thought about leaving Belmont because there wasn't enough 
support for the music program. Students still have to share instruments, and 
Feliz is given only $300 a year to purchase new instruments and music. He once 
bought wooden sticks at Builders Emporium because he couldn't afford to buy 
real drumsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy at another school asked me to take over his program," he said. "He 
said, 'Tony, get out of there. There's nothing you can do for those kids. 
They're not going to support a band over there.' After that, I decided to stay 
because it made me really mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feliz has grown attached to the school, his job is never easy. Last 
fall -- two weeks before the band was about to enter a regional competition -- 
someone broke into the school and stole $25,000 worth of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was devastating," Feliz said. "But some of the kids wanted to perform 
without instruments. They just wanted to march." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school managed to replace the instruments with money from its 
general fund, crime remains a constant threat to everyone at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is in the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division, which 
last year reported 119 homicides, 109 rapes, 3,749 robberies and 3,968 
aggravated assaults.

CAL LUTHERAN MAKES IT LOOK EASY THIS TIME, 83-62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 No one, including Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap could have expected it. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 46 seconds left in Saturday night's Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball playoff game between the 
Kingsmen and Pomona-Pitzer, Dunlap had the luxury of emptying his bench as Cal 
Lutheran was on its way to an 83-62 victory at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for the Kingsmen (24-2) and guaranteed 
them a third consecutive appearance in the NCAA Division III playoffs, which 
start this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer (19-7), which tied Cal Lutheran for the SCIAC title during the 
regular season and beat the Kingsmen, 85-76, in overtime Feb. 16, has to hope 
for an at-large berth when the Division III playoff pairings are announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense did a great job tonight," Dunlap said. "Our offense hit a few dry 
spells, but they were not able to capitalize when we did and that's because the 
Cal Lu defense did its job." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer hit 29 of 51 shots in its victory over the Kingsmen, but made 
only 19 of 55 this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal Lutheran shot a ho-hum 44.8% (30 of 67), that was a dramatic 
improvement over the last game between these teams, when the Kingsmen made only 
36.0% (27 of 75) of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 46-37, early in the second half, Cal Lutheran went on an 8-0 surge to 
take a 54-37 lead with 12:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer scored five consecutive points to narrow its deficit to 54-42 
with 11 1/2 minutes remaining, but Jason Smith hit two three-point shots and 
Dave Ulloa sank a short jump shot from the left side on an assist from Damon 
Ridley to give Cal Lutheran a 62-42 lead with 9:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason Smith is starting to play like he did earlier in the season and that's 
a big plus for this team," Dunlap said. "He's still only at about 90%, but 
that's better than a lot of players at 100." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-5 freshman from Australia who missed the first seven games of SCIAC 
play with a bone chip on his left knee -- an injury that will require surgery 
after the season -- had 12 points, four rebounds, an assist and a steal in 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley had 19 points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals for the 
Kingsmen while Rupert Sapwell added 13 points, nine rebounds and two blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Greer had 13 points and 12 rebounds for Pomona-Pitzer.

BRIZUELA PAIR VICTORIOUS IN CITY FINALS; HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING: BROTHERS FROM 
MONROE HIGH EACH CAPTURE THEIR WEIGHT CLASS; BELL WINS TEAM TITLE AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the second straight year, a brother tandem asserted themselves at the City 
Section wrestling championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, junior twins Fernando and Armando Avila won titles for Chatsworth 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the brothers were at Bell High, but only Fernando Avila successfully 
defended his title. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's Jose Brizuela (40-1) defeated Armando Avila (24-3), 6-3, in the 
140-pound final. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Brizuela's younger brother, Alfonso Brizuela (35-3), defeated Josh 
Ramon of El Camino Real to win the 119-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we've been working on for the past year," Alfonso Brizuela 
said. "Since last year, when Jose lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Brizuela, a senior, lost to Armando Avila in the semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, the Central League champion, won five individual titles and won the team 
title with 185 1/2 points for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real, the Valley League champion, finished second with 163 points 
and won three individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores gained most of their points at the lower weights. Andy 
Becker (27-9) was the 103-pound champion, beating George Shabazz of Canoga Park 
on a technical fall in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual match, El Camino Real's Casey Lee (119) won his final when he 
was unable to continue after injuring his shoulder. The injury occurred on a 
potentially dangerous move by Charles Zabala of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Ullman (152 pounds) was the third Conquistadore wrestler to win a title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did as well as could have done," Ullman said. "Everyone did their best but 
Bell was a real strong team." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell and El Camino Real led all schools by qualifying seven wrestlers for the 
finals, and the Conquistadores defeated Bell in two of three head-to-head 
finals matchups, but Bell's lead was just too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell clinched the team title when Frank Ordorica won by decision over San 
Fernando's Rene Vasquez, 10-3, at 171 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell won the final three weight divisions and 189-pound Jesus Orozco (30-2) 
was named the outstanding wrestler of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe and Canoga Park won two titles each. The Hunters finished third in the 
team standings with 107 points. 
</P>
<P>
 At 130 pounds, Canoga Park's Jose Barahuna (27-1), a defending City champion, 
completed an impressive day by pinning Amade Nyirak (18-12) of Monroe, a 
surprise finalist, in 21 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadi Jubrail won the second championship for the Hunters, beating Hugo Jordan 
of El Camino Real at 160 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando didn't win any individual titles but gained enough points in the 
preliminary rounds to finish fourth with 101 points. Monroe was fifth with 84 
1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Avila defeated Eduardo Nochez of El Camino Real, 15-8, at 135 pounds. 
The Chancellors finished sixth with 69 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner in each weight class will advance to the State championships in 
Stockton this week.

VENTURA WINS DESPITE HAVING GUARDS DOWN; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FOUL TROUBLE 
HAMPERS BACKCOURT, BUT FORWARDS STEP UP IN 92-78 REGIONAL WIN OVER HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even with its starting guards on the bench most of the second half because of 
foul trouble, the Ventura College men's basketball team is still too much to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates again showed they are a complete team with a 92-78 victory over 
Harbor in a first-round game of the Southern California regional Saturday night 
before 3,300 at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (32-2), seeded No. 1 in the regional, will advance to a second-round 
game Wednesday at home against Rancho Santiago, a 91-89 winner over Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 With point guard Joey Ramirez and backcourt partner D'Mitri Rideout both 
slapped with their fourth fouls early in the second half, the Pirates gave the 
whip to center Michael Tate and forward Brandon Jessie. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sophomores didn't disappoint, combining for 49 points and 33 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie scored a team-high 25 points and led all rebounders with 19. Tate added 
24 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate was especially impressive in the second half with three dunks and two of 
his four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole game plan was to keep them off the boards and not give them a 
second chance," Tate said. "I felt that I had to step up and do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, who along with Tate is one of the better leapers in junior college 
basketball, thrilled the crowd with four dunks of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 One in particular -- a one-handed jam after following his own missed 15-foot 
jumper -- rocked the gym and gave Ventura a 58-51 edge with 13 minutes 46 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their size and our (missed) free throws hurt us," Harbor Coach Carl Strong 
said. "We don't have the physical guys like Tate and Jessie." 
</P>
<P>
 And the few the Seahawks (13-17) have got into foul trouble and were not a 
factor offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Eric Wright, for instance, scored only eight points and fouled out in 
the second half. The 6-foot-4 freshman averaged 19.6 points in South Coast 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only guy we have who can legitimately score inside," Strong said. 
"It hurt us when he got in foul trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 With Wright neutralized, Harbor was forced to find an alternative and found 
one in guard Codi Evans, who drove effectively to the hoop and connected on 
several jumpers to finish with a game-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez bounced back after re-entering the game with about six minutes 
remaining and finished with 17 points.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / PAIGE A. LEECH: AREA TEAMS MAKE MASS PLAYOFF EXIT

 Sportswriters. . . . what do they know? 
</P>
<P>
 Every Monday, a group of Times' sportswriters sits around a table and picks 
the area's top 10 teams in the current boys' major sport. There have been 
plenty of heated discussions over the years -- even vicious name calling -- 
about the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 But, a week from Monday, when the basketball season is complete, we're going 
to be hard-pressed to come up with the area's final top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because every team in our most recent top 10 has been eliminated from the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, five of those teams lost their first playoff game and two others 
lost their second. 
</P>
<P>
 Brutal postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in defense of the writers, it's not as if we couldn't tell the good teams 
from the bad. We just failed to distinguish the bad from the horrible and the 
losers from the chokers (and believe me, there were plenty of good teams that 
choked). 
</P>
<P>
 The region's deficiency of strong basketball teams, however, is not solely 
limited to those in our top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Valley edition covers nearly 70 high school boys' basketball teams 
from Channel Islands to Glendale and from Lancaster to Sherman Oaks. 
Forty-three teams from this region (33 Southern Section and 10 City Section) 
made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three, Crescenta Valley, Santa Clara and Campbell Hall, are still 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 How can a region so rich in football and baseball talent be so poor in 
basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches, like North Hollywood's Steve Miller, say Valley teams are weak 
because there aren't enough solid teams in the area to sustain a decent 
competitive schedule to stay sharp for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's some really good coaching and some really good players here, 
but not necessarily enough good players," Miller said. "Not enough teams game 
in and game out. And you have no control over that." 
</P>
<P>
 Among City Section teams, it comes down to two differences between area City 
teams and non-Valley City teams, Miller said. It's the style of play and 
numbers of talented athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition in the City is much better than the Valley," Miller said. 
"Look at the styles. The City is pressure, pressure, pressure. How many teams 
play like that in the Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a completely different style of ball. The style and the talent is very 
hard to simulate." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also maintains that the lack of good youth basketball programs is 
taking its toll. Grant Coach Howie Levine concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of kids playing five-on-five outside," Levine said. "But, you 
don't learn the game that way. It's really not team-oriented. No one plays 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine was not at all surprised by the poor showing of area teams in the 
playoffs. "I knew that the Valley was down right away." 
</P>
<P>
 And the natural disaster made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake threw us off a little like a lot of schools," Levine said. "I 
think Hart definitely lost their momentum, playing away from their school and 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, fans, don't despair. There is a cure for a poor basketball season: 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Play ball!  
</P>

 City blues: The weakness of City basketball in the region was apparent in the 
postseason. Ten of the region's 18 City teams made the playoffs. Seven lost in 
the first round, including North Hollywood and Chatsworth, the Times' No. 2- 
and No. 1-ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, ranked No. 5, Cleveland and San Fernando each advanced past the first 
round but lost in the quarterfinals Friday. And each had the opportunity to win 
in the final seconds but could not convert. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Reseda, Cleveland and San Fernando were merely keeping with the 
natural order of basketball blues in the Valley. Or, perhaps it's something 
else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mind-set that City teams have. City teams don't like to lose to a 
Valley team," said Miller, who coached Fairfax to two City titles before taking 
over at North Hollywood. "It's an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transcending gender lines: The poor showing among area City teams is not 
limited to boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of 10 Valley area girls' City teams lost in the first round. Only Taft 
and Sylmar advanced to the quarterfinals. But, as fate would have it, the two 
teams met in a 3-A quarterfinal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft won, 49-37, and now the Toreadors represent the only area City basketball 
team -- boys or girls -- left in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be sure to tell them that on Monday," Taft Coach Mark Drucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 False alarm: Senior forward Jason Hartman was flabbergasted after being told 
by a Thousand Oaks High official Thursday that he had been selected to play in 
the McDonald's All-American all-star game on Easter. "This is too good to be 
true," he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out he was right. The McDonald's official had called the school to 
inform Hartman he had been one of 10 finalists from California, not that he had 
been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school kind of goofed up," said Dean Hartman, Jason's father. "That's the 
way it looks to me."

FLORIDA TURNS NORTHRIDGE INTO GATOR-BAIT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: HOST TEAM HAS ALL 
THE FUN IN SUN BY BATTERING MATADORS WITH 19 HITS, 14-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Co-eds in the stands wore skimpy attire. Everyone else was in shirt sleeves. 
The weather was in the high 70s and had been all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the pinkish tint on the faces of the Cal State Northridge baseball players 
had nothing to do with the fact that central Florida has been blessed with 
prime sunning weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Only their hides were tanned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was embarrassing," outfielder Kevin Howard said. "Very embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida racked up season highs in hits and runs Saturday to roll over 
Northridge, 14-2, before 2,230 in the second day of round-robin play in the 
Florida Gator Slug-Fest. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (4-8) has lost five games in a row for the first time in Coach Bill 
Kernen's six-year tenure, and more trouble looms. In the final day of 
tournament play today, the Matadors will face 16th-ranked Ohio State in a 
doubleheader. The Buckeyes already have beaten 22nd-ranked Florida and 
sixth-ranked Oklahoma State in the Slug-Fest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got blasted by a better team," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida (10-2) blasted off, all right. The Gators banged out 19 hits in eight 
innings, seven for extra bases. Northridge starter Keven Kempton (0-3) didn't 
last three innings, partly because of shaky defense and largely because he 
served up a pair of two-run homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 2 2/3 innings, Kempton, a senior right-hander who won 10 games last year, 
gave up nine hits and eight runs, three earned. He has given up 22 earned runs 
in 25 2/3 innings over four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a group effort, however. Northridge made three errors -- leading to 
seven unearned runs -- and added a handful of other blunders (three hit batters 
and four wild pitches) for bad measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida left-hander John Kaufman (3-0) avoided trouble over the first four 
innings, and by then, his mates supplied him with him an 8-0 lead. In the 
fifth, Howard doubled home Josh Smaler and Keyaan Cook to pare the lead to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard snapped Kaufman's string of consecutive zeros at 21 2/3 innings, which 
is even more impressive in light of the fact that Kaufman, who gave up five 
hits and struck out eight over six innings, is a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, Florida (10-2) banged out five consecutive hits off sophomore 
reliever Evan Howland, including a 410-foot home run to dead center by Brian 
Duva, his second of the game. Howland, in fact, gave up the cycle in the inning 
as Florida scored four times to take a 12-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the boisterous crowd was breathing down the Matadors' collective 
neck. Northridge strikeout victims were serenaded, step by step, as they 
trudged back to the dugout. Third baseman Tyler Nelson, who committed two 
errors to give him a team-high nine this season, was razzed when he finally 
made a routine play. 
</P>
<P>
 The public-address system piped in sarcastic tunes during Matador pitching 
changes. The scoreboard flashed E-R-R-O-R in six-foot letters. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Northridge had its nose rubbed in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good," Kernen said. "That's why we're in this thing, to see what it's 
like to play in front of a crowd like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for this team to grow up. We're not ready to handle this level of 
competition in this type of environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate things are going lately, every pitcher the Matadors have faced looks 
like a world-beater. Northridge has scored 12 runs in its past five games and 
has more than six hits in only one.

A FAIRY-TALE VICTORY FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY; BOYS' BASKETBALL: AT-LARGE TEAM

<P>
 It's so cliche: An at-large team with no returning starters advances to the 
championship game of the Southern Section's top division. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, no one say Cinderella. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, what the heck. If the shoe fits . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High beat Santa Ana Valley, 69-67, in a Division I-AA 
semifinal game Saturday night before a raucous crowd of about 1,200 at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really wanted this one bad," senior Richard O'Neill said. "We wanted it 
for ourselves we wanted it for Coach. This is the best feeling I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great. I love this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (19-9) will face Long Beach Poly (24-6) next Saturday in the 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley, which finished fourth in the Pacific League, got to the 
championship game with a nearly flawless game. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley outrebounded Santa Ana Valley, 36-11. Six-foot-nine junior 
Blake Jacobson led the way with 13 rebounds despite being called for his third 
foul early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley scored almost at will. O'Neill scored 27 points, Brock 
Jacobsen had 20 and Jacobson added 18. Crescenta Valley made 15 of 17 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard did what he has done all year," said tearful Crescenta Valley Coach 
John Goffredo. "Brock, ever since his wrist has healed, has shot that way. And 
Blake was dominating inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley led by as many as 13 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Santa Ana Valley (26-4), co-champion of the Century League, 
hinged its comeback hopes on sophomore Olujimi Mann, one of the top point 
guards in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann scored 27 points, making seven of 12 three-pointers, and helped his team 
pull to within 65-62 with 2 minutes 5 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crescenta Valley, which has not been to the final in Goffredo's 16 seasons 
as coach, held on when O'Neill sank two free throws with 38 seconds to play and 
Jacobsen made a layup seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole team played great," Jacobsen said. "Everyone just stepped up and we 
are going to the finals. It's unbelievable. It's a Cinderella story." 
</P>
<P>
 Afraid he would say that.

5 AREA WRESTLERS QUALIFY FOR STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS

 Five area wrestlers advanced to this week's State finals in Stockton by 
placing among the top eight finishers in the Southern Section Masters 
competition Saturday at Fountain Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 James Castaneda of Alemany and Tim Bonebright of Thousand Oaks placed second 
in their weight divisions, Agoura's Chad Payne and Rio Mesa's Tom Nelford 
finished third and heavyweight Sean Burdick of Ventura was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda, wrestling at 112 pounds, advanced to the championship match, but 
lost to Rosemead's Tim Kawamura, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebright (140 pounds) scored a late takedown in the semifinals to advance to 
the championship round, but also lost. "I wrestled terribly all day and I still 
got second, so I guess that's OK," Bonebright said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 125, Payne lost his first match before winning three in a row to take 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford (152) won two matches, then dropped a semifinal match, 8-5, to Long 
Beach Poly's James Rudolph. Nelford then rebounded to win his last two. DAN

HOT PROPERTY: RACER'S RECIPE FOR REMODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Legendary racing guru CARROLL SHELBY, the Texas chili master and car builder, 
and his wife, Lena, are nearing completion on a major rehab of a Bel-Air home 
they bought last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby, 71, had leased the house for a dozen years before its previous owner 
decided to sell. "Our actual residence is in Texas, but we spend time in 
California, because I had my heart transplant out here," he said. He had two 
heart bypasses before his transplant in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A Le Mans winner who also raced Formula One cars, Shelby came to California in 
1960 to open the country's first race-car driving school. Later, he built the 
Cobra, the most famous performance automobile in American motoring's 100-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his transplant, he designed and built a race car for amateurs and got 
married for the fourth time. He sold his chili company but holds chili 
cook-offs for charity through his International Chili Society, and he is 
assembling a limited number of Cobras at his Gardena plant amid controversy 
over whether or not the parts are original or newly made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sell these 427 Cobras and donate a large part of the money I get for them 
to my Heart Fund," Shelby said. His Heart Fund, based in West Los Angeles with 
a branch that just opened in England, benefits indigent children with cardiac 
problems requiring surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby's Bel-Air house was built in the 1960s to have four bedrooms in about 
2,600 square feet. Shelby is updating the home and adding 1,200 square feet, 
including a maid's quarters and 35-foot-long gallery. An old church pew will be 
used as a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted a tailored but rustic, cowboy chic look," said architect Robert 
Anderson of Hancock Park. "We're bringing over some old but wonderful wooden 
pieces from a barn on their ranch in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Their Bel-Air house -- which has what Lena Shelby describes as "fabulous city 
and mountain views" -- was purchased for $850,000, records show. Another 
$300,000 is being spent on refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN CLARK, who played Jim Stolpa's mother in the January CBS movie 
"Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story," and Clark's husband, gridiron 
star-turned-actor ALEX KARRAS, have listed their Lake Arrowhead home again. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which had been for sale in 1991 at $795,000, is now priced at 
$699,000 with Vee Ward at Century 21 High Country in Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1953, the house was being remodeled in 1991 when it was first put on 
the market. The 2,800-square-foot home has four bedrooms, including a master 
suite with its own deck, two walk-in closets, a river-rock fireplace and spa 
tub. The house is a short walk to the lake.

 Karras, one of the greatest players in Detroit Lion history, who later starred 
with Clark in "Babe" (the Babe Didrikson Zaharias story) and the 1980s sitcom 
"Webster," had planned to use the Arrowhead home as a getaway, but he 
discovered soon after buying the property that he's allergic to the pines. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Clark recently completed building a weekend home in Malibu and maintain 
their longtime residence off of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The former home of THOMAS SPIEGEL, the deposed thrift executive charged with 
looting millions of dollars from failed Columbia Savings & Loan in Beverly 
Hills, has been sold for nearly its last asking price of $4.1 million to a 
businessman from Hong Kong, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was on the market in 1991, when Spiegel still owned it, at $9.8 
million. It was taken over by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency 
charged with disposing of failed thrifts' assets. Spiegel defaulted on his 
mortgage last May and moved from the house Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a sealed-bid process, the RTC received 15 offers on the 
11,000-square-foot home, built about eight years ago. The gated estate has six 
bedrooms, including two staff quarters; a guest house with two baths; a tennis 
court and three-car garage, with space for a limo. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Vara and Brad Kimball shared the listing. Both are with Fred Sands' 
Brentwood office. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion photographer TODD SMITH and his wife, author MELANIE KIRSCH, who wrote 
such books as "How to Get Off the Fast Track and Live the Life that Money Can't 
Buy," have sold their Hollywood Hills home and bought a farm in Rhinelander, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple left town two years ago but rented out their three-bedroom 
Hollywood home until selling it for nearly their last asking price of $499,000. 
The southwestern-style house -- which Smith built with a circular, two-story 
living room -- was priced at $729,000 six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers were identified as producer David Salzberg and his wife, Karen Kim, 
a Raiders cheerleader. Tony Shultz of Fred Sands, Hollywood Hills, had the 
listing, and Tom O'Rourke of Jon Douglas Co., Sunset Strip, represented the 
buyers.

'ALL SHAKEN UP AND READY TO MOVE?'; OUT-OF-STATE REALTY ADS TARGET SOUTHLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; O'Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance 
writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quake-rattled Los Angeles residents who are considering a move away from the 
Southland have found plenty of options in the classifieds these days, as 
hundreds of real estate advertisements beckon them with the lure of solid 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nashville, Tennessee: No fault! All shaken up and ready to move?" began one 
home-sale ad in a local newspaper. "Missouri: Earthquake free!" boasted 
another. And an ad out of New Mexico opened with the question: "When is enough 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Classified ads like these for out-of-state homes have soared to record levels 
at large and small publications throughout Los Angeles in the weeks following 
the 6.8 magnitude earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Sandy Walsh, The Times' assistant division manager for 
national classifieds. "Almost the day after the quake we were inundated with 
calls and faxes. . . . It just went wild. We've had an all-time high in ads 
within the last three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of out-of-state ads published in The Times more than tripled on the 
first Sunday after the quake to almost 700. The paper published an average of 
nearly 1,800 ads after that, with the highest count at more than 1,850. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who placed the ads wanted to include earthquake wording, but 
Times' advertising policy does not permit negative references to this area. 
Still, Walsh said, faraway customers continued to swamp the paper's phone and 
fax lines with classified ad requests, and not just for the real estate 
columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot more businesses and farms for sale," Walsh said. "Even our 
help wanted ads have increased." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Daily News, long-distance property ads climbed 
significantly after Jan. 17. "The number of classified ads placed in the 
out-of-state and out-of-area categories . . . doubled during the weeks 
following the earthquake," said Lynne T. Jewell, spokesperson for the San 
Fernando Valley-based daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 And ads at the LA Village View have expanded the weekly tabloid's out-of-state 
property section from about a page before the quake to as many as 2 1/2 pages 
in its most recent editions, said publisher James Sogg. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly are thinking that it's a good time for them to advertise 
property," Sogg said of the brokers and homeowners placing the ads. "Their 
perception is that people are eager to move out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to tell whether that will happen, said those familiar with the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had about a 60% to 70% increase in outgoing referrals and many are 
homeowners who have serious damage," said Kendall Rojas, vice president and 
director of relocation for Fred Sands Realtors. "The interesting thing is, this 
always happens after an earthquake and a majority of them never make the move." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Howe, director of relocation services for Jon Douglas Co., agreed: 
"Certainly the pace has picked up, but I don't know how serious a lot of these 
people are. It may just be an initial reaction to the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe said since the quake, she too has received calls from a number of hopeful 
out-of-state property sellers who are convinced that Angelenos are poised to 
flee the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did get a call from a guy yesterday from Winnsboro, S.C., who sells 
plantations," Howe said. "He was just convinced one of our clients wanted to 
come to South Carolina and buy a plantation." 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Barrington, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Nashville, is 
among those who've placed earthquake-specific ads in L.A.-area publications. 
Barrington specializes in wooing California buyers to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 So far she's received between 15 and 20 inquiries compared to one or two 
before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the prospective buyers who've responded have told her they're tired of 
the city and its recent spate of bad luck including the riots, the fires and 
the earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking questions about home prices, the four seasons that we have 
here and if any other Californians are thinking of moving here, which they 
are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrington, who left Los Angeles in 1992 after living here for four years, 
said she empathizes with the callers. "The last three months I was in L.A. 
there were several earthquakes that really scared me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But those considering a hasty exit from California should be forewarned: There 
are hundreds of faults outside the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the greatest earthquakes ever recorded in the continental U.S. 
happened on the New Madrid fault, which extends 120 miles from Arkansas, 
northeast through Missouri to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Dec. 16, 1811, and Feb. 7, 1812, four great earthquakes measuring 
greater than 8 in intensity ravaged the region. The temblors were so powerful 
they changed the Mississippi River's path, formed lakes and rang church bells 
as far away as Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the likelihood of more huge quakes happening on the New Madrid fault 
in the next few centuries is considered small, a moderate, yet potentially 
damaging temblor is quite possible, said Margaret Hopper, a geophysicist with 
the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Hopper said, because many buildings outside California aren't built to 
withstand even a moderate shaker and because of differences in the way the soil 
east of the Rockies transmits vibrations, moderate earthquakes outside 
California carry a greater potential for devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to move to that area, not only should you consider your own house 
but you should think of what the community is going to be like after an 
earthquake," Hopper said. "What about the schools my child goes to? What about 
the hospitals and fire departments? Will they be able to function afterward?" 
</P>
<P>
 But 76-year-old Floyd Melugin, a Missouri native whose 100 acres of Ozark hill 
property is described in L.A. area ads as "out of earthquake country," said he 
doesn't consider the New Madrid a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here all my life and I never heard of (earthquakes) close to this 
area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melugin and other sellers are running ads in even the smaller, more localized 
Los Angeles-area newspapers that usually have very few out-of-state ads. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Leader Newspapers, which publishes the Burbank and Foothill Leaders and 
the Glendale News Press, out-of-state home ads have skyrocketed, said Leslie 
Stiger, the classified supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're such a small newspaper, we usually have one or two of these ads, now we 
have 14," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "earthquake safe" language is also starting to turn up in the local home 
sale and rental columns, said Debbie Scott, real estate account executive with 
the Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how many people whose buildings survived the quake are now 
saying that (in ads)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the amount of bedrock under a house may for now have more appeal 
than the number of its bedrooms, there are already signs that the 6.8 quake 
won't scare many residents away nor will it slow the influx of new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this one client who called from out of state," said Rose Gonzalez, 
classified manager for the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper. "He was trying to 
sell his out-of-state property to come back to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, of Douglas' relocation office, said her department's phone lines are as 
busy as ever with calls from prospective L.A. residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an incredibly resilient marketplace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My relocation coordinator has been on the phone all day counseling people who 
are relocating to L.A. We can't keep these people out. They're like, 'What 
earthquake?' "

HOW CAN I FIND OUT WHAT MY HOUSE IS WORTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traditionally, people turn to two methods to determine the value of their 
homes: appraisals and something called a comparative-market analysis. 
Appraisals vary in cost depending on the price of the home, but average about 
$300 for a $250,000 house.Appraisers review numerous factors including recent 
sales of similar properties, location, square footage and construction quality. 
</P>
<P>
 An appraisal is a professional "estimate of a property's monetary value on the 
open market; an estimate of a property's type and condition, its utility for a 
given purpose or its highest and best use," according to Charles O. Stapleton 
III, Thomas Moran and Martha R. Williams, authors of "California Real Estate 
Principles," 3rd Edition (Dearborn Financial Pub lishing Inc., Chicago, 1994) . 
</P>
<P>
 Comparative-market analysis is an informal estimate of market value performed 
by a real estate agent or broker. It is based on like sales and offers a range 
of values including probable market value. Agents will provide an analysis at 
no charge in hopes of getting a home listing.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOT WATER ON DEMAND SYSTEM SAVES ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering 
consultant.

 QUESTION: I let the water run for over a minute just to get hot water from one 
of the bathroom faucets. This wastes my time and a lot of water down the drain. 
Is there any do-it-yourself gadget to get hot water faster? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: In the typical U.S. home, more than 9,000 gallons of water are wasted 
down the drain each year waiting for hot water. In addition to wasting water 
and your time in the morning, it causes an indirect energy loss that pushes up 
your gas and electric bills too. 
</P>
<P>
 The energy loss can be as high as 15% of your annual water heating costs. In 
the winter, all the room temperature water that runs down the drain is replaced 
by cold incoming water from the city main. Your furnace and water heater must 
run longer just to warm that extra 9,000 gallons of cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest and most efficient instant hot water system uses a demand triggered 
design. It is ideal for an existing home and you can easily install it yourself 
in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This simple hot water demand system uses a tiny high volume pump located under 
the bathroom sink farthest from the water heater. This pump and a solenoid 
valve connect the hot and cold water lines under the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 When you want hot water, turn any hot water faucet on and off quickly. This 
triggers the pump to start running. It rapidly draws water from the hot water 
pipe under the sink and diverts through the solenoid valve back to the water 
heater via the cold water inlet line-all through existing plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, the hot water reaches the sink. As soon as a sensor detects 
the hot water at the sink line, the pump shuts off and you turn on the hot 
water faucet. Any faucet you turn on triggers the pump to start. If you mount 
this pump under the sink farthest from the water heater, you will have instant 
hot water at all your faucets. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option, installing a special continuous hot water circulation pump, 
requires adding a return pipe from the sink to the water heater. This is 
simplest in new construction, but you can also add it in an existing home. You 
can run the return water pipes from floor to floor through closets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this wastes some energy by continuously circulating hot water in the 
pipes, you can minimize this loss by insulating the pipes. Installing a 
circulation pump with a 24-hour timer also reduces losses. You can set it to 
run only during the times of the day when you use hot water the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing an inexpensive 115-volt electric tankless water heater under the 
sink also provides instant hot water. The plumbing hookup is very simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 733 listing manufacturers of hot water 
demand systems, continuous circulation pump/timer and electric tankless water 
heaters, prices, specifications and a chart showing daily hot water needs. 
Please include $2 handling fee -- cash or check. Send your requests to James 
Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Can 
Electric Meter Give Wrong Reading? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last summer, with no lights on and the refrigerator not running, I noticed 
that the wheel in my electric meter was still spinning pretty fast. Could the 
meter be bad and recording too much usage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although it is possible that the electric meter is wrong, it is unlikely. A 
modern home uses electricity even when nothing is turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 The refrigerator could be in the auto-defrost mode, which consumes much 
electricity.

 TARNISHED HALO? Angels pitcher Mark Langston says he has a feeling the club 
may put it all together this season. But did he read the Sporting News 
magazine's baseball preview? It picks the Angels dead last in the newly created 
American League West division. And with this kicker: "Youth movement gets old." 
The Angels' weakness, says the magazine: "The lineup consists almost entirely 
of youngsters who are learning on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 DATE WITH AN ANGEL: Here are some dates to pencil onto the calendar if you're 
an Angels fan: March 4, April 5, April 11 and Oct. 4. The first -- this Friday 
-- is when the Angels open their exhibition season at the Colorado Rockies, in 
Tempe, Ariz. April 5 is their first game of the 1994 season, against the Twins 
in Minnesota. And April 11 -- a Monday afternoon -- is the home opener at 
Anaheim Stadium. . . . And Oct. 4? If Langston's right, the Angels begin the 
playoffs then. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW TRADITION? There are 24 title insurance companies working in Orange 
County, but only three of them have women in roles as high as vice president, 
says Joanette Graves. Maybe the others should take note: On March 10, Graves, a 
vice president at Old Republic Title Co. in Santa Ana, will receive the Society 
for Advancement of Management's 1994 Manager of the Year Award for Orange 
County. . . . "Maybe for some old habits are hard to break," Graves says. 
"Fortunately, our company judges you by your talent." 
</P>
<P>
 T-SHIRT COMPROMISE: Remember those company T-shirts at Virgin Megastore at 
Costa Mesa's Triangle Square, which erroneously said the store was in Newport 
Beach? Store managers have come up with a compromise: The store's 45 employees 
now wear and sell shirts that admit they're in Costa Mesa. But they also still 
sell the Newport Beach ones. . . . Explains President Ian Duffell: "A lot of 
people want to buy Newport Beach T-shirts; the locals would rather buy Costa 
Mesa ones. So we have both."

 AIR BURBANK: From year to year, life doesn't change much at Burbank Airport. 
In fact, the air traffic -- air carrier, air taxi, general aviation and 
military -- hardly varied at all from 1992 to '93. . . . Overall, takeoffs and 
landings, above, went down about 2,600 flights. (B2) 
</P>
<P>
 TURF WAR: Like the drug dealers she opposes, a self-proclaimed one-woman crime 
fighter in Van Nuys is trying to protect her territory. (B1) . . . She claims a 
Neighborhood Watch group has invaded her turf and says its efforts to scare 
away prostitutes and their customers by videotaping them are ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY FEUDS: If you think bank robberies or murders are the most dangerous 
calls police officers face, guess again. An angry, and armed, husband and wife, 
or father and son can be much more deadly. (B1) . . . A recent FBI report said 
that domestic disturbance calls, such as the one that slain Officer Christy 
Lynne Hamilton answered in Northridge last week, account "for more line-of-duty 
deaths than any other circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 NAME GAME: Residents of Lake Los Angeles voted in November to change the 
community's name to Desert Buttes, largely because the town no longer has a 
lake nearby. But the new name has become the butt of several jokes, including 
one that refers to residents as "butt-heads," and the local Town Council has 
scheduled another election on the issue. (B20) . . . Loyalists say the desert 
town's name is no worse than that of the Antelope Valley -- which has no 
antelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTERSHOCKS: Thousands of San Fernando Valley residents affected by last 
month's Northridge earthquake are finding that it's not easy to put their lives 
back together. Many are still homeless. Others are jobless. Countless others 
have found their futures dependent on a maze of official paperwork needed for 
loans, housing, food and necessities. (B1) Burbank Flights

GAY PRIDE PIONEER'S LIFE INCLUDED FRIENDSHIPS, DREAMS AND DEATH; ACTIVISM: 
RANDY ROHL TOOK ANOTHER BOY TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL PROM IN 1979. BUT THAT'S NOT 
WHAT HIS SURVIVORS REMEMBER HIM BY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARREN MILLS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Rohl's life as a gay man spanned two eras -- giddy and tragic, 
liberating and lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, when gay pride was ascendant and the sexual possibilities seemed 
endless, Rohl turned a rite of teen-age passage into a moment of political 
theater: He took another boy to the prom in Sioux Falls, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 The national media were there to record the moment; the camera lights glared 
as Rohl and his date danced; gay activists crowed that it was the first time a 
same-sex couple had ever been allowed to attend an American prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Randy Rohl faded into obscurity. Until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, it was reported that Randy Rohl had died in a Minneapolis hospital 
in the last moments of 1993. The cause was AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 When Isolde Rohl's 17-year-old son told her about his prom plans, she was 
astounded. "I knew Randy was different, but I didn't know why he was different. 
I had no idea at that time that he was gay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, in her memory and those of his friends, Randy's sexual orientation 
pales next to his other attributes -- his sense of fun; his love of computers 
and photography, skiing and swimming; the motorcycle and red Jeep he drove; his 
fluent German, Spanish, French. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is reason to believe that Randy himself felt his gayness was 
overemphasized. As far as his family and friends know, after the Lincoln High 
School prom, he never again participated in any gay-rights exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about it, the sexual part of everyone's life is such a small 
part, it's unfair to judge anyone by their sex life. It's such a trivial 
matter," he told reporters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The commotion came mostly from the news media when Randy and his date, 
20-year-old Grady Quinn, arrived at the Downtown Holiday Inn's Embassy Room. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple wore matching powder blue tuxedos, red rose boutonnieres and silver 
pierced earrings. "The only special treatment they got was a lot of room on the 
dance floor," the Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some police on hand -- Randy said he had received threats to "tar 
and chicken feather" him -- but they were not needed. Isolde Rohl was in the 
spectator section; when Randy looked around and saw his mother, he broke into a 
big grin, she recalled. The dance went on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy told reporters that Quinn was merely a friend, not a romantic interest. 
(In fact, Quinn was the partner of a local gay rights activist.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's rather sad that my date and I have to get more publicity or more 
acknowledgement from the press than any other couple," he said. "I don't think 
we're any more worthy of special attention. Yes, maybe it's a milestone in gay 
rights, but it's being made into more of a freak show." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, Randy seemed like your average, bookish kid, with red hair and 
braces. And after the prom and graduation, his life went on. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he moved to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota. He 
hoped to become a doctor. He never accomplished that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept in touch with his family, and gave his mother a doll with a photo 
impression of his face so she'd have him close by. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If you miss me, just look at me. Here I am. You can punch me out,"' 
Isolde Rohl said. "He could be such a clown." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Herzog worked with Randy at University of Minnesota Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit it off right away. I liked him and he liked me. He told me he was gay 
right away. It was no big deal," said Herzog, of Brooklyn Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two met, Herzog was single and said she and Randy enjoyed going to 
bars together and picking out men for each other. "He was wild. He made me 
laugh. We had a lot of fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wouldn't have been gay, I might have married the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 William Lowell, who met Randy when both studied genetics and cell biology at 
the University of Minnesota in 1988, said his friend was fearless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always attempting to get a reaction out of people," Lowell said. 
"You'd be walking down the hall with him and he'd let out a bark, then would 
look at you and say, 'Knock it off!' I always appreciated his sense of humor. I 
liked him because he did the things that I never would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy didn't tell Lowell about one feat of daring -- the prom -- until he'd 
known him a year and a half: "He said it wasn't meant to be political." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Herzog married and moved to Nevada, but she kept in touch with Randy. 
Then, in the mid-1980s, he called her to tell her that he was infected with 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed he contracted the virus from a man he had lived with for about 
three years, and who died of AIDS about a year ago, Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe how accepting he was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy had been a traveler all his life -- indeed, his parents met in Germany, 
where his father was posted in the service (the couple broke up in 1968) -- and 
after his diagnosis, his wanderings resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, Randy and his younger sister, Tori, had often visited their 
maternal grandparents in Germany. Randy studied there during his high school 
years, and had used his grandparents' home as a base for trips to Russia, 
Africa, Greece, Ireland, England, France and Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he went back to Germany, and worked as a translator and as a 
photographer, shooting weddings and doing 3D photo posters, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took pictures of everything -- a beautiful butterfly outside, a dandelion 
-- and enlarged it," she said. 'Anything interesting that was a challenge and 
needed concentration, Randy was into it." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Minnesota from time to time, and took classes. He moved to 
California but was too easily fatigued, too weak to do much of anything. 
Finally, last fall, he moved back to Minnesota to be closer to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 As his health deteriorated, Randy talked about death, often couching it in the 
language of the computer world. "He almost felt like he was a computer program 
that had gone awry and needed to be deleted and started over," Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing he regretted was that he didn't get to go to medical school," 
Lowell said. And, of course, he regretted that his life was so short. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say to me, 'Hey, Mom, we all have to die sooner or later. Just not 
so soon,' " his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he could no longer walk or stand up by himself and was blind in 
one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell said he believed Randy always held out hope that a cure would be found 
for AIDS. "At the end, he said he was really disappointed, that he didn't feel 
they were any closer to treating the disease. In November, he said if things 
didn't get better he wanted to be gone by the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy died at 10:52 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Randy's ashes will be buried in the family plot in Pirmasens, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 He told his mother he would like to have a square in his memory added to the 
AIDS memorial quilt. Isolde Rohl, an accomplished seamstress, is sewing the 
patch -- a black bordered block featuring a picture of Randy sitting behind his 
microscope, a caption reading "Searching for a Cure," and a poem she saw on a 
hospital wall: 
</P>
<P>
 With tearful eyes we watched him linger  
</P>
<P>
 And saw him slowly fade away.  
</P>
<P>
 Although we loved him dearly  
</P>
<P>
 We could not make him stay.

MARINES' DECISION TO TRY WOMAN GREETED BY FUROR; VIRGINIA: STATE AUTHORITIES 
DECIDED THAT A FEMALE LEATHERNECK ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE WHEN SHE SHOT TO DEATH 
A MALE MARINE WHO HAD STALKED HER, ASSAULTED HER, AND BROKE INTO HER HOME 
WIELDING A BAYONET. 
</P>

 For weeks, he'd been stalking her, threatening her. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marine Cpl. Anthony Goree broke into her Woodbridge, Va., apartment last 
June at 3 a.m., wielding a bayonet, Rayna Ross, also a Marine, shot and killed 
him. It was justifiable homicide, Prince William, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Marine Corps has charged Ross with murder. She could spend the 
rest of her life in prison if convicted. And Prince William police and others 
are outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the slaying occurred outside the Quantico Marine Corps Base, the 
corps was required to investigate because two Marines were involved. In 
December, Ross was charged with murder, and this month, she appeared before a 
Quantico, Va., military judge who is expected to recommend whether she should 
be court-martialed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm appalled but not surprised," said Patricia M. Gromley, a former Marine 
and director of the Military Project of the Women's Resource and Education 
Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "For the military to pick up on this 
after the local prosecutor found it justifiable is way out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't get a single prosecution in Tailhook, but, by God, they're 
going to get her," said Gromley, adding that she suspected sexism in the Marine 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cantarella, a Prince William police detective who investigated the 
shooting, testified at Ross' Quantico hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question that this was self-defense," Cantarella said. "I 
believe this guy was in there to do some serious bodily harm or to kill her." 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the killing, Prince William County Commonwealth's Atty. Paul B. 
Ebert declared it justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who breaks into a home armed, particularly with his history, I think, 
is asking to be killed," Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being represented by a Marine lawyer, Ross, 22, is getting 
advice from a civilian lawyer who is counsel for the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA has argued that the case shows that a five-day waiting period for 
handgun purchases is a bad idea. Ross bought her weapon, a .380 semiautomatic 
handgun, just three days before Goree broke into her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply do not understand how this ever even got to the charging stage," 
said NRA lawyer Michael Patrick Murray, a retired Marine colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray theorized that the basis for the charges against Ross was a 30-page 
report to the judge advocate general of the Navy, which called Ross "a spider 
woman" who "lured men into untenable positions and dumped them." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the Marine report recommended that Ross be investigated for 
possible criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Barry N. Moore, public affairs officer for Quantico, said the decision to 
charge Ross was based on the initial civilian investigation as well as that of 
the Naval Criminal Investigative Services. He said he was not aware of an 
additional report to the judge advocate general. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Ross' commanding officer, Col. Bruce Gombar, determined that charges 
should be brought under military law. "Virginia has broader statutes and case 
law about killing intruders," Moore said. "It's not so clear-cut in military 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Goree, 26, "posed a threat" to Ross, his commanding officer had noted before 
the killing. But Moore said the issue of Goree's stalking Ross "never came up 
for us in the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 On the June night when he was killed, Goree entered Ross' apartment by prying 
a sliding glass door off its tracks, then went to Ross' bedroom, where she was 
asleep with her 2-year-old daughter and a friend who was lying on the floor, 
police reports say. Ross fired twice at Goree, killing him with the second 
bullet, police records say.

KIDNAPERS SUPPLY CHINA'S BRIDE-FOR-SALE MARKET; SLAVERY: MEN WHO CAN'T ATTRACT 
A MATE CAN BUY AN ABDUCTED WOMAN FROM CRIMINAL GANGS, WHO FLOURISH AS PARENTS 
FEAR FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS' SAFETY.

<P>
 The peasant girl Fan Xianxiu began her journey into bondage a year ago as she 
walked the unfamiliar streets of this southwestern provincial capital in search 
of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women befriended Fan. They bought her new clothes and persuaded her to 
join them on a trip north. When they got off the train in Inner Mongolia, two 
men were waiting to take them to a nearby village. 
</P>
<P>
 There, to Fan's shock, a skinny and lame 24-year-old peasant paid her four 
companions $483, the price of a good color television, to take her for his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was so ugly that none of the local women wanted to marry him," Fan 
recalled. Her voice was soft and she looked every bit the 16-year-old naif with 
her ponytail and bangs hanging over her baby face. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Fan is back in Chengdu. Police rescued her from a life of bondage that 
has become all too common in modern China. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting at a government holding center to be reunited with relatives, she 
recounted her harrowing tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan told of the nights she was forced to sleep with the man who purchased her, 
the days she was shadowed by his relatives to prevent her from running away, 
the few moments by herself when all she could do was pray her ordeal would soon 
end. As she spoke, haltingly, in flat, short sentences, she squeezed the hand 
of a comforting friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was brokenhearted," she said. "I hoped I could get back to Sichuan as fast 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In imperial China, women were commonly sold to be wives, concubines or 
prostitutes. The communists ended that after taking power in 1949. But the 
breakup of farming communes, which doubled as powerful local governments, and 
the partial return of a market economy has eroded Communist Party control in 
the countryside and led to a resurgence of human trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons for the problem. Paying a family to wed their daughter 
is back in fashion, and men who cannot afford that often find it cheaper to buy 
a bride from kidnapers. Men from remote villages sometimes find that local 
women won't have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal gangs find easy kidnap targets among the millions of poor peasants 
who flood the cities in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan, who was sold into a relatively well-off household and was never beaten, 
fared far better than many other abducted women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The personal freedom of most kidnaped women has been restricted, most of them 
have been bitterly beaten, some of them have been raped and some have been 
resold on many occasions," the state-run Inner Mongolia Daily reported 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50,000 cases of abducted women and children were reported in 
1991-92, the last years for which statistics are available, a spokesman for the 
national police said. The actual number of kidnapings is undoubtedly higher 
since not all are reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the women are abducted from Chengdu and elsewhere in the 
southwestern province of Sichuan, the provincial police refused to discuss the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But one need only travel about an hour from Chengdu and listen to the people 
of Taihua village to understand just how pervasive the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Nong Ziying, who believes her 16-year-old daughter's disappearance 
five years ago must have been an abduction: 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Chengdu a lot of times, but I didn't find out anything," said Nong, 
46, standing by a field of young green wheat as she clutched a tiny 
black-and-white photo of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I cried . . . I think of her a lot, but there's nothing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Zhen Shufang. She is so petrified that her only child, an 
18-year-old daughter, will become the next victim, that she doesn't let her 
leave home. Zhen spends the day doing embroidery behind barred windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls that age are easily tricked," the mother said. "They can be kidnaped 
and sold." 
</P>
<P>
 One village girl was abducted and sold to a peasant in another province before 
being rescued and returned home. Her parents tracked her down and coaxed police 
with gifts of cigarettes to help bring her back. 
</P>
<P>
 The central government clearly wants to crack down on the kidnapings. They not 
only are embarrassing to a ruling Communist Party that stresses sexual equality 
but also provide ammunition to international critics of China's human rights 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have enacted tough anti-abduction laws and executed some 
kidnapers. In 1991-92, police rescued about 44,000 abducted women and children 
and arrested about 75,000 members of kidnap gangs, the Public Security Ministry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan Xianxiu was rescued late last year when Inner Mongolia police swept 
through her village looking for kidnaped women as part of a provincial campaign 
against abductions. She was among nearly 60 kidnaped Sichuanese brought back 
from the north to Chengdu in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the man who held her for eight months on the final day "urged me to 
stay. I said I wasn't coming back. Of course he was angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the other women owed their return more to personal courage than 
police work. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a penniless 15-year-old surnamed Yang, traveled about 60 miles in frigid 
weather after escaping from the man who bought her. She reached the safety of 
police in Jilin, a northern provincial capital, after seven days on the road, 
sustained by the kindness of peasants who took her in at night. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the kidnaped women and children who are rescued, countless more never 
go home. The women who made it back to Chengdu said there were many more 
purchased wives still living in the villages up north. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims are so fearful of being caught and beaten they never try to 
escape. Others choose to stay, those who have borne children or find their new 
surroundings more comfortable than their impoverished home villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Abducted women also may find themselves stigmatized if they return home. 
Parents often reject them, husbands divorce them. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, with booming urban areas continuing to lure poor peasant women, it 
may be difficult for authorities to snuff out the abduction epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Young country women seeking work as maids or factory workers continue to crowd 
an illegal job market at Chengdu's Nine-Eyes Bridge, a favorite hunting ground 
for wife-traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police efforts to close the market have failed. Posted signs and broadcasts 
warning of abductors on the prowl don't seem to frighten the young women, who 
believe they will be able to spot trouble if it comes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they sound a bit like Fan Xianxiu, bundled in a red sweater against 
the winter cold. She'll soon be looking for work again, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I won't be fooled again," she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked how she will spot potential abductors, she groped for an 
answer: 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm careful, it'll be all right."

VIRGINIANS IN CIVIL WAR OVER DISNEY PARK PLANS; DEVELOPMENT: THE ATTRACTION IS 
INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE HISTORY, BUT AT PRESENT IT'S DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN 
BLUE-COLLAR HAYMARKET AND EXCLUSIVE THE PLAINS. HAYMARKET IS ECSTATIC, THE 
PLAINS AGHAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tale of two towns: Historic old Haymarket, workaday and blue-collar, where a 
church raises funds with an all-you-can-eat spaghetti supper and grocer Mike 
Davis sells nightcrawlers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just over Bull Run Mountain, a town called The Plains, its tidy brick 
sidewalks and antique shops nestled in Virginia's old-money, fox-hunting 
countryside; a place where the village smithy, craftsman Nol Putnam, forges 
ornate gateposts on his anvil. 
</P>
<P>
 Between these two towns and these two neighbors, a wedge has been driven: Walt 
Disney is coming, to Haymarket's delight and The Plains' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney woke up the countryside last fall by revealing that its agents had 
quietly bought land or options on 3,000 acres of Prince William County 
countryside, on the edge of Haymarket, as the site for its fifth theme park, 
its third in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's America is intended to illustrate American history, from Pocahontas 
to Steven Jobs. The park will open in 1998 -- unless opponents like blacksmith 
Putnam prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney plans a man-made lake where the Monitor and the Merrimack will re-enact 
their Civil War battle. America's immigrant experience will be retold at a 
replica of Ellis Island. The "painful, disturbing and agonizing" stories of the 
enslavement of the blacks, the massacre of the natives, the divisions of 
Vietnam -- all will be dealt with, said Disney Chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a steam train, a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster too. And with 
a push of a button, an "audio-animatronic" Bill Clinton (or whoever is 
President in 1998) will deliver a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 All this makes some historians itch. Richard Moe, president of the National 
Trust for Historic Preservation, mused: "Can George Washington coexist with 
Mickey Mouse? Can slavery be properly interpreted in an amusement park?" 
</P>
<P>
 These are not questions that plague Haymarket grocer Davis. He was one of the 
first to capitalize on Disney's plans. He printed up T-shirts with the legend, 
"Haymarket, Virginia -- Just Another Mickey Mouse Town." By Christmas, he'd 
sold 1,200 -- in a town of 483 citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis estimates that 80% of Haymarket welcomes Disney, on the grounds that 
development is inevitable and Disney will bring jobs and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those with doubts, Davis said, hesitate chiefly because they think the 
company, and not Virginia taxpayers, should pay for the new roads and sewers 
that Disney demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is going to get the land out here," he said. "It might as well be 
Disney. We couldn't ask for a better taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the mountain, volunteers hand out bumper stickers that say, "Disney Makes 
Millions. We Pay Millions," and another that shows the shield symbol of I-66 
and asks, "Disney's New Parking Lot?" 
</P>
<P>
 I-66, already congested, carries commuters to Washington, 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacksmith Putnam bemoans the changes he foresees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting seduced," he said. "The Plains will no longer be a bucolic 
little town. We'll get the spillover -- maybe not 30,000 visitors a day, but we 
could get 5,000. We'll be inundated. And following that will be all the things 
people want, gas stations, motels and, God help us, the fast-food strips." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney knew what it was doing when it picked Haymarket. Twenty million 
tourists a year visit Washington -- exactly the family clientele Disney appeals 
to. Most come by car. Disney plans to lure them west. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., which is a vacation destination by 
itself, the Virginia park is intended to be one day's stop in a Washington 
vacation. It will be only a 10th the size of the Orlando extravaganza, insists 
Mark Pacala, general manager of the Virginia project. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's re-enactments will play out on historic soil. Long before George 
Washington made war on the British, Haymarket was an important colonial 
crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Civil War broke out, "Every man but one in Haymarket voted for 
secession," said town historian Robert L. Crewdson. "Apparently that man was 
very nearly mobbed." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Civil War battles, the First and Second Battles of Bull Run, were fought 
in the hills nearby. Both were Confederate routs known to Southerners as the 
battles of Manassas. Later, Union troops sacked Haymarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a day's easy drive are other tourist draws -- King's Dominion and Busch 
Gardens, two commercial parks; and Jamestown, Yorktown and the restored village 
of Colonial Williamsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 And thousands of tourists will be pulled to nearby Dulles Airport when the 
Smithsonian Institution builds a huge air and space museum there to house the 
B-29 that dropped the first atomic bomb, a Concorde supersonic transport and 
the space shuttle Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney expects to welcome as many as 30,000 visitors a day (in 7,500 cars), 
Pacala said, and to reap other profits too. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 125-acre theme park, it plans a 144-room hotel, a 27-hole 
golf course, 2,500 homes, and office and retail space. He said the company will 
invest $1 billion in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginia is open for business," declared newly installed Gov. George Allen, 
hailing Disney's plans. He asked the Legislature, which is somewhat more wary, 
for $163 million to build a new I-66 interchange, widen roads and provide 
infrastructure. County taxpayers would have to approve additional millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the opposition, mostly from the next-door Fauquier County, much of it 
from the Piedmont Environmental Council, waging a splashy campaign called 
"Disney -- Take a Second Look." 
</P>
<P>
 (A joke making the rounds, the Fauquier Citizen reported, is that if God 
wanted to move heaven to Haymarket the PEC would advise, "God -- take a second 
look.") 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of jobs Disney will bring has become an issue. Disney foresees 
12,400 new jobs -- 2,700 at the park, 3,700 at the hotel and other Disney 
enterprises and the rest spinoff jobs created by the arrival of so many 
newcomers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are mostly low-paying jobs, and the new residents may require 
government services that will more than absorb the tax revenue generated by 
Disney, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the same activists succeeded a few years ago in blocking a regional 
shopping center that would have bordered the Manassas battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not opposed to a Disney theme park for Virginia, but Haymarket is the 
wrong place," said Bob Dennis, president of the environmental council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would destabilize a thriving agricultural economy to have a city -- that's 
what is coming -- plopped right down on its edge, in a mixed landscape ranging 
from cattle farms and wood lots to highly invested vineyards and horse-breeding 
facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's Pacala attributes the furor to a small core of Virginia's landed 
gentry. "It's amazing what money can buy," he said.

ABJECT MISERY ALONGSIDE PROSPERITY'S GLOW IN ASIAN CITIES; DEVELOPMENT: 
ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT HAS FUELED ENGINES OF THE WORLD'S FASTEST ECONOMIC 
GROWTH. BUT RICH AND POOR ALIKE PAY A HEAVY PRICE.

 Five years ago, Kimnai Satreewong took her dreams to the city. Now, if she can 
ever scrape enough money together, she wants to buy a pickup truck and go home 
to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimnai, 43, makes a pretty good living selling somtam, or raw papaya salad, 
from a cart on a downtown corner. Her take of $20 to $28 a day is several times 
the minimum daily wage of $5. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not enough to provide the new life she had sought for herself, her 
unemployed husband and their two children, who stayed behind. She lives in one 
tiny room and, at work, police badger her for blocking the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will stay here just one or two years more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is sweeter for banker Manit Panitkul, 35, as it is for the thousands of 
other prosperous young business professionals. Manit and his wife live in a 
house on the outskirts. His main complaint is traffic jams, which can be 
horrendous in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 The banker and the somtam vendor embody the entrepreneurial spirit that has 
made Asia's cities the engines of the world's fastest economic growth. But the 
mega-cities are paying a severe price, and many who live in them are concluding 
that the frustrations and hazards outweigh the rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleaming towers rise beside sprawling slums in Jakarta, Manila and Bangkok. 
The rich can afford comforts and protection, but must breathe the same air, 
drink the same water and navigate the same clogged streets as the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimnai needs only about five minutes to push the food cart from her room to 
her street corner. Manit noses his new Toyota through rush-hour traffic at 
about the same pace. Like her, he rises before 6 a.m. Unlike her, he spends 2 
1/2 hours getting to his job at the Laem Thong bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the developing countries of Asia, city services provide little benefit to 
either rich or poor. Public transport is inadequate and cars choke the streets 
day and night, fouling the air with exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians tend to build cities as production centers rather than as places to 
live, and "the problems increase faster than the rate of solving them," said 
Somsuk Boonyabancha of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Since World War II, millions of Asians have moved from farms to cities, often 
ending up in ramshackle slums as squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 20 years ago, one-fifth of Asians lived in cities. That is expected to 
reach more than half in East Asia by 2005, and a similar proportion in South 
Asia by 2025. 
</P>
<P>
 At current rates of growth, 13 of the world's 21 mega-cities -- those with 
more than 10 million people -- will be in the Asian-Pacific region by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore has planned successfully, but Dhira Phantumvanit, president of the 
Thailand Environment Institute, said other cities have grown haphazardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Large cities are being strangled by rapid growth, Dhira said, adding: "What is 
happening now in Bangkok will happen soon in Jakarta, then go to Manila, then 
go to Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the dilemma facing all major cities of every (developing) country. By 
the time we feel we have enough money to start to invest, we are confronted 
with the magnitude of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the poor suffer the most, as usual, not even the rich can escape such 
pervasive urban problems as air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead in Bangkok's air -- most of it from automobile exhaust -- kills 200 to 
400 people a year and accounts for 200,000 to 500,000 cases of high blood 
pressure, the U.S. Agency for International Development estimated in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, high concentrations of airborne lead may have the more 
insidious effect of reducing the intelligence of Asia's children, the 
custodians of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less qualified they are, the less productive the future will be," said 
Jens Overgaard, co-author of a report on Asia's cities by the Economic and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, a regional U.N. organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about one-fourth of the urban poor have safe water supplies, fewer than 
half have access to sanitary facilities, and garbage disposal and sewage 
treatment services are breaking down, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommends reducing red tape and bureaucracy, sharing power and decisions 
with the people and private groups, and preventing pollution instead of trying 
to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Red tape often makes it difficult for workers in cottage industries and street 
vendors like Kimnai to start small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't waste time trying to slow down growth -- it will grow anyway," 
Overgaard said. "Remove the obstacles to growth," 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the misery of the slums, the prevailing attitude is resourcefulness, 
not despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists in Bangkok and other cities have begun their own efforts to clean up 
the environment and nurture small business, and are pressing governments for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Somsuk of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights heads a project to lend money 
at low rates to responsible local organizations, and says the officials must 
work with the communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be done in partnership style," she said. "That should be the 
theme of the new decade."

SQUATTERS IN MANILA LEAD PRECARIOUS LIVES; PHILIPPINES: MANY FLED COUNTRYSIDE 
ONLY TO END UP IN SHACKS ALONG RAIL TRACKS, IN VACANT LOTS, ON AIRPORT FRINGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Adelaida Vitales lives with her three daughters in a wooden shack not much 
bigger than a king-size bed. Just over the fence, workmen are finishing a 
high-rise luxury condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitales is among the estimated 3 million "squatters" who live on other 
people's property in metropolitan Manila, a city of 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence lends a shabby air to the city, which lacks the order and 
glitter of prosperous Singapore or Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Squatters are but one of Manila's many problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * The potholed streets are clogged with horrific traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Air pollution is three times the maximum in official health standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garbage piles up waist-high in some neighborhoods. An estimated 1,000 tons 
is dumped daily into the Pasig River, which flows into Manila Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 For the squatters, living conditions are appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fled poverty and a Marxist insurgency in the countryside only to end up 
in shacks along railroad tracks, in vacant lots, beside airport runways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to live in a two-story house; now we live here," said Vitales, 55, 
pointing to a tin-roofed shanty. The bed she shares with her three young 
daughters takes up more than half the space. A teen-age son sleeps in a 
neighbor's shack. 
</P>
<P>
 No social services are provided to squatters, so they survive by their wits. 
Vitales and 75 other families get electricity and water, for example, by 
tapping illegally into the systems that supply the nearby Quezon City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her shack leans against a concrete fence surrounding an eight-story 
condominium and five-floor office building on the lot where she and the others 
used to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Manila has had little success in dealing with the squatter problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippine government has too little money to build public housing or buy 
land for resettlement. Local plans get bogged down in the overlapping 
bureaucracies of metropolitan Manila, which is divided into four "chartered 
cities" and 13 municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcible evictions of squatters bring complaints, even civil suits by human 
rights activists who believe the right to a home overrides property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 A new national law prevents local governments from demolishing shanties built 
before March, 1992, unless new home sites are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Those living in such "danger areas" as streets and canals can be evicted, but 
Mayor Mel Mathay of Quezon City, chairman of the Metro Manila Authority, said 
many squatters refuse to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Many squatters who are awarded rights to settle in government relocation sites 
sell their permits to others and stay in the city, Mathay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gregorio Andolana, chairman of the House Committee on Housing, said the 
solution lies in developing rural areas so people do not have to look for work 
in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If basic services are there in the countryside, and there are schools . . . 
and there are hospitals, the people will not leave," he said.

UNFRIENDLY SKIES OFTEN FAR FROM PURR-FECT FOR NON-HUMAN PASSENGERS; PETS: A 
DEBATE IS RAGING OVER WHETHER A MISPLACED CAT AND THE MILLIONS OF OTHER ANIMALS 
TRANSPORTED EVERY YEAR ARE FAMILY MEMBERS OR JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF BAGGAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Spanky the cat hasn't been seen since he was loaded onto a KLM airlines flight 
in Saudi Arabia two days before Christmas. The cat's cage turned up in the 
Amsterdam airport, but the cat was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch airline has apologized for the loss and offered to refund the $225 
shipping cost, but that has done little to soothe owner Kevin McGowan, who is 
living in Potomac, Md., after working for three years in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just a little cat. It was a family member," McGowan said. "And 
they're treating it as if it was a piece of luggage." 
</P>
<P>
 A debate is raging over the question of whether Spanky and the millions of 
other pets transported on airplanes every year are family members or just 
another suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Manhattan ruled recently that a dead golden retriever was 
worth no more than a bag of clothes. The judge sided with American Airlines in 
a suit brought by the owner of a dog that died from heatstroke in a cargo hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal rights activists said the decision underscores what they've been saying 
for years: that airlines are indifferent to animals and tolerate a scandalous 
rate of animal loss, injury and death as a cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is so bad that we have issued a warning to all pet owners that 
they should never ship their pet in anything but the cabin of the plane," said 
Brenda Foster of the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for several airlines said that they always treat pets with extreme 
care and that even though accidents occur, they represent only a tiny fraction 
of the vast number of pets transported. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, more than 100 animals have died aboard airlines since 1990. 
Fifty-six puppies died on one Trans World Airlines flight, and 32 dogs died on 
a Delta Air Lines flight. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines paid a $48,000 fine when 24 dogs died on one of its flights, 
and five dogs died on American Airlines flights. 
</P>
<P>
 In those and dozens of other cases prosecuted by federal authorities, family 
pets and animals in commercial airline shipments allegedly suffocated or 
suffered heatstroke in cargo holds that became stifling on hot days. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's perfectly safe, and that is just not true," said Foster, 
who said her group has received complaints about every major airline in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Gus Whitcomb, a spokesman for American Airlines, said his company carries 
about 50,000 animals a year, with rare problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have the same responsibility for a pet that we do for a 
passenger," Whitcomb said. "If we really did carry pets and we didn't care 
about them, the death rates would be a lot higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitcomb said that although the airlines recognize the emotional and 
sentimental value of a pet to its owner, "an animal is checked baggage from a 
legal liability standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitcomb likened a lost pet to a lost home movie. While both are irreplaceable 
and have enormous value to their owners, when they are lost, insurance 
companies pay only on their actual value. 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment was endorsed in February by U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl 
Kram of New York. Kram ruled that a man whose golden retriever, Floyd, suffered 
heatstroke in an American Airlines cargo hold could not sue for anguish and 
loss of companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that Andrew Gluckman of New York was entitled only to lost 
baggage compensation. Jolene Marion, Gluckman's attorney, said Floyd died after 
sitting for more than an hour on a Phoenix runway in a cargo hold that reached 
140 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 American offered to settle the case for $1,250, the standard compensation for 
lost baggage, and fought to keep Gluckman from collecting more. Marion, who 
specializes in animal rights cases, said the case highlighted the airlines' 
indifference to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 At United Airlines, spokesman Joseph Hopkins said his company makes about $10 
million from the 200,000 live animals it transports each year, giving the 
company an economic as well as a moral obligation to treat animals well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said United's commitment to animals was demonstrated in December when 
a United pilot dumped $2,300 worth of fuel and made an unscheduled landing in 
Wisconsin after being alerted that a cat and a dog had been improperly loaded 
in a cargo hold. The animals were not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1991 and 1993, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the 
Animal Welfare Act, fined six airlines a total of $67,500 for violations. An 
additional 80 violations are pending.

WOMAN ACCUSES MOTHER OF KILLING FATHER; TEXAS: TAMMY RUSSELL HAS INSISTED FOR 
15 YEARS THAT HER MOTHER COMMITTED MURDER BY SETTING A FIRE THAT SWEPT THROUGH 
THEIR MOBILE HOME. ONLY NOW HAVE CHARGES BEEN FILED. 
</P>

<P>
 For 15 years, Tammy Russell has insisted that her father's death was no 
accident, that the fire that killed him was set by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, nobody listened. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire investigators reopened the case in December after another 
family member, whom they wouldn't identify, also raised questions about Jack 
Edward Russell's death. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Jan. 18, Tammy Russell's mother, Mildred Laverne Russell, 49, was 
indicted on charges of murder and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd get to see it," Tammy Russell, 25, said in Sunday 
editions of the Tyler Courier-Times-Telegraph. "Before Mildred was arrested, I 
kept everything inside. It was like I hid part of my life. Now I'm relieved 
that I don't have to hide it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Russell was found dead Jan. 22, 1979, in a back bedroom of the family's 
mobile home, which had been consumed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the initial investigation, the fire was started by a cigarette 
that ignited a couch. Russell was the only person home at the time. Mildred 
Russell said her husband was drunk and asleep when she left the house with her 
four children. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Tyler pathologist who reviewed the original autopsy, and found it 
incomplete, said it was possible that Russell had been hit on the head before 
fire swept through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's body was exhumed in December and a second autopsy was performed. 
Investigators say the second autopsy supports the initial ruling that smoke 
inhalation caused Russell's death. But they could not determine what caused the 
blunt wound to his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Russell, who was 11 at the time, said she remembers leaving the house 
with her mother that night after her parents fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rode behind the house, up and down the street, about 100 times, slowly," 
she said. "We stayed driving in that area of that house all night long. . . . I 
told her two times that the house was on fire and she wouldn't stop. She said 
it was the neighbor's chimney." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Russell said her mother gave her a fabricated story to provide 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said to tell them I was standing in a hallway when my father threw a 
stereo and that I saw a cigarette butt fall on the couch," she said. "She said 
if I didn't do what she said, my brothers and sisters would be placed in an 
orphanage."

LABOR CAMP NIGHTMARES TRAIL DISSIDENT TO U.S.; HUMAN RIGHTS: FORMER CHINESE 
PRISONER'S BOOK IS NAMED FOR 'BITTER WINDS' THAT SWEPT THROUGH THE 
PAPER-WINDOWED CELLS AND CAME TO REPRESENT THE PREVAILING INJUSTICES.

 Harry Wu wanted to forget the torture, the scavenging for rats to keep from 
starving, the memory of friends dying one by one, carried away and dumped into 
cold ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after Wu arrived in the United States, free after 19 brutal years in 
Chinese labor camps, the nightmares never went away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bitter winds always follow me and, in the end, I think I have to tell 
people the truth," said Wu, whose real name is Wu Hongda, in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't shake his memories of Big Mouth Xing, a wily petty thief who 
taught him the art of survival but died of hunger, or Lu Haoqin, driven mad and 
then to suicide for the lack of human touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved them and they loved me. I can't turn my back on them. To forget them 
means to betray them," said Wu, 57, as he discussed his new book, "Bitter 
Winds: A Memoir of My Years in China's Gulag." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is named for the northern winds that swept through their 
paper-windowed cells and came to represent the injustice of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu's story begins in 1955, when he was a young man in Shanghai eager to help 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung build socialism. He read in the People's Daily that the 
future of China would depend on minerals, oil and coal, and enrolled in 
Beijing's Geology Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wu adjusted to the spying of the Communist Party Youth League and 
mandatory party ideology study sessions, he tried to settle into a routine of 
study and his passion, baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 But he made a few mistakes. He didn't join the party-sanctioned singing and 
drama clubs, he snuck off campus to meet a girlfriend and he spoke out against 
the arrest of his older brother for "illicit connections with foreigners" after 
authorities discovered letters from their sister in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 27, 1960, just after graduation, Wu was arrested. Never formally 
charged or tried, he spent the next 19 years in labor camps, labeled, like tens 
of thousands of other prisoners, a "counterrevolutionary rightist." 
</P>
<P>
 He was released in 1979 by a government desperate to recover from the violent 
excesses of the decade-long Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, he had learned to steal and beat up fellow inmates for food and 
cigarettes, find rats and snakes to supplement his diet of gruel and biscuits, 
and think about his mother's cooking at "food-imagining parties." 
</P>
<P>
 He had also had a revelation while escorting the body of a fellow inmate to 
his grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human life has no value here, I thought bitterly," Wu wrote. "But if a 
person's life has no value, then the society that shapes that life has no value 
either. If the people mean no more than dust, then the society is worthless and 
does not deserve to continue. If the society should not continue, then I should 
oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that thought that stopped him from committing suicide. It is the same 
thought that keeps him going today. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in the United States in 1985. He's now a resident scholar at 
Stanford University's Hoover Institution and he hopes to start a family with 
his wife, Chen Ching-lee. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wants the American people to know that the conditions that prompted his 
nightmares still exist. Wu and Chen went to the prisons in 1991 to shoot a 
secret video for a "60 Minutes" segment on Chinese prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dissidents from the 1989 Tian An Men Square uprising still capture 
headlines, Wu doesn't want people to disregard the faceless millions laboring 
in China's gulag. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people will see that this is the core of the human rights issue in China, 
not a few well-known dissidents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government says there are about 3,300 political prisoners, 
although human rights advocates believe the figure is closer to 10,000. Wu 
estimates there are 10 million people in the "laogai," or labor-reform system 
of prisons, labor farms and resettlement camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu intends to testify before Congress for a second time against renewal of 
favorable tariff status on Chinese imports and against imports of goods made by 
Chinese prisoners. 
</P>

 Brazilian police raided a fortress-style gambling house in Sao Paulo early 
Friday and arrested 20 people suspected of running the illegal casino, 
Brazilian television said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clandestine casino, complete with secret escape tunnels and hideaways, was 
housed in a mansion in the city's elegant Morumbi district, where many foreign 
diplomats live. 
</P>
<P>
 Police used a Jeep to break down the front door and found eight gambling 
tables inside, equipped for roulette, blackjack and other games.

NO ROOM AT FLOODED INN FOR A RACCOON; DES MOINES: HOLIDAY INN HAS BEEN CLOSED 
SINCE JULY, WHEN FLOODS DEVASTATED MIDWEST. ITS ONE REMAINING EMPLOYEE USED 
DEADLY FORCE TO EVICT AN UNWELCOME GUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER MUNNS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only guest at the sprawling Holiday Inn South the other night was a 
raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The only employee shot him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know how he got in, but I know for sure he didn't want to 
leave," said chief engineer Patrick Rush. "I cornered him in one of the guest 
rooms and got him with a .22. Then I threw him out back." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Holiday Inn in Iowa has been closed since July, when the Midwest 
was struck by devastating floods. The nearby Raccoon River poured 6 to 8 feet 
of water through the first floor of the nine-acre complex, ruining 156 guest 
rooms and trashing the bar, restaurant, kitchen, front desk and everything in 
between. Estimated damage: about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush said the 346-room hotel will one day come back to life. But no decision 
has been made on when that might happen, leaving the hotel one of the great 
flood's more spectacular victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews stripped the lower floor and shuttered the place. 
</P>
<P>
 All 120 employees were laid off except Rush, who once headed a staff of eight 
electricians, handymen and plumbers. His job now is to keep the building 
stable, answer the phone and kick out unwanted guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the general manager and secretary and security and everything else," he 
said. "I'm learning a lot about the hotel business. I'm dealing with people I 
never had to deal with before." 
</P>
<P>
 One challenge came in January, when the Holiday Inn reservations clerks 
mistakenly booked 60 rooms. He found out about it when people started calling 
to confirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't talk to some of them, they were so upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have understood if they could have seen the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood debris and gunk was removed from the first floor, along with everything 
else down to the exterior walls and interior studs. The second floor still has 
beds and other furniture, but much of it has been damaged by soggy fallen 
plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The boilers were ruined, so the hotel is using refrigerator-sized heaters to 
keep the place from freezing up. The natural gas bill is $20,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprinkler system has been turned off. It wouldn't work anyway because the 
water main from the street burst during a cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush constantly patrols the property, as do guards at night, to make sure the 
heaters are working properly and to check for unwanted guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the flood, transients found their way into the hotel and set up 
temporary quarters, but Rush shooed them away. "We had one guy who wouldn't 
take no for an answer," he said. Criminal trespass charges were filed and there 
have been no problems since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not lonely," he said. "I miss the other employees and I wish they had 
jobs. But I'm not lonely. I've got plenty to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's number is still listed and Rush handles 40 to 50 calls a day. 
Mostly his answer is: "I'm sorry, we're not open." 
</P>
<P>
 The building is structurally sound, he said, and hotel officials at first said 
it would reopen by last October. Then the reopening was pushed back to spring, 
and now the date is indefinite. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was insured but three of the five institutions that hold bonds on 
the hotel have been taken over by the federal government. All are in the Kansas 
City area, according to Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for the Resolution Trust 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 She said unspecified issues have delayed a decision on whether to permit the 
hotel to reopen. The building is owned by Hotel Corp. of America of Kansas 
City, whose director of operations, Wayne Heintz, declined to comment.

WHEAT BUYERS MARCH TO DIFFERENT DURUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 38-seat auditorium at the Northern Crops Institute looks like a United 
Nations assembly hall in miniature, complete with world clocks, flags and 
equipment to provide translations in any three languages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the universal language in the brick-and-glass center is food -- cheese 
puffs, couscous, anything that can be made from barley, beans, sugar beets, 
sunflowers, spring wheat and other crops from the Northern farm belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to teach people how to grow crops," said acting director John 
A. Crabtree. "This is here for them to learn to purchase and process." 
</P>
<P>
 That's become a bigger task in the 10 years since the institute began as part 
of a four-state effort to sell off an increasing glut of commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries from Mexico to Morocco to the nations of the former Soviet Union are 
switching away from government monopolies and cooperatives for their raw food 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Without instruction at places like the crops institute or the International 
Grains Program at Kansas State University, millers can find themselves at a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people coming in where their import needs were taken care of by 
their government," Crabtree said. "Now they're on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can be as messy or intimidating as the U.S. market system, with its 
futures markets, commodity exchanges, and six classes of just one commodity -- 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides hearing lectures on management of flour mills or grain procurement, 
visitors tour farms and grain elevators just minutes away in the Red River 
Valley. They travel a little farther to visit the grain exchange in Minneapolis 
and the port in Duluth. 
</P>
<P>
 But how is the Moroccan visitor to know whether the durum from Prosper, N.D., 
will turn out couscous to please the folks back in Marrakech? If the country 
adopts a grain inspection system, how do you explain that the American system 
and not the French one is the one to emulate? 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the rest of the institute comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the patronage of the late Sen. Quentin Burdick (D-N.D.), former 
chairman of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee, the institute has a 
two-and-a-half story durum mill under its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 It also runs a mill near the Fargo airport so visitors can learn the right mix 
of barley, soybeans and other crops for livestock feed. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's main building houses a baking laboratory, so visitors can see 
how the hard red spring wheat that is grown here works in different flour 
mixtures. There's a commodity grading laboratory where visitors learn about 
U.S. grain standards. And there's an extruder that turns out ready-to-microwave 
pasta and all kinds of breakfast foods and snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the place to see a wheat-based cheese puff au naturel, before the 
finger-staining orange coating is put on. 
</P>
<P>
 If those foods earn a respectable place at the table here, that's because 
breakfast cereal and finger foods follow close on the heels of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world's coming around to more extruded wheat products," said John Howard, 
director of programs at U.S. Wheat Associates, the export-promotion group for 
wheat producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups like U.S. Wheat Associates and the U.S. Feed Grains Council help pay 
the travel and lodging for visiting trade delegations and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Those groups use money raised by member growers and some of the $32 million 
the U.S. Agriculture Department will spend this year to develop foreign 
markets.

GLOBAL POLLUTION GNAWS INTO FOREST; ENVIRONMENT: TRACE AMOUNTS OF BANNED 
SUBSTANCES SHOW UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY ROSENTHAL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On remote Mt. Moosilauke in New Hampshire's White Mountains, scientists have 
found more signs that pollutants can be long-distance travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest floor samples taken from Mt. Moosilauke and from the nearby Hubbard 
Brook Experimental Forest have yielded trace amounts of the insecticide DDT and 
industrial chemicals called PCBs, both banned in the United States since the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the toxic chemicals could have accumulated in the forest decades ago, 
when DDT was still used actively and PCBs were not so stringently regulated, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scientists think it's likely that most of the chemicals originated 
outside the United States and were deposited in the forests relatively recently 
after being carried in the atmosphere, said William Smith, a Yale University 
forest biologist who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another indicator of the smallness of our globe and the efficiency 
of the atmosphere in circulating persistent chemicals wherever they are 
released," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also underscores the need to combat pollution on an international 
basis and the important role forests play as air filters, said Smith, who 
serves on the science advisory board of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. The board is seeking broader cooperation on international environmental 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-distance atmospheric transport of pollutants and their contamination 
of lakes and streams has been well documented in the United States. Less 
research has been done on their contamination of land, especially forests, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Moosilauke, in north-central New Hampshire, is the westernmost peak of the 
White Mountains. Hubbard Brook is about five miles away. The sites are about 
125 miles northwest of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The insecticide DDT, which can cause cancer in humans and is toxic to 
wildlife, has been banned in the United States since 1972 and is prohibited in 
most countries. But its use has increased in Mexico, Central America, India and 
eastern Europe, the scientists noted in their study, published in the November 
issue of Environmental Science Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Production of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, was halted in the United 
States in 1977 because of their carcinogenic potential. The chemicals were 
widely used as lubricants and insulators and remain a significant source of 
pollution in urban and industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both DDT and PCBs are resistant to chemical breakdown and magnify in the food 
chain, meaning that concentrations of the toxic chemicals are highest in 
animals at the top of the food chain. Both can enter the atmosphere in the form 
of vapors or in combination with aerosols. 
</P>
<P>
 The test for the presence of DDT and PCBs came during a longstanding effort at 
Hubbard Brook to monitor the atmospheric transport and deposit of heavy metals 
generated by industry, motor vehicles and other sources. The scientists 
documented how lead deposits declined with the federal law banning lead in 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of continental air mass movement, storm tracks that have passed over 
centers of agricultural and industrial activity and large urban areas also 
frequently pass over northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Contaminants are trapped by trees and then washed to the ground or dropped 
there with leaves, needles and twigs. The thick organic layer in northern 
forests acts to absorb the chemical deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is a bit disturbing about the PCBs and DDT is not that it is damaging 
the system . . . but that it is still accumulating in it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the Mt. Moosilauke samples had greater levels of the trace 
chemicals than the Hubbard Brook samples. At Moosilauke, the highest PCB 
reading was 252 per billion parts of soil; the highest DDT level was 192 per 
billion parts soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples were taken from various elevations on Moosilauke, starting about 2,700 
feet and going up to the 4,810-foot summit. At Hubbard, samples were taken at 
elevations ranging from about 800 to 2,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing away freshly fallen leaves, twigs and other forest litter, the 
researchers dug no deeper than six inches to get their samples, a mix of 
decomposing and well-decomposed organic material. 
</P>
<P>
 Some samples were taken from forests 110 years old, others from areas 
clear-cut just five years ago. The age of the trees appeared to have no 
correlation to the amount of contaminants recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater amounts of DDT and PCBs were found on slopes facing prevailing winds, 
which blow from the west, but the test was not large enough statistically to 
establish a pattern, Smith said.

SNORER HAULED INTO COURT AS NOISE VIOLATOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who snored so loudly that her next-door neighbor couldn't sleep has 
been hauled into court for violating the city's noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sari Zayed, a 30-year-old mother of two, pleaded not guilty last week, but 
must return to court March 25.She faces a $50 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor, Chris Doherty, complained that he lost sleep because he could 
hear the woman's snoring through their common bedroom wall in the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Zayed says she's the one who can't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "You kind of wonder what's going to happen now," she said. "Am I going to 
snore? Is my husband going to snore? Is this man going to come through the 
wall?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zayed has hired a lawyer and is considering a lawsuit of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty had complained to her three times before calling police. She tried to 
stop, even tried putting a mattress against the wall to muffle the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer investigated on Jan. 31 and recommended mediation. But Doherty was 
fed up. He demanded that she be awakened and cited.

YOUNGSTERS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GAMBLING FEVER THAN ADULTS, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAM SCHMID, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Faherty's gambling habit began innocently enough, watching a church bingo 
game from his mother's side at age 12. It ended nearly a decade later with a 
trail of bad checks and maxed-out credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many gamblers, he was drawn by the lure of easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you play 15 minutes or three hours, it's the same adrenaline rush," 
he said. "But the second you get away from the table, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 And, like a growing number of compulsive gamblers, Faherty was hooked on 
betting before he was old enough to buy a drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an epidemic in America, a little-noticed epidemic," said Dr. Durand 
Jacobs, a clinical psychologist in Redlands, Calif., and a pioneer in treating 
compulsive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say compulsive gambling among teens is growing along with the gambling 
industry in the United States. Lotteries are operating in 37 states and the 
District of Columbia. Greyhound tracks have sprung up from Texas to Wisconsin. 
And in the last five years alone, casinos have spread from Nevada and New 
Jersey to 15 additional states. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money wagered legally in the United States has also grown 
dramatically -- to an estimated $330 billion in 1992, an increase of 162% in a 
decade, according to Gaming & Wagering Business Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 While gambling becomes more accepted and accessible, experts say little is 
being done to warn teens about its hidden perils. Some researchers say children 
run a greater risk of getting hooked than adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids are going to wind up having disastrous gambling careers, 
and it's preventable," said Henry Lesieur, chair of the criminal justice 
department at Illinois State University. He has spent two decades studying 
gambling's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are scarce, but experts say anecdotal evidence is building that 
more teens are becoming problem gamblers. Valerie Lorenz, executive director of 
the Compulsive Gambling Center in Baltimore, has seen a regular increase in the 
number of calls from teens since its national hot line started in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The percentages are still small, but the point is, five years ago they 
weren't calling at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said the rate of problem gambling among youths who gamble is at least 
10%, twice that of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding that the very young are far more affected by the changing scene 
of gambling in America than are the adults," he said. "As you come down the age 
brackets, we're finding more and more problem gambling among the younger and 
younger." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota is a prime example of the growth of legal gambling. In the last 
three years, the state began a lottery and signed compacts with Indian tribes 
that opened the way for video poker, slot machines and blackjack. Today, 16 Las 
Vegas-style casinos dot the state, and spending on legal gambling has more than 
doubled -- from $1.6 billion in 1990 to $3.4 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gamblers must be 18 years or older to enter most Minnesota casinos, 
some teens boast about the ease with which their friends have been able to 
sneak past security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just go with a friend who's old enough and walk in while he's showing his ID 
to the guard," said one teen who was playing blackjack -- and losing -- 
recently at Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists say the constant barrage of casino advertisements has seduced 
teens into thinking gambling is as harmless as a Nintendo game. 
</P>
<P>
 Billboards promoting Treasure Island boast of "more ways to play and win." 
Television ads for Mystic Lake casino in the Minneapolis suburb of Prior Lake 
tell viewers, "You're a lot luckier than you think." The Minnesota Twins even 
had a tie-in with casino gambling last season, promising a chosen few a free 
turn at Treasure Island's "cash tornado" if the home team won. 
</P>
<P>
 And because gambling has the properties kids love -- instant gratification, 
blood-pumping excitement -- some experts believe they're more liable to get 
into trouble once they start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens who win just get an enormous ego boost from gambling," Lesieur said. "A 
teen can hope to work at maybe $4.50 an hour if they're lucky. Here, they 
gamble and can win $80 on a pull-tab. That's big money." 
</P>
<P>
 Faherty knows that lure all too well. While attending college at the 
University of Minnesota-Duluth, it drew him regularly to the Fond du Luth 
Casino, just a few miles from his dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 During his sophomore year, the same year he started supporting himself, live 
blackjack made its debut at the casino -- and his gambling habit spiraled out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm thinking, 'I can turn $20 into $100,' " he recalled. "It got to the 
point where I would take an entire paycheck with me and lose it and fall behind 
on rent. The cards just weren't falling." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no catching up. By the summer of 1992, he was broke and constantly 
lying to his parents. One fateful weekend, he decided to win some of it back 
during a road trip with friends. But he ended up losing so much money at a 
Hudson, Wis., dog track that his rent check and several others would have 
bounced if his parents had not bailed him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without their understanding and help, there's no way I would have survived," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambling counselors cite common examples of high schools' holding mock casino 
nights to keep students from drinking, and lottery tickets stuffed in 
youngsters' Christmas stockings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults don't realize it's any more dangerous than spitting on the sidewalk," 
said Betty George, executive director of the Minnesota Council on Compulsive 
Gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 A Minnesota study has found that young gamblers are increasingly raising their 
sights -- from sports and other informal betting to lottery playing, scratch 
tabs and video gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trend in an uncomfortable direction. . . . There's the lure of 
big-time winning," said Ken Winters, who conducted the study for the University 
of Minnesota's Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prevention and treatment for teens are more widely available in 
states such as New Jersey, it's often a different story in states less 
accustomed to widespread gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools teach about drugs and 
alcohol, but neither district has a program on gambling. That will depend on 
the results of an upcoming statewide survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to assume we have a problem is almost putting the cart before the 
horse," said Jay Ettinger, assistant director for guidance at St. Paul public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesieur and others disagree. "We have to treat it like we treat alcohol," he 
said. "Underage gambling shouldn't be tolerated because of its potential. . . . 
To achieve your self-worth through gambling is extremely risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Faherty, now a newspaper reporter in Duluth, hasn't gambled since June, aside 
from a single lottery ticket he purchased over the summer. He said he's 
grateful to have stopped before winding up in jail or hurting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But others might not be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess," Faherty said, "is that there's a lot more people like me out 
there. Kids think it's just another acceptable thing to do."

DAM-BUILDING FERVOR WANES IN U.S. BUT PICKS UP STEAM IN THIRD WORLD; 
ENVIRONMENT: EVEN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION IS GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS. 
MASSIVE PROJECTS ARE CONSIDERED TOO HARD ON PEOPLE, ECOSYSTEMS. 
</P>

 Dam it. Dirty words today -- they have become so sensitive that some of the 
biggest dam builders in the nation and the world don't even want to whisper 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, once one of the premier dam 
builders in the American West, out of the dam-building business; its spokesmen 
say it no longer acts as technical consultant for such colossal foreign 
projects as China's Three Gorges Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's largest hydroelectric project, the dam is expected to cost at 
least $10 billion, displace a million people, destroy a natural wonder on the 
Yangtze River and take 15 years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank, the single largest international source of money for water 
projects, is financing fewer and fewer dams, because they have become so 
controversial, sources say. The bank recently canceled the final portion of its 
loan for India's Sardar Sarovar Dam, which rivals the Three Gorges in scale and 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant dam projects have proliferated in the last 50 years as the primary means 
of supplying water and generating hydropower -- often without regard to social 
and ecological consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists contend that U.S. experts shouldn't compound past ecological 
catastrophes by continuing to provide engineering models to the rest of the 
dam-building world. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, more than 35,000 large dams rise above 50 feet in height, and more 
than 110 giants, classified as "megadams," tower higher than 450 feet. 
Two-thirds of the megadams built in the 1980s are in developing countries. 
Soaring nearly 1,000 feet, the Nurek Dam in former Soviet Tajikistan is the 
highest anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What U.S. dam builders accomplished in less than half a century is considered 
so extraordinary that it can be compared to a geological force -- except that 
it happened almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mightiest thing ever built by a man," Woody Guthrie sang in 1941 of Grand 
Coulee Dam in Washington state, which has the greatest megawatt output in the 
United States and the third-largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tennessee Valley Authority, created in 1933, controls 47 dams that 
generate power for a once underdeveloped region, helps control flooding, fills 
reservoirs for water sports and eases river navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75,000 dams of all sizes operate in the United States. But the glow has 
gone off water development. Many of the best sites have been used up. Only 9% 
of river miles in the lower 48 states remain undeveloped, said Kevin J. Coyle, 
president of American Rivers, a conservation organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The belief that big projects serve everyone has been tarnished by the image of 
rampant congressional pork barrel. Power dams in particular upset ecosystems. 
And many people regret the dam-caused loss of scenic wonders such as Glen 
Canyon on the Colorado River in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big trend now is dam removal. We are moving beyond the view that dams, 
once built, are a permanent feature of the landscape," said Matthew Huntington 
of American Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the "age of dams" has ended in the United States, massive 
dam-building continues virtually unabated in developing countries. With an 
international- community-be-damned posture, some national governments such as 
Malaysia's are bypassing the World Bank and financing multibillion-dollar dams 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's research laboratory in Denver has produced 
models and blueprints for water projects all around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 With its new mandate to engage in water-resource management and environmental 
restoration, the bureau is winding down its technical-support effort overseas, 
said Lisa Guide, a bureau spokeswoman in Washington. "Large-scale 
water-retention basins (dams) are no longer economically and environmentally 
feasible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that as the United States downsizes its dam-building, the 
developing countries are building dams using our approach and models," said 
Deborah Moore, a staff scientist for the New York-based Environmental Defense 
Fund. "We are now seeing the long-term effects, and others are not learning 
from these lessons. If we had it to do over, we'd probably do it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank's new international water resources management policy, 
announced in mid-September, states that the bank will take "a comprehensive 
approach" to solving water scarcity, pollution and environmental problems. Such 
an approach would consider the ecological impact on entire watersheds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore said that the new policy "begs the question about whether it will 
avoid creating more Sardar Sarovar disasters" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof will be in the bank's lending pipeline, which still contains the 
large-scale-dam approach," she said. "Will we see a dramatic decline in 
investments for such costly projects?" The bank said it supports fewer than 8% 
of the dams under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sardar Sarovar, on the Narmada River, is under review by the Indian 
government, said Lori Udall, an attorney in Washington for the EDF, which has 
worked with grass-roots environmental groups in India for seven years to stop 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dam wall (now 230 feet high) may be completed, but the project will never 
be finished without international financing," she predicted. Most of the 13,000 
people who have been resettled so far are still living in windowless tin sheds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. government is not involved in India's dam, it is modeled 
after those in the American West. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most enormous water projects ever designed on the North American 
continent, the James River hydroelectric project in Canada's Quebec Province 
now attracts more international engineering attention than the pioneering U.S. 
dams. If completed, the Hydro-Quebec undertaking would include at least 30 
major dams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the real dam-building is going on in countries like China. They have 
about 250 under construction," said Larry D. Stephens, executive director of 
the Denver-based U.S. Committee on Large Dams, an association of engineers and 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, China's Three Gorges will produce as much hydroelectric power 
as the world's two largest dams combined, the Guri (Raul Leon) in Venezuela and 
the Itaipu on the Brazil-Paraguay border.

 Forty illegal immigrants, most of them from India, were found hidden in a 
sewer in Mexico's western state of Guerrero apparently waiting to be picked up 
by smugglers and transported into the United States, the attorney general's 
office said Friday. 
</P>

1,500 MARCH IN PROTEST OF PROPOSED CURBS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Demonstrators marched from the Eastside to City Hall on Saturday to protest 
proposals that would curb the rights of illegal immigrants and to decry the 
surge of immigrant-bashing in California. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 people took part in the peaceful protest, which began at 
Indiana Street and Brooklyn Avenue and proceeded four miles to the Civic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was organized by the Proposition One Coalition, which favors an 
initiative extending the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act to allow 
amnesty recipients more time to become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition hopes to distribute 26,000 petitions and is urging residents, 
legal or not, to sign them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immigrants are at the bottom of the totem pole and are continually the 
victims of government officials because they can't defend themselves," said 
Kevin de Leon, spokesman for One Stop Immigration and Educational Center, one 
of the coalition organizers. "We want to encourage all immigrants to become U.S 
citizens and vote against those same people in office who verbally attack 
them."

CENTER FOR CITY WORKERS' KIDS OPENS

<P>
 Because both of them work at Torrance City Hall, Judy Emerson and her husband, 
Alan, worried that their three children might be stranded miles away at day 
care near their home in Lomita if an earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 So 1 1/2 years ago, they moved to Torrance so the family would all be in the 
same city during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, they brought their family even closer by enrolling the children in 
a new city-sponsored day-care program that gives priority to city employees. 
Although other large employers contract for day care, Torrance is the first 
South Bay city to sponsor a child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 3 1/2-year-old twins Autumn and Shane spend their days only blocks from 
City Hall. And 6-year-old Jade goes to school just up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent $250,000 to turn part of a boarded-up elementary school into a 
day-care center for 82 children 6 weeks to 5 years old, said Leyta Fuentes, a 
city employee who served on the Torrance Child Care Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, City Kids, operated by Children's Discovery Center, opened at 1520 
Greenwood St., the former site of the Greenwood School. The center has 29 
children, all but three with parents or guardians who work at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the center on the condition that it support itself 
through fees after the start-up costs, Councilman Mark Wirth said. The school 
will rely on the city for basic upkeep, such as plumbing and lawn care. 
</P>
<P>
 The center charges $122 a week for infants; $102 for children age 18 months to 
36 months, and $82 for children age 36 months to 5 years, which Emerson said is 
less expensive than what she used to pay for the twins in home care.

A NUCLEAR WORRIER; BRENTWOOD: HAROLD WILLENS, WHO LAUNCHED THE NUCLEAR FREEZE 
INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA IN 1981, HAS WORKED EVER SINCE TO HALT THE SPREAD OF 
WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Willens is no nuclear warrior -- he's a nuclear worrier.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, this writer, retired businessman and former Marine, now 
approaching his 80th birthday, has done more than most to boost the public's 
awareness of the dangers of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, when the United States and Soviet Union were in the thick of the 
nuclear arms race, Willens launched the nuclear freeze initiative in 
California. His goal was not only to educate people about nuclear arms, but 
also to call attention to the spread of such weapons to unstable countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was Proposition 12, a non-binding initiative of fewer than two 
dozen words that called for an end to the manufacture, research and 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. It was passed in November, 1982, with 51% of 
the vote, and helped move the nuclear arms issue higher on the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends criticized me for raising and spending $4 million for something that 
would not become law, but something much more important happened: breaking 
through the iron curtain of misinformation and misunderstanding and the 
remarkable opportunity to educate about the spread of this cancer on the 
international body politic we call the world," Willens said from his home in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Willens saw firsthand what one bomb can do when he was a Marine intelligence 
officer during World War II. Trained to read, write and speak Japanese, he 
arrived in Hiroshima weeks after the bomb was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he said, he did not object to the use of the bomb because he 
considered the alternative -- the invasion of Japan -- unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no epiphany at that ime. I was stunned by the destruction of one 
bomb, but I was also awed and felt great relief because I was aware of the plan 
to invade Japan. I felt a general pride of being part of the military effort 
and today still think I did the right thing in that war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The epiphany came 15 years later, when he was a guest at a think tank 
discussing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "A match lit up inside of me. Something intellectual and visceral came 
together that said to me that (a) Soviet-American arms race was a time bomb 
which would destroy the whole world," he said. "Rational people, like 
Eisenhower, opposed the use of nuclear weapons and recognized that we couldn't 
survive a nuclear war, but there were those who thought we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Willens did not rest after the nuclear freeze initiative won passage. After 
the measure's approval, Gov. Jerry Brown planned to present it to President 
Ronald Reagan. But the White House turned Brown down. Then, Sen. Alan Cranston 
tried and he was refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Willens found the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helping us in that campaign was Reagan's daughter, Patti. We became friends. 
I visited her and explained how if I couldn't deliver the initiative 
personally, a lot of media attention would be focused on it," Willens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She reached for the phone, dialed and said, 'I want to speak to Daddy.' She 
said, 'Hi, Daddy, I'm sitting here with Harold Willens,' and she explains to 
him the responsibility he has to millions of people. Reagan referred me to 
Michael Deaver, who tried to talk me out of it. I told him I already have plans 
to stage a major march around the White House and he agreed to set up the 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Willens remembers staying up all night before the meeting, carefully preparing 
his presentation. Then he met with Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all alone except for the photographer. I said our daughters were 
friends, that I was a Marine, a businessman. . . . He responded with cliches, 
political catechisms, and when the 15 minutes was over I left totally dejected, 
feeling my grandchildren didn't have a prayer," Willens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unforgettable and also depressing that I had just spoken to the man 
who didn't see the Russians as human beings and who had his finger on the 
button." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Willens was born in Russia in a small town near Kiev and came to the 
United States when he was 8 years old. He lived in Boyle Heights with other 
immigrant families -- all struggling to survive the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the economic deprivations, Willens found hope to be the dominant 
feeling among fellow immigrants. It was during those years, he says, that he 
developed the kind of fearlessness he would later need to take unpopular 
stands. Working a 60-hour, $10-a-week job, he still managed to graduate from 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to become a wealthy man, making real estate investments and 
starting a machine parts and equipment supply company. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Willens thinks the danger from a nuclear catastrophe is greater than in 
the most frigid days of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, he says, is that during the half-century of the nuclear age, the 
United States has been guilty of a demeaning double standard: preaching nuclear 
abstention while practicing precisely the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's it going to take?" he asked, "Pakistan attacking India with nuclear 
weapons?" The United States, Willens says, would be the logical leader of 
worldwide non-proliferation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics, he says the United States does not need a large arsenal of nuclear 
weapons to be secure. To the press, he says don't lump chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons together, because nuclear arms pose by far the greatest threat. 
</P>
<P>
 And to young people, he says be a citizen -- not a resident -- and don't wait 
until you're a senior citizen to do it.

INVENTOR ZAPPING OIL SPILLS WITH DRY ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started with the Huntington Beach oil spill in 1990, when Tim Beck 
stood on the beach watching a black tide of crude oil heading into shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kept getting closer and closer (to the beach)), and nobody showed up 
to save the day," says Beck, 45, a Manhattan Beach inventor and, to make ends 
meet, an El Segundo substitute science teacher. "I started thinking there had 
to be some way to stop an oil spill." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it came to him. Why not use massive heat extraction? In other words, why 
not freeze the oil? Turn the liquid oil spill into a frozen oil spill -- an 
"oilberg" as Beck calls it. Then you could simply pluck the chunks of oil right 
off the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck's first idea for freezing oil spills was to use liquid nitrogen, which at 
nearly minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit is plenty cold enough to freeze oil or 
almost anything else. Only problem was, it's so cold that it might also freeze 
the oil-spill workers along with the oil. He had to scratch that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Beck thought about using frozen carbon dioxide -- that is, dry ice -- as 
the heat extraction agent. The only problem was that oil experts said dry ice, 
at minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit, isn't cold enough to freeze crude oil. Beck 
discovered that it was indeed cold enough, once the gases contained in crude 
oil dissipated into the air.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally Beck found a company in Rancho Cucamonga, Alpheus Cleaning 
Technologies, that manufactures dry ice pellets for "ice blasting," which is 
like sandblasting except that dry ice is used. For about 15 cents a pound, the 
company sells dry ice pellets about an eighth of an inch long and about the 
thickness of spaghetti -- small enough to float, big enough to freeze oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck started taking his idea to oil companies, seeking financing to continue 
the experiments. But he had a hard time finding backers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, Beck says he found an oil company that put about $50,000 
into his research program. He put another $20,000 of his own money into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were encouraging, Beck says. During one experiment he managed to 
create a 500-pound "oilberg," demonstrating the feasibility of the process on 
bigger-than-a-mud puddle spills.

 The massive Los Angeles Unified School District, which will undergo an 
unprecedented restructuring in the coming months, should be broken into 24 
autonomous groups of high schools and their feeder campuses, according to a 
report to be submitted to Supt. Sid Thompson on Monday. . 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were drafted by a committee of teachers, administrators 
and parents who answered an invitation from Thompson in November to help decide 
how to radically reshape the 845-school district. "I think this has been an 
opportunity for us all to learn how to do things better at our schools and to 
learn how to work in a more collaborative manner," said Marianne Hudz, a parent 
and chairwoman of the committee charged with reconfiguring the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say the report is badly flawed because committee meetings were 
unwieldy and marred by uneven attendance. Votes were tainted when large groups 
of people from one community packed some meetings to get their suggestions 
approved, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (Thompson) ignores it," said Harriet Sculley, a cluster committee 
member and president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. district that serves the San 
Fernando Valley. "Whoever was the loudest or first to scream or whoever brought 
the most people from their neighborhood got what they wanted. . . . People were 
not willing to step out and say what is the greater good for the whole 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudz said that the task of reconfiguring the district's 49 high schools "was 
like riding a wild horse. The democratic process is very messy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, she said, "I believed the process worked and anyone who complains 
about it not having worked, all I can do is say we afforded as much opportunity 
as we could for input." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee primarily used community identity and student populations to 
determine the groups. One of its first orders of business was a vocabulary 
lesson. A cluster is a self-governing group of one to three high schools and 
the nearby middle and elementary schools that provide students for them.  
</P>
<P>
 After lengthy debates, the committee voted to split the district's 49 high 
schools and their feeder campuses into clusters that range from the small 
Sylmar-Verdugo Hills cluster with 17,074 students to the super-cluster of Bell, 
Huntington Park and South Gate high schools with 54,850 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Five high schools and their feeders -- Belmont, Garfield, Roosevelt, San Pedro 
and San Fernando -- should be individual clusters either because of their large 
student populations or distinct neighborhood affiliations, the committee 
recommended. Thompson said he intends to put the cluster plan up for more 
public discussion at school board meetings and will turn over his decision to 
the school board in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important part of all this is the fact that these are recommendations," 
Thompson said. "If people still want to put their 2 cents in they should send 
it to me and I'll accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 At least three groups that are upset with the recommendations will be 
submitting minority reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades High School and its feeder schools want to be an individual cluster, 
Palisades Principal Merle Price said. Already, those schools have one of the 
most sophisticated collaborations in the district with all eight elementary and 
middle schools in the area working closely with Palisades High School on 
curriculum and other issues. Four campuses are in the state's charter school 
program, which give schools more decision-making freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Fremont High School in Watts wants to be clustered with Locke High 
instead of Jordan High because it already shares services with Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of parents has complained that the Bell-Huntingtion 
super-cluster is too big. 
</P>
<P>
 Grouping the district into clusters forms the backbone of a sweeping plan to 
transform the nation's second-largest school system from a centrally operated 
bureaucracy into smaller, more manageable units. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan would end a nearly 25-year-old system of regional 
offices, each run by an assistant superintendent and a cadre of administrators 
who issue orders to schools. Services such as maintenance, accounting and 
special programs, which are run from Downtown offices, will be handed over to 
the clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the new school clusters would be free to design their own 
instructional programs to develop higher-achieving students from kindergarten 
through high school. The smaller configurations would allow teachers to do a 
better job of tracking students from elementary to secondary schools. Clusters 
would be free to share resources such as janitors, school equipment and staff 
and parent training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluster restructuring was designed to complement two other major reform 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's LEARN plan shifts virtually every aspect of school management 
to principals, who must collaborate with teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only 34 schools are involved in the first LEARN phase launched last 
year, another 60 schools will be added this spring and all the schools are 
expected to be on board within five years. High School Clusters 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a draft list of school clusters proposed to begin next fall in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. Each cluster would include one or more high 
schools and feeder elementary and middle schools. Schools in a cluster will 
share services and decision-making. 03,15,09,12 HIGH FEEDER SCHOOLS SCHOOLS

BILL BOYARSKY: GAINING THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday night, I finished writing a piece about Christy Lynne Hamilton, the 
slain Los Angeles police officer, and headed home, tired and troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 My editor and I had worked hard on the column, going through all the editing 
tasks we do at the paper to make our writing clear and strong. Still, my 
fatigue didn't explain the feeling of frustration that gripped me as I drove 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 My editor had wanted something from the column that I couldn't give. He 
wondered if there weren't some words of comfort, some answers, I could offer a 
city in which so many good people -- young and old alike -- are murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I said. There's nothing we can do. Christy Hamilton was a victim of random 
violence. It's haphazard, deadly, liable to strike at any time, at a bus stop, 
at an ATM, as you walk along the street, as you sleep in your house. I know 
about random violence because my family was struck by it more than a decade ago 
and that event has affected our lives ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our youngest daughter was beaten with a hammer and left for dead when a 
burglar found her sleeping alone in our house one summer morning. Eventually, 
Jennifer recovered. She is now a nurse who has cared for many other victims of 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not religious, but I think I believe in God. On my infrequent visits to a 
synagogue, I would ask God how this could have been permitted to occur. I never 
got an answer and eventually quit asking. I still don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 If we had had better locks on our doors, the burglar might not have been able 
to break in. But that isn't certain. I brooded over the locks for a long time, 
blaming myself, imagining I could impose enough control on life to guarantee my 
family's safety. Finally, I realized the best locks can be broken and that the 
streets my daughter walked on were more dangerous than her own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Our friends were wonderful. But when we talked about the assault, I could see 
they were searching for some constructive lesson, a survival skill that could 
be gleaned from this experience.  
</P>
<P>
 The most common question was: "Did they catch the guy?" Eventually the police 
caught a man they believed did it. But it was hard to understand why people 
cared so much about a point that was almost irrelevant to us. I believe in 
swift and severe punishment, but it would not make my family feel any better or 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally figured it out. People felt that the capture of a criminal would 
make them feel safer. It would show society was in control. A thug would be 
removed from the street and a long prison sentence would send a message to 
others like him. Justice would be served. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a comforting thought. It's what drives lawmakers to build more prisons 
and increase sentences. But given the reality of L.A., with all its guns and 
drugs, another law is much more relevant: being in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I got home Tuesday night and walked into our house, the same one my daughter 
was attacked in. The thought of moving hadn't occurred to us. Our friends 
washed away the blood. It was our family home and nobody was going to force us 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I told my wife about the dialogue I'd had at the office. We talked about 
whether there was anything more I could say about Officer Christy Hamilton's 
death, in light of our own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I thought about it, some lessons occurred to me. They're nothing big, 
no 10-point program to guarantee safe streets, nothing to really stop the 
random violence that has gotten much worse since my daughter was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 I had learned something about courage by watching my daughter recover, become 
a nurse and then work in a dangerous and bloody county hospital surgical 
emergency room. The lesson: We can't run away from society's dangers, nor can 
we permit them to run our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson 2: We, as individuals, have a responsibility to make our society as 
safe as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's killer, 17-year-old Christopher Golly, was addicted to speed, 
methamphetamine, a drug that makes you act crazy. Yet a family friend said his 
father gave him a semiautomatic rifle so they could share a common interest. 
Hadn't the father, who was killed by the son, ever heard of fishing, or sports 
or reading -- or church? Giving that kid a gun was sending him down the path to 
murder and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the kid's friends? They knew he was headed down that path. They 
should have intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 My final thought is that we, as individuals, are all in this together. We've 
got to draw strength from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw this a few weeks ago. Our next-door neighbors had been burglarized. 
Rather than sitting around bemoaning their fate, they had called the local 
police station and invited a cop out to help us organize a Neighborhood Watch 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 These groups are part of an overall Los Angeles Police Department strategy 
called community-based policing. Residents like us keep our eyes open and our 
houses secure. If we see someone poking around a neighbor's house, we call the 
cops. The cops, for their part, know us and treat us as friends and 
collaborators, rather than patrolling the streets as if they were an occupying 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 This being L.A., it was the first time I had met some of my neighbors. We sat 
around and talked. A friendly cop filled us in on crime prevention moves. We 
put together a list of our names and phone numbers. It all made sense, 
certainly more sense than waiting for Sacramento or Washington to pass some 
complicated crime-fighting bill. It fit in with my belief in not running away, 
and in individual responsibility. Here, on this block, we neighbors would make 
our stand. 
</P>
<P>
 We've got our list now. We know some of our neighbors better. I know it's a 
dangerous world. I don't walk to the 7-Eleven late at night. But I've taken a 
small step to stop the threat of random violence from overcoming our lives.

LATINO MEMBERS ANGERED BY PLAN TO EVANGELIZE CHINESE AT CHURCH; CATHOLICS: 
ARCHDIOCESE IS TRANSFERRING THE ONLY SPANISH-SPEAKING PRIEST AT ST. THOMAS 
AQUINAS. CLERGY LEADERS SAY PARISHIONERS ARE OVERREACTING TO THE CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Ramirez is a humble man, a devout Catholic who sprinkles his 
conversations with references to "Our Lord Jesus." But these days, Ramirez says 
the Lord is telling him to prepare for a righteous fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Ramirez and hundreds of fellow parishioners at St. Thomas Aquinas 
Catholic Church in Monterey Park see it, the archdiocese of Los Angeles is 
trying to take away the parish where they have worshiped for 30 years, seen 
their children and grandchildren married, and celebrated Mexican holy days such 
as Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese wants to turn the predominantly Latino church into a center 
for winning Chinese-Americans over to Catholicism. Plans call for removing the 
parish's only Spanish-speaking priest and installing two Chinese-speaking 
priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that what they are doing is in the best interest of the people, 
but how can it be in the best interest of our community when 75% of the parish 
is of Mexican descent and they're sending us no priests who speak Spanish?" 
Angelina Castanjeto asked angrily in Spanish, the language in which she feels 
most comfortable. "This church was built with the hands of Latinos from East 
Los Angeles and now we are being marginalized." 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials say parishioners are overreacting to minor changes that will 
barely affect the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The archdiocese has an obligation to evangelize the Chinese community," said 
Father Peter Ling, associate pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas. "Many good Catholics 
from Taiwan and Hong Kong come here and they become pagan. We're going to reach 
out to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the anger has reached such a pitch that some members are boycotting the 
collection plate, others are vowing to leave and one longtime benefactor 
stopped taking out ads in the weekly church bulletin. Many of the church's 
Chinese Americans also are upset, and both groups express concerns that changes 
will drive an ugly racial spike into a harmonious and tolerant multiethnic 
parish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are Chinese from Hong Kong, this is the United States. America is 
a mixture of all races, and (the archdiocese) shouldn't just cater to 
Orientals," Audrey Lock said. "We're happy with our present situation, so why 
change it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese has long intended to mount an aggressive evangelical effort 
targeting the San Gabriel Valley's rapidly expanding Chinese American 
population and says that Monterey Park, where 37% of residents are of Chinese 
origin, according to the 1990 census, is the place to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the church has made few inroads. Archdiocesan officials say Catholics 
make up only 2.5% of Los Angeles County's 245,000 residents of Chinese descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,200 parish families, only about 20 are of Chinese ancestry. The 
weekly Chinese language Mass is held in the rectory chapel each Sunday because 
of the tiny turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese two weeks ago unveiled plans to build a Chinese community 
center at St. Thomas Aquinas to reach potential converts. It also plans to move 
a Chinese language school for children, the Ming Yuan Institute, to church 
grounds, putting profits into efforts to evangelize Chinese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese-language Masses at nearby parishes will be consolidated at St. Thomas 
Aquinas. And the church, which until now has had one Spanish-speaking priest 
and one Chinese-speaking priest, will have three priests who speak Chinese and 
none who speak Spanish. Father Delos A. Humphrey, who spent more than 30 years 
as a missionary in Taiwan, takes over Tuesday as pastor. The church is also 
transferring in Father Stephen Liu, who speaks very little English. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese is moving out Spanish-speaking pastor Father Brian Cavanagh, 
who headed the congregation for 18 years and by all accounts reached out to 
every minority group. The church says it will meet the needs of Latino members 
by inviting priests from other parishes to say Sunday Mass in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanagh has declined to comment on the archdiocese's decision to transfer 
him. When he introduced Humphrey as his successor last Sunday, Cavanagh urged 
parishioners to stay calm and stop listening to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes have infuriated many, who point out that elderly Latino 
parishioners and newer immigrants who do not speak English will no longer have 
a priest in residence who can minister to them on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy threatens to turn the two ethnic groups against each other 
when leaders from both communities throughout the west San Gabriel Valley are 
trying to mend fences after a number of racially motivated incidents in 
schools. Latinos, for generations a dominant group in the southwestern part of 
the valley, have seen recent Chinese immigrants change the face of their 
neighborhoods and open hundreds of businesses. The two groups have been working 
together on a multicultural task force and have lobbied successfully for a 
conflict resolution class to be taught in the Alhambra public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The church was one place where tensions tended to disappear -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Each May the parish throws a fund-raising fiesta where members sample each 
other's cuisine and music. Their children attend the parish school together. 
Sometimes they marry each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, conversations are taking on charged overtones as some Latinos view the 
changes as one more example of how newcomers are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the strangest thing I've ever heard," said Salli Ramirez, (no relation 
to Eddie) who wears a silver cross on her chest that says "Jesus es mi senor."  
</P>
<P>
 "These Chinese aren't even Catholic, and they're building a center here that 
we can't belong to. You can just imagine what it'll be like when they have 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bitter," said Connie Ortega after Mass on a recent Sunday. "You work so 
hard for so many years and you see it taken out from under you. . . . In 
another year this will all be a Chinese institution and we'll get pushed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, some Chinese American parishioners plan to leave because of the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Chinese, but I am also fair, and this is not the proper way," said Mimi 
Chen, who says she plans to quit her parish of 30 years in protest. "We already 
have one Chinese priest, we don't need three. I don't see any Mexican priests 
here. I think as Catholics we should all be united, but the priests are making 
the Chinese and the Latinos upset at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Villajin, a Filipino American, agreed. "We don't mind if St. Thomas 
Aquinas Church reaches out to the Chinese, but the church is supposed to be for 
everyone, regardless of ethnicity. Our concern is that it's going to be for one 
ethnic group only." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Chinese American parishioners fear that they will become scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese people are caught in the middle of this right now, as if they are 
to be blamed," said Sister Lucia Tu, director of the Asian Pacific ministry at 
the archdiocese. Parishioners led by Eddie Ramirez have requested a meeting 
with Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. But angered because they received no response, 
about 100 people demonstrated in front of his residence at St. Vibiana 
Cathedral in Downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The archdiocese thinks that the Latino community is passive, that we'll 
accept anything without questioning it," Ramirez said. "But we are going to 
fight this." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park City Councilwoman Rita Valenzuela, a longtime member of St. 
Thomas Aquinas, has written Mahony two letters, asking for a meeting. More than 
250 parishioners have signed a petition asking the archdiocese to reconsider 
its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Thomas Curry, secretariat for Ethnic Ministry at the archdiocese, which 
is implementing the changes, said he is astounded at the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit at a loss to explain why they're so terribly concerned," 
Curry said. "There's some nervousness whenever there's change, but we've 
emphasized over and over that this is not a major change. We've assured them 
they're not being pushed out. We're just adding something to the parish." 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming pastor Humphrey, a Maryknoll priest who speaks fluent Chinese, says 
he intends to reassure his new flock that all Latino-oriented ministries such 
as Spanish-language Masses, Bible study groups and charismatic prayer groups 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey also intends to study Spanish and will look for a priest who has 
experience in Mexico or South America to help out at St. Thomas Aquinas. But 
church officials concede that Southern California has a shortage of 
Spanish-speaking priests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few in the church are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnes Lung-Tam, a Catholic who grew up in Monterey Park, calls the changes 
exciting and approves of efforts to reach out to the Chinese American 
population. She hopes that the parish can add a Mass in her native Cantonese to 
complement the Mass in Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also said the situation requires delicate handling. "I'd like to 
believe we're all Catholics, that we see a need for growth," Lung-Tam said. 
"But whenever there's a big influx, the existing community can feel slightly 
threatened or displaced." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few Latinos counseling a wait-and-see attitude is Maria Elena 
Rangel, 21, a psychology major at Cal State Northridge who attended the parish 
primary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's distrustful, but how do we know what's going to happen?" Rangel 
asked. "I feel sorry for the Chinese people. The way this thing is going, 
they're not even going to feel welcome here." 
</P>
<P>
 On Ash Wednesday, many of the 150 people who crowded into the parish hall for 
a tostada dinner after Mass recalled how they have sacrificed for their church. 
</P>
<P>
 While St. Thomas Aquinas was under construction in 1963, the faithful gathered 
on Sundays in a Monterey Park machine shop, where priests said Mass and 
everyone contributed enthusiastically to the collection plate, knowing that the 
money would buy bricks, mortar and stained glass for a church of their own. 
Now, they are upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart and Jennie Rando, parishioners since the day St. Thomas Aquinas opened, 
gave $5 instead of their usual $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Rando, an Italian American who has a small security company, has donated 
a security system for the tabernacle and sacristy, provided free patrols of the 
church grounds and taken out large ads in the church's weekly bulletin. But 30 
years of tradition have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got up at 6 a.m. this morning and canceled," Jennie Rando told the 
assembled parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't take our church away from us, we'll start donating . . . 
again," her husband said.

MCNALL REPORTEDLY TO SELL MOST OF KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce McNall's tentative plan to sell a piece of the Kings involves divesting 
himself of about two-thirds of the club, sources familiar with the deal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage McNall is selling in the $60-million deal has until now been a 
well-kept secret. McNall and the prospective buyers have declined to reveal the 
percentage, citing a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But several sources confirmed that McNall will be parting with a majority of 
his interest in the club if the sale to Culver City telecommunications 
executive Jeffrey Sudkioff and associate Joseph Cohen goes through. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Sudikoff said Friday that the deal might not close for another two 
weeks due to factors such as the complexity of the deal and the 
later-than-expected signing of a new contract by King superstar Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction had been expected to close by the end of this month. Sudikoff 
is the chief executive and founder of IDB Communications, a fast-growing 
telecommunications company. His bid for the Kings beat a competing offer from 
an affiliate of Sony Corp., which wanted to buy a minority position in the 
Kings and also own a piece of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has said that the partial sale is needed to help finance a new 
state-of-the-art arena in Los Angeles where the Kings can play under more 
favorable financial conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations also involve Los Angeles Lakers and Forum owner Jerry Buss, with 
whom the Kings have a long-term lease. One scenario involves Buss joining in 
the arena development so that the new facility would house both the Kings and 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, a lawyer for McNall confirmed that the tentative sale 
will also allow McNall to rid himself of a major loan with Bank of America, 
which separate sources have described as a $90 million line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, 43, invested in the Kings in 1986 as a partner with Buss, assuming a 
majority interest two years later. The team's popularity has mushroomed since 
McNall's historic 1988 acquisition from the Edmonton Oilers of Gretzky, who is 
four goals short of tying Gordie Howe's all-time National Hockey League record 
for goals scored.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; JUMPS' GLITTER ISN'T GOLDEN FIGURE SKATING: 
KERRIGAN IMPRESSED WITH HER FIVE TRIPLES, BUT BAIUL'S PERFORMANCE WAS MORE 
ARTISTIC OVERALL, JUDGING REFEREE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In 30 years as an International Skating Union judge, the referee for the 
women's figure skating competition in the Winter Olympics said Saturday that 
she has never been involved in a more difficult decision than the one that gave 
Oksana Baiul of Ukraine the gold medal over Nancy Kerrigan of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Britta Lindgren of Sweden was not a member of the nine-member panel that 
judged the competition, but, as referee, it was her role to judge the judges. 
She said she would have given Kerrigan a higher mark for technical merit and 
Baiul a higher mark for artistic impression, but, ultimately, she agreed with 
the five judges who ranked the Ukrainian first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could say who was the better or worse," she said. "They were very, 
very similar. Five judges preferred Oksana, and four didn't. It could have been 
the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have to make a decision, and it's hard to do it in 20 seconds. It's 
not so easy to think of all these small details. It's sometimes more than you 
can handle. This was the most difficult decision I've ever seen. I think so, 
absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 With the figure skating competition concluded, the first four finishers in 
each discipline returned to the Olympic Amphitheatre Saturday for an exhibition 
before a capacity crowd of 6,000. But most of the discussion among the sport's 
officials focused on the judging in the women's freestyle program of the 
previous night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said she would not second-guess the judges because she had not seen 
Baiul's performance. But after her exhibition appearance, she said she was 
disappointed, based on what she had been told. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a little upsetting," she said. "I was flawless, I didn't have any 
touch-downs, I didn't make any mistakes. I was clean. She two-footed two 
jumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts said that Kerrigan should have been awarded the highest technical 
merit scores from all nine judges because she did five triple jumps. Three 
judges gave higher technical marks to Kerrigan, three to Baiul, and three had 
them even. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindgren said, however, that all nine judges were able to satisfactorily 
justify their scores in an event-review meeting Saturday morning. Kerrigan, she 
said, lost judges technically because she changed a planned triple flip to a 
double at the beginning of her four-minute program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy's triple-triple, that was the positive side for her," Lindgren said. 
"But it was felt that Nancy, first of all, didn't do the triple flip. Oksana 
had a very good triple lutz at the start, and she did a triple flip, even with 
a touch-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the spins of Oksana are very beautiful and maybe more interesting than 
Nancy's are. Oksana's flying spin for sure was better quality, and so was her 
step sequence. Nancy has one good step sequence and one good spiral, but it is 
only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not only the jumps that are important." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindgren added that Baiul could make a case that she should have been awarded 
higher artistic impression marks from all nine judges instead of only three. 
Three scored Kerrigan higher, and three had them even. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy was quite slow and careful with her skating," Lindgren said. "She is a 
little more cold as a skater. It's nice presentation, but it doesn't really 
come from inside. When Oksana presents a program, you can see it is coming from 
the heart, from inside. It's the difference between good presentation and a 
little better presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindgren made her remarks after an ISU news conference called at the behest of 
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch to discuss the 
controversy in Great Britain over last week's ice-dance judging. The British 
favorites, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, finished third behind two 
Russian teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But ISU officials also were asked whether the presence of Ukrainian judge 
Alfred Koritek on the women's panel represented a conflict of interest. He is 
the president of the Ukrainian figure skating federation and the father of 
Baiul's former coach. When his son left to coach in Canada, Koritek arranged 
for Baiul to train with her current coach, Galina Zmievskaya. 
</P>
<P>
 ISU rules prohibit judges from sitting on panels for competition in which 
family members are involved. But ISU vice president Lawrence Demmy of Great 
Britain said that the rule might be broadened in the future. Koritek gave 
first-place scores to Baiul in both the technical and freestyle programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The other judge in the women's competition who had an apparent conflict of 
interest was Germany's Jan Hoffman, the 1980 men's silver medalist who trained 
under Jutta Mueller. She coaches Katarina Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, however, placed Witt eighth and the other German skater, Tanja 
Szewczenko, sixth. He proved to be the decisive judge because his combined 
technical merit and artistic impression scores had Kerrigan and Baiul even, but 
he had Baiul scored higher for artistic impression, which is the tiebreaker in 
the freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 Demmy said that he would have scored Torvill and Dean first in the free dance 
last Monday night but said that they had points deducted because of two illegal 
moves. So did the winners, Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeni Platov, but their 
transgressions were less serious, he said.

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; FEW KNOW TROUBLES HE'S SEEN 
</P>

<P>
 No other ninth-graders at Anaheim Unified have been where he has been, seen 
what he has seen. One minute, he was playing soccer with his friends. Next, he 
was a boy with no face. What grotesquely remained of it was on CNN and on the 
cover of Newsweek, painted crimson with blood. Weeks later he was 8,000 miles 
from home and his life had been saved. His vision had not. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmates have scant awareness of what it must be like to be Sead Bekric, a 
war's most innocent bystander. His face is fresh and handsome as before, with 
few discernible scars. He is making friends. His English is improving daily. He 
takes math classes, typing, computer science. He is studying Braille. He can 
ride a bike. He plays basketball with a sonar device affixed to the ball, so he 
can hear where it is. 
</P>
<P>
 And at night, Sead Bekric returns to Anaheim Hills, to his mother, older 
sister, younger brother and the American family with whom they now dwell. How 
horrifying to be 16 years old and a war refugee, to be a casualty, a living 
symbol of a nation divided. Sead can see nothing now. But already he has seen 
so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Sead has been flown here to participate in tonight's closing ceremony of the 
Winter Olympics. With him is Anthony Maglica, 63, the California businessman 
who paid for Sead's airlift from Bosnia and for his surgery at UCLA, who for 
the last 10 months has given sanctuary to four people he had not previously 
known. Tony Maglica owns a firm in Ontario, Calif., that manufactures 
flashlights. Forty thousand of those flashlights will be illuminated at the 
climax of tonight's ceremony, as gestures of hope, candles of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one bears an inscription: 
</P>
<P>
 REMEMBER SARAJEVO 
</P>
<P>
 Sead remembers. He will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "If people learn, if they realize what is happening there, perhaps it 
will stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Sead's father, older brother and two other sisters are still in Bosnia, 
staying alive, staying low. The family had already been uprooted by the 
conflict that had turned Yugoslavs savagely against one another. Their home was 
burned. Expelled from their native village during an "ethnic cleansing," the 
Bekrics, Muslims fleeing Serbs, moved from town to town. They were making the 
best of a very bad situation when on April 16, 1993, without warning or even 
hint of imminent danger, Sead was passing time on a schoolyard in Srebrenica 
with other boys his age, kicking a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 There came an unforgettable, ear-splitting noise. A blast. Then cries for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer ball rolled away. Schoolboys lay in the dirt, screaming. They -- not 
professional soldiers, but youthful innocents -- had been deliberately targeted 
by Serbian artillery fire from the hills. When the dust around him cleared, 
Sead Bekric could see many of his new friends sprawled around the playground. 
Some of them were dead. He ran to one seriously wounded boy's side. Sead was 
kneeling beside him when there came one more tremendous explosion. That was his 
last conscious memory. 
</P>
<P>
 At a clinic in the city of Tuzla where he awakened, to which he and other 
Muslim refugees had been evacuated with the insistence of the United Nations, 
doctors toiled day and night to dislodge the shrapnel from Sead's eyes and 
disfigured features. It was more than merely a boy's face. It was a fright 
mask. And it was photogenically irresistible, this stricken youth on a 
stretcher, hands folded behind the head, that maimed grimace, that blood-caked 
turban of bandage. It was the gut-splitting image of this war. It was evocative 
of Vietnam and a photographer's vivid image of a helpless child, wailing amid 
the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sead's was a face that bespoke everything that was happening in his homeland, 
particularly once the CNN International television network flashed it around 
the world. The cover of the May 10, 1993, Newsweek printed one large, 
self-explanatory word across Sead Bekric's injured chest: "Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Tony Maglica already was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't get the scene out of his head. And he had never forgotten what had 
happened to his own family in Croatia, more than 60 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression had overwhelmed Tony's mother in the hard times of 1932 New 
York. A struggling Croatian immigrant, she was homesick and broke. So, bundling 
up her 2-year-old son, she returned overseas to the family farm. But once their 
village in Croatia was overrun by fascist troops, the Maglicas were forbidden 
to leave. They were trapped there until the end of World War II, and it wasn't 
until 1950 that Tony Maglica finally returned to the nation of his birth and 
got a job in California as a machinist. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, operating out of a garage, he began his own business. The 
one-man machine shop evolved into what is now the 600-employee, 
multimillion-dollar Mag Instrument, Inc., maker of a line of flashlights called 
the Mag-Lite. When war erupted in Bosnia, Maglica made sure shipments of 50,000 
of his six-inch black flashlights were hurried there to help those who had no 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Maglica said, "I had to do something. I couldn't just sit there." 
</P>
<P>
 What he did was set into motion an exhaustive effort to find Sead Bekric, the 
boy on TV, and fly him to America. With considerable assistance from a 
Connecticut relief organization called Ameri-Cares, the injured teen-ager was 
located and prepared to be evacuated. Maglica financed the airlift from Croatia 
and passage all the way to Los Angeles, 8,000 miles away. He volunteered his 
company's funds to cover countless hours of surgery at the Jules Stein Eye 
Institute on the campus of UCLA, where facilities were far superior to those 
Sead had known until then. Back in Tuzla, medics had to treat their patients 
without antibiotics, without anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he saw Sead in person, Maglica said, "He was so thin, I could 
pick him up with one hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Sead held that hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sead wouldn't let my hand go. I had to stay right by his hospital bed," 
Maglica said. "And yet he was so calm. His wounds were horrible, but his 
brother was there and he was taking care of his little brother, who was crying 
and absolutely terrified. Sead kept telling him, 'Don't worry, I'll be all 
right. Everything will be all right.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What a wonderful boy he is. And today, 16, he is almost like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Sead's sight was too far gone to save. His blindness will endure. But the 
surgeons at UCLA did remarkable things, nonetheless. They helped Sead survive a 
massive infection that was threatening his life. They also worked diligently on 
his features, to the point that now his scars are few, his face restored. He 
looks like any other Orange County teen-ager now. He is one. 
</P>
<P>
 For one more day, though -- this day -- Sead Bekric is back in Europe to 
embody wartime and its consequences, to shine a flashlight in its eye. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "People must see and they must help. It's the only hope we have." 
</P>
<P>
 He is symbolic of his people's grief. He is also symbolic of their salvation.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; SWISS SKI GREAT ADDS TO LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vreni Schneider wouldn't concede that winning the gold medal Saturday in 
slalom was a fitting way to end her Olympic career. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, it is unlikely that the Swiss star will still be beating back the 
teen-agers at the 1998 Nagano Games, but why start conceding? 
</P>
<P>
 Had she conceded that .68 of a second was too much time to make up on leader 
Katja Koren after the morning run, Schneider could have never made history with 
a seamless second run that allowed her to claim the gold by 1.79 seconds over 
runner-up Elfriede Eder of Austria, the silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Koren, from Slovenia, who had posted the fastest first-run time from the 33rd 
starting position, took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider might now stake a claim to the title of best female skier ever, 
which has long been held by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proll, who retired with 
62 World Cup victories and three Olympic medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is second on the all-time World Cup win list with 50, and the rest 
of her career ahead. Her victory Saturday was no upset. She had won five of the 
eight World Cup slaloms this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The race marked the first Olympic breakdown for the U.S. ski team. Of 
America's four starters, only Carrie Sheinberg completed the race, finishing 
18th. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning her third Alpine medal of these Games, Schneider became the first 
woman to win five of them. To the gold medals she won in giant slalom and 
slalom at the 1988 Calgary Games, she added this slalom gold, a silver in 
Alpine combined and a bronze in giant slalom.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been lean years for Schneider, particularly 1992, when she slumped 
badly and finished out of the medals at the Albertville Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were never concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My health is good," Schneider said. "I will listen to the voice inside myself 
about the future, in the spring. I prefer to enjoy this very great moment." 
</P>
<P>
 She had only the fifth-fastest time in the first run but, of those ahead of 
her, only Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg matched her in slalom savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Koren, Slovenia's comeback kid, won a super-G earlier this season from the 
66th start. When she shot into first on the first run from the 33rd position, 
her Olympic dream was already fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Koren squinted into the sun at the timing board, stared for a good 10 seconds, 
finally figured out she was first, then thrust her arms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe it was possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing last among top seeds in the second run, the 18-year-old Koren admitted 
she was just skiing for a medal. Schneider had posted an unbeatable time, and 
Eder was entrenched in second. 
</P>
<P>
 It was heady enough stuff that Koren could knock Wiberg, the gold medalist in 
combined, off the victory stand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second Olympic medal for Slovenia as an independent nation. Earlier 
in the week, Alenka Dovzan had won the bronze in combined. 
</P>
<P>
 These were proud moments for a nation that broke free from the former 
Yugoslavia in 1991, although Slovenians are offended that the Olympic computer 
information system has credited both medals to Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not Slovakia," Tone Vogrinec, the Slovenian coach, said. "It's a big 
difference, about 800 kilometers on the map." 
</P>
<P>
 Eder's silver was the second medal in these Games for the Austrian Alpine 
team, which has dominated the World Cup the last few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Austria's performance has obviously been affected by the death of Ulrike 
Maier, killed in a downhill race Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep on fighting," Eder, 24, said. "Life goes on. I tried to be 
like Ulli. I had a very strong image of Ulli, to fight the way she used to do."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; THIS TIME AROUND, TURNER IS DISQUALIFIED; 
SPEEDSKATING: AMERICAN CLAIMS THE DECISION IS RETALIATORY. U.S. MEN WIN THEIR 
FIRST SHORT-TRACK MEDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman other short-track speedskaters would most love to beat if only they 
could, the United States' Cathy Turner, received hate mail from a competitor, 
but that did not disturb her as much as the even harsher message sent to her 
Saturday night by International Skating Union judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, called "the dirtiest skater in short track" by a competitor, was 
disqualified in the semifinals of the 1,000 meters, an action she said was 
retaliation for the controversy she has been involved in since the opening 
night of the Winter Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two-time 500-meter champion, it was the first time in five races since 
short track became an Olympic sport in 1992 that she has not won a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. men, however, won their first short-track medal Saturday night inside the 
Olympic Amphitheatre, finishing second to Italy in the 5,000-meter relay with a 
team that included Eric Flaim. The 1988 runner-up in long track's 1,500 meters, 
he became the first person to win medals in both of speedskating's disciplines. 
Australia finished third for its first Winter Olympic medal ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver medal gave the Americans 13 medals, their most ever in the Winter 
Olympics. They won 12 in 1932 and 1980, both on home ice and snow in Lake 
Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most of the attention again was focused on the 31-year-old 
Turner, the former pop singer and Ice Capades headliner who dominates the sport 
both on an off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 When she won her 500-meter gold medal Thursday night, Chinese officials 
protested that she interfered in the final with second-place Zhang Yanmei, who 
was so upset that she refused to pose with Turner on the victory stand. 
</P>
<P>
 When Turner read her electronic mail in the athletes' village the next day, 
there was a message from an anonymous Canadian that told her to go to a place 
where the weather even in February is much warmer than Norway. Canadian 
officials later apologized to Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Canadian speedskaters complimented Turner Saturday night, saying that she 
skated one of her cleanest races in the semifinals and seemed puzzled that she 
was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Turner, who was called for a minor brush that she had with Zhang and 
South Korea's Kim So-Hee while passing them on a curve midway through the race. 
South Korea's Chun Lee-Kyung won the gold medal with a world record time in the 
final of 1:36.87. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel strongly that the judges were just waiting for me," Turner said. "I 
watched the videotape, and I couldn't believe it. I never did anything wrong 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great Olympics, and this doesn't hurt me at all. But what they're 
doing here with all of the controversy is really hurting the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch asked the ISU 
Friday for a report on the numerous protests and disqualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaranch was particularly concerned about Zhang's behavior on the victory 
stand and the perceived threat of violence against Turner by a competitor. 
Canadian Nathalie Lambert said Thursday that she hoped Turner would "get what 
she deserves" in Saturday night's race. Asked to elaborate, she said, 
"Something bad." What Turner got was a disqualification.

 The final two heats of four-man bobsled will help conclude the Winter Olympics

 U.S. drivers Randy Will and Brian Shimer -- 10th and 11th respectively after 
Saturday's first two heats -- are out of contention but not out of bizarre

 Improbable? It's as if those trolls of Norwegian legend are riding as brakemen 
for these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will, reacting to the February cold of Norway as if it were a sudden 
development, said the ice was too cold for his Austrian-made runners, the steel 
blades on which the sled rides. The ice of the Olympic chute was 13 degrees 
below zero Saturday. He said it needed to be 10 degrees warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two awesome trips," he said of the two runs. "The guys pushed their 
hearts out and I drove 100%, but our battle is with the temperature. If it's 
warmer, nothing beats me, but this is Norway. I need the DDG runners that the 
Swiss and Germans use. They're flying here." 
</P>
<P>
 Harald Czudaj, driver of Germany II, held a narrow lead over two bobsled 
legends heading into today's competition. Gustav Weder of Switzerland I was .12 
of a second behind, and Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany I was .18 of a second behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss claim to mold their own runners. The Germans use what are called 
DDGs, made by a factory in Dresden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be East Germany," Will said. "Now it's free enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Will, ninth in the 1992 Olympics and retiring after this race, consider 
buying DDGs in preparation for the cold? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the $5,000," he said. "I've already spent $70,000 on my 
equipment (he uses his own Italian-made sled) the last four years. I'm just a 
broke athlete having a blast here, trying to salvage some dignity and do my 
best for the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shame getting beat on a technical edge. They're just not going to 
beat us any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shimer employed the only DDGs to which the U.S. Bobsled Federation had 
access. In a strange twist, they were rented from driver Bruce Rosselli, who 
failed to qualify for the Olympic team while using them and subsequently named 
Shimer and the federation in a conspiracy suit that was rejected in arbitration 
and in court. Now Shimer and the federation are promising to sue Rosselli for 
libel and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, on the eve of the Olympics, Shimer went to an on-and-off the ice 
antagonist for runners he has never used before, but that's not all. He also 
chose to drive a new sled, borrowing the Bo-Dyn sled that has been used by Jim 
Herberich, who was eliminated by Will and Shimer in a race-off for the two U.S. 
Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a little chancy?  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but you never know how sleds are going to perform under different 
conditions," Shimer said. "The way we were going in the system we were using, 
I'd have struggled to finish in the top 10, and I didn't come this far to do 
that. I mean, I know it's a little late for a fresh start, but I thought it was 
worth the risk. Besides, there are three different setups with the Bo-Dyn, and 
we put the steering system off my sled into this one, so it wasn't entirely 
new." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer jumped from 13th to 11th with the ninth-best time in the second heat 
and said he was excited about that and the opportunity to move up even more 
when he starts early in the third heat on clean ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could be 2 1/2 seconds faster or more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time Olympian, Shimer plans to continue, enthusiastic about the Bo-Dyn 
project and his hope it will make as much progress in runner development as it 
has in only two years with the sled itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they continue to receive financial support, we should have more than one 
or two options by the time of the next Olympics," Shimer said, referring to 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Will: "If I was four years younger and not married I'd be staying with 
the Bo-Dyn project, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of him will be. He said that he had sold his runners to the Bo-Dyn 
interests. Don't look for their future use in Norway, however. It tends to be 
brisk here in February.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; PARISIEN FAILS IN SLALOM, SAYS SHE MIGHT 
RETIRE AT 22; SKIING: AMERICAN CITES THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER IN DECEMBER OF 
'92 AND ADDS THAT SHE IS "JUST RUINED RIGHT NOW." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Parisien, despite the emotional gulf separating her from her best days, 
somehow felt obligated to win Saturday's slalom, improbable as her chances 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 Obligated to her dead brother, Jean-Paul; to her sponsors, to herself, to her 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 She actually feared no one would speak to her if she lost, even as defeat 
loomed as inevitable. Parisien was a shell of the world-class racer she once 
was, yet there were moments when she still felt like a champion in her race 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, Parisien thought, she could fool herself for a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 After posting the 18th-fastest time in the first run, Parisien was 
disqualified when she straddled the third gate from the finish in the second 
run at Hafjell. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality crushed her. Parisien always had an Olympic pain partner in Dan 
Jansen, the hard-luck American speedskater who shared the burden of winning a 
medal for a lost sibling. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen won his gold last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien is alone again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about my own (mental) health a little bit," Parisien said 
afterward. "Ski racing right now hasn't been important to me, since my brother 
died. It's tough to be out there when it's not important to you." 
</P>
<P>
 There was minimal emotion in her voice, no tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Paul, Parisien's older brother and mentor, was killed Dec. 17, 1992, when 
a drunken driver sideswiped his car and forced it into a tree just a few miles 
from the family's home in Auburn, Me. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien now says she came back too racing too soon, only weeks after his 
death. It might have been the frustration talking, but Parisien, 22, said she 
might now retire from World Cup ski racing, or at least take a long sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she might enroll at the University of Colorado and try the Pro 
Circuit to make some spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm at a point, nothing really matters to me except my own -- not 
to sound mystical -- but my own spiritual health," she said. "It's just ruined 
right now. Crushed. My whole family is. That's just the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, it's the Dan Jansens and I who have suffered by going back into 
competition, having to go back the next day and having to race. I don't think I 
gave myself enough time. I've overestimated my strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put too much store in this race, I really wanted to do something, the final 
hurrah, whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien has won more World Cup races, three, than any other current U.S. 
Alpine member. Before her emotional crash, she was considered a gold-medal 
contender in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't it time to get out of a sport when you're standing in the starting 
gate, as she was Saturday, thinking, "Wow, I don't know about this"? 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the absolute worst thing you can do," she said. "I'm kind of ashamed at 
the fact that I've thought that way. Because any athlete who feels that way 
should get the hell out and give someone else a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Every contemplation was tied to that Dec. 17. She thought about quitting last 
Christmas, around the one-year anniversary of J.P.'s death. The skier who led 
the first slalom run at the 1992 Albertville games, only to lose out on a medal 
by .05 seconds, was suddenly skiing vacant, posting mediocre results, when she 
finished at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Her top finish this season is eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been coming on for quite a while," she said. "A year and a half now. I 
don't blame it on anything, I don't say because my brother died, my motivation 
is gone. I do this for me, too. But maybe I realize that it's not making me the 
person I want to be. You never know. I might be hit by a drunk driver tomorrow, 
and I don't want feel this way if it's my last day." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien criticized the U.S. ski team, claiming it does not know how to 
produce world-class athletes. This, as the U.S. concludes one of its most 
successful Olympics ever in Alpine, with two gold and two silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the ski team needs to revamp their whole structure and do some major 
changes, with the way they manage athletes," Parisien said. "The coaching 
staff, they need to think about us a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was Parisien, in a break from team policy, who was allowed to train 
with a personal coach earlier this season, a plan that was scrapped in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comments did not sit well with Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've walked away with two gold and two silver and an athlete starts 
criticizing the team?" Major said. "She should look at herself in the mirror. 
That's the place she needs to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien had only kind words to say about Major, but he thought that a bit 
incongruous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the Alpine director," Major said. "I should be included (in the 
criticism). I'm the management. Who's there to blame? If there's bad results, 
I'm the one to blame. And I'll take full credit for not skiing well today. But 
I'll take some credit for those golds." 
</P>
<P>
 Major was eager to speak with Parisien for further clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants to ski on the Pro Circuit? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for has-beens and people that never made it on the World Cup," he said. 
"She could be an overall champion on the World Cup. You can't just take one 
race and turn that into your career." 
</P>
<P>
 Major, who also serves as the women's coach, understands the emotional burden 
she carries. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants Parisien back, but warned that leaving the program was sort of like 
jumping off a tiger. There is no easy way back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's as good as Pernilla (Wiberg) or Vreni (Schneider), but you've got to 
meet that standard," he said. "And right now, that standard is very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Major said Parisien was not in great physical condition this season, but he 
wrote it off to extenuating circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees that Parisien should take some time off, but said she needs to get 
her priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be on that board in the top three, you pretty much have to 
give 100% of your life to it," he said, pointing to the Olympic scoreboard. 
"You can't sort of say, 'Oh, I'm going to college on the side.' She's talented, 
she can go to college and be successful in academics. But the three girls up 
there (on the podium) aren't worrying about their academics right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien isn't sure of her next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be talking out of my armpit," she said. "I'm so volatile." 
</P>
<P>
 She might ski at the World Cup races at Mammoth Mountain early next month. 
After that, it's anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "To not do it when you know you can be at the top, it's a joke, a waste of 
talent," Parisien said. "I know that. I need a break. It's so hard to explain. 
All of this isn't as important as it used to be."

SMOLDERING WILKINS ARRIVES; CLIPPERS: IRKED FORMER HAWK ALL-STAR PRACTICES WITH 
TEAM AND IS EXPECTED TO START TONIGHT AGAINST SEATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks were all Dominique Wilkins ever knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins spent his entire 12-year NBA career in Atlanta, where he became one of 
the city's most popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilkins was traded to the Clippers for All-Star forward Danny Manning 
Thursday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a special section on 
Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew from WSB-TV, the ABC affiliate in Atlanta, accompanied Wilkins to Los 
Angeles to chronicle his debut as Clipper tonight against the Seattle 
SuperSonics at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew anything but an Atlanta Hawks uniform," Wilkins said. "It'll be 
really strange, but life is full of changes and a lot of them are good, so I'm 
ready to get going. I love the game no matter where I'm at, so I just want to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, the NBA's sixth-leading scorer with an average of 24.4 points per 
game this season, had helped the Hawks -- off to their best start ever -- 
challenge the three-time defending champion Chicago Bulls for the Central 
Division title. But Wilkins' new team is battling to get out of last place in 
the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing to leave that, I'll be honest about that, because I felt 
we did have a chance," Wilkins said. "I can accept trades as long as it's done 
the right way, but that's something I have to put behind me. I look forward to 
playing for the Clippers and anything else doesn't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I left Atlanta, they said my productivity was down and my scoring was 
down. But it was for the betterment of the team. I thought I was having a great 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the trade coming. I felt it all year. They kept talking championship, 
but they really didn't want to win a championship, because they wouldn't have 
put that kind of a distraction (the trade) on a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're having a great season, I don't think you should take a piece of 
the puzzle away when you're so close, but they felt they had to do it more for 
the future than for now, which doesn't make much sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins' first day as a Clipper was hectic. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving at LAX, where he was met by Clipper Coach Bob Weiss, he was 
whisked away in a stretch limo. After a physical exam, Wilkins had lunch at a 
soul food restaurant in Marina Del Rey, where he bumped into Clipper rookie 
forward Harold Ellis, who was also having lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was off to the Sports Arena for a news conference to introduce him to 
the Southland media. 
</P>
<P>
 It was strange to see Wilkins, who only last week played against the Clippers 
at the Sports Arena, changing into his red Clipper practice jersey in the 
locker room. He took the corner stall vacated by Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins met his new teammates and then worked out for the first time with the 
team. Weiss moved practice to 5:30 so Wilkins could attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who is likely to start tonight, looked sharp in practice, throwing a 
nice pass through the key to set up guard Gary Grant for a layup during a 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper point guard Mark Jackson thinks Wilkins' adjustment will be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played together in several charity games," Jackson said. "We just want 
to get it down and get to know each other on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's ninth-leading all-time scorer, Wilkins is shooting a career-low .432 
this season. However, Wilkins, 34, maintained that his scoring average has 
declined this season because he's taking more three-pointers and concentrating 
more on playing defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's a long ways from finished," said Clipper assistant Johnny Davis, 
who coached Wilkins in Atlanta. "He can still play." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's headed for the Hall of Fame, Wilkins, in the final year of a 
contract that pays him $3.5 million, isn't ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can play maybe 10 or eight years," Wilkins quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are expected to open contract negotiations with Wilkins, who 
could become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, in several 
weeks.

COETZER WILL TRY FOR A PASSING GRADE; TENNIS: SHE DEFEATS DAVENPORT TO ADVANCE 
TO EVERT CUP FINAL AGAINST TOP-RANKED GRAF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa knows what she'll be up against when she plays 
top-ranked Steffi Graf today in the championship match of the Evert Cup at 
Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not many people have beaten her," Coetzer said of Graf, who is 16-0 this 
year. "So, you go out there and really just try to stay in the game. When she's 
playing well, she can really beat you by far." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Graf is not like playing anybody else on the WTA Tour, said Iva Majoli 
of Croatia, who lost to the German, 6-4, 6-1, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always fun when you play the No. 1 player in the world," Majoli said. 
"Sometimes, you can't just look to play somebody so you can win. Sometimes, 
it's good to play Steffi and see how you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer, who lost in last year's Evert Cup final to Mary Joe Fernandez, will 
find out today after advancing with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Lindsay 
Davenport, a 17-year-old senior at Murrieta Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 She looks forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be back in the finals again," said Coetzer, who squandered two 
match points in last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what it would take to win, she laughed nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer, 22, is 0-3 against Graf, 24, and has yet to win a set, winning more 
than two games only once, but still she said: "The more I play her, the more 
comfortable I feel. I kind of get an idea of how fast she's moving on the court 
and how she wins her points." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, very easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Majoli, however, Graf started slowly, losing her serve in the first 
game and failing to win a point against Majoli's serve in the second and 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started (the match) not moving toward the ball very well and gave her the 
chance to play aggressively," Graf said. "I hit a lot of returns not really in 
the middle of my racket and then I told myself, 'Come on, just try to keep the 
ball in play first and try to get yourself into the game,' which worked in the 
middle of the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I finished the first set, I think I was concentrating better out there. 
I played the points better and I stepped into the ball a bit more, played more 
aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf held serve the rest of the way, broke Majoli twice in each set and made 
it off the court in less than an hour, winning in 59 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Majoli, a 16-year-old from Croatia who is 0-4 against Graf: "The first 
set, I was doing fine. The second, I got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport was fine in the first set, too, but later seemed frustrated by the 
tireless Coetzer, an energetic baseliner who, at 5 feet 2 and 122 pounds, is a 
foot shorter and about 50 pounds lighter than Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of my game," said Coetzer, who despite an ability to frustrate 
opponents with her tenacity, lost to Davenport, 6-1, 6-2, at last year's U.S. 
Open. "She can either make winners right into the corners, or she's going to 
miss a few. I just try to keep the ball in play and hope she misses at the 
right stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Will a similar strategy beat Graf? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that you can do is just start playing better and if she makes 
more errors and you make more winners, then you have a chance," Majoli said. 
"But otherwise. . . ."

FROM A PRODIGY TO A PROTECTOR; TENNIS: ANDREA JAEGER, NOW 28, CHANNELS HER 
ENTHUSIASM INTO EASING THE SUFFERING OF CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Etched in the memory of tennis fans everywhere is the picture of a child named 
Andrea Jaeger, pigtails flapping as she bounced around the courts at the 
shrines of the game, Roland Garros and Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 While others her age were experiencing pimples and puberty, she was 
experiencing the clay of Paris and the grass of Centre Court, in front of 
sellout crowds in the thousands and television audiences in the millions. She 
was not merely an early-rounder. She was a finalist in both events. 
</P>
<P>
 The child prodigy from Lincolnshire, Ill., as fiery as she was bouncy, won her 
first tour tournament at 14 years 8 months. She was No. 2 in the world before 
her 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she went away, not slowly or particularly quietly, but away, 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 After tearing up her serving arm and shoulder in 1984 in the middle of a 
French Open match, she had played only a dozen or so tour matches from that 
point until a day in Houston in 1987, at a nondescript women's tour event. She 
won both her first-round singles and doubles, then defaulted, never to play on 
the tour again. At 20, she finally put a stop to her endless cycle of surgery, 
rehab, cortisone, ice and aspirin.  
</P>
<P>
 She is 28 now, and except for occasional mentions in the press about the 
problems of similar young stars such as Jennifer Capriati, the name Andrea 
Jaeger doesn't come up much. Nor does the story of where she has been and what 
she has been doing since that day in Houston in 1987, when she walked away from 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a story that should come up -- and will more and more as it becomes 
better known -- because it is a warm and wonderful story of a now-grown-up 
child, helping those who aren't and probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger is here at the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort for the Evert Cup 
tournament. It will end today with the finals, and with a celebrity match in 
which Jaeger will play and also receive a televised commendation on the ESPN 
broadcast for her work with children. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, she sat in the bleachers on a side court, tight perm now replacing 
pigtails, and talked about the love of her life, her "kids," who now number 
well into the hundreds. She hadn't called a news conference, she had been 
sought out. News conferences aren't her style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids know if you are doing things for a response, or if you really care," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what kids know and think is all she really cares about these days. She 
runs something called Silver Lining Ranch in Aspen, Colo. It is the focal point 
of her Kids' Stuff Foundation, which is a program for children, age 7-20, with 
life-threatening diseases or life-altering conditions. Briefly put, Jaeger 
spends 14 hours a day, seven days a week, raising funds and attending to the 
details of providing a special place and time for these children, many of whom 
find her through Make-a-Wish programs.

 "They come to Aspen and we take them horseback riding at Martina's 
(Navratilova) ranch, or to Hard Rock Cafe, where they give us free lunches," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays video games with them: "I went one-on-one with one of my young guys 
who had no hands, and he kicked my butt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes to the hospital with them: "One of my guys needed somebody to go with 
him for a chemotherapy maintenance shot, and so I went along, and he did so 
good that when we got done, we were high-fiving right there in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 She goes the extra mile for them when other programs can't: "One of my kids 
has a brain tumor and the only way she could come to Aspen is if we had oxygen 
on the plane and oxygen in her room. So we did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She began this with her own money, and has pretty well run through most of 
that. "I don't own a car, a lot of days I just kind of fast instead of grabbing 
lunch, and the only thing about tennis that really bothers me at all now is 
that I can't still play and win some money for the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is not out begging. She ran Kids' Stuff on a $325,000 budget last year 
and is aiming at $1.5 million this year. Most of that comes from friends and 
special donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, John McEnroe just writes a check," she said. "He doesn't tell 
anybody. He doesn't call a press conference. He just does it." 
</P>
<P>
 She has an 800 number so that kids who visit can stay in touch, at no cost. 
Everywhere she travels, she sends her kids postcards, hundreds and hundreds of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 As she talks, she bubbles enthusiasm. This is her life work, something she 
will do forever, she says. The day her first group of 100 children arrived in 
Aspen was like winning 10 Wimbledons, she says. This is so important to her 
that her personal life, perhaps children of her own, must take a back seat for 
the moment, adding with a laugh that when she does marry, it will probably be 
to a cancer specialist or a child psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the pigtails are gone, but not the bounce. She describes herself 
currently as "childlike, but not childish -- there's a big difference, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is nothing childlike or childish about the description of what this 
is all about: "The kids say that, when they come to Aspen, they forget they are 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 That was from Andrea Jaeger. Adult.

THIS GUY ISN'T AN AVERAGE JOE; TENNIS: TODD MARTIN THINKS OF HIMSELF AS BEING 
ORDINARY. ON THE COURT, THOUGH, HE HAS BECOME SOMETHING SPECIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear Todd Martin tell it, his rise into the top 10 of the ATP Tour rankings 
is a tribute to clean living, good parenting, Midwestern values and an 
old-fashioned work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds a bit boring, Martin couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly described himself as "an All-American kid" last month at the 
Australian Open, where he was a surprise finalist, and is not the least bit 
apologetic about his ordinariness. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are pretty clean-cut and conservative, and I think I've modeled 
myself after them my whole life," he said. "And I think I've turned out to be 
your fairly average Joe off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 With racket in hand, however, he stands apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 23, was selected as most-improved male professional of 1993 by Tennis 
magazine after improving his ranking from No. 87 to No. 13, beating five top-10 
players and reaching the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued his climb in Australia, moving into the top 10 despite losing to 
Pete Sampras in the final, and won his second pro title two weeks ago at 
Memphis, where his career first took flight a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always believed in him," said Sampras, who was pushed to five sets by 
Martin in the third round of the 1992 U.S. Open. "This doesn't surprise me at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Martin will make his Davis Cup debut, playing singles when the 
United States meets India in a first-round match at New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately enough for me, I'm enjoying some success at a game I took up in a 
park for the fun of it and to be able to spend a little extra time with my 
parents," said Martin, who is ranked ninth entering the Newsweek Champions Cup, 
which runs Monday through next Sunday at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's, though, was not an overnight success story. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his most celebrated contemporaries -- Sampras, Jim Courier, Michael 
Chang and Andre Agassi -- the 6-foot-6 Martin went to college, studying 
linguistics and playing two seasons of tennis at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 And after turning pro in 1990, he concentrated on ironing out the kinks in his 
game rather than boosting his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means not going to every nook and cranny of the world to play in a 
satellite tournament to get points," said Martin, who gradually improved his 
ranking from No. 269 in 1990 to No. 133 in '91 to No. 87 in '92. "I decided to 
do what I could to improve on what everybody thought I needed to improve on, 
and what I felt like I needed to improve on. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's what I say has provided me with the chance to play as well as I 
have in the past year." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said he has always been a late bloomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't the most gifted athlete in the juniors, but I think I knew the game 
pretty well and I had a good coach and I made a lot of gradual improvements," 
said Martin, who gave up basketball in high school at Lansing, Mich., so he 
could concentrate on landing a college scholarship in tennis. "And then, the 
same thing in college." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin started his ascent last year in Memphis, where he defeated Agassi and 
Chang before losing to Courier in his first tour final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were my first big wins, but the big thing was, I won three matches to 
get there. That was something that wasn't happening very often for me, so I was 
already excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I got by those two guys and played well against Jim in the final, 
that sort of ensured me that it wasn't a fluke. I played well seven days in a 
row, and that's a pretty encouraging feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin reached the final in four more tournaments last year, winning his first 
pro title on clay at Coral Springs, Fla., and posted victories over Stefan 
Edberg, Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia last month, he defeated Edberg again, winning three tiebreakers 
in a 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 semifinal victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A baseliner as a younger player, Martin has developed a more attacking style 
during the past year, combining a net-charging approach with a two-handed 
backhand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've developed a serve that has enabled me to get to the net more and more," 
he said. "I'm getting more and more aggressive every year now, and I think the 
more aggressive I am, the better I'm going to get."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; PRESSURE APPEARS TO BE ON SWEDES; HOCKEY: 
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT NOTHING SHORT OF THE GOLD IS ENOUGH. CANADIANS ARE 
RELAXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Happily casting themselves as underdogs in today's gold-medal game against 
Sweden, Canada's Olympic hockey players romped through practice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like our mood," Coach Tom Renney said. "And given what we had to work with 
over the course of the year and how various hockey people looked at how we'd 
compete, we're satisfied with that role. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minds of other people, maybe we're somewhere we shouldn't be. But in 
our minds, we deserve to be where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have won the World Championship three times since 1987 and 
Olympic bronze medals in 1980, '84 and '88, Swedish teams have never won a gold 
medal. A loss today to Canada, whose 5-1-1 record is identical to theirs, might 
cost Coach Curt Lundmark his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We read in the newspapers that we're supposed to win the gold," said left 
wing Mats Naslund, the former Montreal Canadien standout. "Even our (hockey) 
federation says the only thing that counts is if we win the gold. That didn't 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's only loss here was to Canada, by 3-2 in the final round-robin game. 
Canada also defeated Sweden in two of their three pre-Olympic games and at last 
year's World Championship, but the players aren't relying on history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go in thinking, 'We beat them three times, so we should beat them a 
fourth,' that can be deceiving," defenseman Brad Schlegel said. "This is a 
one-shot deal. . . . Sweden is a patient hockey club, sound defensively, and 
they move the puck well and counterattack. We have to be aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
 They also have to be aware of Peter Forsberg, who set up Sweden's first three 
goals against Russia in a 4-3 semifinal victory Friday. Forsberg was the sixth 
pick in the 1991 NHL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He proved to me he's not only a promising player, he's ready to play in big 
games," Naslund said. "I had doubts, a little bit, but (Friday) he played 60 
minutes of super hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Naslund centers for Jonas Bergkvist and Roger Hansson on Sweden's top line. 
Its top individual scorer, right wing Patrik Juhlin -- seven goals, eight 
points -- usually plays with Naslund and King draft pick Daniel Rydmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada has scored 25 goals, five fewer than Sweden, but each team has given up 
only 16. Corey Hirsch, who has a 1.98 goals-against average, will start in goal 
for Canada against Tommy Salo, who has a 2.20 average. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to pay the price along the (boards) and down low," Renney said. 
"We've got to stay out of the penalty box, be patient and dedicate ourselves to 
a game plan of strong defense." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first gold-medal experience for most of the Canadians -- only 
three players are back from the 1992 team that lost the gold medal to the 
Unified Team -- and they are savoring it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in as underdogs and nobody expected us to be here," Hirsch said. 
"We're enjoying ourselves, enjoying the moment, when maybe other teams are 
feeling the pressure."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; U.S. LOSES TO GERMANY, 4-3, ENDS UP EIGHTH 
IN WORST HOCKEY FINISH

<P>
 Their medal hopes long gone, U.S. hockey players set one last goal here 
Saturday: to win the last period of their last game as a tribute to Coach Tim 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that was beyond them. Their 4-3 loss to Germany left them with a 1-4-3 
record and eighth place, the worst by an American team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches put in so much effort, and we let them down," goaltender Garth 
Snow said. "Our coaches are too nice guys to get treated the way they did in 
this tournament. It's a shame. It's definitely not Xs and O's. We didn't pick 
it up a notch when we got here, and that's in the players' hands. We're 
probably the most well-prepared team here. It comes down to us playing and we 
didn't play. It's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said team captain Peter Laviolette: "If anybody's going to take the fall for 
the way this team played during the Olympics, it's the players. The coaches did 
everything they could. They did an outstanding job. We didn't do what we were 
supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Taylor: "You have to keep the perspective that we had a great season and 
we did a lot of tremendous things on the ice and off the ice. We just didn't 
get the job done hockey-wise, and if that's the only measure of their success 
and failure, we have to be labeled a failure. But they represented their 
country well and with pride. We just fell short. I'm the one who chose them, 
and I'm the one who trained them, so I'll accept responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a nice run. It was a lot of fun. I have a lot of happy memories and 
positive experiences along the way. Except now you (reporters), the players and 
me, we can only see the last two weeks." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Lasting memories of the XVII Winter Olympics, Lillehammer '94: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wall-to-wall people on Storgata, making Lillehammer's little snow-covered 
Main Street look like Bourbon Street in New Orleans on Fat Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The absurdity of 250 reporters sitting in an auditorium at 1 in the 
morning, listening to Mike Moran and Harvey Schiller of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee reading the news releases reporters had just been handed on Tonya 
Harding's being allowed to skate in the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The anguished look on world record-holder Dan Jansen's face after a slip in 
the 500-meter race, his speedskating specialty, had cost him, once again, an 
Olympic medal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That lung-searing first breath when you step outdoors on a deceptively 
sunny winter morning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The absurdity of hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews waiting 
to catch a glimpse of Tonya Harding after her arrival in Hamar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bonnie Blair, joyfully singing along to the national anthem on the winner's 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The room-filling aroma of strong, hearty Norwegian coffee brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All those moose-crossing signs, and not one moose sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The realization that there are 7,353 ways of preparing salmon -- and that 
Norwegians know every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The humbling view of the ruggedly handsome Norwegian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The touching sight of aerial skier Nikki Stone, who had just missed 
qualifying for the finals herself, hugging and comforting a weeping Kristean 
Porter, who had messed up her chance by landing on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thousands of happy Norwegians -- waving flags, singing, cheering, trying to 
run with the skiers -- at race after race at the cross-country stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The absurdity of Tonya Harding's coach telling 500 or more reporters at a 
news conference that only questions deemed appropriate by her would be 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jere Longman of the New York Times promptly asking Harding, why, since she 
had lied to reporters about smoking cigarettes and to the FBI about her 
knowledge of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, anyone should believe anything she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The look of relief on Dan Jansen's face as he skated a victory lap, 
carrying his baby daughter, after finally winning his Olympic gold in the 1,000 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The unique hockey rink in the mountain at Gjovik. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more, of course, much more, but . . . So, adjo Olympics. Adjo 
Lillehammer. Adjo Norway. Thanks for inviting us. MIKE KUPPER

 The Lillehammer Games have been the most successful for U.S. Winter athletes. 
Through Saturday, Americans had won 13 medals, six of them gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous high for the U.S. was 12, a total they won in 1932 at Lake Placid, 
then matched there in 1980. Previous high in foreign countries for the United 
States was 11 medals, in Oslo in 1952 and two years ago at Albertville, France.

<P>
 Dan Jansen, the speedskater who finally won a medal -- gold, it turned out -- 
in his last Olympic race, after having come up empty in three previous Olympics 
and in his first race here, on what it would be like if speedskating, like 
figure skating, were judged: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows? If our sport were judged, I might have won an Olympic medal before 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Blair, Jansen's speedskating teammate who began her Olympic career 10 
years ago in Sarajevo, said she would be donating $5,000 toward relief efforts 
in that war-torn city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of great memories of the Olympics there, and it's so different 
now from what I remember," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Frager in the Baltimore Sun: "CBS Friday night presented the story of the 
most reprehensible behavior at the Games, and it had nothing to do with figure 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother of Uzbekistan's Lina Cherjazova, gold medalist in the women's 
freestyle skiing aerials, died three weeks ago. Her country's Olympic committee 
kept the news from Cherjazova, CBS said.

 helped produce the highest-rated Friday night for a network in U.S. television 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's figure skating finals on CBS got a preliminary national rating of 
43.9, Nielsen Media Research said Saturday.That was 76% above two years ago, 
but 9.5% below Wednesday, the first night of women's figure skating.  
</P>
<P>
 About 4.33 million fewer homes tuned in than did on Wednesday, but the 
broadcast was still the second-highest rated night ever for the Olympics in the 
United States. Each rating point represents 942,000 homes, 1% of the television 
households in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous top rating for a Friday night was 35.2. That figure was achieved 
by CBS on Nov. 21, 1980, when the "Who Shot J.R.?" episode of "Dallas" got a 
53.3 rating over one hour, and was matched by ABC on Feb. 11, 1983, when the 
"Winds of War" was televised. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's figure skating finals on CBS two years ago at Albertville, also on 
a Friday night, got a 25.0 rating and a 40 share.

 Ed O'Bannon is considering leaving UCLA and making himself available to the 
NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, a 21-year-old junior, the Bruins' leading scorer and rebounder, said 
Saturday that he is undecided on whether to take advantage of a new NCAA rule 
that allows players to be drafted, then return to school if they do not wish to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm just thinking about the tournament," O'Bannon said. "If I were 
a lottery pick, maybe things would be different, but right now, leaving is not 
on my mind." 
</P>

 O'Bannon said he is leaning toward remaining at UCLA, where he is a

 It was only the first intrasquad game of the season, but Manager Tom Lasorda 
led off with Delino DeShields batting in front of Brett Butler, followed by 
Mike Piazza, Darryl Strawberry and Eric Karros, indicating the lineup for next 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy (Lasorda) sat me down and asked me where I should hit," Butler said 
after Saturday's game at Vero Beach, Fla. "And I said where I want to hit is 
first, but where I should hit is second behind Delino, that's the way it has to 
be. Delino gets on and with his speed, Tommy can utilize what I do well and 
that's bunt him over. This is the lineup to come." 
</P>

 Jose Offerman, who batted second most of last season, was in the eighth spot.

 Mike Busch, who has been touted as the Dodgers' third baseman of the future, 
has been working out at first base and played the position Saturday during the 
game. The switch to first -- Busch's original position -- leaves the Dodgers 
without a strong prospect at third base, a situation the club has become 
familiar with since the departure of Ron Cey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about the move, there are four or five third basemen in camp and 
they really only have (Eric) Karros at first," Busch said. "I know that Eric 
has the job locked up, but I can't worry about that. I just need to swing the 
bat the best I can and try and make the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Busch, 6-foot-5, hit 40 home runs during the last two minor league seasons, 
causing the Dodgers to look ahead, see Karros at first, and move Busch's power 
to third. But Busch had trouble making the adjustment defensively, committing 
40 errors.  
</P>
<P>
 This spring the position is Tim Wallach's to lose, with Dave Hansen the 
closest challenger. Behind Hansen is Henry Blanco, 22, who is highly regarded 
defensively, but hit .195 last season at double-A San Antonio, and Ron Coomer, 
whom the Dodgers acquired in a trade with the Chicago White Sox in December.

 Pedro Martinez summed up his first three days as a Montreal Expo as 
"horrible," saying he knows it will get better, but for now, he's lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'm here with the Expos because it is a good opportunity for me," 
Martinez said. "But being here (in spring training camp) is almost like going 
back to the Dominican (Republic), the only difference is it's a major league 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way different here (than Dodgertown). You finish your practice and you 
have to find your way to get home and find your way to eat. I will get used to 
it, but for now, I don't really know anyone here, and the guys I do know are 
married or are not staying in the hotel. I know I am really going to miss 
(brother) Ramon. It's kind of boring for me when practice is over. The last 
three days here have been horrible."

 The Expos train in West Palm Beach, sharing a stadium with the Atlanta Braves. 
Unlike Dodgertown -- where the players can stay right next to the clubhouse, 
are fed three meals a day in the dining room and clubhouse and even have a 
special activity room -- the Expos' facility has a clubhouse, stadium and 
practice fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait until the season starts," Martinez said. "I would rather be here 
because of the opportunity. But I wasn't thinking I was the right one to be 
traded." MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FOR DAVIS, IT'S TIME TO PROVE HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chili Davis strolled into the Angels' spring training camp Saturday looking 
for his new locker, introducing himself to new teammates, but finding the same 
old situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off the finest year of his career, Davis still must prove himself all 
over again just to assure that he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the third time in five years that he has played in the final year of a 
contract, and the previous two experiences left him looking for new employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year they keep saying, 'You can't, you can't,' " Davis said. "I keep 
telling them, 'I can, I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who hit 27 homers and drove in 112 runs last season, discussed a 
two-year contract extension last fall with the Angels, but failed to reach an 
agreement. The Angels wound up renewing Davis' option for $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I was disappointed in was how it was done," Davis said. "Here 
I was, having one of my best years, and they have people telling me that they 
don't want to pay a DH that kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, I don't want to hear that. Show some gratitude. Renew my option, and 
then talk contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Buck Rodgers: "It's a shame, because when a guy has a career 
year, he should get more out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said he likely will explore the possibility 
of a contract extension with Davis, but said it's premature to predict if 
anything will transpire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over with now," said Davis, who missed the first two full-squad workouts 
because of personal business. "I know I'm not going to play any differently on 
a one-year contract than if I had a four-year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what I can do, and I'll show them again."

 Frank Tanana, 40, was warming up in the bullpen Saturday when he decided to 
experiment with a new pitch -- a cut fastball. It's a pitch he has not thrown 
in his 20-year career, but after a little success, well, you would have thought 
he found the fountain of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this might add another 15 years to my career," he yelled to Rodgers. 
"When I turn 45, I'll bring this out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to tell how Tanana is faring, Rodgers said, until the 
exhibition season commences. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know he has below-average stuff," Rodgers said, "so you just have to sit 
back and wait for the results. We've got to find out whether he can still fool 
people."

 Like almost everyone else in America, batting coach Rod Carew was watching the 
Olympic figure skating competition Friday night, but he had a different rooting 
interest than most. "I was pulling for (Tonya) Harding to win," Carew said, 
laughing. "I was probably the only one. I was hoping she'd pull off a miracle." 
. . . The Angel players closed the clubhouse doors and threw an impromptu 
birthday celebration for first baseman J.T. Snow, who turned 26 on Saturday. . 
. . Starter Russ Springer, who was a disappointment last season for the Angels, 
going 1-6 with a 7.20 earned-run average before being sidelined with a strained 
back, has caught the attention of the Angels' coaching staff the first week. 
"He's been a pleasant surprise," Rodgers said. "You can tell something was 
bothering him with his back last year."

their Cactus League opener Friday against Colorado. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SWIMMING / PACIFIC 10 CHAMPIONSHIPS; QUANCE SETS NCAA RECORD, BUT STANFORD WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Kristine Quance has a problem with limits. In swimming, at least, she pays 
them no mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance, a USC freshman, shattered the NCAA record in the 200-yard breaststroke 
at the Pacific 10 Conference championships Saturday at the Belmont Plaza 
Olympic Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance finished in two minutes, 9.88 seconds, breaking the record set by 
Dorsey Tierney of Texas in 1991 by 1.66 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't get intimidated by fast times," USC Coach Mark Schubert said. 
"She has a unique ability not to limit herself and that's what makes her 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, meanwhile, easily won the three-day meet with 1,632 points. Arizona 
State finished with 1,186 points, followed by USC with 1,162.5 and UCLA with 
1,072. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal won 13 of the 21 events, including all five relays. USC was next 
with four individual titles, including Heather Ballard's victory Saturday in 
the 1,650 freestyle in 16:25.58. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea Loveless and Jenny Thompson led Stanford, winning three individual titles 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Loveless defended her title in the 200 backstroke in a meet record 1:54.13. 
She also defended her title in the 100 backstroke on Friday and won the 200 
individual medley on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson defended her title in the 100 freestyle in 49.18 after defending her 
title in the 200 free on Friday and winning the 50 free on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite overpowering every other team, Stanford swimmers were disappointed 
that more of them did not make qualifying marks for the NCAA championships mext 
month. In all, 16 Stanford swimmers have qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, from our point of view, the thing that we should be the most proud 
of is that we were tough, mentally," Loveless said. "We didn't let the 
disappointment get us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Quance is another who didn't let disappointment get her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance was upset Friday night after winning the 100 breaststroke in a Pac-10 
record 1:01.28 because she had wanted to swim faster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 breaststroke, however, Quance swam in a lane next to Arizona 
State's Beata Kaszuba, the defending Pac-10 champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaszuba, whose second-place time of 2:10.93 also bettered the previous NCAA 
record, pushed Quance the entire race.

11 WACO CULTISTS ARE ACQUITTED OF MURDER CHARGES; TRIAL: OUTCOME INDICATES 
JURORS PLACED MOST BLAME ON THE GOVERNMENT. SEVEN BRANCH DAVIDIANS ARE 
CONVICTED ON LESSER CHARGES. ANAHEIM MOTHER AGREES WITH DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dealing a sharp blow to the government, jurors on Saturday acquitted all 11 
members of the Branch Davidian cult accused of murder and murder-conspiracy in 
the deaths of four federal agents who stormed their compound near Waco, Tex., a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the defendants were convicted of lesser charges. Five were convicted 
of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter in the deaths of the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents. Those five and two others were also found 
guilty of weapons possession charges. Four cult members were cleared of all 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder and murder-conspiracy charges would have carried a maximum 
punishment of life in prison. Conviction on the voluntary manslaughter charges 
could bring sentences of up to 10 years. No date was set for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the defendants were convicted of some offenses, the 
acquittals on the most serious charges indicated that jurors believed the ATF 
-- and not cult members, whose lawyers had argued they acted only in 
self-defense -- was largely responsible for the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Terry Kirk sought to make that point in telling reporters 
outside the courthouse: "The nerve of the federal government to do what they 
did on Feb. 28, and then come into a courtroom and file a brief saying: 'Oh, if 
it's a federal agent, you don't have the right of self-defense, you have to 
take a bullet in the head.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the judge didn't buy it, the American people most assuredly would not 
have bought it, and that's the message the jury sent." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim resident Ruth Moser, the mother of cult member Sherri Jewell, who died 
in the fire that ended the 51-day standoff, agreed with defense attorneys' 
claims that the Davidians acted in self-defense when they fired at federal 
agents during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good grief, they're not to blame," she said of the cult members. "They're not 
the ones to storm themselves and shoot themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Jahn, the chief prosecutor, said in reaction to the verdicts that "these 
agents were a group of very brave men and women who walked into a murderous 
ambush and demonstrated their courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the verdict was a statement against the use of excessive force by 
police agencies, Jahn said that "if there was excessive force, that needs to be 
resolved in the court, not from the barrel of a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those agents did not die in vain," said prosecutor Bill Johnston, tears in 
his eyes. "I want to tell everyone in law enforcement throughout this wonderful 
country and especially in the ATF to keep their chin up. . . . Seven 
individuals out of 11 have been convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno told reporters in Washington that the convictions on 
lesser counts "indicate that the killing of these four ATF agents was 
unjustified." 
</P>
<P>
 She said federal law enforcement officials will focus on developing "systems 
and procedures to see that a tragedy like this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the jury were not available for comment. Jurors deliberated for 
four days after hearing six weeks of testimony in a San Antonio courtroom. The 
case was moved from Waco because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors reached their decision just short of the first anniversary of the 
bloody raid on Feb. 28, 1993, in which the agents and six Davidians died. The 
assault led to a 51-day standoff at the cult's Mt. Carmel compound. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 19, FBI armored vehicles battered the cult compound and pumped in 
tear gas in an effort to end the standoff. Hours later, the compound went up in 
flames. Prosecutors claimed cult members set the blaze in a mass suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Cult leader David Koresh and about 80 followers, including 18 children, died. 
Koresh and some other Davidians had been shot. However, a number of cult 
members, including most of the defendants, either left the compound during the 
standoff or escaped the inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts brought tears of joy from several defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Clive Doyle, a 52-year-old native Australian who is a naturalized U.S. 
citizen, was among those acquitted of all charges. He wept when he told 
reporters outside the courthouse: "I'm sorry there are four agents that are 
dead and a lot more that are wounded. Personally, I believe that those in 
charge of their agencies caused that. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my personal conviction, but we lost 85 of our friends and family too, 
and it was unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodrow (Bob) Kendrick, 63, another defendant freed Saturday, said through his 
tears that he is "still proud to be a Branch Davidian." He described Koresh as 
having "had more compassion for all humankind than anyone I have ever met. . . 
. He loved the children like Christ did 2,000 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The lone female defendant, Ruth Riddle, was convicted of a firearms violation, 
but U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. promptly invalidated that decision on 
grounds that it did not apply to her case. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle, 30, a Canadian citizen, and Norman Allison, a 29-year-old Briton who 
also was acquitted, are in the United States illegally and will be deported by 
immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 During the case, defense lawyers adopted a strategy of putting the government 
itself on trial, questioning the level of force used by the raiding party of 75 
agents against the cult members, who the attorneys insisted were controlled, 
victimized and kept in the dark by a psychotic leader, Koresh. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, which started Jan. 12, prosecution witnesses testified that 
they saw the defendants bearing weapons the morning of the raid, but 
prosecutors were unable to show conclusively that the defendants had fired the 
shots that killed the four agents. They were among those agents seeking to 
serve arrest and search warrants on Koresh for illegal weapons purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers said they were assisted by a federal investigative report last 
fall that concluded the initial ATF raid was conducted with poor supervision 
and that top ATF officials had lied in saying they thought they had maintained 
an element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, those authorities conducted the raid even after learning that 
Koresh had received advance warning and was waiting for the agents with 
automatic weapons, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 Former ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins retired on the eve of the report, and 
five other officials criticized in the document took early retirement or were 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Magaw, the agency's new director, said in a statement Saturday that 
jurors had "reached a conclusion that they alone are empowered to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Praising the slain agents, Magaw said "they went to serve a lawful purpose but 
. . . were met with the most terrible hail of gunfire and explosives ever 
directed against American law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 While conceding that human errors were made, he said that "mistakes do not 
justify the mass murder that David Koresh ordered on Feb. 28 and concluded on 
April 19." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before announcing their verdicts, jurors again listened to a tape 
recording of a 911 call made by cult members the morning of the botched raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell them there's children and women in here and to call it off!" cult member 
Wayne Martin told a police dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers argued that the recording showed that cult members were merely 
trying to defend themselves and lacked the criminal intent that the government 
needed to support murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle's attorney, Dan Cogdell, told jurors that cultists not only had a right 
but a duty to defend themselves against excessive government force. He claimed 
that "the government has taken the position that as long as a person has a 
badge and gun, it doesn't matter. They can hit your house with 75 agents, they 
can gas it . . . in the name of the law."

ANAHEIM CRIME PUTS CITY, DISNEY ON GUARD; SAFETY: PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE AIMED 
AT AVOIDING MIAMI-LIKE TOURIST VIOLENCE AROUND AMUSEMENT PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Another Miami? 
</P>
<P>
 To a city dominated by tourism, the image is a jarring one. But there it was 
in black and white, an ominous prediction by Anaheim's interim police chief 
that a tourist might one day become a victim of spreading gang violence in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardly a weekend goes by without a gang-related shooting," then-Chief Jimmie 
Kennedy wrote in a confidential memo last Nov. 9 to the city manager about 
department staffing levels. "Several gang territories are within a mile of 
Disneyland. There is great potential for another Miami incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Anaheim to a city where nine tourists have been murdered may be 
harsh, city officials said last week, but they agreed that crime is Anaheim's 
most serious and vexing problem. It's a concern shared by many residents and 
businesses in the area, including one of the county's most powerful corporate 
citizens: the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the potential problem is not lost on Disney, which last year 
brought a hockey team to Anaheim and is now weighing a $3-billion expansion of 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials acknowledge they are concerned about crime issues in Anaheim 
and are trying to do something about them. Whether motivated by altruism, 
enlightened self-interest, or both, Disney officials have embarked on a highly 
visible campaign to attack the sources and symptoms of crime in the community's 
worst neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, they have swapped Mighty Ducks tickets for 106 guns, organized a 
youth hockey program called Disney GOALS to give underprivileged youngsters 
something to keep them off the streets, and formed a quasi-partnership with 
local school districts to provide job training and educational opportunities. 
Additionally, they have planned a massive new resort around Disneyland that 
would effectively give a face-lift to some of the city's most blighted 
commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can with our programs to make a difference, and 
keep people moving in the right direction," said Ron Dominguez, executive vice 
president of Walt Disney Attractions. "We recognize there's a need to help our 
young people, and give them alternatives to destructive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 But is Disney doing all this only to protect its investment in Disneyland? 
</P>
<P>
 "So what?" says Charles Ahlers, president of the Anaheim Visitor & Convention 
Bureau. "Everybody should be trying to protect their investments here. Anaheim 
is pretty fragile. We're getting competition (for tourism money) from 
everywhere. . . . Maybe what Disney is doing will start a trend." Disney's View 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say the programs they sponsor are not started out of concerns 
over crime, but rather because they want to be a "good corporate neighbor. This 
is nothing new to us," said Dominguez, noting that the company has a long 
history of community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Disney officials acknowledge being acutely aware of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think as citizens of any community you should do whatever can be done to 
deter crime," Dominguez said. "It should be everybody's concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Gaston, Anaheim's new police chief, agreed that Disney has a tradition 
of community involvement. But, he said, "it appears they're getting much more 
involved in programs directly. . . . It's something that's needed in this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gaston and Dominguez dismiss the notion that Anaheim is on the verge of 
becoming another Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gaston: "I don't think the same conditions exist here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more confidence in our community being able to control any real 
negative crime situations," said Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth agrees that the crime problem can be solved, but 
recognizes that there is potential for disaster. He said the information in the 
memo by Kennedy, who had been with the department for 29 years and was chief 
from 1980 to 1988, was disconcerting. Kennedy had returned from retirement to 
head the department while a search was underway to replace Chief Joseph T. 
Molloy, who died of a heart attack last July. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (crime problem) is something that we can't sweep under the rug," said 
Ruth, noting that in the next couple of weeks he plans to approach the Anaheim 
City Council with plans to hire 22 additional officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials have always been deeply concerned about crime -- and the 
public's perception of it -- in and around Disneyland. The company goes to 
great lengths to make sure that the "Happiest Place on Earth" is also one of 
the safest. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of security officers patrolling the park and Disneyland Hotel, in 
fact, exceeds the number of police officers patrolling the entire city. 
Currently, there are 382 Disneyland security officers responsible for about 250 
acres, compared to 352 sworn police officers covering the 30,800 acres within 
the city. Inside Disneyland 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials rarely discuss crime at the park. But a glimpse of 
Disneyland's crime problem was revealed in environmental and planning documents 
released two years ago for the currently planned $3-billion expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those documents, there were 5,292 security incidents reported at 
the park in 1991. Anaheim police officers, however, were only called to respond 
1,084 times. The most commonly reported incidents were theft, vandalism, 
assault and battery, auto thefts, shoplifting and trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney security officers prefer to investigate such incidents themselves, 
interrogating witnesses, collecting evidence and writing their own incident 
reports before handing cases over to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Tom Wood rates Disneyland among the safest places in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do a good job of controlling their environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Disneyland's borders it is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a mile of the park are some of Anaheim's most crime-ridden 
neighborhoods, where gang-related shootings are not uncommon, police said. More 
than 51 gangs have been identified in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's concerns about nearby crime apparently prompted a key change in the 
proposed expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Disney officials said they planned to have a shopping promenade 
that would open to the public. But when the final plans were unveiled, Disney 
had put the shopping district inside the park, effectively excluding the 
public. Sources close to the project said the change was made because of crime 
concerns, but Dominguez discounted that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the expanded Anaheim complex will have guests driving directly 
from freeway off-ramps into parking structures, bypassing Anaheim's streets. 
Disney said that was designed to avoid traffic problems, not crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is not alone in its concern over crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel and motel managers in the area are also mindful of the crime 
picture, and how it affects tourism. "It's an industrywide problem," said Ned 
Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott and board member of the 
Anaheim Visitor & Convention Bureau. "Everybody is aware of it." Perception Can 
Hurt 
</P>
<P>
 How bad is the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials and business leaders say it's not as bad as many people, 
including retired Chief Kennedy, perceive it to be. But for a community that 
makes its living on tourism, perception can be as damaging as reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim has every reason to be concerned," said John Poimiroo, director of 
the California division of tourism in Sacramento. "Tourism is extremely 
vulnerable to crime and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike natural disasters that disrupt the flow of tourists, like fires or 
earthquakes, crime has a more protracted impact on tourism, he said. Tourism in 
Florida, he said, has suffered greatly because of the violence there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlers, the head of the Visitor & Convention Bureau, said that tourism is 
always at the mercy of public perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're doing OK," Ahlers said. "Anaheim may not be the safest place 
in the world, but we're not labeled unsafe either." 
</P>
<P>
 Police acknowledge that violent crimes have increased in the city over the 
past 10 years. For example there were 11 homicides in 1983 compared to 35 in 
1992, and 26 in 1993. Aggravated assaults in 1992 -- the most current 
statistics available -- were also up more than 35% since 1986, according to the 
state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Anaheim has considerably less violent crime than Miami, according to 
statistics from the FBI. There were 3.42 murders for every 10,000 residents of 
Miami in 1992 -- the last year for which such figures were available -- 
compared to 1.27 per every 10,000 residents of Anaheim. Residents of Miami 
suffered more than twice as many rapes per capita and about six times as many 
robberies and assaults, the statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, who was appointed police chief last month, said the city is trying to 
cope with the gang and drug problems that are plaguing many Southern California 
communities. He said that while some violent crimes have increased over the 
years, the city has experienced a drop in some other crimes such as property 
crimes and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that Anaheim police are being stretched thinner. There 
are twice as many calls for service as there were 10 years ago, but the 
department has added only 10% more officers to deal with the increased 
workload. The city's population -- now 285,477 -- grew by 26% over the same 
10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 By almost all accounts, the officers in Anaheim are doing a better job with 
fewer resources than 10 years ago. And, the city is aggressively pursuing 
community policing efforts that attempt to draw on all the city's departments 
and resources together to combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts of the police and city alone are not enough, City Manager Ruth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens and the business community need to take responsibility for the 
problem and get involved," Ruth said. "People need to step up to the plate and 
help -- like Disney. What they are doing is real positive." Tale of Two Cities 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, Anaheim's interim police chief said the city's gang and 
drug problem created a "great potential for another Miami incident" -- an 
allusion to the robbery-slayings of tourists that has prompted several foreign 
governments to discourage tourism there. Acomparison of crime rates per 10,000 
residents for 1992 shows that crime is considerably more pervasive in Miami.

DISSENTERS ASIDE, UNITY IS WATCHWORD AT GOP CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a stack of fake "million-dollar bills" in the pocket of his suit jacket, 
UC Irvine student Matt Zandi anxiously shuffled his feet as he waited at the 
back of a packed hotel meeting room at the state GOP convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Zandi, 21, and other members of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom 
were listening to -- and often heckling -- U.S. Senate candidate, Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who plans to tap his family's wealth in his bid 
to unseat Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 And then on cue, as Huffington ended his portion of the candidates' forum, 
Zandi rushed up to the stage and then across the room, throwing the bogus 
currency at the candidate and his supporters. Huffington, the conservatives 
yelled, cannot "buy" the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The gimmick was pretty much the extent of the protest by conservatives as 
party leaders sought to emphasize unity and steered away from litmus test 
issues that previously divided the party's moderates and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County delegates leave the convention today, they face a major 
challenge: how to maintain unity and diminish the roar of discontent among 
conservative activists, but keep them excited enough to work for Republican 
victories in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolving that dilemma is crucial for statewide GOP candidates who count on 
Orange County to produce vote margins of more than 2 to 1 -- enough to push 
some candidates over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's well-financed campaign makes him the best bet to win the June 7 
primary even though he is not yet well-known by voters statewide, the young 
Orange County activists acknowledged later. But they are nonetheless looking to 
former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, the conservatives' 
conservative, to carry their banner. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dannemeyer supporter from Orange County, who spoke on condition that his 
name not be used, predicted that unless the young party activists find a reason 
to get involved, the November election could be a repeat of 1992, when U.S. 
Sen. John Seymour, a moderate Republican from Anaheim, lost to Feinstein.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the party definitely needs Bill Dannemeyer, in a sense, to rally the 
troops and get them out to the polls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gov. Pete Wilson facing no major challenger in the GOP primary, the 
conservatives said they are muffling their usual criticism of the governor 
because he is the party's standard-bearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson angered many conservatives last year by opposing Proposition 174, the 
school voucher initiative that would have given parents $2,600 per child in 
government money toward school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Wilson's standing in public opinion polls has risen, and animosity 
among the GOP once reserved for Wilson is "gone, gone, gone, gone," state GOP 
Chairman Tirso del Junco said as the convention opened Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are so focused and so united that it's pathetic. You will see the 
conservatives come behind Pete Wilson. Orange County and Southern California . 
. . is very much united," Del Junco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has made amends in Orange County, said state Sen. Rob Hurtt 
(R-Garden Grove) whose Garden Grove-based Container Supply Co. has contributed 
to conservative causes, including the school voucher initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard for (conservatives) to get behind (Wilson) when he keeps 
going against us," Hurtt said. But when the alternative is a Democratic 
governor, "push comes to shove and we go with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson political consultant George Gorton said during an interview Saturday 
that the governor's approval rating is higher among Orange County Republicans 
than it is statewide. The notion that Wilson strikes a chord of discontent 
among the party's conservatives is "a myth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is very well liked by the party," Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach developer Buck Johns, a leading member of the influential 
Lincoln Club, agreed that Wilson has the support of local conservatives, 
particularly when he focuses on economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there would be greater enthusiasm if (two-time Senate candidate) 
Bruce Herschensohn were the standard-bearer, but he's not," Johns said. "Pete 
became the standard-bearer because he won the governorship . . . and he's done 
a hell of a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said the more conservative faction of the 
party also realized that contentious debates on social issues got in the way of 
the party's broader and more important goal -- to win elections -- and caused 
the political defeats of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned something from that," Conroy said. "We have to make sure that we 
don't go out of here fractured and swinging at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Convention floor fights on social issues such as abortion and gays that marked 
state Republican meetings in recent years are not expected to be replayed today 
when the delegates vote on resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, crime control and health care have dominated the policy discussions 
at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton told delegates Saturday that the November election will be driven by 
voters' demands for action on the economy, crime, illegal immigration, 
education and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has disappeared faster in my lifetime than the abortion issue," 
Gorton said in a later interview. "It's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, who did not attend the 
convention, said the statewide races are so "low key" that some Orange County 
delegates delayed their arrival at the convention Friday. They detoured through 
Los Angeles to be part of the "Tonight Show" audience for the scheduled 
appearance of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh, it seemed, was a "bigger draw" than the convention, Fuentes said, 
"but then, Rush Limbaugh is pretty big stuff anywhere."

POLICE APPROVE WAGE CONTRACT WITH ANAHEIM; UNIONS: THE OVERWHELMING VOTE TO 
ACCEPT A 6.75% INCREASE OVER TWO YEARS SIGNALS AN END TO 19 MONTHS OF 
ACRIMONIOUS NEGOTIATIONS. ILL FEELINGS LINGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers, enmeshed in an angry and protracted wage dispute with the 
city, have grudgingly voted to accept a new contract that will mean a 6.75% 
raise for more than 300 officers at the county's third biggest department, the 
union said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen months into the impasse, officers approved the contract by a vote of 
268 to 33. But a union official said the overwhelming margin was more a 
reflection of exasperation than satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract was accepted, reluctantly accepted," Anaheim Police Assn. 
President Bruce Bottolfson said after tallying votes collected earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought so hard for this damn thing, but it's gotten to the point that 
we're obviously not getting any farther with the city, so it's basically, 'take 
the money and run.' " Bottolfson said. "We realized we couldn't squeeze any 
more out of the lemon." 
</P>
<P>
 Working without a contract since July, 1992, many Anaheim officers grew 
increasingly bitter during contract negotiations, as they picketed at City Hall 
and Disneyland, staged a 24-hour "blue flu" sickout, and traded angry barbs 
with city officials. One officer even intentionally ticketed Mayor Tom Daly's 
car for expired vehicle tags. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the dispute came down to wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers' union complained that they had not had a raise since mid-1991 
and ranked only 18th out of 20 Orange County cities in police salaries -- even 
though Anaheim's 352 officers make it third in size in the county, behind only 
the Sheriff's Department and Santa Ana police. Anaheim police salaries range 
from $2,804 to $4,040 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers wanted a 10% raise over two years, but city officials said 
Anaheim's financial problems -- it is expecting an $8-million shortfall for the 
coming fiscal year -- made that virtually impossible. The city ultimately 
bumped its final offer earlier this month by 0.25%, proposing a 6.75% raise 
spread over two years. That was the proposal accepted on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved package also includes an immediate bonus of $1,000 for each 
officer -- above the $750 initially offered by the city -- and increased 
medical benefits for police retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great, it really is," City Manager James D. Ruth said when told 
Saturday about the outcome of the union vote. "It's a significant 
accomplishment for everybody, and I think everybody feels good about the 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the resolution of the police dispute also should enable the city to 
speed talks with three other municipal unions that are negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was obviously the most contentious one, the most difficult because the 
negotiations have been so prolonged," he said. "Now that it's resolved, I think 
it'll help to be able to focus on these other (employee) groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the police officers, Ruth acknowledged, "aren't happy, and that's 
unfortunate, but it's the best we can do. . . . We recognize that we've fallen 
behind in base pay, and we're trying to bridge that gap, but how do you bridge 
the gap when you're operating at a deficit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on both sides of the bargaining table said that the months of 
gridlock in the dispute -- and the protests that accompanied it -- put a 
serious strain on police-city relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in everybody's best interests to move on," Ruth said. "I can put all 
this behind me, but frankly, I think those guys' actions have been really 
unprofessional and illegal. . . . Public employees aren't allowed to strike and 
everybody knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the police association, Bottolfson said the officers' bitter experience 
over the past 19 months will prompt them to become more involved in city 
politics. That process began in earnest Saturday, as union officials 
interviewed five candidates vying for open council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The police protests served to pull union members together, but they did little 
in ending the contract dispute, he said. "It didn't do a lot for us. 
Realistically, it made us realize that we've got to do more politically. . . . 
We'll be out walking the precincts." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson was particularly critical of Mayor Daly, who recently began meeting 
privately with the union president to seek an end to the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe he didn't play any role" in the resolution, Bottolfson 
said. "All he did was get our expectations up. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly could not be reached for comment Saturday.

DANA PARSONS: HE'S A DUES-PAYING MEMBER OF THE COMPUTER ILLITERATI

 I read somewhere that the imminent wave of electronic technology will create 
hundreds of new millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 NEWS FLASH: I will not be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 While everyone else is zooming off merrily onto the information superhighway, 
I'll still be gassing up alongside the dirt road of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "Let's Get Interactive" age, I'm still just a "Quit Buggin' Me" kinda 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had one personal computer. Maybe you had the same model: the "Aaarrgh 
2000." I believe that line has been discontinued due to excessive consumer 
complaints. Anyway, it was given to me by a friend when he upgraded his system, 
and I thanked him profusely because it marked my entry into the computer world. 
Only after he was long gone did I come to discover his gift was the equivalent 
of giving me a dog with fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer is now resting comfortably in its packing box in the back of my 
closet, next to the ski boots I haven't taken out in five years. Needless to 
say, the contraption is probably obsolete by today's standards, looking like 
something that may have been invented by Eli Whitney. It is available to the 
highest bidder, no reasonable offer refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus have I gone to bed every night for the last five years without a 
functional home computer. It has not been an easy sleep. It doesn't comfort me 
to read that there are 30 million computers in American households. In other 
words, I realize that something may be passing me by. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to a friend who's riding the tail of the computer comet. He's amazed 
at the wonders at his fingertips, especially after he "met" someone named Marla 
on his PC who invited him into her "room" for some talk about S-E-X. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him that "Marla" could well be a longshoreman from New Jersey, but he 
said, "What do I care?" I told him I saw a talk show where people have actually 
been bilked out of thousands of dollars by people they met over their home 
computers. "Marla's not like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want you thinking I'm a modern-day Luddite. I don't hate the computer 
or want all of them destroyed. I admit that my reaction is born largely of 
ignorance. Like all small-minded people, I fear the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I haven't tried to become computer-friendly. For example, after 
being disdainful of "Pong" when it hit the scene years ago, I came to excel at 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep down, I was hoping it was all a fad. I never really believed they could 
do all this computer stuff they said they could do. I was hoping it would be 
like the threats about the metric system -- talk about it for years, throw 
everybody into a panic, then abruptly pull the plug on it. 
</P>
<P>
 This communications technology stuff, though, looks like it's here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The tip-off is all these communications companies that want to merge. Cable 
companies wanting to merge with phone companies. I thought cable companies 
hated phone companies. Or is it the other way around? The articles always say 
the companies are "positioning" themselves for something, but then I can't 
understand the rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I see where the "done deal" between the TCI cable company and Bell Atlantic 
fell through. The article said they would have reached 40% of all households. 
Reached 40% of all households to do what? Just what were these guys up to, 
anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was for $33 billion, so it sounds to me like a good one to have 
fallen through. Any transaction worth that much money is going to result in 
something that I can't figure out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is that prospect of becoming one of the new millionaires. That 
does give me pause. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend says the new interactive age will be looking for programming 
geniuses. I'm not too modest to say that I've always considered myself a 
programming genius, but my friend said they don't mean from the standpoint of 
watching programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine. Have it their way. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm content to watch the parade pass by. I'm sure somebody will explain it all 
to me at the appropriate time. Somebody will come to the house, give me 
directions to the superhighway and wish me luck. 
</P>
<P>
 A final thought: As these geniuses are building the information superhighway, 
have any of them had the foresight to build some rest areas?

FLYING OFF THE HANDLE; DOGFIGHT AMONG RIVAL MODEL-PLANE GROUPS ESCALATES INTO 
LEGAL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversy has divided friends, cast a shadow over an otherwise innocent 
hobby and, on occasion, allegedly prompted death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The warring sides hate each another to the point of one suing the other in a 
multimillion-dollar federal court action. And there's a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
 What's stirred such ill will is radio-controlled model airplane flying, which 
involves more than 12,000 participants between the ages of 10 and 74 in Orange 
County alone. Statewide, the sport has more than 33,000 fliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's causing really strained relations among people who have been friends for 
a long, long time," said Bob Pompeo, owner of Hobby Town USA in Trabuco Canyon. 
"This is a hobby people are trying to enjoy. And for a lot of people, it's 
turning into a real drag." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old Dallas-based Sport Flyers Assn. is suing the granddaddy of the 
sport, the 56-year-old Muncie, Ind.-based Academy of Model Aeronautics. The 
upstart group says the older group wields a nationwide monopoly that is 
crippling its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 SFA says that, in effect, AMA so dominates the sport that in order to fly 
these planes at all, one must belong to the AMA or risk not being able to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, pending in federal court in Dallas, charges the AMA with unfair 
business practices and restraint of trade under antitrust laws. But with 
graphic descriptions, it also illustrates how volatile the issues have become. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 160,000 AMA members are now ruled by leaders who are using their 
considerable power to harass and attack SFA," the suit charges, further 
claiming that "SFA members have been excluded from public flying sites, 
threatened and even assaulted and/or beaten by AMA members or supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 AMA officials deny the allegations and have filed a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no such incidents have occurred in Orange County, although several 
have been reported in San Diego County, where SFA officials say the problem is 
more explosive than anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the dispute threatens to limit where model flying can take place in 
Orange County and may force AMA members, here and elsewhere, to pay much higher 
dues if their group loses the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the suit's key issues is insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Model-airplane fliers must carry both medical and liability insurance, which 
only two groups in the country offer -- AMA and SFA. The suit alleges that, by 
blocking SFA fliers from public sites, AMA officials have virtually mandated 
that all fliers belong to its organization and buy its insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, they're saying, 'You can't be insured unless you belong to one 
group or the other, but the only way you'll ever fly here is if you belong to 
ours,' " said an SFA representative, who asked not to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the emergence of SFA, AMA was the only agency in the country offering 
liability insurance to members -- which model airplane fliers say is a 
necessity, should cars, people or structures be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio-controlled plane zooming out of control recently killed a spectator at 
a Phoenix event. And one once put a three-foot-wide hole in the side of a 
Goodyear blimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Such planes commonly weigh between four and eight pounds and have wingspans of 
60 to 70 inches. But Bruce Moore, the recognized leader of the sport in Orange 
County, knows of one plane that weighs 65 pounds with a wingspan of 29 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Crashes prompting insurance claims are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, an independent flier -- 
belonging to neither group and thus uninsured -- crashed a model plane into the 
head of a passing jogger. The jogger is suing the county for thousands of 
dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Bunker, liability claims manager for the county, said a similar suit is 
pending and will soon go to trial. In that one, a man claiming to have been 
injured by a model plane in Mile Square Park is suing the county for damages 
although the pilot was fully insured. 
</P>
<P>
 The county recently made plans to end radio-controlled flying at Mile Square 
Park by soliciting private development of the triangular-shaped, 137-acre area 
used by hobbyists who like its 1,000-foot-long, 100-foot-wide runways once used 
by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once development begins -- and the date is uncertain -- the county's only 
public site for model-aircraft flying will be eliminated, effectively freezing 
out the local members of Sport Flyers Assn., who would have to look for a 
private site or hope a public venue emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA wouldn't be affected because it leases a privately owned site for 
flying in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, president of the Flying Falcons of Saddleback Valley, belongs to the 
AMA, as do 10,000 other model-aircraft fliers in Orange County. An estimated 
2,000 belong to the rival group. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sport Flyers members want to fly in Orange County, Moore said, they're 
welcome at the private site in Trabuco Canyon, but first must join the Flying 
Falcons -- who lease the property -- and then enroll in the AMA.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Moore says, SFA membership carries almost no weight in Orange 
County, absent membership in the AMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompeo, the 45-year-old hobby shop owner, is, for instance, a member of both 
Sport Flyers and the AMA, but it's only the latter affiliation that permits him 
to fly in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's organization has largely sidestepped the issues raised in the lawsuit 
by using a private site, where it can easily impose its own bylaws and dues, as 
well as those of the AMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Sport Flyers allege that flying clubs across the country are 
seeking to prohibit its members, mostly at public sites, such as San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, which allows access only to AMA members. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County fliers often practice their hobby in San Diego, where SFA 
officials say none of the 22 flying clubs allows its members to fly, although 
three-quarters of the sites are publicly owned. 
</P>
<P>
 SFA officials allege that it's the AMA banning them from flying and using 
"scare tactics" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that such exclusion is an example of "restraining trade to 
protect a virtual monopoly" in what SFA officials call "a billion-dollar 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Howard, president of Sport Flyers Assn., declined to comment on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Lowe, president of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, said from his 
home in Altamonte Springs, Fla., that the AMA had tried to settle the suit 
repeatedly, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've charged us with unfair business practices, which we think is a bunch 
of crap," Lowe said. "They're claiming we're unfair, so we've countersued, 
we're so angry about it." He declined to discuss the countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe sighed and said, "This is supposed to be fun, a hobby. . . . But when 
you've got this hanging over your head and you've got to deal with it and pay 
attorneys -- well, it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined further comment, except to say he worries most about the fate of 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore shares that fear, saying the Orange County model-aircraft flier will, 
like AMA members across the country, be made to pay if SFA wins in court. 
Steeper dues will undoubtedly be required to pay court costs and damages, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sunny afternoon, Moore, 62, and two of his club's members flew 
planes around the perimeter of a quiet valley, near a rural creek. The pilots 
sent their planes soaring skyward, then dipping furiously in figure-eight 
pirouettes, before landing them flawlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompeo, the hobby shop owner, said he figured it was only a matter of time 
before society's litigious ways touched even model-aircraft enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, there's nothing more thrilling than to take a box full of wood and 
sticks and build something," he said. "Then put a radio in it and watch it take 
off, fly around and land, all in one piece. It's extremely gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 But until the lawsuit is settled, it will never be as gratifying as it could 
be or was before. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fighting like a bunch of kids," Pompeo said. "I wish they'd all get 
together and work it out and let everyone fly. After all, no one owns the sky." 
Flyer Safety 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the radio-controlled airplane controversy is the issue of 
insurance. Such protection is considered important should a plane go awry and 
crash into a car, building or person. 
</P>
<P>
 High flying: Planes stay below 400 feet to avoid colliding with real aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Far Flying: Some planes respond up to three miles away. For safety reasons, 
pilots fly within a designated 400- to 600-yard airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Precautions Pilots flying radio-controlled planes observe these 
restrictions: * Flights limited to six to 10 minutes. * Volunteer air-traffic 
controllers monitor takeoffs, flights and landings. * Only five planes may be 
in flight at any one time. * Spectators are not allowed on airfield.

A SPEECH-LESS CLASS FINDS ITS VOICE AGAIN; EDUCATION: FIVE FORMER STUDENTS 
RETURN TO THE NEWPORT HARBOR HIGH DRAMA DEPARTMENT TO TEACH PROGRAM AND REVIVE 
THE DEBATE TEAM, WHOSE MEMBERS WILL TRY TO QUALIFY FOR THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several years after finishing college, Amy Tygart has gone back to high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 There she is, roaming the same halls -- sometimes in the same jeans -- as she 
did as a teen-ager. By day, the 23-year-old Tygart manages a pediatrician's 
office, but each Wednesday night she and four other former speech and debate 
champions return to the Newport Harbor High drama department and their beloved 
speech class. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, they're the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very strange. It's like a parent and a child: Your parents, you don't 
understand them and you think they're geeks, but then you grow up . . . and you 
say, 'Oh. . . .' It's like that! All of a sudden, I'm a teacher. I'm a geek!" 
Tygart said one recent evening as she tutored a girl who could be her younger 
sister. "A lot of the kids remind me of myself or of my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tygart and the other coaches were away at college, Newport Harbor's 
longtime drama director died and the speech program died with him. The new 
drama director had other priorities that left her with little time for evening 
speech classes and weekend tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The school had no money to hire another speech coach, so for several years 
there was no team. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gregg Schwenk, a 1986 graduate, visited his alma mater and offered to 
come in "every once in a while" to work on students' speech skills during drama 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while grew to 'Why don't you take over the class?' " Schwenk 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, enrollment in Schwenk's evening speech class has jumped 
from eight students to 40 and the team is once again winning local tournaments, 
with some students trying to qualify for the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 For the coaches, it is a mix of nostalgia and community service that keeps 
them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of a nerd, I guess. I was not the most popular guy on campus by 
any means. (Speech) gave me a place," recalled Mark Tygart, 26, Amy's older 
brother and Schwenk's former debate partner. "It gave me a social sense of 
identity that I really lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think I'd leave high school sometime," he said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tygart, who, like Schwenk, works at a mergers and acquisitions firm, 
added: "But I have a certain amount of enjoyment in doing it. If you've been 
working since 8:30 a.m., you don't want to go off and volunteer doing something 
you loathe." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent evening during "class" -- essentially a series of auditions, 
rehearsals and research sessions with people alternately sprawled on the floor, 
sitting in the halls or standing at makeshift podiums -- the coaches seemed to 
have as much fun as the students. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner, a girl is opining about the rise of crime. In another, another 
girl passionately recites a monologue about death. Upstairs, a full-fledged 
spar has broken out over whether students should be required to take 
standardized tests before receiving high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 That's SPAR, or "spontaneous argument," a speech tournament category that 
tests articulateness and quick thinking through impromptu debate and 
cross-examination on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At tournaments, students compete in various events. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiercest battle is in formal debate, in which contestants prepare as many 
as 2,000 note cards on a single topic -- this year's is health care -- and then 
have a short time to prepare arguments on a specific, narrower question. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm-up for debaters is a mock congress where students imitate lawmakers with 
speeches about bills and resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rounds involve dramatic or humorous interpretation of readings, or 
extemporaneous speeches about current events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like debate. I can't win with my parents -- most kids can't -- but I can 
win with my friends," said Ryan Simpkins, 16, champion of Wednesday night's 
practice SPAR. "And even if you don't win, you can still have fun. I love to 
argue." 
</P>
<P>
 As more and more schools cut performing arts electives from their curricula 
because of tight budgets, the volunteer coaches are the only way to keep the 
speech program alive, school officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them, the program would fall flat," said Newport Harbor Principal 
Steve Pavich. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's four high schools, only one other has a speech team -- it, 
too, is coached by an alumnus of the program who serves as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides arguing, speech class builds self-esteem, teaches research and 
analysis strategies and develops skills critical to jobs, the coaches said. 
Students also keep up with current events and learn a lot of history from Mark 
Tygart, whom Simpkins called "a living World Book." 
</P>
<P>
 For students, the after-school elective offers five credits, an extra grade 
and a perk on a college application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speech was really a great thing for me, giving me a little more self-esteem, 
making me feel like I fit into a group," said Amy Tygart, who, in addition to 
her job, is studying at UC Irvine to be a high school English teacher. "Even 
somebody who isn't a champion speaker, someone who just improves a little in 
this class, it's something that they'll take with them the rest of their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwenk said he uses the skills he learned as a debater "every day." 
</P>
<P>
 But never are they more pertinent than when he is standing at the front of the 
drama room, suddenly an authority in shirt and tie, trying to get the class to 
be quiet, take roll and give directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view this from time to time as our penance," he admitted. "When our 
student turns to us and says, 'I don't have my homework,' that's getting back 
at us for all the times I didn't have my homework."

CLASH OF THE VIGILANTES; 2 CRIME-FIGHTING GROUPS HAVE NEW FOES -- EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 The battle against street crime along Sepulveda Boulevard has a new set of 
combatants -- neighbor against neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On a crime-ridden corner along the boulevard, two radically different groups 
are clashing over how to eliminate crime in their neighborhood. It's a clash of 
personalities as much as tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The town may not be big enough for the both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-proclaimed citizen crime-fighter Mary Lou Holte complains that a 
Neighborhood Watch group led by Joseph and Mary Williams has invaded her turf 
on the northwest corner of Vanowen Street and Sepulveda Boulevard. She said the 
group's effort to scare away prostitutes and their customers by picketing the 
boulevard is an ineffective publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses say that Holte's one-woman patrol against crime during the past 
several years has netted only publicity for Holte and has done little to put a 
bite in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the spat are the police -- and a controversy over citizen 
patrols' effectiveness and how they should operate. The debate has even drawn 
national attention, with Holte appearing on nationally televised shows such as 
"Larry King Live," "20/20" and, with Joseph Williams, on "The Jerry Springer 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is out of control," said Holte, 45, who makes her 
headquarters at a doughnut shop on the corner of Vanowen and Sepulveda. "It's 
called jealousy. They've tried to tear my program apart. I'm talking about the 
police and (the Williamses') little community watch group. It's dividing and 
conquering the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't doing any good," countered Joseph Williams, 52. "She wasn't 
chasing any prostitutes away. I feel sorry for her, but the woman was out there 
for some sort of glory." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Holte nor the Williamses' group has any formal police training in how 
to identify criminals. Police have not discouraged their efforts but also 
express concerns about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand the neighbors' plight," said Sgt. Larry Mauldin of the Van 
Nuys Division vice squad. "One doesn't want to prompt vigilantism, but 
sometimes people have to do what they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups wince at the term "vigilante." They are merely citizens, they say, 
trying to take back the streets they love. 
</P>
<P>
 Since at least the 1970s, say police and neighborhood residents, Sepulveda 
Boulevard has been a favorite marketplace for prostitutes, drug dealers and 
their customers. Residents complain that much of this illegal activity flows 
into their neighborhoods as prostitutes perform lewd acts in parked cars and 
drug addicts toss dirty syringes in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, vice officers at the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
station have conducted a number of sting operations to combat the crime problem 
and, last year, received $15,000 from City Councilman Marvin Braude's office to 
step up arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past three years, one motel, a mini-mall and a convenience store 
along the boulevard have been ordered by authorities to hire security guards, 
erect lights or take other measures to combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city gathered testimony from angry residents at a public 
hearing to consider similar actions against five Sepulveda Boulevard motels 
suspected of catering to prostitutes and drug dealers. No ruling has yet been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents have grown tired of waiting for others to solve the crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte's crusade began six years ago, she said, when she was nearly raped in an 
alley behind Sepulveda Boulevard as she was walking home. After suffering two 
broken ribs while fighting off her attacker, Holte formed the Town Keepers 
Action Group, an organization of residents, which began meeting monthly to 
pinpoint crime problems in their neighborhood or to share their concerns with 
public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1989, Holte took her crusade to the street. "I wasn't going to be a 
victim," said Holte, who lives on disability because of a congenital lung 
defect. "I was going to help others be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at Holte's meetings varies, with recent gatherings attracting about 
50 residents. She's the only one, however, who actually hits the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 During her foot patrols, Holte quietly urges suspected prostitutes to leave 
the streets, chases street vendors and suspected drug dealers from corners, 
confronts motel managers about allowing prostitution and jots down the license 
numbers of cars she suspects carry drug dealers or prostitutes. She has also 
made several citizen's arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Holte said, she was the lone citizen patrolling the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in December, lumber salesman Joseph Williams said he got tired of seeing 
prostitutes strut along at the corner of Kittridge Street and Sepulveda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams collected several of the members in his 8-year-old Neighborhood Watch 
group and began parading on the troubled corner with video cameras and placards 
that warned both hookers and their customers to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is the first regularly organized effort to scare away 
prostitutes and customers from a San Fernando Valley neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to put the fear of God in them," said Williams, who has been 
videotaping the activities and license plates of the suspected clients. "The 
neighborhood is angry." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be walking to the supermarket with my son and guys will pull up and ask 
'how much?' " said 25-year-old Kym Dunn, who recently carried a picket sign 
with her 1-year-old boy, Matthew. "I'll say, 'Get away from me. Can't you see 
I've got a kid with me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't confront anybody," said Mary Williams, 51. "Normally, just walking 
with the signs is enough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses' efforts have since expanded into other regions of Sepulveda 
Boulevard. Earlier this month, the group acquired cellular telephones and 
walkie-talkies and began moving their pickets and video cameras to Sepulveda 
and Vanowen. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was on the airwaves, not a street corner, where Holte and Williams 
first clashed. During a nationally televised encounter aired this month on "The 
Jerry Springer Show," the two bitterly criticized each other's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Williamses have begun carrying their placards and video 
cameras to the corner in front of the doughnut shop as well as other spots on 
the intersection. Holte says the Williamses are harassing her and want to stop 
her patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very intimidating," Holte said. "Because they want me to join their 
effort and stop what I've been doing. The battle started after I made national 
attention. There was no battle before that except the Police Department. Where 
were they five years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Williams disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the worst corners in the Valley," she said. "If she's doing 
such a good job over five years, why has it been such a problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Police acknowledge that the corner has been a magnet for crime. In 1992, 
residents and city officials worked together to impose operating restrictions 
on a 7-Eleven store in the same mini-mall because it attracted drug dealers and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But police will not say whether either side should make room for the other. 
The effectiveness of both has received mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the sense that she provides us with information on criminal activity, 
she's a valuable resource," Van Nuys station Capt. James McMurray said of 
Holte. "In the sense that she takes some of these situations into her own 
hands, she sometimes puts us in a situation where it costs more in police 
resources to undo a situation that didn't need to happen in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the Williamses' group is also unclear. Although police say there 
is nothing they can do with the videotapes of license plates, some prostitutes 
say the pickets have discouraged them from frequenting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been avoiding that area because of them," said one 22-year-old 
prostitute who was working farther up Sepulveda. "You lose a lot of business." 
</P>
<P>
 But police expressed some concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad that the citizens are out there doing that, but we're also 
concerned for their safety, because a lot of the girls have pimps who have 
hired Southland gangs to protect them," said Officer Andrew Neiman of the Van 
Nuys vice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict on the corner of Sepulveda and Vanowen is not expected to end 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not be told by any group where I can go," Holte said. "I'm not 
stopping my patrols." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Williams said he will do whatever it takes, within the law, to 
scare crime away from the boulevard, no matter what anybody says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes wearing a gorilla suit," he said, "I'll wear a gorilla suit."

DOMESTIC CALL IS THE DEADLIEST OF ALL FOR POLICE; CRIME: OFFICER'S SLAYING A 
GRIM REMINDER THAT HOME DISTURBANCES ACCOUNT FOR MAJORITY OF ON-DUTY DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's one of the first things they tell you when you put on a police officer's 
gun and badge: Responding to a domestic disturbance call is probably the most 
dangerous thing you'll ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget bank robberies and collaring murder suspects. More police officers are 
killed or seriously injured when answering a domestic call than anything else 
they will do in the line of duty, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, police must thrust themselves into the middle of an already volatile 
situation between an enraged -- and armed -- husband and wife, or father and 
son, with little or no information to go on. Or a seemingly harmless squabble 
can turn deadly at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, police again were reminded of such perils when Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, a 45-year-old rookie officer, was fatally shot early Tuesday as she 
answered a call of shots fired in a domestic dispute in Northridge. Although 
officers knew someone had called 911 claiming he had shot his father, they had 
no idea what to expect when they arrived at the Amestoy Avenue house where 
17-year-old speed freak Christopher Golly had already killed his dad, Steven. 
By then, he had hidden behind a wall with an assault rifle and was waiting for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they know they can be gunned down, like Hamilton -- or stabbed, 
beaten or bludgeoned -- at any time during a visit to someone's house, even if 
they take all the precautions possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll make you think twice the next time you go on a family disturbance 
call," said patrol Officer Kristin Traynor, who worked with Hamilton at the 
Devonshire Station during the four weeks Hamilton was on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what you're going into. Tensions are so high, you just don't 
know what to expect," Traynor said. "You don't expect (someone) to open fire on 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the number of officers killed or seriously injured on calls of 
domestic disturbances has risen steadily in recent years. Last year, 40% of the 
154 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty were responding to such 
calls, according to the Miami-based National Assn. of Chiefs of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, in its most recent report on officer slayings, said that disturbance 
calls accounted "for more line-of-duty deaths than any other circumstance," 
even outpacing arrests gone awry, or encounters with robbery, burglary and drug 
suspects combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officers in Southern California have been killed recently while 
responding to domestic calls. Kent Hintergardt, a Riverside County sheriff's 
deputy, was fatally shot in May while investigating a dispute outside a 
Temecula apartment. Hintergardt, 33, was shot in the head before he could pull 
his gun from its holster. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, rigorous training and role playing at the Los Angeles Police 
Academy have resulted, on average, in far fewer police deaths on domestic calls 
than in other departments nationally. But "across the board, all of us could 
tell you about close calls," said Lt. Dan Hoffman, Hamilton's boss at the 
Devonshire Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, authorities say there are so many close calls and serious injuries 
that the LAPD and most other law enforcement agencies don't even bother to keep 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, there were 91,024 assaults on police officers nationwide, more than 
eight times the number of assaults in 1960, according to a recent study by the 
police chiefs association and Columbia University. Much of that increase has 
come in the past eight years, and each year, a higher and higher percentage of 
the injuries is attributed to responses to domestic disturbances, said 
association President Dennis Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most dangerous call for a police officer to walk into, because it's 
so vague," said Gerald Arenberg, association executive director. For 30 years 
Arenberg has studied the slayings of more than 6,000 officers nationwide killed 
in the line of duty. "A family disturbance should ring for any police officer 
as one of extreme danger. It is a very scary call to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Police frequently are called repeatedly to the same house to quell 
disturbances caused by warring spouses or siblings. But they must assess each 
situation independently and immediately. Even the most modern mobile display 
terminals in LAPD squad cars, which are linked to department computers, can't 
provide a complete history on a household, said Lt. John Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if police had seized guns involved in a prior dispute at a residence, 
chances are the weapons would already be back in the hands of their owners; 
authorities can confiscate guns from an agitated resident, but state law 
requires that they return them after 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, police can haul away the violent person for psychiatric counseling 
or criminal charges, if the officers believe the person poses a threat to a 
family member or himself. But often, the most that officers can do is to quiet 
things down, leave the scene of the disturbance and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly and his father had had frequent fights, and friends say the troubled 
youth had made previous statements about wanting to kill his father. But police 
had not responded to a domestic disturbance call there before. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had gotten there sooner and separated the father and son, and the 
situation had been as volatile as it obviously was, we could have taken the 
guns out of the house," said Sgt. Ed Wheelis of the Devonshire Station. "But 
they eventually would have gotten the guns back. And what happened could have 
eventually happened anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic calls are not only getting more frequent, but increasingly dangerous 
-- and deadly -- as more and more drunken or combative homeowners arm 
themselves with knives, pistols and, as in Golly's case, assault rifles, 
authorities say. Last year, Los Angeles police officers responded to 42,698 
domestic disturbance calls that resulted in arrest reports or other paperwork. 
But the vast majority of cases ended when police broke up squabbles and left, 
said Officer Debbie Kane, a domestic violence instructor at the police academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their obvious potential for violence, it's nearly impossible to 
safeguard police from peril on domestic dispute calls, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers frequently have to contend with combatants who are on drugs or 
intoxicated, and who are in jealous rages that can propel even the most 
law-abiding citizens toward murder, Kane said. Warring spouses or family 
members often grow even more outraged that their troubles have prompted an 
intruder to come into their home, and frequently both will turn against the 
hapless officer, especially if arrests appear imminent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants us there. So they all turn on the officer," Kane said. "There 
are just a multitude of reasons why it's dangerous. And we don't know where 
their weapons are." 
</P>
<P>
 At the police academy, officers are taught to be ready for anything in a 
domestic dispute. They are told to approach each situation and each house with 
extreme caution and to immediately separate the warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
 They are instructed to pull their patrol cars up several houses away, 
particularly if the call indicated that gunshots had been fired. The officers 
called to the scene of the Golly disturbance thought they were following that 
procedure, but they unwittingly stopped in front of the Golly house. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin of the national police association remembers a similar situation in his 
home city of Bay City, Mich., several years ago. Two officers were killed after 
rolling up to a house where two brothers were shooting at each other on the 
front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just pulling up on a shotsfired call," Martin said. "As soon as 
they got out of their car, they were killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers are lulled into a false sense of security, often having to 
answer as many as five domestic calls a night, most of which can be settled 
quickly and without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every family dispute is different," said Detective Robert Pulley, who works 
cases involving juveniles. "I've been in situations myself where families were 
real hostile and there was a potential for me to be injured and everyone ends 
up happy in the end. Other times, things seem real calm, but suddenly they get 
explosive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a juvenile or adult (is involved in the disturbance), we are trained 
from day one in the academy that the domestic-related radio calls are the most 
dangerous," Pulley said. "You are dealing with human emotions, and humans 
aren't perfect. You should have a little fear reserved, to protect yourself."

VICTIMS FIND UNEXPECTED STUMBLING BLOCKS

<P>
 Nearly 1,000 hours have passed since the Northridge quake -- ample time to 
recuperate, to reassess, to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it? For the thousands of San Fernando Valley residents who were deeply 
affected by the quake, healing comes in small increments. Backsliding is 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 An unemployed man made homeless when his mobile home was destroyed Jan. 17 has 
found a job, but is living in a motel. A couple whose hillside home slid has 
discovered repairs will drag on longer and cost more than they expected. A 
merchant who quickly replenished his smashed liquor stock now faces mounting 
debts. And a woman who had moved into her garage has returned to her cracked 
house, but cannot afford to repair it. JOAQUIN MORENO 
</P>
<P>
 A single room at a motel on a seedy stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard is not 
Joaquin Moreno's idea of making it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month and a half since the Northridge quake wrecked his mobile home in 
Sylmar and left him homeless, Moreno, 30, has found his first job in nearly 
three months and has moved out of a Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the job pays poorly and a room at the Vagabond Motel is not exactly 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to look for (a second) job," he said last week. "Maybe 
working 4 p.m. to 8 or 9 . . . even to midnight if I have to." 
</P>
<P>
 At his current job, in the service department at Keyes Mazda in Van Nuys, he 
works from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., five days a week. He drives customers home 
who have left their cars at the shop, sweeps up, washes cars. Thursdays and 
Saturdays are his days off, though he works overtime at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually unsinkably optimistic, Moreno's existence on the verge of homelessness 
since the quake has caused even him to worry. For instance, one day last week, 
he realized that he had only one more night left on the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency voucher that had given him five days of refuge in the 
$30-a-night North Hills motel. 
</P>
<P>
 So after working half a day on his day off, he headed to a Red Cross center in 
San Fernando and spent several hours persuading a caseworker to call the motel 
so he could stay another week. For that, he received several sheets of paper, 
which he carefully put into an already bulging Manila folder. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's life now is dependent on official paperwork. He has forms for a place 
to live. Forms for $15 in food a day at Carl's Jr. Forms to get an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be easy after I found a job," he said. "But it's 
going OK. The only thing I need is an apartment, a place to stay. Then I'll be 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, the apartment has remained elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 He found a place he likes in Panorama City on Van Nuys Boulevard and a housing 
voucher from FEMA that will pay for it, but it hasn't worked out. The apartment 
manager has had him fill out two different applications, and the manager's 
supervisor wants additional references before renting to him. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to happen like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that all I had to do is show them the paperwork and tell them it 
was an emergency and I would have no problem," Moreno said. "I don't think the 
manager is being dishonest. I think he's just confused because no one told him 
what to do. I'm going to try to get someone from (the federal housing 
department) to come with me to take care of it, but I haven't been able to 
reach them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last month, his day has started at 5 a.m., when he has to get up to 
make it on time to work. After riding three buses, he arrives at the car 
dealership about 6:30, the sky still showing only a hint of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, when he gets home, he goes straight to his room, careful to 
avoid the forward prostitutes and persistent drug hawkers that hang around the 
stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard. He reads, writes letters, watches television. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's clothes remain in the damaged trailer. He owns only a few shirts and 
pants, underwear. A pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 To make his motel room more habitable, he asked the motel manager for a 
refrigerator and telephone. He has to pay for each phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is money," he said. "You can not do anything without money. Nada. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he smiles. And abruptly begins singing. "When I get my own place, 'I'll 
be back on the road again, can't wait to get back on the road again. . . .' " 
DANIEL K. WHANG 
</P>
<P>
 For all appearances, liquor store owner Daniel K. Whang has put the earthquake 
behind him. On a recent morning, his Northridge market was filled with the 
sounds of counter chit-chat and the brisk clack of his cash register drawer 
shutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the shelves of Whang's replenished liquor collection, silvery wires have 
been strung to prevent bottles from falling over, as they did by the hundreds 
in last month's temblor. White splotches mark where cracks and holes have been 
newly plastered. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are not nearly as rosy as they look, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, the Glendale resident's life has been awash in paperwork as 
he has attempted to get extensions on various loans to free up money to repay 
his store suppliers, who fronted him stock after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is preparing to apply for his second Small Business Administration 
disaster loan. His first was for a South-Central liquor store that was burned 
down in the April, 1992, riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, he fears he could lose his Glendale apartment building, which he 
estimates suffered $20,000 worth of damage in the earthquake. Quake damage 
drove three of Whang's four tenants from the complex, meaning that, at the 
least, Whang will lose $2,000 in rent next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a headache," admitted Whang, 41, who appeared tired yet remains 
upbeat about his life and his future. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, one bank has granted Whang a four-month extension on repayment of his 
apartment loan, but in turn required higher payments for six months beginning 
in June to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The store owner said that other bank officials have informally told him that 
extensions on his repayment schedule for loans for his own home and his 
Northridge store will be approved, but Whang worries that the terms will merely 
end up adding to his financial load. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, Whang estimates that his quake loss was less than he 
thought. He said he has incurred $83,000 worth of earthquake damage to his 
apartment building and his Northridge market, including $50,000 in lost store 
inventory -- down from his original estimate of $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulties they face, Whang and his family seem to have avoided 
the emotional trauma that often accompanies financial worries. One reason, the 
store owner says, may be that he downplays problems when speaking to his wife, 
and doesn't speak of the difficulties at all around his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I worry too much, probably my family will get depressed or panic," Whang 
said. "When I go home, I act like nothing happened. Because my family -- my 
mother, my wife, my son -- they cannot help me." LUCY PEREZ 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Perez and her family have moved back into her quake-wracked Pacoima 
house, after living for three weeks out of a tent in her front yard and, later, 
in the garage in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unsettled feeling that the quake brought has not ebbed, and her 
single-story stucco house hardly feels like a home anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the unnerving aftershocks, which widen old cracks and begin new 
ones, are the headaches of trying to maneuver through a jungle of paperwork and 
government bureaucracy to get a loan to make her home -- and life -- whole 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding process has been slow and frustrating, said the 68-year-old 
widowed grandmother, who lives on Pinney Street with her son, Eddy Perez, and 
two teen-age grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of getting better and getting our lives together, we are not," she 
said, as she gestured from her porch to huge cracks on the inside and outside 
of her home. "How can we?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, she and her son say, is that the combined income from her Social 
Security payments and his salary as a part-time worker at a pizza delivery 
business are not enough to qualify for a loan and too much for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not too rich and not too poor, so we fall in the cracks," said Lucy 
Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency did give her a $3,450 grant to make 
the house livable again, but that falls far short of the $44,000 they believe 
is needed to repair the home and replace damaged furniture and personal items. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an initial loan request was denied, FEMA and other federal loan 
agencies are still reviewing the Perez family's funding application. But Eddy 
Perez said he has been told that the most he can get is a grant for $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of the damage includes a gaping hole in the living room ceiling and 
a massive rip in the home's front wall that has left a huge sheet of stucco 
hanging precariously from the frame, like bark peeling off a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the quake, a city inspector taped a green tag to the front 
porch window, declaring the house safe. But Lucy and Eddy Perez have little 
faith in the inspection, considering it took only 10 minutes to complete and, 
since then, new cracks have appeared with every aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you live here?" Eddy Perez asked, pointing to a quarter-inch-wide crack 
that runs half the length of the living room ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lucy Perez, the financial plight she faces only compounds problems she has 
struggled with since her husband died two years ago, following a long bout with 
heart and lung ailments. His death left her with a handful of medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her son took out a second home loan, for $65,000, to pay bills and 
make some long-needed improvements around the house. But the few improvements 
that were made were spoiled by the quake and the family must now go into debt 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of little things adding up like a snowball," Eddy Perez said. 
STEVEN AND BARBARA SADD 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Northridge earthquake sent his home sliding 10 inches down a 
Sherman Oaks hillside, Steve Sadd remained convinced his life would be back on 
track within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with earthquake insurance, he contracted workers just a week after the 
quake to pull his house-on-stilts back on its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The same morning, Sadd's contractor told him that he and his wife, Barbara, 
would probably be able to return to their home within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But that month has come and gone and, like hundreds of San Fernando Valley 
residents whose homes were damaged during the quake, the Sadds have found 
themselves faced with the realization that the road to recovery will probably 
be a long and expensive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty optimistic early on, but I'll be lucky now to be back in the 
house by July," said Sadd, a Century City attorney, who is temporarily renting 
a house in West Los Angeles. "It sounds to me like they need to rebuild the 
entire house." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadd originally estimated it would take $60,000 in repairs to get his 
red-tagged home to meet building standards. But that figure quickly escalated 
to more than $100,000 after more damage was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Sadds can return to their home with its breathtaking view of the 
Valley, the floor needs to be reattached to a foundation, which in turn needs 
to be reinforced with concrete and steel beams.  
</P>
<P>
 "We would love to get back, but we're waiting for contractors, engineers and 
permits," said Barbara Sadd. 
</P>
<P>
 And all the work will have to wait until the Sadds settle with their insurance 
company, which so far has given them less than $2,000. Meanwhile, the couple 
has spent thousands of their own dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone as far as I can on my money and I'm still waiting to hear from my 
insurance company," Steve Sadd said. "They're slower than molasses." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadd said he fears that his insurance won't cover all the damages. The couple 
has yet to hear back from FEMA and they are now contemplating taking out an SBA 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after building inspectors deem the structure safe to re-enter, the Sadds 
will be faced with a disaster of broken furniture and glass that remains strewn 
throughout their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, it was wonderful because, despite all the tragedy, people 
had pulled together because we had all shared the same experience," Sadd said. 
"But now I'm feeling very discouraged. . . . I feel like I've lost more than (I 
did) before." 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been turned completely upside down and there's no light at the 
end of the tunnel."

VALLEY BRIEFING: BURBANK AIRPORT; EXPANSION PLANS TAKING OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Airport has come a long way since the days when Amelia Earhart and 
Howard Hughes frequented its airspace. It has grown tremendously since it 
opened in 1930 on 234 acres with a 27,000-square-foot terminal. Now 441 acres, 
it has a terminal of 163,344 square feet, 3,500 parking spaces and serves 4 
million passengers a year. And still another expansion is on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing longtime safety concerns, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority voted last year to build a new terminal that will be about four times 
the size of the current facility and cost about $200 million. About 5 million 
passengers per year are predicted by 1998, when the first phase of the 
expansion will be completed. Officials say that number will grow to 10 million 
by the project's completion in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion has not been without debate. A total of 2.5 million residents 
live within 10 miles of the airport and there are several schools nearby. 
Critics complain of noise and air pollution. Supporters counter that it will 
generate jobs to replace those lost after Lockheed decided to move in 1989. 
History 
</P>
<P>
 * The beginning: When Burbank Airport opened with its five 300-by-3,600-foot 
runways, it was the nation's first multimillion-dollar airport and provided 
more paved landing area than any other airport in the region. By 1934, it 
served as many as 98,000 passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Early aviators: During the 1930s, Amelia Earhart, a resident of North 
Hollywood, tested and repaired planes she purchased from Lockheed Aircraft, 
which had begun building wooden airframes in 1928 on an adjacent airstrip. 
Other early Burbank aviators were Charles Lindbergh, the first person to fly 
solo across the Atlantic; Wiley Post, who made the first solo flight around the 
world; and Howard Hughes, the aerospace tycoon. New Terminal 
</P>
<P>
 The airport authority voted in March, 1993, to build a new 670,000-square-foot 
terminal with 12,300 parking spaces northeast of the runways. A new terminal 
had been under discussion since 1980, when the Federal Aviation Administration 
pressured airport officials to replace the current terminal, which is 
considered too close to the runways. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will be in two phases. During Phase I, scheduled to be completed 
by 1998, a 465,000-square-foot building with 6,700 parking spaces on 60 acres 
will be built. The second phase will be completed in 2010. Airlines at Burbank 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines had the largest increase in passengers at Burbank since 
1992: 04,14,11,11,16 Airline 1992 1993 Percent change Southwest 1,856,211 
2,742,035 47.72% United 816,276 714,406 -12.48 America West 432,598 316,953 
-26.73 American 369,209 231,532 -37.29 Alaska 197,052 185,467 6.25 Delta 71,813 
17,622 -75.46 On-Time Performance 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures compiled in December, 1993, Burbank ranked high against 
other Los Angeles-area airports for on-time arrival and departure rates: 
03,15,09,11 Airport Arrival Departure Burbank 83.7% 87.4% LAX 75.9 85.3 Orange 
County 78.1 87.4 Ontario 80.8 88.0 Flights and Passengers 
</P>
<P>
 Takeoffs and landings have decreased....  
</P>
<P>
 1993: 207,325 
</P>
<P>
 ...while number of passengers has increased 
</P>

HUNDREDS ATTEND SERVICE FOR SLAIN SECURITY GUARD; FUNERAL: AT A CHAPEL IN 
ORANGE, MARINE CORPS HONOR GUARD SALUTES THE GULF WAR VETERAN SHOT DOWN ON WHAT 
WAS TO HAVE BEEN HIS LAST DAY ON THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Marine Dagoberto R. Carrero survived seven months of flying helicopter 
missions in the Persian Gulf, but he could not escape a senseless attack back 
home which claimed his life last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "War is mano a mano, and the other (attack) is pure cowardice," said Dennis 
Bowen, a Vietnam veteran and father-in-law of the slain Carrero, 23, who died 
in a barrage of gunfire during his shift as a security guard at a local movie 
theater Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, nearly 230 of Carrero's family and friends joined a Marine Corps 
honor guard for Carrero's funeral, filling an Orange mortuary to capacity to 
say goodby to the former serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are seeking six teen-agers who reportedly threatened Carrero when he 
asked them to leave the theater so a crew could clean up after a showing of a 
film at 7:15 the night he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two hours after Carrero was slain, a second unarmed security guard, 
19-year-old Rupert Morales of Santa Ana, was killed in an unrelated shooting as 
he attempted to direct a car into a parking space at a bar in Garden Grove. 
Funeral services for Morales will be held in Mexico today. Police are still 
searching for his killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, two Marines stood at attention at each end of Carrero's flag-draped 
coffin in the small chapel as Sgt. Major Craig Fairbanks shared his memories of 
the former soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carrero stood out from the others the first time I met him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks, who said Carrero's positive attitude always lifted the spirits of 
the people around him, noted that Carrero was chosen Marine of the Year in 1991 
from among the 250 members of his Tustin-based helicopter squadron. Carrero was 
a junior aerial gunner instructor and a crew chief on a four-member CH-53 
helicopter team. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carrero decided to leave the Marines in 1992 after three years of 
service, Fairbanks said he tried his best to persuade him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quality of Marine is needed in the Corps. I wanted him to stay for the 
future leadership of the Marine Corps . . . and when he left, the loss to the 
Corps was the gain to someone else," Fairbanks said.  
</P>
<P>
 Staff Sgt. Ricardo Segarra, who met Carrero while they served together in 
Okinawa, told the mourners that he loved Carrero like a brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not only a good person," a tearful Segarra said, "he really cared 
about other people and shared with others. There are not many people like that 
left in this world." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Carrero's supervisor from Patrol One security said Carrero 
was one of his finest employees. "He was a leader and very hard worker. I 
received more commendations from clients about him than for any of my other 
employees," said Jason Bancroft. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lone bugler played taps, two Marines folded the U.S. flag on Carrero's 
oaken casket and handed it to his wife, Nicole Carrero, 27, who sat in the 
front pew with the couple's 9-month-old daughter, Jeralyn. 
</P>

 Nicole's brother, Matt Bowen, said his sister is deeply distraught over last 
week's slaying. When Carrero did not return from his night shift at the movie 
theater, Nicole went to the theater and learned from fellow employees that her 
husband had been shot to death, Matt Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said Carrero, a native of Puerto Rico, worked two eight-hour shifts a 
day to support his family. His goal was to go to college and secure a 
high-paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he wanted to do was to provide a good life for his family," Matt Bowen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Married for 18 months, Nicole and Dagoberto Carrero had moved into a newer, 
nicer apartment in a safer neighborhood just the day before Dagoberto Carrero 
was killed, Matt Bowen said. The day of his death was to be his last assignment 
as security guard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero had been accepted into the Air National Guard, and was to fly to Texas 
Thursday for a four-month training session which Carrero hoped would eventually 
help pay for college, Matt Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the funeral, family members and close friends attended a private 
viewing. Carrero will be cremated and his wife will keep the ashes, and will 
have her ashes mixed with his after she dies, Dennis Bowen said.

HAYDEN MAKES A CAMPAIGN STOP IN COUNTY; POLITICS: THE LIBERAL STATE SENATOR, 
WHO IS SEEKING THE DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION, STRESSES THE NEED FOR 
REFORM DURING HIS APPEARANCE IN GARDEN GROVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Tom Hayden, whose liberal, anti-war record has made him a lightning rod for 
conservative Orange County legislators, brought his bid for the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination here Saturday and pleaded for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said his message to Orange County is that reform is neither a liberal 
nor conservative issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an honest, conservative businessman you will never prosper if 
(lobbyists) can buy off a politician," he said in an interview. "If you're a 
member of the ACLU, you'll never be able to save free speech in a world 
dominated by 30-second commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, Hayden appeared at a gathering of two dozen Democratic Party 
activists who met at a savings and loan here. "There are good people in 
Sacramento who occasionally do good things," he told the group. "But I'm tired 
of defining success as slowing the rate at which things get worse. . . . Every 
night in Sacramento there is a fund-raiser attended by the lobbyists, and the 
next day they go before some committee and ask for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best business investment in the world. . . ," he said. "They are the 
only ones that haven't been in economic downturn in the recession." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first venture into Orange County for Hayden, a state senator from 
Santa Monica, since his surprise Feb. 9 announcement that he was challenging 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
for his party's gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of that announcement, Hayden conceded that he has almost no chance 
of winning, but would pursue his political reform agenda in hopes that the 
other candidates will adopt some or all of it, allowing him to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 He is advocating $100 to $500 limits on campaign contributions, bans on 
political action committees and off-year fund-raising, public matching funds 
for candidates, a code of ethics for political consultants, strict lobbying 
regulations, and bans on appointments of big donors to state panels such as the 
Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the need for reform, Hayden cited the California Department 
of Transportation, which has spent only 3% of its capital budget on seismic 
retrofitting projects since the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the freeways weren't fixed," he said, "is that they were lobbied 
by developers to put in an off-ramp instead of making the freeways safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said his campaign is not directed at imposing his personal politics on 
people -- he just wants to reform the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political consultants tell Kathleen Brown, you need to raise $20 million. 
They tell John Garamendi, you need to raise $20 million. . . . That's $57,000 a 
day for 365 days. . . . And it goes to the consultants, who make a lot of 
money, and the TV crews . . . all for a 30-second spot that tells you nothing 
but how the candidate looks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is over," he said. "It's become become a branch of the advertising 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he figured that he can run a decent, cheap campaign by asking 
people to donate $94 each, as "shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see," the blandly attired Hayden said, joking, "I don't use my 
money to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, whose reform-oriented campaign has been compared to those of Jerry 
Brown and Ross Perot but without a toll-free number or colorful charts, fielded 
questions on health care, immigration, crime and education. In each case he 
criticized the latest reform proposals as failing to address root causes. For 
example, he said, immigration has been hyped as an issue for political gain, 
but on the other hand, the immigrants would not be here if U.S. businesses were 
not providing illegal jobs to undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in video game technology, Hayden said, outpace reforms needed in 
classroom instructional techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said building prison cells to keep repeat felons locked up takes away 
money from community colleges because Gov. Pete Wilson will not raise taxes to 
cover the cost for both.  
</P>
<P>
 "By opening up the prison doors he is closing the college doors," Hayden said 
of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the meeting, Hayden acknowledged that Orange County politicians have 
tried to oust him from the Legislature, including Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and even Democrat Paul Carpenter of 
Cypress, a former state senator recently convicted on political corruption 
charges, but who fled before sentencing and is now a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is (Carpenter) now?" Hayden said. He noted that Ferguson, another 
staunch critic, recently spoke highly of him in print.  
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, Hayden said, "is still fighting the Vietnam War. I'm sorry I haven't 
been able to make peace with him."

WOMAN KILLED, 3 OTHERS INJURED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was killed and three other people were injured Saturday in an accident 
on the Ventura Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 4 p.m. on the westbound freeway near the San Diego 
Freeway interchange, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, California Highway Patrol officers were still investigating the 
cause of the accident in which a car carrying two women collided with a pickup 
truck and overturned, said CHP spokesman Bruce Ferrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fatality, the accident left two adults seriously injured 
and an 8-year-old child with minor injuries, a Los Angeles Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two westbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed for more than four 
hours after the accident, Ferrier said.

SLAYING VICTIMS LEAVE SURVIVORS STRUGGLING TO COPE; BEREAVEMENT: THEY DEAL WITH 
SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES AS OTHERS WHO HAVE LOST A FAMILY MEMBER, BUT EXPERTS 
SAY THOSE WHO LOSE A RELATIVE TO HOMICIDE STRUGGLE WITH A LOT MORE.

<P>
 After Elena Hancock's only son was shot to death at a party on Thanksgiving 
Eve, 1992, she stopped working and started drinking herself to sleep at night 
with vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 48-year-old home-care provider returned to work a month later, she 
wore an overcoat over her pajamas because, she said, she was too depressed to 
get dressed, apply makeup and sometimes to shower. 
</P>
<P>
 At that same time, Linda Cunningham, bereavement director for Kaiser 
Permanente in Panorama City, began a support group specifically for murder 
victims' survivors. The only other San Fernando Valley-area group, Parents and 
Siblings of Murdered Children, met only once a month and at first did not allow 
friends or other relatives to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser's group, which meets twice a month, is free and open to friends and 
family members whether or not Kaiser is their medical benefits provider. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware of Kaiser's group when she initially sought help, Hancock spent two 
months in two other bereavement groups until a member of one of the groups told 
the Sun Valley resident about the Kaiser program. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those groups, I didn't fit in," Hancock said. "Those people lost a father 
or a sister or brother because they were sick, and in the beginning it was OK. 
Later on I found out it was not for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they deal with some of the same issues other survivors do, issues 
such as anger, denial and depression, experts say those who lose a relative to 
homicide struggle with a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The catastrophe of murder makes people feel that they are not safe and they 
don't have control over things," said Dr. Ann Schofield, one of the 
facilitators for Kaiser's group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other people sometimes shun someone who's had a murder (in their family) 
because it makes them aware of their vulnerability -- that 'This could happen 
to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Removing survivors of homicide victims from other bereavement groups also 
benefits those groups' members, Schofield said, because the stories such 
survivors tell are often overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 8, 1992, Wendy Weiker, an American psychologist living in Israel, was 
gunned down in her office, along with three other women, by one of her 
patients. The 31-year-old was five months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Lisa Obligenarz, called Kaiser to inquire about her health 
benefits and learned that its group was to begin in two months. Like most 
homicide victims' survivors, the Van Nuys resident remembers being in shock 
after her sister was slain. Obligenarz drew inspiration from others in the 
group who were experiencing the same debilitating shock, yet were courageous 
enough to attend meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard people describe how someone's slaying had crippled their lives, 
she would accent the positive. "You're out of bed, you're here and you're not 
on drugs," she would tell them. Mere attendance at the group was seen as reason 
for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody stayed in their pajamas the first week (after the murder), we 
knew why they did that and that it's normal," she said. "That's the difference 
between that group and a widow's support group or a cancer support group." 
</P>
<P>
 The group meets at Kaiser's Panorama City facility because the earthquake 
demolished their former Granada Hills meeting place. Attendance varies. 
Sometimes only a few people show up. At other times, there have been as many as 
15, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors and two counselors spend 90 minutes, sometimes longer, sharing 
anger, fears and unique frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schofield said group members often need to talk about "the slowness of the 
legal process" and how murder cases are being handled by the courts or police. 
</P>
<P>
 "A murder is not complete until they catch the guy and keep him from murdering 
other people," said Nancy Marshall, whose 40-year-old son was killed Dec. 15, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall and her husband, Sanford, of Mission Hills have all but given up 
trying to get the police to make an arrest in their son's case. They say that 
their son was killed with a "hot shot," a lethal injection of drugs, by a man 
he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner ruled Sandy Marshall died of a drug overdose. With no witnesses to 
say the dose was not self-inflicted, police determined Marshall's death was 
accidental. The case is still open but there is no active investigation, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Frank Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshalls joined the support group a year ago and went as often as the 
group met, twice a month. Within six months, they were feeling "more 
comfortable" and not attending meetings regularly. Now when they go, they go to 
help others as well as themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a feeling for all those people that are in there and you hear all 
their stories," Sanford Marshall said. "I don't know how they could survive 
without the group." 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year-old Westside resident had survived without any support group for 15 
years after her sister's death, but with great difficulty. Her sister, then 14, 
was killed in a hotel while the family was vacationing. But her parents would 
not discuss the slaying, or let her discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Kaiser's group last June, she sought help in individual 
therapy. Like some other slaying victims' survivors, she said it did not help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person that you're talking to one-on-one doesn't do what the group does," 
Williams said. "The group makes it so that talking about (the murder) is such 
an easy, normal thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Obligenarz agreed. "People are more willing to go and seek help (in a group) 
because you don't feel like you're there because you've got some problem."

GLENDALE BURGLARY SUSPECT CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendale burglary suspect was captured early Saturday after fleeing police 
along the Harbor Freeway, driving at speeds of more than 100 m.p.h., 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode began about 3:10 a.m. with a report of a break-in at a mobile 
phone business in the 1300 block of East Colorado Boulevard, Glendale Police 
Sgt. Jim Lowrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spotted a man leaving the scene and pursued him, eventually onto the 
Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing down the freeway at more than 100 m.p.h., the man finally exited at 
Century Boulevard and continued along surface streets with three Glendale and 
two Los Angeles police cars in pursuit, Lowrey said. He crashed his car on 96th 
Street in Los Angeles and was captured after a short foot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 About $2,200 worth of mobile phones were found in the car of the suspect, 
Frank C. Reddings, 23, of Los Angeles, Lowrey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Reddings was treated for unspecified arm injuries and booked into Los Angeles 
County Jail on a burglary charge and outstanding warrants, according to Lowrey. 
He will be arraigned in Glendale on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some good citizens who had witnessed this incident," Lowrey said. 
"That's how we were able to apprehend this person."

ROBBER FLEES LAGUNA BANK WITH CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A robber posing as a bank customer stole an undetermined amount of cash from a 
Wells Fargo branch here and was still at large Saturday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect entered the bank, at 260 Ocean Ave., about 11 a.m. Saturday and 
demanded money from a teller. No weapon was seen, but the man reached 
repeatedly toward his waistband as if to suggest he was concealing a weapon, 
Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Mike Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other customers in the bank at the time, but no one was injured. It 
was not known what type of getaway vehicle the suspect may have used.

 An anti-gang crusader who has been the target of harassment by a local gang, 
was injured Saturday when a suspected gang member threw a rock that struck her 
in the head, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viviana Guerra, 36, suffered a deep laceration, but refused to be taken to a 
hospital, said Lt. Don Hooper of the LAPD'S North Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the attack, police arrested Luis Salazar, 21, and a 16-year-old 
youth and booked them on assault charges, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have documented more than 50 cases of harassment against 
Guerra -- mostly vandalism to her home and verbal threats -- since the woman 
began cooperating with police about two years ago in an effort to rid her 
neighborhood of a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a 20-year-old suspected gang member was sentenced to prison for 
terrorist threats against her after he said, "Bang, bang, you're dead, bitch," 
and used his hand to simulate a gun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes life miserable for them, and they know it," Hooper said.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's attack occurred about 1 p.m. when one of a group of suspected gang 
members who congregate near her Tiara Street home threw a rock at her as she 
drove by, Hooper said. The rock went through the car's open window and hit 
Guerra in the side of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra's home is less than one block from a police station.

VICTIM HELPS CATCH HOLDUP SUSPECTS; CRIME: FOUR DAYS AFTER HE WAS ROBBED, A

 Four days after a local electrician was robbed at gunpoint while leaving work, 
the man spotted the two suspects at a fast-food restaurant just across the 
street from his office Saturday and helped police apprehend them, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arther Masaoka, 36, had just walked into a Burger King on Beach Boulevard in 
Huntington Beach around 3:45 p.m. when he saw two teen-agers who he believed 
had robbed him of about $1,100 in cash and jewelry Tuesday night and had 
threatened him with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I walked in, they were there, refilling their Coke cups," said 
Masaoka, who lives in Fountain Valley. "I knew it was them -- I'm real good at 
faces." 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths spotted him and fled on foot, police said. Masaoka, worried 
that they might once again be armed, waited a few minutes before chasing them 
in his car and calling the Huntington Beach police on his car phone to report 
the suspects, he said.

TUSTIN POLICE, OTHER CITY WORKERS TO GET 2.5% RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salary increases of 2.5% have been approved for municipal workers in three 
employee groups, including the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was approved unanimously by the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 After negotiations that started in October, representatives from the city and 
the unions agreed to one-year contracts retroactive to Jan. 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pay raise, employees with one dependent will receive an 
additional $23 a month for medical insurance premiums. And police officers who 
are taking classes or additional training may have their tuition reimbursed for 
up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the economic environment, the raises are generous," said City 
Manager William A. Huston, who was a member of the city's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said that the city proposed a three-year contract similar to the one 
police sergeants and lieutenants agreed to last month -- a 3% raise for each 
year of the contract, which when adjusted for inflation could rise to 4.34%, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Adams, who helped the city employees and police unions negotiate their 
contracts, said that the three-year contract offer was rejected because city 
representatives insisted that the city have the authority to cancel the 
contract and reopen negotiations during the second and third years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the unions maintained wanted any cancellation of the contract to be by 
mutual agreement and not by the city alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said that the 16 sergeants and lieutenants agreed to the provision in 
their contract that guarantees increases only in the first year. Those raises 
were retroactive to Dec. 27, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 employees and 65 rank-and-file police officers will be included in 
the pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Four employees who handle confidential information, such as the secretaries of 
the city manager and the police chief, also will receive the 2.5% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary raises for police officers will cost the city about $74,000 and 
those for the other employees more than $110,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of the continuing threat of mudslides, the deadline for people 
affected by the fire last fall to apply for disaster aid has been extended to 
April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain-related problems in Laguna Beach, Malibu and other areas where soil 
erosion is a concern prompted federal officials to extend the filing period for 
disaster relief, which was originally scheduled to end last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura counties 
were declared federal disaster areas on Oct. 26, making available federal funds 
for individuals and business owners. The declaration was amended on Nov. 19 to 
include damage from soil erosion, landslides and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for assistance, call the toll-free tele-registration line from 6 a.m. 
to midnight daily at (800) 462-9029 or the TDD number for the hearing impaired 
at (800) 462-7585. 
</P>
<P>
 Information and applications also are available at community disaster recovery 
and preparedness centers in Laguna Beach, Malibu and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster victims who want to check on their relief application or change 
paperwork already filed can call (800) 525-0321 or the TDD number at (800) 
660-8005.

PRIVATE BEACHFRONT OWNERS RULED NOT LIABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of private beachfront property are not liable for injuries suffered by 
people playing in the ocean near the property, an appellate court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Affirming a lower court decision, the 4th District Court of Appeal last week 
said that "owners of a private beach" do not own or control the ocean and 
therefore "are not responsible for injuries that take place in that ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision ends a four-year court battle for a couple in Cypress Pointe in 
San Clemente and a homeowners' association. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by Curtis Swann of Temecula, who was paralyzed from the neck 
down while attending a beach party, alleged that Paul and Madeline Olivier of 
Cypress Pointe, the Cyprus Shore Community Assn. and two other homeowners' 
associations were liable for paying his medical bills and unspecified damages 
for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann was a friend of a guest at a beach party when he was injured during the 
summer of 1990. He brought the lawsuit against the Oliviers and the homeowners' 
associations that allowed the beach party to take place, charging them with 
failing to warn him of any beach hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann's lawsuit was dismissed by an Orange County Superior Court judge, and he 
appealed the decision to the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeline Olivier welcomed the latest decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this case a very long time," she said Friday. "It's a decision that 
was needed to be made and needed to be clarified." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Thomas G. Chambers, who represented the Oliviers, said the case 
initially involved Cyprus Shore, Cypress Pointe, and Cyprus Cove homeowner 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "These three different associations had created all these agreements for 
people crossing over on their property headed to the ocean," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Pointe and Cyprus Cove were eventually dismissed as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling, the appeals court said it could not hold the Oliviers and 
Cyprus Shore liable for the "defective or dangerous condition of property which 
(they) did not own, possess, or control." 
</P>
<P>
 The court pointed out that Swann admitted that he was injured in the "surf" of 
a public beach near Cyprus Shore's private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that the Cyprus Shore Community Assn. or Paul and Madeline Olivier 
can control the ocean adjacent to their land is nothing short of ludicrous," 
the appeals court said in its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann could not be reached for comment.

BILINGUAL FEMA WORKERS RUSHED TO L.A.; DISASTER TEAMS: FORTY-FOUR STAFF MEMBERS 
BASED IN PUERTO RICO COME TO EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS' AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 When the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up shop after the Northridge 
earthquake, it was confronted by thousands of confused and frightened residents 
desperate for help. For residents who don't speak English, that confusion, fear 
and desperation were compounded by a sense of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Jose Monge came in. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of Spanish-speaking residents unable to adequately communicate 
their needs and concerns, the call went out to 44 bilingual FEMA workers based 
in Puerto Rico. As he has in other disasters, including the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake, Hurricane Andrew and the devastating Midwest floods, Monge flew out at a 
moment's notice with other workers to staff disaster assistance centers 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked about seven disasters, including this earthquake," said Monge, 
who was assigned to a FEMA location at the Toberman Recreation Center in 
Pico-Union. "The reason they call us in Puerto Rico is because they know all 
the FEMA workers are bilingual." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 temblor, more than 500 FEMA workers have been flown in from 
across the country, including 78 from FEMA's Region 2, which covers New York, 
New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Those Region 2 "reservists" 
include the bilingual workers who routinely respond to emergencies in areas 
where there is a large population of Spanish-speaking residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly recognized by FEMA that there are vast numbers of people who 
are living in disaster-prone areas that need information in their native 
tongue," FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston said. "English isn't their first 
language and we recognize that, and we're trying to bring people on board as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Most bilingual workers are not full-time FEMA employees. Monge, a reservist, 
is a sports coordinator in his hometown of Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservists are first brought on as local hires in an area where a disaster has 
occurred, such as the towns in Puerto Rico where Monge first joined FEMA during 
floods there in 1992. They are then trained on FEMA computers and procedures 
and asked to stay on as reservists, who are called into action when disaster 
strikes. Reservists can be asked to stay on indefinitely; In Miami, they have 
been asked to stay on for up to three years to continue work in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,100 workers have been hired locally by FEMA's Region 9 -- which 
includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam and several Pacific Islands 
and territories -- since the Northridge earthquake. In addition to the new 
hires, Edmonston said bilingual Region 2 workers were brought in because there 
were insufficient trained personnel to respond to the earthquake, the greatest 
disaster in FEMA history. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of Pico-Union and Westlake left homeless by the quake, disaster 
assistance centers staffed by bilingual personnel continue to be vital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helps when they see us," said Audrey Bonilla, a FEMA worker from 
Region 2. "They (victims) feel more comfortable, I think, because we speak 
Spanish and we try and understand their language and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Justo Hernandez, another FEMA reservist from Region 2: "Once you tell 
them I'm here from Puerto Rico and I'm here to help you, then they open up and 
tell you what's wrong and what they don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in jeans and print shirt, Monge, brought in as the site manager at the 
Toberman Recreation Center, listened on a recent afternoon to a woman whose 
apartment was red-tagged, barring her from entering her building. Another 
worker explained that the woman has been unable to receive housing assistance 
because of a mix-up in the paperwork that lists the apartment as being 
habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical," Monge said, instructing another worker to contact building 
inspectors. "Every day we have people who don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 applications have been processed at the center in the heart of 
the predominantly Central American community. The number of applicants has 
decreased since the center moved to the Toberman Recreation Center at 1725 
Toberman St. recently, Monge said. 
</P>
<P>
 For reservists such as Monge, Bonilla and Hernandez, the need for experienced 
bilingual emergency personnel translates into months spent away from families 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left (Puerto Rico) in 1992, and my kid was a year old. When I went home in 
January, he was walking and talking and he wouldn't come near," said Hernandez, 
an assessor with FEMA. Hernandez has spent most of the last two years assisting 
in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew and in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who is pregnant, smiled and agreed that the job has a high personal 
cost. "I have two kids and they are with my mother right now," she said. "For 
me it's not so bad because my husband is also with FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very unusual. Ever since Andrew we've had continuous disasters," 
Edmonston said. "And Region 9 has had its share."

SANTA ANA MAN FATALLY SHOT IN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot and killed after arguing with two men outside his apartment 
building, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Orozco-Lujan, 21, was taken to a nearby hospital after the fight about 
11:30 p.m. Friday, police said, and was pronounced dead when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Orozco-Lujan got into a dispute with a visitor, believed to be the assailant, 
in front of the apartment building in the 700 block of East Walnut Street, 
Santa Ana Police Cpl. Dan McDermott said. The two men may have been arguing 
because the visitor wanted to enter the apartment complex, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor left after the short dispute, but returned about five minutes 
later with another man. After the three men renewed the argument, McDermott 
said, the assailant pulled out a handgun of unknown caliber, shot Orozco-Lujan 
and fled with his companion. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made Saturday.

FIRE AT GARDEN GROVE BUSINESS CAUSES $250,000 IN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flames tore through a clothes-cleaning business early Saturday, causing about 
$250,000 in damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported, and investigators are still looking into the cause 
of the blaze, said Ellen Covey, spokeswoman for the Garden Grove Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire set off an alarm at Hawk Industrial Uniforms at 11701 Anabel Ave. at 
3:42 a.m., fire officials said. Flames already had burned through the roof when 
firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three firefighters battled the blaze, which caused about $50,000 in 
damage to the building and $200,000 to its contents. Four fire engines from 
Garden Grove and one from Santa Ana responded to the fire, officials said.

MAN SHOT BY SECURITY GUARD AT MINIMARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lancaster man was in serious condition Saturday after being shot by a 
convenience store security guard who was trying to detain the man after he was 
identified as a suspect in a previous theft of beer, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Martinez, 26, was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center with 
a single gunshot wound following the incident that occurred at 10:45 p.m. 
Friday at Little Mini Market in the 300 block of West Avenue I, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred after a clerk in the store identified Martinez as a 
suspect in a previous theft of beer, Deputy Ed Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a security guard tried to detain him, Martinez fled the store and was 
shot outside as the guard pursued him, sheriff's deputies said. Deputies said 
they believed the shooting was accidental, but it was unclear how the revolver 
discharged or if there had been a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to identify the guard but said he was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're handling it as an accidental shooting until the detectives do a 
follow-up investigation," Grantham said.

LAKE LOS ANGELES NAME-CHANGE CONTROVERSY FAILS TO EVAPORATE; POLITICS: 
LOYALISTS FIGHTING TO KEEP UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY FROM CALLING ITSELF DESERT 
BUTTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an unofficial vote last November, it looked like this remote Antelope 
Valley town-which has no lake -- would soon have a more fitting name: Desert 
Buttes. 
</P>
<P>
 But four months later, after Lake Los Angeles loyalists raised a ruckus about 
how the election was conducted, the signs and stationery here remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed name change has triggered a fierce dispute among town leaders, 
who say another vote in November is needed to decide what this sun-baked 
unincorporated community, about 20 miles east of Palmdale, should be called. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Desert Buttes, a reference to striking rock formations near the 
town, say it is a more descriptive, more dignified name for a sprawling 
community whose population is estimated at 12,000 to 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the proposed name has just triggered a new round of jokes. 
Quipsters have shortened it to Desert "Butts" and have referred to its 
residents as "Butt-heads," they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who want the town to remain Lake Los Angeles insist the present name 
is no worse than that of the Antelope Valley -- which has no antelope. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name change has stirred up a lot of controversy among the people of Lake 
Los Angeles," said Bobbi Allen, a nine-year resident who opposes the switch to 
Desert Buttes. "It's a funny little community with a stupid name. But 
unfortunately, it's our name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people out here have really banded together to stop being the laughing 
stock of the Antelope Valley. We already know there is enough support to keep 
it Lake Los Angeles."  
</P>
<P>
 The town was named for a 27-acre artificial lake created in 1967 to help sell 
relatively low-priced houses in a sparsely populated patch of desert, a 
90-minute drive from Los Angeles. A developer let the lake dry up in 1981 when 
residents refused to take over the cost of keeping it filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Crane, president of the Lake Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, was one 
of the leaders behind a drive to change the town's name. "The lake dried up," 
she said. "The buttes won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Crane is also a member of the Lake Los Angeles Rural Town Council, which 
mailed advisory ballots to 4,518 registered voters last fall, asking about a 
name change. 
</P>
<P>
 The Town Council collected 757 ballots on Nov. 2, the same day as the general 
election. Among these, 55.9% supported a name change, and Desert Buttes was 
favored by 194 voters -- more than any other choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Crane was overjoyed. "I've wanted to change the town's name since I bought my 
first property there in the early 1970s," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after the election, Allen and other critics complained that some 
ballots had not been counted and that others had arrived at local homes after 
the election. They said the results were not valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents "thought it was a big joke," said Bonnie LeFebvre, co-owner of 
a local real estate business and a video shop. "They didn't vote because they 
didn't think anything would come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the name change is adopted, LeFebvre said she would have to change two 
store signs, the business cards and rubber stamps at her video shop, along with 
all of the identification stickers attached to her tapes. "By the time it was 
over with, I'm sure it would cost $10,000," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 LeFebvre, who has lived in town for almost 16 years, added: "My view is shared 
by most of the old-timers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jennifer Keys, a local businesswoman who served on the election 
committee and defends its work, believes the uproar was caused by just a 
handful of outspoken residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who have been in the forefront of the town, which was 
very small 10 years ago," she said. "It's a growing-pain kind of thing. That's 
cool. That's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, because of the outcry, the Town Council has agreed to set up another 
election in November. They said that will give residents who favor Desert 
Buttes or Lake Los Angeles plenty of time to line up supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got as fair an election as was humanly possible," said Ralph Hobson, 
acting president of the Town Council. "We haven't figured out the motive for 
all these people who are causing a ruckus. We're just trying to make the best 
of it."

THE QUARTERBACK QUESTION: MOON OVER MITCHELL, OR VISA VERSA?; RAMS: IN THE 
POST-EVERETT ERA, TEAM PONDERS WHETHER VETERAN LEADERSHIP OR YOUTHFUL POTENTIAL 
IS WHAT'S NEEDED NOW. NFL EXPERTS DIFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Make Pat Haden the Ram general manager and he would . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Sign Scott Mitchell as quick as I could," said the former Ram 
quarterback-turned-football analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Put Matt Millen in charge of the Rams and he would . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Mitchell over Warren Moon, no question," said the former CBS commentator 
and Raider linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Make Dan Fouts the boss and he would . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Moon because he's the better quarterback," said the former San Diego 
Charger quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question that faces every fantasy football league owner and armchair 
general manager who channel surfs through the NFL season: Who's going to be my 
quarterback?  
</P>
<P>
 And the Rams are trying to find their answer by targeting Mitchell, an 
unrestricted free agent from Miami, and Houston's Moon as top candidates to 
replace Jim Everett, who is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
 So should they trade for the veteran Moon, who's also being pursued by 
Detroit? Or should they sign the youthful Mitchell, who is being wooed by 
several teams and is scheduled to visit Rams Park on Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
 Weigh the pros. Weigh the cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is 26. Moon is 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon has started 139 NFL games, Mitchell seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon has passed for 33,685 yards, Mitchell 1,805. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is expected to earn between $3 million and $4 million a season. The 
Oilers want to deal Moon and his $3.25 million contract, but the Rams probably 
will have to give up at least a second- and a third-round draft pick to get 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden wouldn't make that trade, adding that Mitchell would be the Rams' best 
long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, he can play in the NFL," said Haden, who saw Mitchell's first pro 
start this past season, in place of injured Dan Marino. "He can lead a team. He 
carries himself well, and his Miami teammates liked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about it, if he was really interested in money, he could have stayed in 
Miami and made $2 million a year as a backup to Marino. But he wants to compete 
as a starter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing in a young quarterback is a must for rebuilding teams such as the 
Rams, Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, they're not going to win the Super Bowl next year," he said. 
"But in three years, they might be Super Bowl contenders, and Warren will 
probably be retiring in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Mitchell, you don't know how good he can be yet. With Moon, you know how 
good he was . There's a big difference there." 
</P>
<P>
 So which quarterback would a fan pay $30 to see play in Anaheim Stadium on 
Sundays? Moon would be the logical choice, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I would give Mitchell a chance and build with him," said Rob Burdick, a Ram 
and Raider fan and part-time bartender in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the fans would want to see Moon. But if the Rams are looking for fan 
support, maybe they should bring in Nancy Kerrigan." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Seymour of Capistrano Beach, a former Ram season-ticket holder, said the 
Rams shouldn't take Moon or Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon should go to Detroit, where he can run and gun," Seymour said. "He costs 
too much, and he's not right for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a mobile guy, and you don't need him to hand off to Jerome Bettis. They 
need to start over, go with new blood and get one of the quarterbacks out of 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams could trade for Moon, then use their fifth pick in the April draft -- 
or trade up if need be -- and take one of the two college stars -- Tennessee's 
Heath Shuler or Fresno State's Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an expensive gamble, as the Rams would have to invest at least $6 million 
in the two quarterbacks, which isn't practical under the NFL's new 
$33.8-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could do that," Fouts said. "A young quarterback could learn a lot from 
Warren, then take over in a few years. But I think when you draft a Shuler or a 
Dilfer, you have pressure to play them right away, and you couldn't do that 
with Moon there." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden isn't convinced Shuler or Dilfer will make as big an impact as Seattle 
rookie Rick Mirer or New England's Drew Bledsoe did this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good strategy to take Moon and then draft a quarterback," Haden 
said. "But the high draft picks aren't a sure thing, and you would be paying 
them about the same as you would be (paying) Mitchell. And if the rookie 
doesn't turn out, it's going to take you three years to find that out." 
</P>
<P>
 With Mitchell, the Rams would take a similar risk. He threw only eight passes 
in his first three seasons with the Dolphins. He was 3-4 as a starter last 
season but was slowed by a separated shoulder that forced him to miss a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to see a little of Mitchell this past season, his ability and what he 
can do," Millen said. "He's a quarterback that you can take and develop him." 
</P>
<P>
 With Moon, the Rams would be rebuilding with an aging superstar who threw as 
many interceptions (21) as touchdown passes last season. In a 28-13 loss to the 
Rams last season, he completed 19 of 42 passes for 310 yards with one touchdown 
and two interceptions. And when was the last time he led his team to a victory 
in a big game? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fouts is convinced Moon would be perfect for the Rams' short-term 
plans. With the Rams emphasizing Bettis' running, it would take the heat off 
Moon and, perhaps, prolong his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren is in terrific shape," Fouts said, "and he could be a Vince Evans type 
and play even longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Mitchell, a left-hander, would mean the Rams would have to find a 
strong right tackle to prevent the quarterback from getting blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Right tackle Jackie Slater, an 18-year veteran, had a torn pectoral muscle 
last season and is an unrestricted free agent. His replacement, Darryl Ashmore, 
is still a little raw as a pass blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Moon would mean not only adding depth to the offensive line, but also 
giving up draft picks in a trade. The Rams have a lack of depth and can ill 
afford to give up a second- or third-round pick for an aging quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick, a longtime Southern California sports fan, expects the Rams will 
follow that familiar path of pursuing a quarterback near the end of his career. 
Remember Bert Jones and Joe Namath? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think organizations go for the has-beens in situations like this," Burdick 
said. "Moon is a great quarterback, but I hate to see the Rams grab him so late 
in his career. Why should they keep bringing in old players like they always 
have? They have been doing that for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're in the same situation as the Lakers. Sure, I hate to see Byron Scott 
and the other players leave, but I don't mind seeing George Lynch play, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the quarterback shuffle has been Everett and his replacement last 
season, T.J. Rubley. Rubley, a ninth-round draft pick in 1992 from Tulsa, 
didn't impress as the starter, and the Rams are hoping to trade Everett for a 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would risk a second-rounder on a guy who has played as well as Jim has in 
the past," Haden said. "I'm still surprised by what has happened to him in his 
career, but I think Jim's the kind of guy who will prosper elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fouts: "If I was negotiating, I would ask for a first-round pick. By 
asking for a second-rounder, the Rams are saying they would settle for a 
third-round pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden and Millen compared Everett's situation to that of Jim Plunkett's 16 
years ago. Plunkett was thought to be washed up when the Raiders signed him in 
1978, but he led them to two Super Bowl victories in the next six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Everett as mentally tough as Plunkett? No," Millen said. "But can Everett 
get some things done as a backup somewhere else? Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a change of scenery would help him. He's had some problems, but 
still, at times, nobody throws a better deep out pattern in this league than 
Jim Everett." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Haden: "Maybe sitting on the bench for a year or two will resurrect Jim's 
career the same way it did Plunkett's." Quarterback Options 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be Houston's Warren Moon over Miami's Scott Mitchell? The Rams began 
pondering that question during the free-agency period, which started last week. 
How their NFL careers compare: 10,10,05,05,07,06,06,07,05,06,12 Player G S 
Comp. Att. Pct. Yards TDs Int. Sacks-Lost Moon 141 139 2632 4546 57.9 33685 196 
166 315-2403 Mitchell 31 7 135 241 56.0 1805 12 9 7-49  
</P>
<P>
 Note: Mitchell's 31 games are mostly as holder for kicks. His seven starts all 
came last season; he previously had completed only two of eight passes in three 
seasons.

REBEL OR PACIFIST -- MEXICAN UPRISING DIVIDES VILLAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pedro Perez and his neighbor, Gustavo, spent their youth picking coffee and 
herding cattle for ranchers at the edge of the southern Mexican highlands and 
their middle age trying to carve a living from the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 For two decades, they have worked together -- mostly in vain -- to demand 
basic education, health care, water and access to this village, which is now a 
four-hour trek over muddy trails from the nearest dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last week of December, their lives, which had been so similar, 
diverged sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo, who asked that his last name not be used, covered his face with a 
bandanna, took up an old rifle and marched into the county seat of Ocosingo 
with the rebel forces that took over a handful of towns in southern Mexico on 
New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez stayed home, convinced that armed rebellion is not the solution to their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rebels marched out of Ibarra, toward their targets, they left a 
divided community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the New Year's Day debut of the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army, as the rebels call themselves, the split has become even 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The same difference of opinion has divided many local villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as Zapatista representatives sat down with the government for the 
first time to try to negotiate a peace agreement, communities throughout the 
rebels' jungle stronghold were also attempting to heal the wounds left by the 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiators have said they are nearing agreement on the political and 
economic rights that are at the heart of the rebel demands, few details have 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
 But here in the jungle, the divisions are clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising has split families, setting off charges and counter-charges that 
range from theft to betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the towns here are divided," said Armando Cruz as he lugged a 
100-pound bag of salt though calf-deep mud up the trail toward Ibarra. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz and Perez were carrying essential supplies -- salt, soap and medicine -- 
to their village from the airstrip at Santa Lucia, a two-hour hike away and one 
of the few towns in the area without a significant Zapatista presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In towns that the rebels control, they have scattered logs and driven poles 
into the airstrips -- which already are little more than clearings hacked out 
of the jungle. Their sabotage has cut off an essential means of transportation 
in these remote communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, men claiming to be guerrilla sympathizers have blocked overland 
traffic into the Zapatista-controlled area, which includes most of the Montes 
Azules Biosphere Reserve and surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 The blocked roads have become a major source of friction between Zapatistas 
and pacifists. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels say they fear military incursions if planes and vehicles are 
allowed into the area. Their neighbors angrily watch their supplies disappear 
and their only cash crop, coffee, rot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are like prisoners here," the graying, paunchy Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Alberto, the community's volunteer health promoter -- as close as the 
village comes to having a doctor -- said one diabetic woman died in childbirth 
during the early days of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 No planes were flying to take her to the nearest hospital, which is three 
hours away on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto worries that more deaths will follow unless the roads and airstrips 
are opened soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if traffic could resume tomorrow, it will be too late for most of the 
coffee crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of that loss will be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ibarra produces bananas and citrus fruit, the only crop that can 
survive the three-day walk to the nearest market in Ocosingo is coffee. The 
crop is harvested in December and usually sold in January. Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, like many of his neighbors, has bags of rotting coffee sitting in his 
wood-plank, palm-roofed hut. Because he could not sell his coffee, Cruz 
explained, he will not be able to buy clothing for his six children, ages 2 to 
11, or to replace his worn, year-old machete and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a usable machete, he cannot clear the undergrowth that has overtaken 
his corn and bean fields since last fall's harvest or even walk through the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to die of hunger," he predicted grimly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gustavo and the village's other Zapatistas -- 24 families in all, versus 
53 pacifist households -- argue that the community is already dying of hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been struggling for 20 years, and we are tired of begging our 
government to pay attention to us," he said at a candle-lit meeting that the 
rebels called to meet two visiting reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are in the jungle, shafted," he said. "We have no road, we have no 
hospital, we have no decent teachers. We have no sugar or salt or any more 
money for collections to send representatives to talk to the governor and be 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the masked, uniformed rebels who appeared in the cities during the 
brief occupation and have posed since for cameras at the edge of the jungle, 
Gustavo and his neighbors wore civilian clothes to greet their visitors. The 
meeting was arranged on condition that no last names or ranks would be 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Zapatistas refused to give even a first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their leaders, these grass-roots rebels say they will not give up their 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be at peace, but we will never give up our arms," said a young man in 
a palm leaf cowboy hat. "If we turn them in, everything will go back to the way 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo's list of grievances was the same as those expressed at a pacifist 
community meeting that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity was no coincidence: Until a year ago, the two groups were 
members of the same rural association, the organization that sent the community 
emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas claim that the rural association actually recruited and 
organized the armed groups a decade ago. But the leaders sold out to the 
government a year ago, they charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The pacifist version is that the rural association was never involved in the 
armed struggle. The split occurred a year ago over the issue of schoolteachers, 
the pacifists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups agree that teachers sent to the village by the federal government 
have played hooky a lot over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels blame the problem on the government's notorious laxity in paying 
rural schoolmasters. They believe that the solution is to pay teachers well and 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 The rural association, on the other hand, decided that city-bred teachers just 
could not cut it in the jungle. The solution, according to the organization, 
was community teachers, people from the village who would receive short courses 
in teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Community teachers are supposed to have finished junior high school. However, 
to attend junior high, students from the jungle have to go to boarding school 
in the city, which few families here can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, only two people in the village have an eighth-grade education, 
and the village's 74 children need three teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, instead of a full salary, community teachers would receive "a 
gratuity" of $150 to $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious, a group that later identified themselves as Zapatistas pulled their 
children out of school and refused to pay their share of the village's $1,500 
property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that without government teachers, the only service the village 
received from the government had been withdrawn. Therefore, they argued, there 
was no reason to pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to keep us ignorant," said one rebel, who did not identify herself. 
"Children do not learn well without a qualified teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's 23-year-old son, also called Pedro, is one of the community teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments hurt, he said. He had worked hard to attend junior high school, 
supporting himself with a job as a hotel receptionist while he studied in San 
Cristobal de las Casas. He would have liked to finish school, but the family's 
money ran out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see how the children are learning," he said in defense of his teaching 
abilities. "They are doing much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was not the dispute over the teachers but the changes that came 
after that have been the most divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas, who had been training secretly, according to the pacifists, 
began marching on the village square. They stopped attending village 
celebrations and discouraged their children from playing with friends whose 
parents were pacifists. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one morning in late December, five of the men marched off with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 When they came back in early January, they told neighbors that they had helped 
take Ocosingo, site of the heaviest fighting in a conflict that has claimed 
more than 100 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ibarra rebels said they were able to leave Ocosingo before the federal 
army arrived, and thus escaped the battle. When they returned home, it was to a 
town in rebel-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the area, Zapatistas became more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, they removed benches from the church, taking them to the rebel "security 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Santa Helena, where guerrilla sympathizers are the majority, 
they confiscated the community shortwave radio. 
</P>
<P>
 They set up checkpoints on the paths between towns and searched everyone who 
tried to pass. Those who refused to be searched were escorted back to their 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the radio and the benches, pacifists admit, the rebels have taken 
nothing. Pacifists claim to have been threatened, but demur if asked when and 
by whom and what was said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups said they want a reconciliation. But the wounds run deep. A 
pacifist from Santa Helena named Pedro said in the presence of rebels that none 
of his relatives were involved with the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, one of the rebels said sheepishly, "He is my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, neither side claims to be pro-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has not done a single thing we have ever requested," said 
Pedro from Santa Helena. The difference is whether they believe that fighting 
will solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a Zapatista because I have six kids to feed and I do not want to 
die," Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of his Zapatista neighbors said he is willing to die for 
precisely the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children are sickly because they are malnourished," he said. "We have 
risen up in arms because we cannot take any more."

MASSACRE MAY BREAK IMPASSE ON PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Yasser Arafat recalled all his peace negotiators to PLO headquarters in Tunis 
for crisis talks on Saturday, yet many analysts said the massacre in a West 
Bank mosque may give Arabs important bargaining leverage and open a new window 
to a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman sought to salvage his own 
credibility and the viability of peace talks with Israel, diplomats and others 
close to the talks said the tragedy -- like the shelling of the Sarajevo 
marketplace that led to the brink of international military intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- could provide the impetus to break the deadlock in 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that out of this horror comes a sort of balancing of public 
opinion perceptions, certainly in the West," said a Western diplomat close to 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chernobyl got people focused on nuclear dangers across the board. This kind 
of slaughter, if it had taken place in incidents taking one or two lives, would 
have been viewed as part of the background noise," he said. "But kind of like 
the mortar shell that dropped in the Sarajevo marketplace . . . ironically 
enough this probably gives a boost to the statesman impulse on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's advisers made it clear that they 
realize Israel will have to come up with a significant package of goodwill 
gestures if it wants to recover the momentum lost in the talks. There is a fear 
in Jerusalem that anything more than a brief hiatus could lead to a serious 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tactical question -- how much to give and when to give it," said 
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the housing minister and a confidant of Rabin. "If we 
give it all up front, then the PLO will be encouraged to demand more. If we 
give none, we risk losing the remaining momentum and looking like accessories 
to those murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably come up with some gestures, some real concessions and some 
promises of much more if we can move fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Arab analysts were far less optimistic, saying Friday's attack -- in which an 
Israeli settler opened fire on hundreds of worshipers in a Hebron mosque, 
killing 48 -- dealt a blow to the peace talks just at the moment they were 
beginning to bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Arafat's ability to salvage his credibility among Palestinians is in 
more danger than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the peace process was going well, I think we were about to conclude 
an agreement, and I see nothing positive from this whatsoever," one Arab 
analyst said glumly. "If there isn't a substantial gesture from the Israelis, 
this is going to be serious trouble, because Arafat's credibility is going to 
be challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat summoned his negotiators from talks in Cairo, Washington and Paris to 
PLO headquarters in Tunisia and prepared to make a decision on how to respond 
to President Clinton's invitation to resume peace talks in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 While the PLO has already officially accepted, Arafat is likely to delay the 
resumption until he receives some gesture from the Israelis on the issues of 
Jewish settlers, Palestinian prisoners and additional Palestinian security 
guarantees, PLO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a senior State Department official said the United States expects the 
Palestinians and Israelis to restart the talks by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've told them: 'We want you to be here by Wednesday,' " the official said. 
"We're confident that they're going to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO officials said they first will seek some public statement from the 
White House affirming opposition to Jewish settlements in occupied Arab lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the duty of Mr. Clinton to denounce the existence of the settlements 
according to international law and the U.N. Security Council. They are illegal. 
And something should come from the American Administration to emphasize that 
these settlements are illegal," said Mohammed Sobieh, secretary general of the 
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Until those conditions are met, "the time now is not convenient to go back to 
Washington," Sobieh said. "Any meeting with Rabin now will harm the credibility 
of Arafat. Such a massacre is very big: People are praying at a mosque without 
arms, with their children, in a holy month on a holiday, and they are shot (in) 
their backs. No, any soon meeting will harm Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials are demanding disarmament of Israeli settlers in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, a move that would prove difficult because many settlers are 
military reservists assigned to combat units and because the Israeli public 
might not support forcing settlers to live unarmed in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the PLO will at least demand that Jewish settlements be placed on the 
negotiating table now, rather than waiting several years for the issue to be 
decided along with the final status of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who has more than 10 proposals for responding to the crisis, is said to 
be opposed to any measures that would compromise Israel's security in order to 
appease the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the issue of settlers, while disarmament is unlikely, there is some 
support for measures such as outlawing Kach, Kahane Hai and other extremist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very idea that we have to do something about the settlers means there has 
been a shift in the political ground here as a result of the Hebron incident," 
one Rabin adviser said. "Politically, Rabin may feel that he can use the 
general revulsion over this act to press ahead. . . . The argument to get this 
wrapped up and to get us out of the territories becomes more powerful now." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud Party, expressed fears that 
Israel in its eagerness to atone for the attack will make "undue concessions," 
particularly on the issue of settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need now, in fact, for restraint, caution and sober action, both 
on the security and on the political front. I think the opposite is happening 
-- the government is feeling the pressure to do something dramatic. And when 
you do that you may do something dramatically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO is also calling for the deployment of international forces to provide 
protection for Palestinians -- a proposal that Israel already has rejected -- 
and is likely to make further demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners 
and the return of Palestinian deportees. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab analysts familiar with the talks predicted that any really substantial 
gestures on Israel's part are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of what happened, I doubt that they will decide to dismantle the 
settlements. It's not going to happen," one analyst said. "They will probably 
focus on the specific event, and on the person, and if they decide to do that, 
it simply becomes the act of a deranged person, and there's no addition to the 
peace process because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the attack's potential contribution to moving the peace process 
forward depends in large part on its resonance as the negotiations resume their 
tedious course. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region accustomed to violence, analysts say they fear that it will simply 
drop into the landscape of a bloody past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a region where on both sides there is an awful lot of callousness 
that has been acquired by so many atrocities and incidents," one diplomat said. 
"Will people be holding onto this in their minds, two or three weeks down the 
road even?"

ARAB RAGE SPARKS RIOTS ACROSS MIDEAST; 3 KILLED; ISRAEL: SOLDIERS RING HEBRON 
AS RESIDENTS MOURN MOSQUE VICTIMS. OCCUPIED TERRITORIES ARE SEALED OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 Violent demonstrations over the massacre of 48 Palestinians at a mosque in the 
occupied West Bank spread deep into Israel on Saturday as Israeli Arabs 
protested the atrocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more Palestinians were killed in continuing clashes with Israeli forces 
in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and military commanders early 
today ordered the indefinite closure of the occupied territories, preventing 
Palestinians from entering Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli chief of staff, said he was deploying more 
forces throughout the territories in an effort to restore calm, but he 
emphasized that the soldiers had orders to act with maximum restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident we can contain further violence, whether the source be 
attacks by (Israeli) settlers on Palestinians or by Palestinians seeking 
revenge for the massacre in Hebron," Barak told diplomats in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our goal is not only to contain, but to quiet the situation, which is now 
very, very tense, so that the peace process will not be disrupted by this 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 President Ezer Weizman, describing the attack by a Jewish settler on the 
Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron as "perhaps the gravest thing that happened to us in 
the history of Zionism," said he will travel to the West Bank city today to 
offer his condolences and to apologize on behalf of the Israeli people. "We 
have to work to heal the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebron was saturated Saturday with Israeli troops and paramilitary police, and 
more soldiers ringed the city, about 20 miles south of Jerusalem, as residents 
continued to mourn the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread clashes continued, however, between Israeli troops and Palestinians 
elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest also spread to other Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lebanon, Palestinians in refugee camps burned tires and draped their homes 
with black cloth in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Syria, hundreds of refugees marched through a refugee camp on the outskirts 
of Damascus waving black banners. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,500 youths marched through the Baqaa refugee camp in Jordan, 
chanting slogans against Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat and the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, more than 35 firebombs were thrown at army patrols in the course of 
the day, a military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian youth was killed in one Gaza clash, and another was killed near 
Tulkarem in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Police battled stone-throwing youths for most of the day around Jerusalem's 
Old City and in other Arab neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramilitary border police shot and killed one youth when, they said, he 
appeared to be preparing to hurl a grenade rather than a rock at them. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to impose a strict closure in the West Bank as well as the Gaza 
Strip reflected the government's anxiety over possible revenge attacks in 
Israel's cities by Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence had erupted Saturday in Jaffa, Nazareth, Ramle and other Israeli 
towns with large Arab populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Arab youths rampaged through Jaffa, adjacent to Tel Aviv's 
commercial center, looting and burning Jewish shops, torching cars and stoning 
police and passersby. Police reported arresting 40 of the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Milo called the Jaffa riot "an extraordinary occurrence, an 
eruption sparked by what happened in Hebron," and he called for a return to the 
"good relations between Arab and Jew" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 Israeli Arabs demonstrated in Nazareth, using burning tires to 
block the main road and stoning Jewish cars after a rally where they demanded 
that the government disarm Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Police used tear gas and clubs and fired over the heads of the crowd to break 
up the protest in Nazareth. More than 45 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads were blocked through much of the Galilee region, according to police. 
Most Arab villages in the area held rallies to protest the massacre and flew 
both Palestinian flags and black banners of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported clashing with demonstrators in several other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests, bringing some of the everyday violence of the occupied 
territories into central Israel, were a dramatic reminder to the Jews that 
nearly a million of the country's population, more than 18%, are Arab and 
Muslim and share the anger over the attack by a Jewish settler on worshipers at 
the mosque in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try for good relations with the Jews, but we are also part of the Arab and 
Palestinian people," said Abdel-Wahab Darawshe, an Arab member of Israel's 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 While describing the protests as "a storm that will calm," he said they also 
reflected "a history of being neglected" by Israel's Jewish majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin met Saturday evening with Israeli Arab leaders to 
plead for their support in maintaining calm and in preserving the momentum in 
the peace negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that at this stage we must save the negotiations," Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres commented as the violence spread. "Certainly, the 
(Hebron) incident places an enormous burden on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of a serious setback to the talks increased after state-run Israel 
Television, quoting a preliminary army investigation into the attack at the 
Cave of the Patriarchs on Friday, reported that two soldiers on duty there had 
rushed in as worshipers were overpowering the gunman, Baruch Goldstein, and 
opened fire on the Palestinians, adding to the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting the Ibrahim Mosque at the shrine, which is sacred to both Jews 
and Muslims, Barak, the Israeli chief of staff, told reporters: "According to 
what is known to me right now, Dr. Goldstein was the only one who was 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers had fired warning shots in the air outside the mosque amid the 
confusion, Barak insisted, but had not fired at the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the army investigation are expected early this week, according to 
military sources, and the government will decide today whether to order an 
independent judicial inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban, a member of the leftist Meretz Party, called 
upon the Cabinet to give "very serious treatment of all the events surrounding 
the massacre" in an effort to rekindle trust between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure is building within the ruling Labor Party and among its political 
allies on the left for tough action against extremist groups among the 130,000 
Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a rally in Jerusalem on Saturday, Peace Now leader Tsali Reshef 
called for removal of Jewish settlers from Arab population centers, for the 
immediate implementation of the autonomy agreement with the PLO and the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our brothers the Palestinians, there are no words in our mouths to 
express the shock, pain and sorrow for the events in Hebron," Reshef said, 
urging the government to follow up its words with concrete steps.

STEEL-FRAME BUILDING CRACKS SPUR WIDER DAMAGE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO and RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least a dozen steel-framed office buildings -- a type of construction long 
considered invulnerable to collapse -- sustained deep cracks in their 
supporting columns during the Northridge earthquake, raising new and troubling 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope and the unprecedented nature of the failures has shaken the 
confidence of many engineers and prompted building owners to search for hidden 
damage in other buildings. The discovery also is expected to trigger a long and 
costly process of analysis and possibly retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-frame buildings are designed to bend with the enormous forces of an 
earthquake without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as earlier temblors exposed the weaknesses of unreinforced masonry 
buildings and stiffly designed reinforced concrete structures, the engineering 
hallmark of the Northridge earthquake may be that steel-frame buildings, which 
include the majority of the nation's commercial and high-rise structures built 
in recent decades, are vulnerable as well, even in moderate earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is the issue which potentially could have the most engineering 
significance from the earthquake," said John Hall, an associate professor of 
civil engineering at Caltech who headed one of several teams studying the 
impact of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about alarming people, many structural engineers said it is too early 
to draw broad conclusions about the relative safety or danger of steel-frame 
structures. None of the buildings with damage, they emphasize, were anywhere 
near collapse. They contrast this with reinforced concrete parking structures, 
such as the 18-month-old facility at Cal State Northridge that crumpled into 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that all of the damaged steel buildings are less than 10 stories 
tall, some engineers believe that the cloud-piercing towers in Downtown Los 
Angeles and Century City "are not as immune to damage as we once thought," Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others stress that steel-frame skyscrapers are still thought to be among 
those least likely to fall, even in a massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need improvement but the fundamental system is very sound," said Michael 
Engelhardt, a nationally known expert on steel-frame buildings. "We can still 
have a tremendous amount of confidence in steel-framed construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, structural engineers were troubled to find that the damaged buildings, 
many of which had crucial welds that fractured and columns that cracked or 
broke, were generally less than five years old. Several failures occurred in 
the steel frames of buildings under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was found in steel buildings as far as 20 miles from the Northridge 
quake epicenter and in the types of modern steel-frame designs thought to be 
safest -- those with so-called moment-resistant frames that are lighter and 
considered most flexible. About half of all buildings completed last year were 
of steel-frame construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.S. Borax's four-story headquarters in Valencia, 80% of the connections 
between the second floor's beams and supporting columns were weakened or pulled 
apart. Breaks in the frame of the three-story City Hall in Santa Clarita halved 
its resistance to sideways forces, engineers said. In one West Los Angeles 
building, which engineers declined to identify, steel supporting columns were 
reported to have cracked all the way through. 
</P>
<P>
 News of steel's problems in the quake has sent engineers rushing to Los 
Angeles to view the damage and stirred a hot phone and fax debate over what 
went wrong. The state's Seismic Safety Commission will discuss steel buildings 
at a Burbank meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have finally found the limits of steel, then this will be significant 
to us," said Paul Fratessa, an Oakland-based structural engineer and commission 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city building officials said they had learned of the problem 
Monday. Jim Usui, a structural engineer with the city, said some buildings will 
be reinspected, and officials will work with the steel industry to develop any 
needed code changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several steel, engineering and welding groups tentatively have scheduled 
conferences to examine changes in building codes, steel fabrication and welding 
and inspection practices. "Obviously, there is a problem. This wasn't supposed 
to happen," said Nestor Iwankiw, research director for the American Institute 
of Steel Construction, a trade group that plans a mid-March meeting on the 
issue. "This is the first time this type of failure has been seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers in California had dismissed the collapse of a steel frame building 
in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, citing generally poor construction methods 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a few Los Angeles-area engineering firms are sending letters to clients 
urging them to look for fissures in the frames of their steel buildings. 
Engineers said some owners may be reluctant to look closely for damage -- which 
may require cutting holes in walls and fire-proofing around steel members -- 
because it is costly and could alarm tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said they believe far more steel-frame buildings suffered damage than 
the 12 or so identified. They said reinspections are turning up additional 
buildings with potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these buildings appeared on first inspection to not be terribly 
damaged . . . which raises the specter that there could be a significant number 
of other buildings with similar problems," said Ron Hamburger, a San 
Francisco-based structural engineer hired to examine one of the damaged 
steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles structural engineer Nabih Youssef said: "The list of buildings 
affected is growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although damage was not evident from the exterior of the U.S. Borax 
headquarters, ultrasonic tests and X-rays showed that more than half of the 
beam-to-column connections in the building needed repairs, said spokesman Will 
Browne. The work will cost $5 million and take until July to complete, 
relegating 200 workers to temporary quarters, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common failure among steel buildings was at the welded connections 
binding the horizontal beams to vertical steel columns. The metal-alloy welds 
are supposed to be stronger than the girders they connect and thus are less 
likely to break. 
</P>
<P>
 As the welds hold, the beams and columns bend or twist, absorbing the 
earthquake's energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the affected buildings, however, some connections became brittle and broke. 
In some cases, only the welds cracked; in others, the weld fractures continued 
into the steel, deeply gouging columns or splitting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Sabol, president of Englekirk & Sabol structural engineers of Los 
Angeles, said the Northridge quake was the first recent earthquake to be 
centered in a U.S. urban area and therefore truly test steel-frame buildings. 
He also said minor cracks caused by previous quakes might have gone unnoticed 
because they were thought so unlikely that no one looked for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some engineers said one cause for the unexpected failure of steel-frame 
buildings was the sheer violence of the Northridge quake, which produced 
unusually high vertical ground motion. Other engineers said state and local 
building codes focus on containing the damaging effects of side-to-side 
movement rather than up-and-down forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to tighten up the codes," said Egor Popov, professor emeritus of 
civil engineering at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Popov said California buildings ought to be more like Japanese buildings, 
which are designed to resist greater earthquake forces. That could boost the 
cost of construction by requiring thicker columns and beams. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said weld inspection techniques ought to be more exacting to reduce 
shoddy craftsmanship, and building designers should install more 
state-of-the-art shock-absorbing systems at the base of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts interviewed by The Times said that steel quality did not appear 
to be a problem. They tended to blame the frame failures on poorly designed and 
executed welding. 
</P>
<P>
 Engelhardt, who tests steel-frame buildings at the University of Texas, 
Austin, had warned in a controversial paper published in December that current 
weld designs leave little margin for error and make them susceptible to failure 
in quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Engelhardt, who has made two trips to visit four damaged buildings, said his 
testing showed that the performance of steel frames is "highly sensitive to the 
quality of the welding, which is difficult to control in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Duane K. Miller, an engineer with Lincoln Electric Co. in Cleveland, the 
nation's largest supplier of welding material and equipment, said the welds 
themselves were less of a factor in the building failures than overall design. 
He said the welding and steel industries are searching for solutions. "We want 
to preclude this from happening in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are readying applications to the National Science Foundation for 
grants to study the shortcomings of steel-frame buildings. But conclusions 
could be years in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the owners of damaged buildings are trying to get them repaired and 
reopened as quickly as possible. In the process, some structural engineers 
said, they are destroying valuable evidence by grinding or melting away welds. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Inc., the Universal City entertainment giant, is repairing damage to a 
three-story steel-frame building under construction atop a parking structure. 
The building is scheduled to be completed by midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not economically feasible to make any building a research project," 
said Manuel Morden, senior associate of Brandow & Johnston & Associates, 
engineer for the MCA building. "We cannot wait for the research to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has embarked on a $4.5-million repair job at City Hall, and 
officials hope to reopen the building in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under way are repairs to damaged columns and welds in a six-story office 
building under construction and scheduled for completion next year at the Getty 
Center in Brentwood. All connections similar to those that were damaged will be 
retrofitted in five other unfinished buildings at the center, said Getty Trust 
spokeswoman Ruth Goldway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be confident that the buildings will be safer than ever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one building, however, probably will be torn down rather than 
repaired. The two-story, 160,000-square-foot Automobile Club of Southern 
California building in Santa Clarita now leans several inches to one side and 
toward the back because most of the first-floor columns were severed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a failure of this type . . . and it's going to be quite a 
task to work out just what went wrong with this one," said David J. Gowers, a 
Rancho Cucamonga civil engineer hired to examine the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most structural engineers never thought they would be pondering such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the old Superman movies," said Scott Melnick, editor of Modern Steel 
Construction magazine, an arm of the American Institute of Steel Construction. 
"Steel isn't supposed to crack." Cracked Frames 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings with cracked steel frames are being discovered throughout much of

</P>
<P>
 Sources: Structural engineers familiar with the buildings Quake Cracks Steel 
Buildings 
</P>
<P>
 In past earthquakes, unreinforced brick and stiffly designed concrete 
buildings were considered most vulnerable to collapse. Buildings made of steel 
were deemed safer, because they tend to bend but not break. The Northridge 
earthquake shattered those assumptions. Engineers have identified a dozen or 
more steel buildings as high as 10 stories with badly cracked welds and 
supporting steel columns. Although they did not collapse, they were seriously 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two types of cracks 
</P>
<P>
 Fracture near interface of weld and column flange 
</P>
<P>
 Fracture through column 
</P>
<P>
 Moment resisting frame 
</P>
<P>
 A steel moment resisting frame is a rectangular assemblage of beams and 
columns. The beams are welded and bolted to the columns.

RUSSIAN REVOLT LEADERS WALK OUT OF PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gleeful, unrepentant leaders of the bloody revolt that ended in flames at 
Russia's White House last October walked out of prison over President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's belated objections Saturday as an amnesty granted by the new 
Parliament took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, former Parliament Chairman Ruslan 
I. Khasbulatov and five prominent extremists embraced family members and 
supporters amid a shower of bouquets, a flurry of red Soviet flags and cries 
for renewed anti-government activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well done, guys, it's our day today!" shouted lawmaker Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, one of more than 200 well-wishers gathered in the snow outside 
Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. An alliance of Communists and Zhirinovsky's 
neo-fascists stunned the government by pushing the amnesty to approval 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutskoi, hustled into the prison last Oct. 4 in combat fatigues and a 
bristling mustache, emerged Saturday in his medal-bedecked general's uniform 
and sporting a bushy beard. "Rutskoi is president!" people chanted as the 
Afghan War hero smiled and waved. "Put Yeltsin's gang on trial!" 
</P>
<P>
 The amnesty ends criminal proceedings against as many as 17 figures in the 
two-day revolt, which had aimed to cancel Yeltsin's decree closing the 
Soviet-era Parliament and install Rutskoi in his place. More than 140 people 
died before the army crushed the uprising with a tank assault. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen hard-liners on trial for the brief overthrow of Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August, 1991, and 11 others arrested for rioting last 
May Day also benefit from the amnesty. But they had been freed from jail long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the imprisoned October rebels thus became the first serious test 
of Yeltsin's willingness to obey his own 2-month-old constitution and avoid a 
showdown with the conservative Parliament elected at the same time voters 
approved it. The constitution gives the Duma, or lower house, unchecked power 
to grant amnesties. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the government complied with the law, its decision was the product 
of evident confusion and internal disagreement. The result seemed to offer 
little assurance of peace between Yeltsin and an opposition now emboldened by 
the liberation of its jailed heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta published the amnesty Friday, 
making it official. But on Saturday, Yeltsin asked Prosecutor General Alexei 
Kazannik to delay it. The president also dispatched an aide to urge Ivan 
Rybkin, the Communist chairman of the Duma, to return the measure to lawmakers 
for "improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's argument was extremely technical: The Duma had erred by wording its 
resolution as if it was a pardon, which only the president can issue, rather 
than an amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Rybkin could respond, Kazannik resigned, saying he could bring 
himself neither to sign an amnesty of "murderers" nor to obey an 
unconstitutional order to delay it. Within minutes, a deputy prosecutor signed 
the order allowing Rutskoi and company to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the rebels were free, presidential advisers continued to criticize 
the amnesty and accused the prosecutor's office of acting in haste to apply it. 
One aide suggested the amnesty still might be modified. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who were ready to push Russia into a bloody civil war were freed 
without trial," said Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, who accused the 
Duma of "encouraging political extremism." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian president reserves the right to act in accordance with his 
constitutional powers in the illegal situation that has shaped up," he added, 
explaining that Yeltsin might challenge the Duma's decision in the courts but 
not resort to force. 
</P>
<P>
 The men freed with Rutskoi and Khasbulatov were accused of leading military 
attacks on the Ostankino television studios and the Moscow mayor's office Oct. 
3 -- under Rutskoi's direction from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said their freedom was nothing less than a vindication of the cause 
of restoring the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Rutskoi should become president," said Natalya V. Arkhipova, a 
42-year-old schoolteacher standing outside Lefortovo Prison. "We received this 
country free of capitalism, and he can help us leave it to our children exactly 
as we inherited it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yegor T. Gaidar, the free-market reformer who resigned last month as economy 
minister, predicted in an interview with a German newspaper last week that the 
pardoned rebels will "regroup and stage a new, better-organized coup . . . and 
set up a nationalist-Communist government." 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels gave little hint of their plans, other than to go home for dinner. 
Rutskoi and Khasbulatov simply thanked their supporters, waved and sped off -- 
the general in a Mercedes, the former chairman in a minivan escorted by four 
carloads of security guards from his native Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I find that prices have fallen and people are living better, that means 
Yeltsin will have been right" about setting up a market economy, Anpilov told 
the crowd. "Otherwise, I will carry on fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei V. Kuznetsov, a researcher in The Times' Moscow Bureau, contributed to 
this article.

GROUPS WITH STAKE IN STATE TOP WILSON'S DONOR LIST; POLITICS: MAJOR 
CORPORATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN INTEREST IN LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS ARE 
PRIME CONTRIBUTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On a day packed with discussions of education policy and meetings with 
legislators, Gov. Pete Wilson found time last fall to slip away from his office 
for an intimate lunch with some old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street from the Capitol at the private Sutter Club, Wilson dined Nov. 
9 with the president of Sun-Diamond Growers and the four chairmen of the big 
agricultural concern's member cooperatives, representing growers of walnuts, 
prunes, raisins and figs. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon tab: $25,000 in contributions to Wilson's reelection campaign, 
the latest in a series of big checks that make the Central Valley farming 
association one of the governor's most generous political benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete has had a personal relationship with the leadership of Sun-Diamond for 
over a decade," Richard Douglas, the firm's senior vice president, said in an 
interview. "We want to see him remain at the helm of the ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will need a lot more contributions like Sun-Diamond's if Douglas and 
his colleagues are to get their wish. The governor's campaign advisers believe 
that to win in November, Wilson will have to spend as much as $25 million. To 
get there, the Republican governor will have to take in about $500,000 every 
week between now and Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson continues his pattern set in 1993, when he raised $5.9 million, he 
will collect that money at small, pricey affairs like the one with Sun-Diamond, 
and at large, $150-per-ticket events for longtime supporters from his days as 
mayor of San Diego. He will receive a few big checks from wealthy entrepreneurs 
and many tiny ones from retirees reached by his direct mail operation. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Wilson's campaign reports, including one filed Jan. 31, shows that 
most of the money Wilson is raising comes from major corporations and interest 
groups with a stake in legislation and regulations decided in Sacramento, often 
in the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies, the oil industry and horse racing interests are among his 
largest contributors. Agriculture, health care companies and telecommunications 
firms also have been generous to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way the system works in Sacramento, where unlike federal races 
there are no limits on the size or the source of political contributions. Some 
donors say they give out of ideological affinity with the candidates. Some say 
they want better access -- improved odds that their phone calls will be 
returned. Others say they wish they did not have to contribute but feel they 
must in order to protect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is on record as favoring a $1,000 limit on contributions. But for the 
meantime, he plays the game by the rules in effect in California. And he plays 
it as well as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say his zeal, particularly his habit of scheduling fund-raisers 
while he is considering whether to sign or veto hundreds of bills after the end 
of the legislative session, is unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's peddling his executive powers," said Harvey Rosenfield, who has 
criticized Wilson for taking money from insurance companies while signing bills 
to weaken Proposition 103, which Rosenfield wrote and shepherded to voter 
approval to impose stricter regulation of insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is sensitive to this criticism and in a few cases has refused 
contributions from interests with matters before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he returned money that the Hollywood Park horse racing track and 
two Los Angeles card clubs contributed as he was considering whether to sign a 
bill that those interests were fighting over. Other legislation on the same 
subject is expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In anticipation of the bills arriving on the governor's desk, we believed it 
was in everyone's best interest to simply return the money to avoid any 
appearance of a conflict of interest," said Dan Schnur, the governor's campaign 
press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many other instances last year, Wilson accepted and kept contributions 
from interests that were seeking to influence him on important matters. Some 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the eve of the introduction Oct. 1 of a controversial new form of diesel 
fuel, Texaco picked up the $30,000 catering bill for a huge Wilson fund-raiser 
at Bob Hope's desert home. Arco contributed $10,000 at the same event. Despite 
protests from truck drivers who said the new fuel would cost more and damage 
their engines, Wilson let the regulation take effect on schedule two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state's nursery industry raised about $53,000 for Wilson at an event 
held as his Administration was weighing restrictions on methyl bromide, a 
pesticide used widely as a fumigant in greenhouses and plant farms. Three 
months later, Wilson reversed an earlier decision and canceled a regulation 
that would have required broad public notification whenever the pesticide was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 * The timber industry contributed to Wilson at the same time that his forestry 
board was considering regulations on cutting trees. Louisiana Pacific gave 
Wilson $50,000 in April. Two months later, Wilson, over the objections of 
environmentalists, ordered state officials to speed up approval of logging 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur could offer no rationale for why Wilson returned the gambling money but 
kept the rest. He said the decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're the incumbent governor, virtually any individual or interest may 
potentially have a stake in something under your purview," Schnur said. "We try 
to do everything we can to identify and remove any potential conflicts. You 
have to draw the line somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Few suggest that the contributions and Wilson's actions are directly linked. 
But even many donors acknowledge that they have given money to Wilson to 
establish a relationship that enables them to educate the governor and get 
through more easily to Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Sun-Diamond Growers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the company plucked Wilson from relative obscurity, endorsed him in a 
crowded Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and helped him raise money from 
other Central Valley growers, according to Douglas, the senior vice president. 
An agricultural neophyte then, Wilson today is one of the industry's staunchest 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our neck stuck out for the mayor of San Diego," Douglas said. "We 
raised money for him, we went to bat for him and he won. Pete, after getting 
elected, came back to thank the Sun-Diamond family time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
 Sun-Diamond officials have many concerns with which Wilson can help. Water 
provided by the State Water Project is vital to their business. The growers 
sell much of their product overseas and benefit from the state's export 
promotion programs. And they use pesticides that are regulated by the state, 
which is under pressure from environmental groups to limit the use of chemicals 
in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these subjects, according to Douglas, were discussed at the 
luncheon with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to lobby the governor in that setting," he said. "We don't 
discuss business. We talk about the world. We talk about families, the state. 
This is kind of like a group of old friends getting together." 
</P>
<P>
 When he does need to talk business, Douglas calls Henry Voss, Wilson's 
agriculture secretary, or Ira Goldman, the governor's trade representative. The 
calls, Douglas said, are swiftly returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly your phone calls are going to get answered quicker than the calls 
from someone who didn't toil in the vineyards to bring in the harvest," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, as in other capitals, this is called access. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Burns, a former legislative aide and now a lobbyist for G. D. Searle & 
Co., a pharmaceuticals firm, said access is what the drug industry was looking 
for when it held a $2,500-per-person fund-raiser for Wilson in Sacramento last 
year. The event raised more than $30,000 for the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending with Wilson were his wife, Gayle, one of his political aides, Joe 
Shumate, and Kim Belshe, then the deputy secretary of health and welfare and 
now director of the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very low-key," Burns said. "There were three companies represented at 
each table, and the governor and his wife and Shumate and Kim rotated from 
table to table. Everybody got face time with the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 At his table, Burns recalled, the main topic of conversation was the fact that 
his boss grew up near Gayle Wilson in Arizona, where her father ran a bakery 
and the father of Burns' boss sold bread for the competition. Despite the small 
talk, Burns said he considered the event a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time I pick up the phone and call someone in the governor's office, 
they'll know who I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same motivation drove the California Ski Industry Assn. to host a lunch 
for Wilson in October, said Bob Roberts, the group's executive director. Wilson 
brought with him the directors of Caltrans and the Highway Patrol, and the 
secretaries of resources and trade and commerce. Representative of nine resorts 
attended, raising $23,900 for the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski resorts, Roberts said, tend to be located in rural areas where few voters 
live. They cannot very well threaten to move out of state if they're unhappy. 
So they have had trouble getting the ear of state officials for years. 
</P>
<P>
 They need to talk to Caltrans and the Highway Patrol about keeping mountain 
roads open on snowy days, to the resources agency about air and water quality 
issues, and to the trade and commerce agency about the promotion of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found that by getting more involved in the political process we have 
been able to at least find an audience of people to listen," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought his industry could get a meeting with four top state 
officials without holding a fund-raiser for the governor, Roberts replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, no." 
</P>
<P>
 The ski industry event is reminiscent of a Wilson fund-raiser a year ago to 
which the governor brought members of the state Waste Management Board to help 
him raise money from the waste handling and hauling industry. Wilson called 
that a mistake and vowed not to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, said that although officials with 
regulatory powers no longer attend fund-raisers, Cabinet officials do. It makes 
sense for these experts to be present to help the governor spell out his agenda 
to contributors like the ski resort operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Wilson Administration said that contributions to the 
governor gain no special favors from these Cabinet officials. "To the extent 
that you can work with anybody, you try and do so," Kevin Eckery said. "But you 
certainly don't accommodate people based on whether you met with them at a 
fund-raiser, for God's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said there is no pressure on companies or interest groups to contribute 
to Wilson, either to obtain access or influence policy. The governor, he said, 
often takes actions against the wishes of his donors. He cited a 1992 bill 
Wilson vetoed even though it was sponsored by the state's prison guard union, 
which is a frequent contributor to the governor and waged a $1-million 
independent campaign to help him win election in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception among the interest groups, however, is that contributions are a 
cost of doing business in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Mangers, a former assemblyman who now lobbies for the California Cable 
Television Assn., said his industry makes contributions because it does not 
want to stand out from the competition, particularly the telephone companies, 
which are big contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, nine cable companies contributed more than $50,000 to Wilson at an 
event in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just as soon inform, try to persuade and educate people of the 
complexities of ours and other interests," Mangers said, "and not have money 
play any role at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangers said he is sure that Wilson would not punish his industry if it 
stopped contributing to his campaigns. But he's not taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the current law and the current rules, it's expected that one will 
participate in the political lives of those who are elected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Future stories will examine the fund raising of gubernatorial candidates 
Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 * PARTY FAVORITE: Lack of GOP infighting lets Wilson focus on Democrats. A3 
Wilson Fund Raising 
</P>
<P>
 California Gov. Pete Wilson has been raising large amounts of money to finance 
his reelection campaign. The governor's campaign advisers believe that to win 
in November, Wilson will have to spend as much as $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The top contributors in 1993 to Wilson's reelection campaign committee were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sam Bamieh, president American Intertrade Group, a Bay Area import-export 
firm, $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pacific Telesis, telecommunications, $56,500.

'YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY'; VIOLENCE: FAMILIES MOURN GIRL ACCIDENTALLY 
SLAIN BY PLAYMATE.

 It was not the violence of the streets but a gun tucked under a bed that cost 
7-year-old Crystal Kimberly Bracey her life. 
</P>
<P>
 On her graffiti-scarred block in Watts, heavy iron bars cover almost every 
window, chain-link fencing keeps the uninvited at bay and nighttime gunfire is 
so frequent that few residents feel secure without a weapon of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gunshots here are like a dog barking -- it's so normal," the girl's aunt, 
Sonya Carter, 23, said Saturday. "But at least if your child is at home, or at 
a neighbor's house, you think you don't have to worry, that they're safe and 
being watched." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody suspected that the pigtailed, high-achieving second-grader would be in 
danger as long as she stayed behind those protective walls. But on Friday as 
she played at a neighbor's house half a block away, a 9-year-old boy pulled a 
high-powered military-style rifle from under a mattress and fired one round 
into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the shooting was accidental but were investigating whether 
anyone in the household had been negligent for leaving the weapon within reach. 
Under the Children's Firearm Accident Protection Act, which took effect in 
1992, an adult can face up to three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine 
for keeping a loaded weapon that is accessible to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, where we live, people feel they need a gun to make it in 
everyday life," Carter said as she wiped her eyes outside the girl's house on 
112th Street. "Now, we'll never know what this beautiful child would have grown 
up to be -- maybe a doctor, maybe a lawyer, maybe the first black woman 
President of the United States. All we can do is wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy discovered the rifle in a bedroom about 7 p.m. His 
grandmother, Lillie Smith, who was watering plants in the living room when the 
shot was fired, said she did not know such a weapon was in the house. By the 
time she realized what had happened, the girl who everyone knew as Kim was 
lying face-down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 After being summoned, the girl's mother dashed to the house, where she cradled 
her bleeding child, whispering words of love. Unable to speak, Kim gently 
squeezed her mother's hand. But 1 1/2 hours later, she was pronounced dead at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers questioned the distraught boy, who was later released to another 
relative. His grandmother said she plans to take him to a doctor Monday. "He's 
still crying," said Smith, 63, a retired noontime aide at nearby Grape Street 
Elementary School. "He just keeps saying, 'It was an accident. It was an 
accident.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she warned the boy -- one of her 17 grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren -- to steer clear of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always told him that you never play with guns, that if you know it's real, 
you don't even touch it," said Smith, who does not own a weapon but believes 
some of her older grandchildren do. "I don't see how they give you that much 
protection anyway. If a person comes up to you with a gun, they're gonna get 
you, whether you have one or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, a drill team cheerleader at Grape Street School, had lived her entire 
life in a neighborhood known for its hazards; in the half-square-mile that 
surrounds her home, police last year reported an average of one violent crime a 
day, including five murders, 125 robberies and 243 assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the perils, Kim strove to excel. Her mother, LaShawn Sadberry, who was 
too consumed with grief Saturday to talk, kept a folder that is stuffed with 
her daughter's schoolwork and awards. There are certificates for perfect 
attendance, good citizenship and positive behavior. One commendation, from Los 
Angeles' BEST after-school program, praised her for participating this month in 
the Community Jam Against Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A beautiful life has been lost," said Kim's aunt, who asked that funeral 
donations be sent in care of Grape Street School. "We know nothing was done 
intentionally. We just want the message to get out that guns equal danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Only Kim's younger sister, 4-year-old Jasmine, did not seem to comprehend the 
horror that has befallen the two families. As the girl pranced around her front 
yard Saturday, her aunt said they tried to explain that Kim had gone to heaven 
to be with the angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she gets back, let me know," Jasmine had replied, "so we can go out and 
play."

<P>
 Away from the majestic pinnacles of Manhattan, so much of this city is like 
the steerage compartment of an immigrant ship, neglected old buildings at the 
edge of ruin, 200,000 families living doubled or tripled up, working people 
paying half their income for a few feet of warmth and a foldaway bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy rates in New York's poorer neighborhoods hover around 1%. There is 
a 10-year wait for public housing. Shelters for homeless families are full 
beyond capacity. People sleep outside, swathed in blankets of newspaper and 
cardboard, their real estate the city's benches and portals and rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something baffling as well as sad about this housing shortage. 
Thousands of abandoned buildings honeycomb the Bronx, Brooklyn and Harlem -- a 
surplus teasing at all the want. Some of them are skeletonized and crumbling 
but others are recoverable with simple applications of piping and drywall. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, there are those among the poor who ask: Why can't we have these 
windy spaces for ourselves? With their own tools and money and sweat, they are 
ready to recast the hollows into livable housing. But they fail to understand 
the unbending rules of a complicated metropolis. Urban renewal, like the law, 
is nothing to be taken into your own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominican immigrant Antonio Rodriguez is one of those failing to appreciate 
this. In a typical week, the cab driver earns $150. Of that, he pays $80 for a 
7-by-12-foot room he shares with two sons and a daughter. Their sleeping area 
is a geometric puzzle of two beds and the bare floor beside a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 49, keeps asking himself: "How can all these empty buildings just 
be sitting there in this of all cities, the capital of the world?" 
</P>
<P>
 So he was easy to recruit, joining a loosely knit group called Inner City 
Press/Community on the Move. Its members scout among the vacant hulks, move in, 
start repairs. For the past five years, their unlawful colonies have vexed New 
York's mammoth Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the landlord 
of a vast, woeful empire of buildings seized for unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 HPD, of course, prefers to make its own plans for its own property. Four times 
now, the city has rooted out Inner City squatters, unhinging more than 100 
families from their improvised homes. These mass evictions -- using the tactic 
of surprise -- are dreadful events, squads of police busting through doors, 
overwrought people coursing tears, possessions scattered and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The displaced are perplexed by their expulsion, disbelieving that their hard 
labors go unappreciated. "We were working people, repairing a building little 
by little," said Amado Campbell. "What are we to do now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what are the desperate to do? Sea to shining sea, poor Americans are 
hard put to find affordable housing. It is not simply a matter of who is 
homeless and who is not. For every homeless person, there are tenfold getting 
by only after agonizing choices: meat on the table or higher rent, crack-heads 
in the halls or higher rent, doubling up with relatives or higher rent. 
</P>
<P>
 This past decade was one obliging to the rich but calamitous for the poor. The 
stock of private low-cost housing eroded. The federal government retreated from 
the construction of new units. The economics of the post-industrial city 
produced a battering one-two punch of higher rents and lower wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building boom of the '80s never filtered down to the poor" said Michael 
A. Stegman, assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. "We have 5.2 million families 
(about one in 15 Americans) either paying more than 50% of their incomes for 
housing or living in substandard units." 
</P>
<P>
 The share of household income used for rent is at a 25-year high, according to 
the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. The poorer the 
renter, the tougher the squeeze. The Harvard researchers classified 3.5 million 
households as extremely poor (earning less than a quarter of an area's median 
income and receiving no housing subsidies.) Of those, about 70% paid more than 
half their income in rent; another 22% lived in housing in serious disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 New York -- this great human ship taking on water -- is overwhelmed. Between 
1988 and 1992, a total of 239,425 residents spent time in a homeless shelter. 
That is 3.3% of the population, and includes one in 20 of the city's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials here have not turned their backs. They boast that New York has 
directed $2 billion toward new housing in the past four years -- three times 
that of the nation's next 50 largest cities combined. But the demand for more 
low-income apartments seems insatiable, beyond the fathoming of planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Rodriguez, six years in America and still stymied by English, knows 
nothing of city housing policies. He works hard, he pays rent. The cabbie might 
be able to earn more picking up fares, but he has to be choosy about who he 
stops for. Last year, 42 taxi drivers were murdered here. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a friend who suggested he contact the Inner City group: "They open the 
lock, and you can just go in." One sleety day, he visited the squatters and was 
saucer-eyed at the roominess inside one of the already occupied buildings. The 
apartments might well have cost $700 a month in the prevailing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez then took a drive with an Inner City organizer, stopping at a South 
Bronx low-rise. On the red brick exterior were white-stenciled letters: 
property owned by City of New York. The squatters were thinking of taking over 
the building and had already replaced HPD's padlock with one of their own. 
Rodriguez ventured in, across a threshold of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The place looked disemboweled, most of its walls and ceilings stripped to 
their structural bones. A haphazard mulch of wood and old clothes and scraps of 
paper filled the floors shin-high. Beneath a broken window was a moldy 
mattress, rotting away like a side of beef. Doors were wrenched off their 
hinges. The stairway had loose steps, and the banister was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug addicts had rummaged around and left their signature crack vials, but no 
one had really lived there for years. The latest newspaper was from 1985, 
opened to an ad for the movie, "The Gods Must Be Crazy." A 1983 collection 
letter demanded payment for "ambulance services rendered." A note on pink 
stationery promised: "Gary, I went to the store. Be right back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez walked among each of the four apartments, the ending of one hard to 
tell from the start of another. The air was musty, and dust hung in every rod 
of light. Cold filled his mouth, a puff of steam escaping with each breath. He 
counted rooms and measured windows. Something was incomprehensible to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has just been sitting here abandoned?" he asked. "I can't believe it. 
Some of these walls don't even need Sheetrock, just scraping maybe, a little 
compound over there. The garbage? It's nothing, just throw it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful place, a room for my daughter, a room for my sons." THE 
SQUATTERS: Working Poor Stake Claims in Hostile Slums 
</P>
<P>
 Squatters are not peculiar to New York. Every city has its share of urban 
guerrillas. In the 1970s, authorized "urban homesteading" was even in vogue -- 
the updated, citified variation of a great folk myth, courageous settlers 
overcoming the elements in a hostile slum. Homesteading still goes on in some 
cities, but the aim is mostly gentrification rather than low-income shelter. In 
Wilmington, Del., the first homesteader was a tax attorney with DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has had a homesteading program too. Its premise was the standard one, 
allowing people to "buy" tumbledown housing with the "sweat equity" of their 
rejuvenating labors. But only designated buildings are eligible under the plan, 
and HPD has not added to its list since 1986. Homesteading is now seen here as 
a nobly romantic but highly inefficient housing strategy: Big buildings are not 
Tinkertoys. Renovations require skilled labor, up to code. 
</P>
<P>
 Squatters cannot wait. Drug addicts are the most visible, commandeering vacant 
lairs like soldiers on a house-to-house search. Then there are the "anarchist 
squatters" of the Lower East Side, many of them refugees from the middle class 
with noms de guerre and an acquired hatred of private property. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the working poor make up an increasing share. Inner City got its 
start in 1987 on the shoulders of Matthew Lee, a 23-year-old on fire with high 
ideals and anti-Establishment politics, his mind sketching out conspiracy 
theories as easily as a child plays connect-the-dots. Lee, then unemployed, 
began publishing a newspaper with a donated mimeograph machine. Inside was a 
sampling of his poetry and information about the hows and whys of squatting. 
</P>
<P>
 A few dozen people responded, and the aspiring organizer was able to coax a 
handful to a meeting. They were Puerto Ricans and Hondurans and Dominicans, 
needy people neediest for the same thing: a decent place to live. They decided 
to look for a building of their own in the Bronx, a borough teeming with Latino 
immigrants as it once had overflowed with newcomers from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The place they chose was city-owned and had been empty for eight years. Each 
of its 20 units had big bedrooms with dulled but intact parquet floors. The 
front windows faced the broad greenery of Crotona Park. Seventy years before, 
Leon Trotsky had lived a few blocks away, waiting for his revolution. Further 
east, Sholom Aleichem gave vent to life's bittersweet in his final Yiddish 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crotona building needed a daunting amount of work, but people were eager. 
They packed tons of rubble into burlap potato sacks bought from a vegetable 
wholesaler. Discarded wood-frame windows were salvaged from construction sites. 
Drywall went up, beams were replaced. Small amounts of electricity were pirated 
by running wires to street lamps. Later, someone with the know-how shimmied 
down a manhole and connected the building to the main power line. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor was mostly done on weekends. People learned basic skills on the job. 
Vandals had raided the plumbing for its value as scrap metal, and new pipes had 
to be installed. Neighbors and passers-by often volunteered. Strong coffee was 
always brewing. In the winter, workers took turns around a wood-burning stove, 
rubbing their hands together as if washing them in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the group had planned to fix up the building and then somehow get 
the city's OK before moving in. But construction went on for a year or so, and 
the waiting was hard. The six Alvarez sisters -- all with small children -- 
were living doubled-up, as many as 15 people in a two-bedroom flat. Anything 
with more space seemed better. Finally, the squatters went ahead and set up 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 All this time, HPD was watching. The city had more elaborate plans for the 
building, renovations of its own. In early 1989, someone from HPD dropped off a 
sheaf of eviction orders, which hit with the force of a cold splash of reality. 
People wanted to know: How could the city do this to us after all our work? 
</P>
<P>
 The squatters appealed to attorneys at Legal Aid for help. And, to their 
relief, they discovered how one law could be nimbly invoked to outmaneuver 
another: The eviction papers had never been properly posted at each door. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal victory was emboldening to a collection of immigrants, few of them 
acquainted with U.S. courts or even the English language. Months went by, and 
HPD still failed to get its paperwork in order. Then there was a long calm. 
Maybe the city had given up? After all, it owned so many buildings and this one 
was already occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the group spread, and the membership multiplied. On some Saturdays, a 
few hundred people showed up to work. The squatters decided to take over the 
abandoned building next door and then they added other big apartment houses 
nearby. By late fall of 1990, Inner City was opening a building a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really cooking," Lee recalled with customary apostolic vigor. "It was 
true empowerment, people making their own decisions on every nail. We knew it 
was illegal, but so what? People were alive. People were taking risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I get lost in my own hype, but the poor have so little available to 
them that practically anything they do is illegal. Be a street vendor, you're 
illegal. Haul trash with no license, you're illegal. Fix an apartment, you're 
illegal. The only way to be legal is to sit in a shelter and give up." THE 
FALL: Blazes and Police Raids Take Their Toll 
</P>
<P>
 But the momentum soon burned away. In December, 1990, a fire broke out at the 
first Crotona site. Lee -- habitually suspicious -- thought HPD might have set 
it. Inspectors were certainly Johnny-on-the-spot with a vacate order, and not 
just for the damaged building, but also the group's site next door. 
</P>
<P>
 No legal technicalities stopped the city this time. About 200 police officers 
in riot gear marched four abreast toward the buildings. A crowd quickly formed, 
including anarchist supporters, chanting: "No homes, no peace." About 20 Inner 
City squatters were holding out inside. They wanted to make a stand, but were 
amateurs at impromptu defiance. They blocked a door with a refrigerator only to 
be surprised by cops who came up the fire escape. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Eve, a second blaze lit up one of the group's other buildings and 
left it a ruin. Five weeks after that, police forcibly removed the squatters at 
yet another site. All told, the people living in 85 units had now lost their 
jerry-built homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inner City's faithful were no longer so spirited. The squatters were becoming 
sullen and desperate and angry. And the turnouts on Saturday began to fall 
away. THE BACKGROUND: Government Is Slow to Deal With the Problems 
</P>
<P>
 America's social contract has important omissions, such as: If you want to 
work, you can. And if you do work, you can live in at least somewhat-dignified 
circumstances. As things go now, the working poor often do not have much of a 
deal. They earn too much to collect welfare, but not enough to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Society may revere the notion of home and hearth, but housing itself is just 
another ware for purchase and sale, a commodity rather than a right. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some federal funds aimed at low-income housing; HUD's annual budget, 
for example, is $25 billion. But the nation's largest housing subsidy is the 
one written into its tax code, allowing deductions for mortgage interest on 
first and second homes. This deprives the Treasury of $46 billion a year, 
according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The biggest tax 
breaks naturally accrue to those with the biggest mortgages: the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing aid for the poor has never been the enshrined policy of the homeowner 
deductions. During the 1980s, federal construction of low-income units was 
allowed to slide toward a halt. This blow was softened to a degree by the 
introduction of new tax credits, encouraging others to do the financing. The 
use of rent vouchers also expanded, though in cities with housing crises, these 
were often of no more value than gift certificates to an empty store. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, with the poverty rate up and the supply of low-cost units down, 
housing assistance is received by only a third of the 13 million low-income 
households eligible. The Clinton Administration has yet to struggle with this 
math. "The budget environment is very, very difficult," said Stegman of HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inner City squatters are mostly working people. They hold factory or 
restaurant jobs, where the pay is less than $200 a week. Or they work 
construction, where the salaries are higher but the labor is only off-and-on. 
</P>
<P>
 HPD officials have never had a good fix on who their adversaries are. They 
speculate that most in the group are illegal immigrants, though that is not so. 
They also consider the squatters to be "innocent dupes" of Matthew Lee. "He 
leads them to believe that the city will eventually let them keep their 
apartment," said Peter Cantillo, an HPD assistant commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, such statements are patronizing. The squatters are well aware of 
what they are getting into and how it might end. If some cleave to illusions, 
it is borne from a naive sense of social justice. In their innocence, many keep 
receipts for building materials. "That way, if the city throws me out, they can 
reimburse me for every penny I've spent," said Pablo Pichardo, a father of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first fires and evictions, Inner City slowly began rebuilding 
strength and attracting new people. For most, squatting was simply a practical 
choice measured against what their rent was buying. Was it better to be a 
squatter in a building with no boiler or a renter in a place with no privacy? 
</P>
<P>
 Hilda Cruz had been paying $50 a week for a small room she shared with two 
other women. Ernesto Gallard, his wife and three children lived in the back of 
a small store, sleeping on floor mats and using the alley for a bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Squatting, of course, involves hardships, especially when a building is newly 
taken and the cold still comes and goes as it pleases. People are bundled up in 
blankets like papooses. There is no running water; bucketfuls are commonly 
toted up from fire hydrants and stored in 50-gallon drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want a place of your own, you have to fight for it," said Paulina 
Gomez, a young restaurant worker with a child. "I buy nothing for myself. My 
mother is very poor, and I don't send her any money because it all goes toward 
buying materials. These windows, with good metal frames, they cost me $570." 
</P>
<P>
 Inner City appeals to a determined few. A sizable number drop out for one 
reason or another; also, slackers who fail to work on their apartments are 
sometimes ousted by others in a building. That way, those who stay are united 
by a sense of shared sacrifice. In some cases, those sacrifices are extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Dario Guzman and Marcelina Isabel, homeless after a rent dispute, accepted 
whatever opening Inner City had. They were the first to move into a three-story 
structure in the South Bronx. Wires hung free from the walls, tangled like 
worms in a fisherman's pail. Rubbish covered the floors. They lacked shovels, 
so the two of them scooped at the mess with broken pieces of Formica. 
</P>
<P>
 The squatters had a newborn to worry about. For days, they left the baby with 
friends. When they finally did bring him over, people on the block called the 
Bureau of Child Welfare. For years, only junkies had used the building; they 
had reasonably concluded that someone was on a binge with a baby in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 A BCW worker hurried over and was surprised to find a solid married couple 
fixing up the front stairs. Still, he warned them that a dilapidated apartment 
was no place for their child. They had to go to a homeless shelter -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, he was right," Isabel said. "It was crazy to have a baby 
in a place with no windows and the winter coming." But she refused to go to one 
of the city shelters, so reviled here as hostelries of mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she went home to the Dominican Republic and dropped the child off 
with her sister. She would call each week from New York to let him hear her 
voice. By spring, the apartment would be in good shape. The baby could be 
brought back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another of those ghastly choices for the poor, forever regrettable and 
worst for Isabel at night, when the tears would pour into her pillow. THE 
BUREAUCRACY: N.Y. Agency Struggles With a Thankless Job 
</P>
<P>
 HPD is one of those godawful bureaucratic apparatuses set up for impossible 
and thankless tasks. It is also among America's biggest slumlords, the manager 
of a burdensome portfolio of about 5,600 troubled buildings, including 3,500 
with tenants. This amounts to 50,000 units, or enough to house the entire 
population of Stockton, Calif.; or Hartford, Conn.; or Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, HPD's inventory was twice as large as it is now. By then, 
low-income housing had already become a big money loser in New York. Operating 
costs for decrepit, pre-World War II buildings were soaring. In poorer 
neighborhoods, with lower rents, landlords were simply walking away from their 
headaches -- or collecting the insurance from a timely act of arson. The South 
Bronx, a vast necropolis of brick tenements, had become a world-famous slum. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cities, property seized for back taxes is auctioned off, but that was 
impractical here. The buildings were precious only to those who lived there. To 
save a diminishing resource, the city felt compelled to enter the housing 
business. An obscure agency suddenly had to become a titan. The abrupt 
inheriting of so many buildings was a maddening challenge for HPD. Who lived in 
them? How much were the rents? Did the boilers work? Was it gas or oil? 
</P>
<P>
 HPD's management of the property, while flawed and costly, has nonetheless 
preserved tens of thousands of badly-needed apartments. The city is a terrible 
landlord -- forever behind in repairs -- but it has been able to divest itself 
of many of the buildings by partly subsidizing their sale and rehabilitation. 
Buyers have been tenants, community groups and private developers. No longer is 
the South Bronx a vast, eerie moonscape. In it are new blooms of brick. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the Inner City group was such an annoyance. By 1991, HPD had 
devised plans for each of its larger abandoned buildings. Every deal was a knot 
of arrangements, this-and-that financing with hither-and-yon approvals. Such 
orderly proceedings left no room for squatters and their urgencies. 
</P>
<P>
 When dispensing standard damnations of the group, however, HPD officials most 
often mentioned other, less arcane concerns. The squatters were "jumping the 
line" ahead of their brethren poor, who were patiently waiting in shelters for 
city housing. They were also a hazard to themselves and their neighbors, 
cooking with illegal kerosene stoves. The city could not be seen to wink at 
such things. 
</P>
<P>
 But the squatters proved easier to lambaste than remove. HPD did not have the 
resources to patrol its abandoned buildings. It would have to tolerate the 
squatters until the very day that the agency itself -- or a new owner -- was 
ready to begin construction. Then the police could be enlisted to throw the 
interlopers out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, many at HPD flinched. Ousting poor families was surely no beauty 
treatment for the self-image. Some agency higher-ups had themselves started out 
as community activists and once considered squatting the tactic of heroes. Of 
course, that was 20 years ago, before things had become so coat-and-tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, even many of the most renegade of neighborhood groups had gotten 
into the game with the moguls. They were incorporated, with foundation grants 
from Rockefeller and Ford and multimillion-dollar government contracts as 
social service providers. HPD was their partner in developing real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some of the agency's more conciliatory bosses felt the best solution 
was to have the squatters undergo a similar transformation. Why not polish up 
the group and let it become another of HPD's not-for-profit housing partners: 
filing the proper applications, entering the financial pipeline, renovating in 
full compliance? 
</P>
<P>
 In March of 1992, the squatters agreed to send representatives downtown to 
talk. The meeting was held around a handsome conference table, the varnish so 
bright it was like a wood-grained looking glass. After the years of antagonism, 
there was an awkwardness in the air: so here were those stubborn squatters, so 
there were those heartless bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice Michetti, then the HPD commissioner, was not among those kindly 
disposed toward the group. She was firm as a schoolmarm, delivering a civics 
lesson: Yes, she understood that rents were unaffordable. Yes, she knew they 
needed homes. But squatting was against the law. It would never be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors tried to convert her with personal stories. They were living more 
safely now; their children were healthier. Some had once been tenants in 
HPD-managed buildings. Their accommodations were better as squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, Enrique Deoleo, deeply resented the commissioner's lecture. Though 
well into his seventh decade, he was still tough as a pit bull, his neck the 
size of a small birthday cake. He had been the first to live in the group's 
largest building, using a flashlight and machete to skirmish with the rats. 
</P>
<P>
 He rose to speak, removing his cowboy hat before imparting a civics lesson of 
his own. "Our buildings may belong to the city, but the city is the property of 
the people and we are the people," he said with some extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has two vehicles, a limousine for the rich to ride in and a tractor 
to dig a hole and push the poor inside to bury them." THE CLASH: Eviction Order 
Almost Ends in Tragic Death 
</P>
<P>
 Among city housing groups, the Inner City squatters are mostly known as 
hard-working and sincere, though even sympathizers have qualms. "As a way of 
allocating scarce resources, allowing the takeover of buildings is not much of 
a program," said Andrew Reicher, an advocate for low-income housing. 
"Homesteading, to be fair, has to have a selection process. Otherwise, it would 
just be a land rush. Competition would get ugly. You'd have wars at 
construction sites." 
</P>
<P>
 Another advocate, Harry DeRienzo, mediated between the squatters and the city. 
It was frustrating work. As a sign of good faith, the city had requested a list 
of all the group's sites. As a sign of their distrust, the squatters had 
refused. Discussions then died out. "When there's an impasse like that, someone 
has to take a risk and that should be the party with the least to lose, which 
I'd have to suggest was the city," DeRienzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inner City's two biggest sites were actually well-known to HPD. They were 
those facing buildings at 670 and 675 E. 170th St. in the Bronx. Large yellow 
signs at the front entrances proclaimed the squatters' presence. The group had 
occupied the 37 units for four years, but now HPD wanted to bring in a private 
developer for a total rehabilitation. To ease the way, the city would nourish 
the project with $4 million in grants and low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 By July of last year, everything was set to go, except the squatters. Most of 
them ignored the flyers left by the city, offering help in relocation. The 
handouts made no mention of a vacate order or a deadline for clearing out. With 
mass evictions so messy, the police prefer the element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of July 8, the heat was awful, burning toward 100. The cops 
rolled up in vans and buses, accompanied by some of the HPD brass. The street 
was quickly sealed off. In moments, everything was motion. The police were on 
the stairs, the roofs, in the halls. Batons banged on locked doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The squatters were ordered to grab what they could and get out. Maria Mata, 
age 61, was caught in her underwear, preparing to take a bath. Suddenly, the 
police were pacing around her, clapping hands, shouting: "Let's go, let's go!" 
Someone from the city snapped her picture, accumulating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 All around, disbelief mingled with commotion. There were sharp volleys of 
cursing and pleas. City workers were carrying furniture to trucks or dropping 
it in dumpsters. Demolition crews broke windows and tore down walls. Plaster, 
like so much crumbled old bread, once again coated the floors. 
</P>
<P>
 People were desperate to locate their friends, personal documents, family 
photos. Francisco Herrera could not find where his wife had put their savings, 
nearly $1,000. The police were hovering over him: "Time is up! Time is up!" 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Cantillo was there for HPD. "It was a terrible thing to watch," he said. 
"The idea is to make the squatters feel the immediate need to leave. Few 
questions are answered. I don't have to tell you how many things they want to 
take with them, but once they get their personal belongings, that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have very little tolerance for people going back in for more. 
After all, what will they need at a shelter? The furniture is supplied." 
</P>
<P>
 When the eviction began, that rugged old-timer Enrique Deoleo, had been laying 
cement in the courtyard. "Do you have any papers from the court?" he demanded 
of the police as they rushed by. Someone from HPD promised that he'd be cared 
for in a shelter. "That's no different than a jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one paid any mind when Deoleo climbed the six flights of stairs, going past 
the cops stationed on the roof. In a few seconds, he was at the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on?" a policeman finally yelled, moving toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay away," Deoleo hollered back. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers squinted up from the street. Against an azure summer sky, the 
squatter looked like some possessed and bereft peasant farmer. A news 
photographer was snapping away. Please don't jump, thought Cantillo of HPD. He 
would later quip that he could see his entire career flash before his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cop on the roof kept coming. "What do you want?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're all a bunch of liars," Deoleo answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The squatter then turned his back. He mumbled a few prayers, made the sign of 
the cross and opened his arms to eternity. He lunged, the cop lunged. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer managed to grab Deoleo just as he pushed off. He yanked him back 
in and wrestled him down and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the wiggy old guy was charged with disorderly conduct. THE AFTERMATH: 
Strategy Changes, but the Struggle Continues 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months have passed, and most everyone from the 170th Street buildings 
still live in hotels used by the city as family shelters, which cost the 
taxpayers about $80 a day per person, or $30,000 a year. "We could use the 
money instead," said Amado Campbell. "Why dump us in here with all the drug 
addicts?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are the usual complaints about such places -- the crime, the noise -- 
but the former squatters are willing to wait it out. HPD has promised them city 
apartments, letting them "jump the line" ahead of other poor people after all. 
Supposedly, it is just a matter of cutting through some final strands of red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the Inner City group has changed strategy. Squatters are now 
settling into smaller buildings, ones with 10 units or less. They think HPD is 
less likely to bother with them now. The group has about 18 in all. 
</P>
<P>
 On most Saturdays, the organizers drive the streets and creep around the brick 
corpses. By now, they are connoisseurs of abandonment, picking out the better 
buildings the way an expert chef might select fresh fish on the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another change too. Squatters at some sites have finally gotten 
Consolidated Edison Co. to sell them electricity, which was not easy. With no 
certificates of occupancy, the group had been like a provisional government 
without diplomatic recognition. They were ineligible for service. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new, smaller sites is a four-story walk-up in East Harlem. It is a 
relief to have lights now, but there is still no running water. Some of the men 
tried to dig a hole from the basement to the outdoor main, but it was a 
screwball idea and they became afraid the street would collapse on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's occupants are a gritty, if star-crossed bunch. Maria Garcia de 
Santos, 26, works in a factory, putting metal studs into dog leashes. The 
salary is $175 a week. A few months back, her husband, Andres, joined her in 
the United States. He has no paying job yet, though he does stock shelves for 
free at a nearby supermarket. "When they do hire someone, it will be me," he 
said optimistically. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria is reed thin, sharply featured, newly pregnant. She grew up in the 
Dominican countryside, and New York is a colossus to her. "I was ashamed to 
live in an abandoned building," she said. "The rats would smash into the front 
door so hard, I thought it was a person and I would get up to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings, she and Andres used to sit around a candle, their shadows 
flitting in the scars of dim light. "I have a right to this place now," she 
said. "Some people want everything easy. They won't come into a place full of 
garbage. They wouldn't do things step by step, a window now, a door later." 
</P>
<P>
 The man downstairs, Dario Solano, was determined that their building have a 
proper mailbox inside the front entrance. He studied the postal regulations, 
installed and reinstalled the hardware, waited for the mail carrier to come up 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who lives here?" the postman asked. "Bums?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dario was proud to explain otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said matter-of-factly. "It is the residents who live here."

5 GUNMEN OPEN FIRE IN PARK; 2 INJURED; VIOLENCE: HUNDREDS WERE CELEBRATING 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH AT PALM SPRINGS PICNIC. ONE SUSPECT IS ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Five gunmen opened fire in a Palm Springs park where hundreds of people were 
celebrating Black History Month on Saturday, wounding a 3-year-old and a young 
man, and sending panicked picnickers running for cover, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police from four agencies descended on the park and arrested one suspect who 
had fled by car, said Sgt. Mike McCracken of the Palm Springs Police 
Department.The gunshot victims were taken to Desert Hospital, where they were 
listed in stable condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was identified as Christopher Bernard Spears, 30, of Cathedral 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the shooting was not racially motivated and may have been 
gang-related, involving picnickers from San Bernardino, who had driven their 
low-rider show cars in a parade that preceded the park celebration, McCracken 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were having a picnic, having a good time," McCracken said. "It was 
incredible. The park was full of people, and a vehicle pulled up and (the 
occupants) began firing. At least two people from that initial vehicle were 
firing toward the visitors from the San Bernardino area. . . . One person in 
the park returned fire, and some of the visitors' vehicles returned fire." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, people in at least three cars were firing at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad part is we went up there and we got 50 different stories from 
different witnesses," McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said because of this police are uncertain how many cars the gunmen arrived 
in and what the suspects' motivation may have been.

DISNEY WAGES OWN WAR ON CRIME; SAFETY: ANAHEIM OFFICIALS PRAISE COMPANY'S 
EFFORTS. TOURISM'S VULNERABILITY TO PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF DANGER IS A KEY 
CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whether motivated by altruism, enlightened self-interest or both, the Walt 
Disney Co. has embarked on a highly visible campaign to attack the sources and 
symptoms of crime in the worst neighborhoods in this city, home to Disneyland, 
its original theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Disney officials have swapped Mighty Ducks tickets for 106 guns, 
organized a youth hockey program to give underprivileged youngsters something 
to keep them off the streets, and formed a quasi-partnership with school 
districts to provide job training and educational opportunities. They have also 
planned a massive new resort around Disneyland that would effectively give a 
face lift to some of the city's most blighted commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can with our programs to make a difference, and 
keep people moving in the right direction," said Ron Dominguez, executive vice 
president of Walt Disney Attractions. "We recognize there's a need to help our 
young people, and give them alternatives to destructive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have gotten bad enough in Anaheim for an interim police chief to liken 
it to another tourist mecca -- Miami, which has been plagued with a serious 
crime and image problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, "hardly a weekend goes by without a gang-related shooting," 
then-Chief Jimmie Kennedy wrote in a confidential memo Nov. 9 to the city 
manager about department staffing levels. "Several gang territories are within 
a mile of Disneyland. There is great potential for another Miami incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Anaheim to a city where nine tourists have been murdered is a little 
extreme, city officials said last week. After all, the city in 1992 had 63 
violent crimes per 10,000 people, compared to 373 per 10,000 in Miami. But they 
agreed that crime is Anaheim's most serious and vexing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Disney, company officials say the programs they sponsor have not been 
started out of concerns over crime, but rather because they want to be a "good 
corporate neighbor. This is nothing new to us," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Disney officials acknowledge being acutely aware of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think as citizens of any community you should do whatever can be done to 
deter crime," Dominguez said. "It should be everybody's concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Gaston, Anaheim's police chief, agreed that Disney has a tradition of 
community involvement. But, he said, "it appears they're getting much more 
involved in programs directly. . . It's something that's needed in this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston and Dominguez dismiss the notion that Anaheim is on the verge of 
becoming another Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the same conditions exist here," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more confidence in our community being able to control any real 
negative crime situations," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth contends that the crime problem can be solved, but 
recognizes that there is potential for trouble. He said the information in the 
memo by Kennedy, who had been with the department for 29 years and was chief 
from 1980 to 1988, was disconcerting. Kennedy returned from retirement while a 
search was under way to replace Chief Joseph T. Molloy, who died of a heart 
attack in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (crime problem) is something that we can't sweep under the rug," said 
Ruth, noting that in the next couple of weeks he plans to approach the Anaheim 
City Council with plans to hire 22 more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials have always been deeply concerned about crime -- and the 
public's perception of it -- in and around Disneyland. The company goes to 
great lengths to make sure that the "Happiest Place on Earth" is also one of 
the safest. 
</P>
<P>
 Security officers patrolling the park and Disneyland Hotel outnumber police 
officers patrolling the entire city. There are 382 Disneyland security officers 
responsible for about 250 acres, compared to 352 police officers covering the 
30,800 acres within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Tom Wood rates Disneyland among the safest places in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Disneyland's borders it is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a mile of the park are some of Anaheim's most crime-ridden 
neighborhoods, where gang-related shootings are not uncommon, police said. More 
than 51 gangs have been identified in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's concerns about nearby crime apparently prompted a key change in the 
proposed $3-billion expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Disney officials said they planned to have a shopping promenade 
that would be open to the public. But when the final plans were unveiled, 
Disney had put the shopping district inside the park, effectively excluding the 
public. Sources close to the project said the change was made because of crime 
concerns, but Dominguez discounted that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the expanded Anaheim complex will have guests driving directly 
from freeway off-ramps into parking structures, bypassing Anaheim's streets. 
Disney said that was designed to avoid traffic problems, not crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is not alone in its concern over crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel and motel managers are also mindful of the crime picture, and how 
it affects tourism. "It's an industrywide problem," said Ned Snavely, general 
manager of the Anaheim Marriott and board member of the Anaheim Visitor & 
Convention Bureau. "Everybody is aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
 How bad is the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials and business leaders say it is not as bad as many people, 
including Kennedy, perceive it to be. But for a community that makes its living 
on tourism, perception can be as damaging as reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim has every reason to be concerned," said John Poimiroo, director of 
the California Division of Tourism in Sacramento. "Tourism is extremely 
vulnerable to crime and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike natural disasters that disrupt the flow of tourists, such as fires or 
earthquakes, crime has a more protracted impact, he said. Tourism in Florida 
has suffered greatly because of the violence there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should be trying to protect their investments here," said Charles 
Ahlers, president of the convention bureau. "Anaheim is pretty fragile. We're 
getting competition (for tourism money) from everywhere. . . . Maybe what 
Disney is doing will start a trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlers said that tourism is always at the mercy of public perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're doing OK," he said. "Anaheim may not be the safest place in 
the world, but we're not labeled unsafe either." 
</P>
<P>
 Police acknowledge that violent crimes have increased in the city the past 10 
years. There were 11 homicides in 1983, compared to 35 in 1992 and 26 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, who was appointed police chief in January, said the city is trying to 
cope with the gang and drug problems that are plaguing many Southern California 
communities. He said that although some violent crimes have increased over the 
years, the city has experienced a drop in property crimes, theft and other 
offenses.

TRACKING A SERIAL KILLER; FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TWO YEARS, GREBES AT THE 
SALTON SEA ARE DYING MYSTERIOUSLY, AND SCIENTISTS ARE SEEKING CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Biologists and bird lovers are helplessly witnessing Act II of one of the 
state's biggest environmental mysteries of recent years: What is killing the 
eared grebes of the Salton Sea? 
</P>
<P>
 Upward of 700 of the small migratory birds have been found dead in the past 
week on the shores of the Salton Sea, California's largest and most polluted 
body of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago at this time of year, the carcasses of 150,000 grebes were 
recovered over several weeks and scientists were never able to pinpoint a cause 
for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same bird and the same mystery," Clark Bloom, manager of the Salton 
Sea National Wildlife Refuge, said Friday. Wildlife biologists have been 
scooping up the lifeless forms by the shovelful and sending samples to the 
National Wildlife Health and Research Center in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 A scientific strike team of veterinarians, pathologists and infection 
specialists, backed by bird specialists from Sea World in San Diego and San 
Diego State University, is determined to break the case this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that we can use what we learned last time as a starting point 
and finally find an answer," said Lynn Creekmore, a veterinarian with the 
research laboratory, which is run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Creekmore said the investigation is centering on three possible culprits: 
biotoxins such as algae or plankton, contaminants such as heavy metals or 
pesticides, and avian cholera. Botulism has been ruled out after initial tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes of the case range beyond just providing answers to the whodunit 
aspects of what biologists call a "significant die-off." 
</P>
<P>
 If the birds are found to have died because of something in the Salton Sea, it 
could prove to be a grim turning point in the sea's environmental misfortunes. 
The Salton Sea, 35 miles long and 15 miles wide, serves as an agricultural sump 
for Imperial County and a depository for the fetid New River from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Smelly in summer and an ominous chocolate color all year round, the sea has 
experienced a drastic decline in tourism and recreation in the past decade, 
leaving campgrounds nearly empty and marinas and motels bankrupt. Signs posted 
here warn people to eat only limited quantities of Salton Sea fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the economic impact, any indication that the sea is killing grebes 
could also limit its future as part of the Pacific Flyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The grebes are among dozens of species that use the Salton Sea and its marshes 
as a stopover on their way from their winter roosting spots around the Sea of 
Cortez to their nesting spots in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the dead birds were found to have elevated levels of selenium, 
arsenic, mercury, zinc and chromium, possibly from agricultural pesticides that 
drain into the Salton Sea. Still, scientists decided that the heavy metals were 
not concentrated enough to cause death. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the possibility that the Salton Sea killed the birds is being 
considered, there is a chance that the birds died because of something they 
consumed at their winter home on the Sea of Cortez, or that such die-offs are 
acts of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be that there have always been die-offs but they just occurred in 
remote areas and we weren't aware of them," said Susan Saul, spokeswoman for 
the Fish and Wildlife Service regional office in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 One estimate puts the current number of grebes at Salton Sea at 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is killing the birds is also apparently driving them mad in the 
process. Bizarre, un-grebe-like behavior is being spotted among grebes on the 
Salton Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding grebes onshore is very unusual," said refuge biologist Mary 
Hunnicutt. "They're picking at their feathers and actually pulling them out. 
That's not normal."

BLACK AGENTS' CLASS-ACTION BIAS COMPLAINT AGAINST INS OKD; DISCRIMINATION: THE 
IMMIGRATION AGENCY'S AFRICAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES CLAIM THEY WERE PASSED OVER FOR 
PROMOTIONS AND KEPT IN SECOND-RATE JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that originated with Los Angeles-based agents, a judge has ruled 
that more than 500 African American officers of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service may proceed with a national class-action complaint 
alleging that the agency discriminated against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative ruling clears the path for what officials and attorneys 
describe as probably the largest-ever case charging a federal agency with 
discrimination against its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS complaint -- which dramatizes the paucity of African Americans in the 
upper echelons of federal law enforcement -- is believed to involve more 
officers than two previous high-profile cases against the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation by African American and Latino agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS, like the FBI, is part of the Justice Department, whose wide-ranging 
responsibilities include enforcement of civil rights laws banning 
discrimination. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno is said to be eager to dispose of the 
embarrassing INS bias complaint, but settlement discussions have made little 
headway. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, black INS officers contend, they have been repeatedly passed over 
for promotions, ghettoized in second-rate jobs and subjected to a "racially 
hostile" work environment, including derogatory comments and unequal imposition 
of discipline. The Los Angeles agents who spearheaded the complaint also 
alleged that they suffered retribution -- including, in one case, offensive 
letters mailed to an agent's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling delivered to attorneys Feb. 18, administrative law Judge Jane 
Goodman, who sits in Los Angeles, certified the case as a national class action 
covering all black officers in the INS, including others who have left the 
service. That action expanded the matter well beyond the initial group of INS 
criminal investigators. The judge took no position on the agents' assertion of 
institutional bias, which may be dealt with at a later hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman ruled on behalf of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an 
independent federal body that investigates bias allegations. The black agents' 
complaint is pending before the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are seeking unspecified amounts of back pay and damages -- 
possibly exceeding $50 million, according to their attorney -- along with 
promotions, reassignments and a wide-ranging overhaul of INS hiring, training 
and staff development policies. The discrimination allegations date back to 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials have not commented on whether there is discrimination in 
their ranks. But authorities have acknowledged disparities in the posting of 
African Americans to upper-level positions.

 In a report released in June, an INS task force found "significant 
underrepresentation" of blacks in supervisory and managerial slots. The report 
cited a "good old boy system" that benefited white males, and a perception of 
racism, nepotism and preferential treatment. Racial divisions had sparked a 
"hostile and volatile" environment in the Los Angeles district INS office, the 
report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the INS named African Americans to several high-level managerial 
slots -- including chief of the asylum office in New York and deputy Border 
Patrol positions in El Paso and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But John J. Washington, a senior special agent in Los Angeles who is spokesman 
for the black immigration officers alleging discrimination, called those 
promotions "window dressing" designed to disguise deeply ingrained inequities. 
</P>
<P>
 He and David L. Ross, the Los Angeles attorney who represents the agents, 
urged the government to reform INS personnel procedures and act to settle the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials said they were reviewing the judge's ruling, but 
declined to comment on its merits or their intentions. The agency has tried to 
diversify its management structure and improve response to discrimination 
complaints, said Duke Austin, an INS spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he acknowledged that there are only 44 African American Border Patrol 
agents -- including only three supervisors -- among the 4,000 officers 
nationwide. Those numbers are especially significant because the Border Patrol 
is considered a career-building path within the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the agency, African Americans represent more than 11% of its 17,000 
full-time workers, but they occupy fewer than 6% of the best-paying positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS bias case began in late 1992, when 19 Los Angeles-based criminal 
investigators filed the initial complaint. But the judge's decision greatly 
expands the number of job categories covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman ruled that the complaint covered the INS' entire national uniformed 
black "officer corps" -- encompassing up to 560 criminal investigators, Border 
Patrol agents, inspectors, detention guards, deportation officers and 
examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the judge ruled, an unknown number of former INS workers may have 
also suffered from bias. Those former employees, combined with clerical and 
other lower-level black INS workers wrongly denied promotions into the officer 
corps or dissuaded from applying, could add several hundred more plaintiffs, 
according to Ross, the officers' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials have 30 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 If the service does not contest the judge's ruling, the stage would be set for 
an administrative hearing later this year on the merits of the discrimination 
claim.

BOSNIAN-CROATIAN TALKS GET UNDER WAY IN WASHINGTON; DIPLOMACY: ON THE TABLE IS 
A U.S.-BACKED PROPOSAL TO CREATE A MUSLIM-CROAT STATE. BUT INITIAL DISCUSSIONS 
PRODUCE NO AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Negotiators from Bosnia-Herzegovina and neighboring Croatia began talks 
Saturday on a U.S.-sponsored plan to end the Bosnian civil war and reported a 
promising start but no immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a goodwill and a desire on both sides to make progress," the prime 
minister of Bosnia's Muslim-led government, Haris Silajdzic, said after a day 
of meetings at the State Department. "We hope we are on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks included officials representing the Bosnian government, Bosnia's 
minority of Roman Catholic Croats and the Croatian government -- but not 
neighboring Serbia or the Bosnian Serbs who have seized more than two-thirds of 
Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 On the table is a U.S.-backed plan under which Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian 
Croats would create a joint multiethnic state in about half of the country, 
seek some kind of federation with the Bosnian Serbs and build an economic union 
with Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good, serious discussion -- but no deal yet," a senior State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who led his country's delegation, said 
there was "a really good atmosphere (and) serious negotiations." Asked whether 
the talks will succeed, he replied: "It is impossible to tell now." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked the parties to come to Washington 
to work on the proposal after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization succeeded 
in stopping the artillery shelling of Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very special moment; we need to build on the cease-fire and success 
we've had in Sarajevo," Christopher told the negotiators Saturday, according to 
a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and his aides believe that a Bosnian-Croatian deal could be the 
key to an overall peace in Bosnia, because it would strengthen the position of 
the Muslim-led Bosnian government in negotiations with the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Washington talks must first resolve the basic issue that has already 
produced a year of bitter combat between Muslims and Croats: Will the Croats of 
Bosnia live in a Muslim-majority Bosnian state? Will they get a separate 
ministate? Or will they join the larger republic of Croatia next door? 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia's president, Franjo Tudjman, has long sought to annex Croat-populated 
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many Bosnian Croats also support annexation, but 
not all do. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's government, which is led by Muslims but also includes some Croats and 
Serbs, rejects any partition of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-backed proposal seeks to solve that dilemma through a complicated, 
three-step process. First the Muslims and Croats would join to create something 
diplomats call the "Bosnian Bicommunal Entity," a federal state with as many as 
10 county-sized "cantons." The BBE, as negotiators call it for short, would 
cover about half of Bosnia's prewar territory, including Sarajevo. It would 
have a Muslim majority but strong protection for its Croatian and Serbian 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 As a second step, the BBE would negotiate peace with the Bosnian Serbs and 
accept their rule over about half of Bosnia. The Muslim-led government insists 
that the two halves of the country must not be divided, but how they would be 
joined remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as a third step, the Muslim-Croat BBE would join neighboring Croatia 
in an economic union with open borders but would remain a separate country -- 
roughly the way the countries of Western Europe have joined in the European 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government has already accepted the basic proposal -- but Croatia 
has wavered, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really a moment of choice for Croatia," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Croatia supports the proposal, the United States will help mobilize Western 
economic aid for the Zagreb government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Croatia obstructs the U.S.-favored solution, the United States will 
consider seeking U.N. economic sanctions against the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they expect the discussions to continue all day today and to 
conclude Monday morning.

<P>
 The Security Council on Saturday postponed for a second day condemnation of 
Friday's massacre of Palestinians by an Israeli at a Hebron mosque.Disagreement 
over the text of a resolution was cited as the reason for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will make another attempt to draft a resolution Monday, diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continued for much of Saturday among the United States, the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and diplomats from Islamic countries. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed earlier that the council will work on a resolution, rather than 
just a statement. A resolution carries greater weight.

GASOLINE SMUGGLING FUELS HAITI DEFIANCE; CARIBBEAN: PETROL IS TRANSPORTED 
OPENLY FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. ACTIVITY SEVERELY WEAKENS INTERNATIONAL 
EMBARGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In daylight, every 30 minutes or so, a tiny wooden rowboat makes a half-mile 
trip across the lake here. At night, the sound of oars slapping the water is 
replaced by the resonating roar of large trucks on the bordering road. The 
boats and trucks are carrying over the plasma that is keeping Haiti alive for 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats and trucks are smuggling gasoline from the Dominican Republic in 
open defiance of an international embargo designed to punish Haiti's military 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Handmade and badly leaking, the boats come across the Etang Saumatere, which 
appropriately means "brackish lake" in the local language, while the trucks 
take a paved highway. They meet at a border post here at Malpasse -- which 
means "bad crossing" -- where soldiers on both sides extract heavy payment for 
letting the illicit cargo through. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats' contribution is small -- each carries 20 to 50 gallons of gasoline 
in plastic bottles and jerrycans every trip -- but they are symbolic of the 
military government's easy and open defiance of the world trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks' contribution, on the other hand, is massive. They are often large 
enough to haul 10,000 gallons of fuel at a time. At current prices, each gallon 
is worth more than $6. 
</P>
<P>
 However it comes, the gasoline has allowed Haiti's hard-line military to ward 
off the world's demand that they restore to power Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the 
president they drove from the country more than 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They actually have increased the supply of gasoline in the last month," one 
foreign fuel expert said. "It is not back to normal, but they're getting enough 
to keep things going to one degree or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company technicians estimate that Haiti is now smuggling in about 25% of 
the fuel that it imported legally before the embargo, which went into effect in 
mid-October after the military reneged on an agreement to allow Aristide back. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it is coming in from the neighboring Dominican Republic, which, experts 
say, purchased at least 15% more fuel in 1993 than it did in 1992 to meet the 
Haitian demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that has been transshipped to Haiti," one oil expert said. "The 
amazing thing is that increase took place entirely after October" -- meaning, 
he explained, that several hundred thousand barrels of fuel have made it here 
during a time when as many as 22 warships have blockaded the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is the Dominican government's and military's willingness to ignore the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominican officials openly declare their opposition to the boycott, even 
though they voted for the sanctions in the Organization of American States and 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, the profits are so great that they are risking the anger of the 
Americans," a diplomat said. "The day after (U.S. Ambassador William) Swing 
flew to Santo Domingo to protest, the smuggling increased." 
</P>
<P>
 And it continues to expand. So much was brought in last week that the price 
fell 30% in two days, from $9 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic jams are back in Port-au-Prince, commerce was restored to a limited 
degree, and electrical power has expanded -- neighborhoods limited to two or 
three hours of electricity until a day or two ago were enjoying power all 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is amazing enough given the weight of the embargo, but it is 
especially awesome given that a gigantic fire earlier this month destroyed 
nearly all of the area where the black-market gasoline was stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two days of the fire, a new storage and sales area was set up on a main 
highway on Port-au-Prince's north side. Today the fuel market resembles an 
amiable riot, choked with trucks and cars lining up to buy gasoline from 
dozens, perhaps hundreds, of vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some is sold in one-gallon plastic containers to people with little money. 
Much is pumped out of barrels into the tanks of the big jeeps favored by 
Haiti's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it is done openly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks these people are just dumb brutes," a diplomat said of the 
Haitian military, "but this fuel business shows that they are resourceful and 
certainly stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
 And rich. According to experts, the smugglers pay about $1.90 a gallon in the 
Dominican Republic. They pay an equal amount to officers of that country for 
permission to cross the border, leaving the rest as profit for the soldiers who 
control the whole business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in spite of the availability of the fuel, in the long run it is "a 
mug's game," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only ones getting rich are the military and the civilians who are 
permitted to share in the largess. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people interviewed for this story, even some who have bitterly 
opposed Aristide's return, agree that the embargo has been disastrous for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford to keep this up," one industrialist said. "I bought enough 
(fuel) to finish my existing orders. But I lose $3 for every gallon I buy. So I 
am shutting down next month." 
</P>
<P>
 Another businessman said commerce is being so badly damaged that it may never 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not elicit any sympathy from the military, said the industrialist, 
whose family has backed the army from the day of the Sept. 30, 1991, coup 
through the resulting economic calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care," he said. "They are getting rich, and they think they have 
beaten the embargo, that the United States can't or won't stop them. They have 
so much money themselves that they pay no attention to us."

HIRED GUNMAN PROBABLY KILLED FEMALE PARLIAMENTARIAN IN FRANCE, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hired gunman most probably killed a female parliamentarian who spearheaded a 
campaign against Mafia drug traffickers in southern France, investigators said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yann Piat of the centrist UDF party, junior partner in the 11-month-old ruling 
coalition, was murdered Friday evening on her way home in the town of Hyeres, 
east of Toulon. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman riding on a motorcycle drew level with her car and first shot her 
driver, wounding him in the leg, and then fired two bullets at Piat, who died 
instantly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the murder of the 44-year-old Piat, who in recent months 
had taken an outspoken stand against drug addiction and traffickers in her 
region, was the work of a paid professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances of the murder make us think very strongly of a contract 
killing," Andre Ride, public prosecutor in Toulon, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have reported that Mafia-style gangs are active in the area, 
trafficking in drugs as well as laundering their money through local casinos 
and nightclubs.

ENCOURAGED BY NORTH KOREAN MOVE, CLINTON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton said Saturday that he is pleased by an agreement to allow 
U.N. inspectors to examine some of North Korea's nuclear facilities, but Senate 
Republican leader Bob Dole accused Clinton of giving up too much in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged," Clinton told reporters. "I want to see the details, but I'm 
encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, a Kansas Republican, charged Clinton with "pussyfooting" on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons effort. "They won't let us inspect two 
sites," he complained. "We're talking about . . . more carrots for North 
Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the U.S.-North Korea deal, completed Friday, the Communist regime in 
Pyongyang agreed to allow a U.N. team to begin inspecting its seven 
acknowledged nuclear facilities on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the inspections begin, the United States will commit itself to a new 
round of high-level political talks and call off its "Team Spirit" military 
exercise with South Korea -- two conditions sought by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, North and South Korea will set new talks at the border village of 
Panmunjom to prepare for renewed reconciliation negotiations between the two 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department confirmed those details of the agreement, which the North 
Korean negotiator revealed earlier -- but it made a point of saying that they 
all depend on the U.N. inspections getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying: Hold it, there's a big contingency here," a senior State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to talk about the other stuff until the inspections have 
started." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is still seeking inspections of two other suspected nuclear 
sites that North Korea has not publicly acknowledged. Those sites were not 
included in the agreement reached last week. Clinton met with his national 
security advisers at the White House on Saturday to discuss the next steps on 
the issue, a presidential aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, in an interview on CNN, said he was not satisfied with the President's 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at North Korea; you know, we've been pussyfooting around there for a 
long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk about inspections; they won't let us inspect two sites. We don't 
know if they have the bomb or not," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officials have said that North Korea may already have one or two nuclear 
devices made with plutonium from its atomic reactors, but U.S. intelligence has 
not confirmed the existence of any weapons there.

 President Clinton wasn't telling Saturday whether he noticed the streaker that 
his motorcade passed on the way back to the White House after a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man, who had been playing rugby in a downtown park, stripped 
down to a stocking cap and running shoes. He then took off at a jog, heading 
straight toward the presidential motorcade, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his return to the White House, Clinton was asked by reporters if he liked 
the rugby game and if he had any plans to go jogging. His only response was a 
grin.

CLINTON CITES SLAIN POLICE IN TALK ON CRIME; LEGISLATION: PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
MURDERED LAPD OFFICER, PRESIDENT SAYS CONGRESS SHOULD PASS SWEEPING PROPOSAL. 
IT IS STALLED IN THE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton paid tribute Saturday to Christy Lynne Hamilton, an LAPD 
officer killed during her first week on the job, saying her death and those of 
other police officers are evidence that "we need a new crime bill that is both 
tough and smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made his comments during his weekly radio address, which he delivered 
from a Washington police district office near the site where another officer, 
25-year-old Jason White, was killed in the line of duty two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The President noted that Hamilton had put off her dream of becoming a police 
officer until after she raised her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was 45 years old when she earned her badge in Los Angeles just last 
week," Clinton said. "She said then the only thing she was afraid of was not 
doing a good job. No one else thought that was a possibility. She was voted the 
most inspirational person in her police academy class." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was shot to death last Tuesday -- four days after completing her 
training -- by a 17-year-old who had killed his father earlier during an 
argument over loud music. The youth opened fire on police as they arrived at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a three-year veteran of the Washington police force, was shot six times 
point-blank as he attempted to question a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Their deaths, Clinton said, should spur Congress to complete action on a 
sweeping anti-crime bill that would put 100,000 more officers on the street, 
ban assault weapons, broaden the use of the death penalty and impose tougher 
sentencing on repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has been passed by the Senate but is stalled in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "These brave officers and their other fallen comrades across our nation left 
behind people who loved them, respected them and looked up to them," Clinton 
said. "For them, their relatives, their friends, their co-workers, for all the 
people in this country who deserve protection, Congress must move to make our 
streets, our schools and our workplaces safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that the handgun-control measure known as the Brady bill goes 
into effect on Monday, and he contended that it will prevent "thousands of 
handgun murders." The measure will require handgun purchasers to undergo 
background checks and a five-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the GOP response to Clinton's address, Idaho Sen. Larry E. Craig 
accused congressional Democrats of putting too much emphasis on gun control and 
not enough on putting away criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people, including our President, want to make gun control the main, if 
not the sole focus of crime legislation. And that's too bad, because all the 
gun control laws in the world won't prevent violent criminals from having and 
using them," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pains me to say it, but many members of the President's party are 
resisting tough measures this nation needs to put away the repeat offenders who 
commit violent crimes," he said. "Rather than taking a tough stand, many of 
them end up coddling the criminal."

 With President Clinton's health care proposal under heavy fire in Congress and 
no other comprehensive alternative emerging so far to take its place, there is 
an increasing likelihood that lawmakers will turn toward the 
less-than-comprehensive reforms that Clinton has vowed to veto. 
</P>
<P>
 As key committees prepare to begin their work in earnest, there is growing 
speculation that Congress may pass only insurance market reforms and a 
watered-down measure to extend coverage to some of the 38 million uninsured 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, Clinton will be left with a difficult choice: Make good on 
his threat to veto any bill that does not provide coverage to everyone, or take 
what he can get and declare victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting to the point where everyone realizes that you just can't fake it 
anymore," said one Democratic congressional aide, conceding that the chances of 
a thorough overhaul of the health care system are growing smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't count the President out, warned senior White House adviser George 
Stephanopoulos. For now, he said, Clinton is content to let Congress do its 
"legislative handiwork" while he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton continue 
campaigning for universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say such a hands-off strategy may doom the drive for 
comprehensive reform, but not Stephanopoulos. "I don't think anybody knows 
exactly how it's going to turn out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusing the situation is the fact that several committees in both the House 
and the Senate will prepare competing versions of health care reform 
legislation, which will somehow have to be reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Ways and Means health subcommittee, which is scheduled to begin 
drafting its version of a health care bill this week, appears certain to reject 
the Clinton plan's provision forcing most Americans to get their coverage 
through mandatory purchasing alliances. It is by means of these alliances that 
Clinton plans to achieve many of his goals, including containment of health 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But subcommittee Chairman Pete Stark (D-Oakland) has flatly declared the 
alliances dead, and other lawmakers say they view them as unworkable, forcing 
too much government intrusion into the health care system. If the alliances are 
to exist at all, many argue, membership in them should be voluntary and they 
should have no regulatory powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan could face even tougher going in the Energy and Commerce health 
subcommittee, which is headed by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). Although 
Waxman is squarely behind the Clinton plan, the moderate and conservative 
Democrats who populate the subcommittee are balking at two of its other 
pillars: requiring employers to provide health coverage for their workers and 
imposing price controls on health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will it all lead? 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a clue in the effort of two members of Waxman's panel, J. Roy 
Rowland (D-Ga.) and Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.), who plan to introduce what they 
describe as the only health legislation on which there is truly a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 It cobbles together elements of the Clinton plan and the major alternatives 
written by various members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Its features include allowing workers to take their health insurance with them 
when they leave a job, reining in malpractice lawsuits, forcing insurance 
companies to provide coverage to people with known health problems, making it 
easier for small businesses to pool their resources to purchase insurance for 
their workers and putting more emphasis on preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 In this lowest-common-denominator approach, there would generally be a lot 
less government involvement in the health care system: no requirement that 
employers or individuals buy insurance, no premium caps to bring health care 
costs under control and no major changes in the tax code to encourage health 
consumers to buy more economical plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Waxman said he has not given up hope of a more far-reaching bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ways to develop a consensus is to get legislation moving," he 
said. "As bills start moving forward, the various groups that have been 
posturing up to now will have to start to figure out what they will support, 
and not merely to stand in opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the President's allies say they see opportunity in the apparent 
disarray among the congressional committees. "What's good now is that we know 
where we need to work," said Linda Lipsen of the Consumers Union, which 
dispatched a small army of its lobbyists to Capitol Hill last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The unsettled situation in the House has also thrown off political 
calculations in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a presumption that you could get all of the President's bill 
through the House of Representatives, and that the Senate might want to pick at 
it somehow," said Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., the Senate Finance Committee's 
Democratic chief of staff. Now, he said, it is beginning to appear that the 
House "can't deliver half." 
</P>
<P>
 But that should not be viewed as a defeat for Clinton, he said. "It might 
start to look like much less to the (Administration aides) who designed this 
massive piece of legislation, but to me, it still and will always look like 
much more than we ever could have expected to do before Bill Clinton became 
President and made this Congress' major job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) seemed to 
take the same view in an interview last week with USA Today. "We're going to 
give it a helluva try," Rostenkowski said. "We'll do as much as we possibly 
can, and whatever that is, it'll be a giant step in the direction of getting 
ultimately a bill similar to what the President wants us to get." 
</P>
<P>
 But if that turns out to be "half a loaf" this year, Rostenkowski added, he 
would advise Clinton: "Don't go around criticizing Congress and kicking the 
sand and looking down and saying: 'Aw, shucks, I didn't get all I want.' I'd go 
out in the Rose Garden with a pen, sign it and say, 'Boy, this is a big 
victory.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That is precisely the sort of speculation that Clinton must squelch, Waxman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has said that he will not let us get away with something that 
does not provide as a bottom-line universal coverage," he said. "It is so 
important that the President make it clear, as he did in the most forceful 
language possible in the State of the Union Address, that he will not accept 
that, and that if members of Congress think they can go home with half a loaf 
that the President will agree to, they are mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman conceded that a stripped-down health bill could have some political 
appeal for lawmakers seeking to dodge the difficult choices that lie ahead. But 
he insisted that it would not solve the nation's central health care problem, 
which is that 38 million people remain out of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and its allies continue to insist that they can recoup any 
losses that are dealt them by the half a dozen or so committees that have 
jurisdiction over all or part of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opportunity, they say, will come in April or May, when the committees 
are through with their work and the Democratic leadership of both houses knits 
together a compromise version to take to the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What counts is that the major pieces (of Clinton's plan) are reported out by 
one committee or another," one Administration strategist said. "We feel there 
are champions of all the major pieces somewhere in that mix. So there's a real 
reason for some confidence that all the pieces of the plan are going to be on 
the table at conference." 
</P>
<P>
 But before health reform can get to that stage, it will have to survive 
several months of pummeling in a series of committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the Gettysburg of political battles. I'm hoping it doesn't 
become the Verdun," said Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.), a member of Waxman's 
subcommittee. The historical metaphor was a telling one: Gettysburg was a 
turning point in the Civil War, while Verdun is remembered as the most 
senseless blood bath of World War I.

VIOLENT CRIME MAY BE DOWN, BUT THE USE OF FIREARMS IS UP 
</P>

 Violent crime has decreased over the last decade, but criminals are 
increasingly more likely to be armed with guns, the Justice Department reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Offenses committed with firearms rose from 9.2% of crimes in 1979 to 12.7% in 
1992, according to the department's national crime victimization survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans experience an average of 6.7 million violent crimes -- rapes, 
robberies and assaults -- each year. The annual number of violent crimes 
involving firearms averaged about 858,000 from 1987 to 1992, said the report, 
which was released by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI reported 16,000 firearm murders in 1992, and the number of all violent 
crimes with firearms reported to the FBI grew 55% from 1987 to 1992, from 
365,709 to 565,575, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Data for the report was collected from national surveys of households and 
prisons and from information that the FBI receives from more than 17,000 law 
enforcement agencies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987 to 1992, victims faced armed offenders in 5.1 million violent 
incidents and in 85,453 murders and non-negligent homicides. In just under 1 
million of these incidents, 880,000 people were injured and 85,000 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of state prison inmates revealed that 16% were carrying firearms 
while committing the crime that put them behind bars, the report said. Half 
said they fired the weapon during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three percent of state prisoners who used guns in their crimes and had 
previous records bought their weapons from retail stores, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of prison inmates who obtained guns illegally said they did so 
to avoid background checks or waiting periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said 91% of the 415 law enforcement officers murdered from 
1987 to 1992 were killed with firearms.

ESPIONAGE REMAINS AN INTERNATIONAL REALITY, EXPERTS SAY; INTELLIGENCE: SPYING 
IS EXPECTED TO GO ON AFTER FUROR OVER CIA OFFICER'S ARREST ABATES. LAWMAKER 
SAYS IT IS FOR U.S. SAFETY. 
</P>

<P>
 The outrage expressed by U.S. officials after the arrest of a top CIA officer 
on charges of spying for the Kremlin obscures a basic rule of international 
espionage: The distinction between friends and foes can get fuzzy in the 
twilight world where intelligence agencies work. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the furor surrounding suspected double agent Aldrich H. Ames dies 
down, officials say, espionage will go on essentially unchanged because that's 
the way all sides want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that we have a lot of experience with friendly countries 
spying on each other," said Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a senior 
member of the House Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that it would be a big mistake for the United States to agree to stop 
spying on countries like Russia in exchange for a pledge by them to stop 
targeting their espionage on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do it to protect ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Russia's foreign intelligence chief, Yevgeny Primakov, made such an 
offer, saying that the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, successor to the 
Soviet KGB, would stop spying against any country "if their intelligence 
agencies say they will stop their activities in my country." 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA rejected the bargain, according to well-informed sources. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior U.S. intelligence official said the United States was not 
interested in concluding a gentlemen's agreement with Primakov because "one of 
them is not a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges that the former Soviet Union and then Russia was paying vast sums 
of money to Ames has produced waves of outrage, especially on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's government is -- at the very 
least -- guilty of ingratitude for accepting U.S. aid to shore up a rickety 
economy while diverting funds to pay for a CIA mole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that, given the high level of assistance that Russia has sought 
from our nation and other donors, they found this money to pay for their 
spying," said Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee. "The Administration needs to assure the American 
people that U.S. assistance did not, somehow, permit this operation to continue 
long after Russia should have shut it down on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Saturday that Americans "don't 
understand why we give aid on the one hand and allow this to happen on the 
other. They thought we had a new relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole suggested during an interview on CNN's "Evans & Novak" program that the 
right course might be to "suspend the aid for a while and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Friday that he has urged the lawmakers "to resist calls 
to reduce or suspend our assistance for reform in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aid, he said, "does not flow from a sense of charity or blind faith. Our 
policy is based on clear American interests clearly pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Yeltsin's government has sought to brazen it out, asserting that 
espionage is a fact of international life. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans like Ames "work for us, our people work for them," said Mikhail N. 
Poltoranin, one of Yeltsin's top advisers. "Intelligence is intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but "this would not be the week for Yeltsin to ask for new credits," 
said George Carver, former deputy director of the CIA. "But in due course it 
will quiet down." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Carver said the United States must do everything it can to 
protect itself from the spies of other countries, whether enemies or friends. 
But he said it would be useless for Washington to negotiate reciprocal no-spy 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any agreements would not be honored," he said. "We do not live in that kind 
of world. We may have iron-clad agreements with the French, but that does not 
prevent them from bugging the hotel rooms of businessmen to discover our 
industrial secrets. The same goes for the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need agreements where everybody gets gooey-eyed," he said. "What we 
have to do is say if you step on our toe, we're going to kick you in the shin." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) agreed that 
counterespionage is essentially a law enforcement problem. Spying is a crime 
and spies should be caught and punished, he said, adding that the sponsoring 
government must also pay a price. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said governments should examine their intelligence operations to 
determine whether the information they are getting is worth the risk of 
exposure. He said the Russians probably did not do that when they decided to 
put Ames on their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spying is high-risk," he said. "You only do it when you need to know for your 
survival. When the Cold War was on and (nuclear) weapons were directed against 
us, it was very important to know what was going on in the Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say if the United States maintains spies in Moscow today, but 
when he was reminded that the nuclear weapons remain in Russian hands and it 
would be important for the United States to know what Moscow plans to do with 
the arms, he replied: "Exactly."

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS INSIST ECONOMY IS STABILIZING; SUMMIT: GROUP OF SEVEN 
FINANCIAL LEADERS ARE SKEPTICAL. BUT THEY'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Meeting with financial leaders from the world's biggest industrial 
democracies, Russia's economic policy-makers Saturday insisted that they are 
committed to reforms and have policies that can stabilize the country's runaway 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the finance ministers and central bankers from the so-called Group of 
Seven who heard the Russians' presentation voiced skepticism that the ambitious 
goals can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the G-7 ministers gave a cautiously optimistic projection 
that Europe may soon follow the United States out of one of the worst 
recessions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, at a separate, bilateral meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
and Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii talked for about an hour but 
failed to make any headway in resolving the issues that have led to a major 
trade dispute between their two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main focus of Saturday's G-7 meeting was on the Russian reform process 
and the obstacles that threaten it in the wake of last December's parliamentary 
elections -- elections that saw proponents of a free-market economy trounced by 
ultranationalists and former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a narrow sense, Saturday's meeting was about world lending agencies 
releasing more of the $44-billion Russian aid package approved by the Group of 
Seven heads of government last year in Tokyo. That assistance is linked to 
progress both in reforming Russia's huge, obsolete, state-owned industrial 
sector and in stabilizing key economic factors such as dangerously high 
inflation and growing budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the larger context, the very future of Russia itself and, with it, the 
stability and security of the West depend in part on the ability of the major 
industrial democracies and key international lending institutions to work with 
Moscow to nurture reform yet avoid political explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-hour meeting held at a large villa in the Taunus Mountains north 
of Frankfurt, the three key figures in control of Russia's economic future -- 
Finance Minister Sergei Dubinin, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander N. Shokhin and 
the chairman of the Russian Central Bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko -- told the 
G-7 ministers and central bankers that the present government will be able to 
limit the federal budget deficit to 5% of gross domestic product this year and 
cut inflation from the present rate of about 23% a month to less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sure that by the end of the year, inflation will be below 10% per month 
(and) a more realistic figure would be 7% to 9%," Dubinin told reporters after 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Shokhin did, however, refer to "a difficult political situation" in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 With many of Russia's radical reformers swept from power, some respected 
Western economists have predicted just the opposite -- a slide into 
hyper-inflation as the pressure for change stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 While the G-7 representatives urged the Russians to press forward with reforms 
launched prior to last December's parliamentary elections, they were clearly 
unconvinced by the assurances they received Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, considering where they are now, that's an ambitious goal," Bentsen 
said after the meeting, shaking his head skeptically as he spoke. "They've got 
some tough judgments to arrive at." 
</P>
<P>
 German Bundesbank Chairman Hans Tietmeyer said he was encouraged by the 
presentation but remained unsure if the goals can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the impression they are trying, but the question is if the political 
structures will allow them to succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a formal statement, the G-7 representatives also: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tried to nudge the International Monetary Fund and the Russian government to 
work more closely to improve the flow of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who played an important role in 
formulating initial post-Communist economic reforms in Poland, said recently 
that of the $17 billion in loans pledged to Russia last year via the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, only $2 billion had been 
dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The IMF failed miserably in advising the Group of Seven countries and the 
Yeltsin administration on Russia's financial reconstruction," Sachs wrote last 
month in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to support a new, substantial debt-rescheduling agreement for Russia 
but emphasized the need for Moscow to meet all remaining debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Noted that enhanced trade access for Russian manufactured goods abroad is an 
essential part of the G-7's reform strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Shokhin accused the West of building what he called a new 
Iron Curtain around Russia by refusing to purchase Russian goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 ministers were also cautiously upbeat about the global economy, 
indicating that one of the worst recessions since World War II has most likely 
reached its ebb. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was overall agreement that the worst of the recession . . . is now over 
and that in some areas, recovery is under way," commented German Finance 
Ministry spokesman Christian Kastrop. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment was based largely on renewed growth in the United States, hopes 
for a Japanese stimulus package and German government estimates that the 
downturn in Europe's largest, bellwether economy has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 German Finance Minister Theo Waigel told the meeting that the German economy 
will return to growth this year, with unemployment peaking at its present 
postwar high of just over 4 million and total gross domestic product expected 
to rise by as much as 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, Germany's inflation rate will most likely drop from 
its present 3.4% level to below 3% by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 While some independent analysts have accused the German government of overly 
optimistic forecasts to boost its image in a crucial election year, Waigel 
strenuously defended his projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMF also urged Japan, in the throes of its own deep recession, to extend a 
$145-billion fiscal stimulus package beyond the present year and pressed Tokyo 
to open its domestic markets more to foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. Treasury Department official said nothing resembling a 
breakthrough came during the hourlong Bentsen-Fujii meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Japan "gave no indication" that it is ready to move on its trade 
impasse with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That dispute is fueled largely by the continued difficulties encountered by 
American companies trying to penetrate Japanese markets and by a U.S. trade 
deficit with Japan that last year hit $60 billion.

WILSON'S MOST GENEROUS BACKER SAYS HE JUST WANTS GOP IN POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Sam Bamieh says Gov. Pete Wilson is a bit too liberal for his tastes, but you 
would never know by the way the Bay Area businessman spends his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh last year was Wilson's most generous contributor, donating $85,000 in 
two checks to the governor's reelection campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh (pronounced Bam'-ee-ay) says he is a die-hard Republican and figures 
that Wilson is the best hope the GOP has of retaining the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fondness is for the Republican Party and not for Governor Wilson, and the 
governor knows it," Bamieh, 55, said in an interview. "I'd rather see a 
Republican in office any day before a Democrat. It's enough that we lost the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh in 1992 gave $287,800 to the national Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh, a native of Jerusalem, said he came to California at 17 and attended 
Sacramento State University, where he earned an MBA. He worked in the finance 
departments of Varian Associates and Spreckels Sugar Co. before starting his 
firm, American Intertrade Group, in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his company is an international real estate developer and financial 
consultant. He declined to reveal the extent of his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh said he asks for nothing and expects nothing from Wilson in return for 
his contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do no business for the state of California," he said. "I'm not looking for 
any assignment by the governor or for any political position." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, he said, would make a "great governor, with some modifications." For 
one thing, he said, he wishes that the governor were more conservative on 
fiscal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh served briefly this year as finance chairman for the California 
Republican Party and said he quit after a dispute with the chairman, Tirso del 
Junco. Bamieh said one reason he gave the money to Wilson was that he has vowed 
to make no further contributions to the state party as long as Del Junco 
remains chairman. 
</P>

 "I know the economic freedoms we have in America are what made our country 
great," he said. "I want to show my appreciation for my country and put my 
money where my mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I don't gamble, I don't womanize, and I don't drink. I have had one 
wife for 30 years and I have two children born in Sacramento. I'm going to 
retire and die in California. What happens to California affects me and my 
family."

MAN'S HOME BURNS 2 WEEKS AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>

 First came the bullets, slamming into Robert Lee Johnson's leg and foot two 
weeks ago as he watched videos in the living room of his rented house in 
Norwalk. Then, at 4 a.m. Saturday, a firebomb exploded on his front porch, 
burning down the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The flames sent Johnson, 40, his wife, Camilla Green, and seven of their 
children and grandchildren, ages 2 to 22, running into the night. Johnson said 
he reopened the healing wounds as he hopped out of the house, leaving his 
crutches, while his wife handed the smaller children to him over a chain-link 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who is African American, and his landlord, who is white, say both 
attacks were attempts by a Latino street gang to drive Johnson and his family 
from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department would not 
comment Saturday on whether the arson investigation included gang involvement 
or was being viewed as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the neighborhood has experienced a rash of incidents involving 
Molotov cocktails in the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time the fire began at Johnson's house, a Molotov cocktail was 
thrown at a white family's home, deputies said. Six weeks ago, another firebomb 
was thrown at the home of a Latino family. Neither ignited, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson, who was shot Feb. 10 and left the hospital Wednesday, and 
landlord Ercil Ewing say that recent events in the 12000 block of Walnut and 
Pine streets leave them little doubt that the bombing of his home was racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of racial stuff flaring up, Hispanics taunting blacks," Johnson 
said. "My family was all in the house, in bed. They didn't care what happened. 
They didn't care who they killed in there." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his children have been taunted while walking from school and at a 
corner phone booth, where they call their friends. His son has been beaten up. 
A brick was tossed through another neighbor's window, carrying a racial epithet 
and a warning to get out. Johnson said the neighbor moved three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents of Walnut Street said they were unaware of racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said that since he came home from the hospital he has been 
watching videos, too frightened to sleep at night. He said his fear intensified 
Saturday night when he saw gang members congregating in an alley behind his 
house so he and his wife drove to the Norwalk sheriff's substation. But he said 
they were told there was nothing deputies could do.

ORANGE COUNTY COMPANIES KEEP BUSY TRACKING THE INFOMERCIAL EXPLOSION; 
ADVERTISING: PUBLICATIONS BASED IN TUSTIN AND SANTA ANA ARE AMONG THOSE THAT 
RANK THE COMMERCIALS, OFFER THEIR OBSERVATIONS -- AND MAKE THEMSELVES 
INVALUABLE TO THOSE WHO CALL THE SHOTS. 
</P>

<P>
 From his easy chair or the treadmill nearby, John Kogler watches half a dozen 
televisions at once, all showing infomercials from VCRs in fast-play mode -- 
and can spot changes from previous versions in any of those 30-minute 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Clare, also view new infomercials in so-called real time, the 
same half hour it takes anyone to watch them, and they put their observations 
in a weekly report dubbed the Green Sheet, because of the color of its 
hard-to-photocopy pages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koglers have a library of infomercials dating back to 1984, an invaluable 
resource that also helps their Tustin-based company, Jordan Whitney Inc., in 
its consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
 They know, for example, what helped Victoria Jackson sell nearly $200 million 
worth of makeup since 1989. They know why Ron Popeil sells so many food 
dehydrators and pasta machines. They can surmise why Dolly Parton's first 
Revlon makeup infomercial, for which the singer-actress reportedly was paid $2 
million, bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dolly Parton infomercial is beautiful looking," Clare Kogler said. "But 
this is a sales tool, and that's what a lot of people don't understand. This is 
not general advertising. This is selling. It's getting people to walk over 
there and pick up their phone and dial the number. If it doesn't do that, it 
doesn't matter how pretty it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Koglers are part of a small coterie of publishers who spend their time 
dissecting infomercials, which are part of the boom in direct response 
television that also includes home shopping channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders pay attention to what the Koglers and others, like Steven 
Dworman of Infomercial Marketing Report in Los Angeles, have to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of these people wields a lot of clout," said Greg Renker, chairman 
of Guthy-Renker Corp. His infomercial production company, based in Palm Desert, 
counts among its infomercial successes Principal Secret skin care with Victoria 
Principal, Personal Power! with self-improvement guru Anthony Robbins and 
Perfect Smile tooth whitener with TV celebrity Vanna White. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they print is very important," Renker said, "because they are the 
disseminators of information in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Whitney's Green Sheet, Dworman's newsletter, ResponseTV magazine in 
Santa Ana and Infomercial Monitoring Service outside Philadelphia have become 
indispensable reading for a Hollywood-type industry afraid to miss any tidbit 
of fact or scuttlebutt. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: profits. The industry sold about $900 million in goods 
and services on television last year and drove six times that amount in store 
sales. The cost of air time was about $400 million, according to industry 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 TV sales are expected to top $1 billion this year and are projected to go to 
$5 billion in a few years, even though the cost of air time is soaring and 
cheaper radio time is beckoning advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Infomercial hits also do well on the shopping channels. Actress Victoria 
Principal sold $9,375 worth of her skin-care products for every minute of her 
four hours of appearances on QVC last summer. Ron Popeil sold 31,000 Ronco Food 
Dehydrators in less than 90 minutes on QVC last fall. The Home Shopping Network 
and QVC each sold a total of more than $1 billion worth of goods and services 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the profits in the infomercial industry even more amazing is that 
most of the program-length commercials fail miserably. The Koglers estimate 
that seven out of eight flop; Renker puts it at 10 of 11. The failures are a 
big reason why the trade publications have become gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 "These reports provide me with ammunition. And with production costs averaging 
about $300,000, I need all the artillery I can get in determining what to 
produce," Renker said. "They don't help me make a good decision, but they help 
me avoid making bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The publications are aimed at those who work or want to work in an industry 
many still liken to the snake-oil business. Indeed, they have helped to 
legitimize the industry by spotlighting shady practices and deceptive pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Lousy products, those in the trade say, not only give the industry a bad image 
but hurt retail sales. And the hottest segment of the infomercial world is the 
emergence of name brands seeking a new way to sell in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retail is such a big component because most people still won't buy from 
television, but they'll buy a product they saw on television from Costco," John 
Kogler said. 
</P>
<P>
 For every Popeil Pasta Maker sold on television, six are sold in stores. So 
retail chains are looking for products they can promote with the slogan, "As 
seen on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 "Major marketers such as Sears, Philips Electronics, Braun, Mattel, Revlon, 
Bank of America and others are utilizing the infomercial to demonstrate and 
explain features and benefits," Jack Schember wrote in his editor's column in 
ResponseTV, an easy-reading four-color magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 His and the other publications essentially do research for the industry, and 
the industry pays dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Sheet -- its real name is Direct Response Television Monitoring 
Report -- publishes both weekly and monthly and has 200 customers worldwide. 
The price: $13,000 a year for the weekly, $3,000 a year for the monthly. 
Overseas subscribers pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly Infomercial Monitoring Service report, which charts infomercials 
shown only on cable stations and describes new programs with little 
editorializing, has about 100 customers paying $3,000 a year each. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworman's monthly newsletter, a potpourri of news, rumors and insider moves, 
goes to about 1,000 readers who pay $395 each annually. ResponseTV, which uses 
advertising to help cover production costs, is the least expensive at $40 a 
year and goes to 16,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many producers, media buyers and other industry executives subscribe to all 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I enjoy reading these publications? No. Do I need to read them? Yes," said 
Lenny Lieberman, a producer based in San Francisco. "There's a perception that 
things are moving so fast that you can't afford to miss anything that's written 
about the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all the publications can survive is a "hot issue," said Helene Blake, 
executive director of the National Infomercial Marketing Assn. in Washington. 
Her trade group puts out a newsletter that just skirts competing directly with 
the publications, which are NIMA members. But she sees no waning of reader 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a thirst for knowledge about the industry," Blake said. "All of 
these publications are widely read. If you don't read one, you might miss 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All four publications operate on small budgets -- the Koglers and Dworman from 
their homes. Their effort is a testament as much to the modern tools available 
to small business as to the phenomenal growth of the infomercial industry. The 
Green Sheet, in fact, is the quintessential modern-day mom-and-pop business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koglers have been watching and taping infomercials ever since the 
program-length commercials first invaded households 10 years ago with their 
toll-free phone numbers urging viewers to call and buy kitchen knives, diet 
aids and assorted other products not sold in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kogler was a real estate lawyer with a prominent firm, and Clare Kogler 
was a speech therapist. When the couple's twins were born 12 years ago, Clare 
decided to stay home and start a direct marketing company, placing 
advertisements in small newspapers across the nation for a line of cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koglers called the company Jordan Whitney -- their middle names. In 1985, 
a year after federal regulations on TV commercials were eased, John resigned 
from his law firm and joined Clare in the venture full time. They wrote scripts 
and produced several infomercials; when larger producers moved in, the Koglers 
moved on to consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the decade, they had a large stash of infomercial videotapes, 
and John was advising a friend in New York about the newest INs, as the Koglers 
call infomercials. The friend offered to pay for a weekly handwritten report, 
and John began mailing copies to four customers in December, 1990. Within a 
year, he was compiling the data by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koglers now have a network of aides who record shows nationwide, then ship 
the tapes to the Koglers' home for review. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Sheet contains details of INs, the couple's opinions of them, plus 
newsy items gleaned from other publications and from conversations with people 
in the industry. It also ranks infomercials by the number of times they air, 
and the industry scans those numbers religiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Without advertising, the Jordan Whitney report has grown to become perhaps the 
most respected of the four publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really a Bible source for making a green-light decision on producing 
infomercials," Renker said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ripper, president of Tyee Productions in Portland, Ore., subscribes to 
all four publications but said that the Green Sheet is essential because it 
provides the most complete list of infomercials, evaluations of their strengths 
and weaknesses, and the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to be current on the new shows and their success or failure," Ripper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publisher Dworman doesn't worry about rankings. He deals instead in the news 
he can generate from talks with producers, manufacturers, infomercial 
celebrities and others in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA film school graduate, Dworman wrote scripts for some episodes of such 
TV shows as "Happy Days," but in the mid-1980s became fascinated with 
infomercials and direct response TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1990, I said there was such a lack of information about the industry that 
I was going to start a newsletter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Infomercial Marketing Report is chatty and opinionated. "Dworman usually 
has the inside scoop," Renker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the January issue, for instance, Dworman pointed out that manufacturers and 
infomercial producers were making more deals with Home Shopping Network than 
with QVC because QVC had a backlog of products submitted for airing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, HSN is ordering more product than QVC and giving better 
guarantees or commitments," wrote Dworman, who works out of his home on the 
westside of Los Angeles. "It's obvious that HSN does not intend to live in 
QVC's or anyone else's shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Jordan Whitney and Dworman, ResponseTV is part of a large 
publishing company called Advanstar Communications. The Irvine firm prints five 
dozen trade journals and started ResponseTV, which is based in Santa Ana, in 
mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schember, the magazine's editor, has three staff writers and a number of 
contributors. Jordan Whitney supplies him with monthly rankings of the top 10 
infomercials and top 10 spots -- short commercials that sell through a 
toll-free phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth widely circulated publication takes a different approach. 
Infomercial Monitoring Service avoids evaluations, gossip and other 
editorializing. 
</P>
<P>
 From an office in Broomall, Pa., west of Philadelphia, owner Sam Catanese and 
seven employees publish the report, which is billed as a scientific summary on 
infomercials running on cable stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do real-time monitoring and taped verification," Catanese said. "We're not 
editorializing, just providing the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Infomercial Monitoring Service tracks about 1,000 infomercials a week on 20 
national cable stations and prints a TV Guide-like grid showing what 
infomercials aired during which time slots on which channels. It also ranks the 
infomercials by the frequency of airings on cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But by concentrating only on cable stations, producers and others say, 
Catanese is missing most of the shows -- about 70% of all infomercials now air 
on broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Catanese may soon get more exposure for his company. Electronic Retailing, a 
four-color monthly magazine set to debut in mid-April, is negotiating with him 
to use Infomercial Monitoring Service rankings, editor Kathy St. Louis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Retailing, based in Van Nuys, expects to cover advertising, 
marketing and retailing associated with TV programs and the much-ballyhooed 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Its publisher and the others recognize that retail shopping is changing 
dramatically. Interactive television, for instance, could allow customers to 
order products they see as a camera pans through a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole shopping revolution coincides with some lifestyle and economic 
changes," John Kogler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are working harder, often both adults in a family. They don't have 
time to shop. Two, it's obviously not a pleasant experience anymore -- the 
clerks are less well-trained, the merchandise is not as available in the sizes 
and quantities. And three, it's not safe in many places anymore." The

JAMES FLANIGAN: CAP CITIES BUILDS MEDIA HIGHWAY FROM ITS OWN BACK LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that an outsized merger has collapsed at an on-ramp to the information 
highway, it pays to look at how smart people, such as those at Capital 
Cities/ABC, are conducting their business and making their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock of Cap Cities, which owns the ABC network, most of ESPN and other 
cable interests, the Kansas City Star and other newspapers and magazines, hit 
an all-time high of $698 a share last week just as the $33-billion 
Tele-Communications-Bell Atlantic merger fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Cap Cities fell back in the general stock market retreat late in 
the week, its price is still up almost 40% in the last year and analysts expect 
it to go higher. They offer many reasons but cite prominently the company's 
quiet and deliberate approach to the dawning of the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities people, its Chairman Thomas Murphy and its principal owner Warren 
Buffett, don't think you can buy a future in multimedia by making mega-billion 
offers for movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead Cap Cities, which is a big company with $5.6 billion in revenues last 
year and about $470 million in net profit, has invested $300 million in recent 
years in TV program production companies and networks in Germany, France, Spain 
and the Scandinavian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The investments still lose money, but will turn the corner shortly. Their 
significance is that Cap Cities has ownership at a reasonable price in a 
revolution about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The European TV scene today is like the United States in the '60s, just before 
the proliferation of cable channels began. "It's like being in a time warp," 
says analyst Alan Gottesman of PaineWebber. An American, such as Harry Sloan, a 
filmmaker and broadcaster who put together a Scandinavian firm with a Cap 
Cities investment, "can see what's going to happen, and get in position to make 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, owning European programming is practice for the big change here. The 
federal financial and syndication rules that have barred TV networks from 
owning or sharing in the lucrative syndication of programming are all but 
repealed now. ABC is dramatically increasing its program production, to $200 
million worth last year from $100 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Cap Cities pledged more than $100 million to a joint 
venture with Brillstein-Grey Entertainment to produce programming for ABC and 
its cable channels. And it's reported to be in discussions on similar joint 
ventures with top entertainment personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so good about programming? A hit product can go on earning money 
forever. ABC owns great series, such as "Roots," "Winds of War," and the 
stylish "Moonlighting" -- programs with long-term value just like movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, fundamental calculations of supply and demand have changed in the media 
business. Years ago, distribution outlets for advertising were scarce -- only 
three networks, a shrinking number of dominant newspapers. But then channels 
for advertising increased dramatically, with cable in electronic media and all 
sorts of specialized publications and mailbox fliers in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution will be even more plentiful with the advent of 150 cable 
channels, or 500. "That reduces the intrinsic value of our media investments, 
although all remain fine businesses," Buffett wrote in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was then that Cap Cities began to make programming investments in 
earnest. The reason was simple: The new oversupply of distribution channels 
creates a yawning demand for programming; "content," as the pros call it, 
became the new scarce resource. That's why Walt Disney Co. has geared up to 
produce 60 films a year and other studios are likewise expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming can be risky, more like the oil business or venture capital than 
communications. "The rule is you invest $1 billion, waste $800 million but get 
rich because the $200 million brings you $3 billion," says a Hollywood 
financier. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cap Cities, which owns substantial distribution assets -- ABC, several 
cable channels and the lead stations in the five largest U.S. markets, 
including KABC Los Angeles -- is increasing its investments in programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities stations are the heart of its business, and not only because they 
record 48% operating profit ratios, the highest in the television industry by 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in 1954 by the late Frank Smith who hired Murphy, then 
a 24-year-old Harvard MBA to run a near bankrupt UHF station in Albany, N.Y. 
Murphy tells the story of Smith driving him to the station's ramshackle house, 
dropping him off and telling him make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did. The company grew from that one station to the point in 1986 when 
it paid $3.5 billion, with investor Buffett's help, and acquired ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's tension in the picture. Murphy at 68 years old stepped back this 
month into the chief executive's post he retired from in 1990. Buffett, 63, 
took some money off the table in December by selling 1 million of his shares 
back to the company -- at $630 a share, a tidy gain from the $172 a share he 
paid in '86. He retains 2 million shares or 14% ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Cap Cities leadership is preparing for something -- either the 
elevation of 42-year old Executive Vice President Robert Iger to the top job, 
or an alliance with another firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Jessica Reif of Oppenheimer & Co. believes an alliance, possibly with 
Disney or Ted Turner, is likely. A Cap Cities acquisition of King World, 
distributor of "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune," also is mentioned. With all 
those hypothetical link-ups, Cap Cities would acquire programming; with one, it 
could acquire management. Michael Eisner, 51, chairman of Disney, worked 10 
years at ABC early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is likely to happen in a hurry. The network business is good again, 
Cap Cities stock is strong -- analyst Reif suggests it could rise to $900 or 
even $1,000 a share on strengthening cash flow -- and Murphy will be in charge 
for a good while yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a two-year window," in which big questions will be answered, suggests 
investment banker John Tinker of Furman, Selz. But whatever happens you can bet 
it will be better planned and executed than the mega-merger that fell apart 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities people are quiet, but smart. For an idea of where the information 
highway is really heading, this is a company to watch.

COLLISION COURSE; CONFRONTATION LOOMS AS JAPAN PERSISTS WITH TRADE BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, the Japanese head of a high-tech company in Japan went 
shopping for a state-of-the-art mainframe computer. After weighing many 
options, he bought a U.S. model. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, he was astounded to find himself summoned to the prime 
minister's office to justify his purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japanese society, this is the most intense kind of pressure, short of 
being asked to cancel an order," said Pat Loui, a Honolulu marketing consultant 
who is a friend of the executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it insists it is committed to free trade, Japan continues to erect 
barriers -- some subtle, some as blatant as an invitation to the prime 
minister's woodshed -- to U.S. companies seeking to prosper in the world's 
second-largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By so doing, U.S. executives and diplomats say, Japan flouts the spirit of a 
number of recent and longstanding trade agreements reached by its own 
negotiators with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 America's frustration peaked this month, as the latest round of trade talks 
collapsed after eight months. President Clinton put U.S. prestige on the line, 
raising the spectre of a trade war with tough talk about sanctions and quotas. 
A new government report underscored the stakes: America's merchandise trade 
deficit with Japan grew in 1993 to nearly $60 billion, a record. 
</P>
<P>
 Inarguably, headway is being made. Many American companies have painstakingly 
pried open the Japanese market, proving it can be done. And some U.S. 
executives acknowledge that their go-get-'em bluster and lack of understanding 
of Japanese ways may contribute to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation is looming. Washington has taken the first step toward 
retaliation in a high-profile dispute over Motorola Inc.'s access to Japan's 
cellular phone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese leaders have sounded conciliatory, promising a package of 
market-opening actions within a month. But many skeptical U.S. business people 
say they've heard that pledge before. 
</P>
<P>
 What's really going on in the key markets? 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an assessment of trade conditions in industries -- telecommunications, 
insurance, autos and medical technology -- that U.S. trade negotiators say have 
been notably stymied by Japanese barriers. Telecommunications 
</P>
<P>
 With all the talk of a coming information superhighway, splice closures and 
telephone terminals have taken on a glamorous aura. And U.S. companies such as 
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Motorola have captured an impressive 
share of the huge global market for innovative telecommunications gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite decades of costly marketing efforts, they have made little headway 
with Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. -- the victims of Japan's adherence to 
procurement methods that exclude outsiders, according to Debra Waggoner, a 
spokeswoman on international trade for the American Electronics Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the tech firms keep bashing away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the largest phone company in the world, so how can you not try to sell 
to NTT?" asked Harry O. Postlewait, an executive vice president at Raychem 
Corp., a Menlo Park, Calif., maker of equipment for telephone and consumer 
electronics companies, utilities and auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying equipment, NTT -- 65%-owned by the Japanese government -- meets 
with favored suppliers to discuss specifications. It then writes proposals to 
suit those companies' products, in effect shutting out U.S. and other foreign 
companies from the bidding, Waggoner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, NTT invites just one company to bid on a project. When foreign 
companies are allowed in, they often are limited to making proposals for 
equipment that represents a narrow portion of the work. Many U.S. companies 
don't bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem: In their 50s, many NTT executives leave to run small 
companies that make telecommunications equipment -- and count on their old ties 
to win business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that you have remnants of a pure monopoly system," said Thomas 
Zengage, a telecommunications consultant in Tokyo. "It's a constant battle to 
make the market truly open." 
</P>
<P>
 Postlewait said Raychem has sensed "a turn for the better" in its dealings 
with Japan in the last 18 months. But the company expects to do just $500,000 
in business with NTT this year, out of its overall telecommunications sales of 
$450 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Raychem has adopted a Japanese-style strategy in its tiny Tokyo office 
-- a strategy of building trust over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying very hard to be their friends and to work together," Postlewait 
said. "We'll play by their rules." Insurance 
</P>
<P>
 Although American insurance companies face no explicit barriers in Japan, few 
U.S. carriers have entered the market. The reason, experts contend, is that 
American corporate impatience tends to collide with Japan's bureaucracy and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is similar in banking, where the same rules ostensibly govern 
all financial institutions, yet American banks have been unable to grasp even a 
1% share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies have gone there and tried to get in, but they find it's a 
long process and not everything is written down," said Mark Weston, director of 
international insurance for accountants Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a market worth fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are the world's most fervent believers in insurance. With a 
population half that of the United States, Japan leads the world in the amount 
of life insurance in force; Japanese trail only Americans in purchases of other 
kinds of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, domestic insurers set up sales operations within major corporations, 
selling directly to their work forces. These agencies typically are staffed by 
company retirees who are well trusted by their former co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most American insurers, however, have failed to gain access to these networks, 
putting them at a powerful disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem, from the U.S. perspective, is that most Japanese insurance 
prices are set by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiums can run twice as high in Japan as in the United States for similar 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is one conspicuous American success story. Aflac Inc., a 
relatively obscure company based in Columbus, Ga., broke into the Japanese 
market in the mid-1970s with a unique product: cancer insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Aflac reaps four-fifths of its $5 billion in annual revenue from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 A key difference between insurance and banking in Japan is that one major, 
explicit obstacle exists for foreign banks: They are not allowed to buy 
Japanese banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet acquisition is the fastest and surest way for a bank to establish itself 
in a new territory, noted Fred Furlong, an economist with the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco. Without that option, "it's much harder to establish a 
beachhead and fight your way in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such U.S. banking giants as Citicorp, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan and 
J.P. Morgan all have prominent Japanese offices, but their operations tend 
mainly to support American companies doing business in Japan. American banks' 
market share is "well under 1%," Furlong said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, Japanese banks held 9.8% of all U.S. banking assets as 
of mid-1993. Autos and Auto Parts 
</P>
<P>
 For many Americans, it has been hard to sympathize with Detroit's complaint 
that it can't sell cars in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three's credibility long was undercut by the dubious engineering, 
design, quality and marketing of U.S. cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last two years have altered the auto world's landscape. Many of 
Detroit's new cars and trucks are hot, while Tokyo's suddenly seem dowdy. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan -- its car makers in painful retrenchment -- actually lost ground in the 
U.S. auto market last year, while Detroit added to its meager share in Japan. 
U.S.-based makers of auto components predict they will sell a record $19 
billion worth to Japanese auto makers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did the trade imbalance in autos and auto parts -- source of more than 
half the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan -- grow an additional 4% last year to 
a projected $34.5 billion? 
</P>
<P>
 Some answers were suggested this month with the publication of a joint 
U.S.-Japanese study that details a wide variety of entrenched business 
practices and interlocking interests that serve as unofficial barriers to 
imported autos in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, funded and endorsed by the U.S. and Japanese governments, finds 
fault on both sides. It notes that some tax and other government obstacles have 
been eased or eliminated and criticizes Detroit for not making a serious 
effort, until lately, to crack the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which is another way of saying lack of market share is the result of choices 
made, not government interference," said William C. Duncan, the top Washington 
lobbyist for Japan's auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the study also suggests that Detroit's past resistance to investing 
heavily in Japan had some business logic, given other overseas priorities, its 
financial woes in the 1980s and the limited prospects for success. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings focused on the financial ties between Japan's auto manufacturers 
and dealers, obstacles to researching the auto market there, exorbitant land 
prices that discourage new dealerships and a distribution system that makes 
imports 20% more expensive than domestically produced cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Japanese government can force change in such deeply embedded 
conditions, said Andrew Card, the former U.S. transportation secretary who now 
is the Big Three's top lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some ways, the situation portrayed by researchers is being overtaken by 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say economic turmoil -- notably Japan's recession and the dramatic 
rise in the yen against the dollar -- is driving fundamental change that will 
ease the auto trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The stronger yen gives U.S. autos and parts a big price advantage over those 
from Japan. That and improving U.S. quality are causing Japanese auto firms to 
break out of their keiretsu, or "families" of suppliers, and buy more U.S. 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, better cars and prices and Detroit's newfound commitment -- U.S. 
car makers are acquiring dealerships and building cars with right-hand drive -- 
are making it more attractive for Japanese business people to align themselves 
with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economics have broken down a lot of the barriers," said Marc Santucci, 
president of ELM International, a Lansing, Mich., research firm. "If the 
dollar-yen relationship stays in this range, you'll see fairly dramatic moves" 
in the auto trade deficit. Medical Technology 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of Japanese prowess in consumer electronics and other 
high-technology fields. Yet U.S. companies can claim undisputed leadership in 
selling medical technology to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Except Japan, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 While American manufacturers of medical devices and supplies capture about 50% 
of worldwide sales, in Japan their market share is a relatively puny 21%. By 
comparison, Japanese medical companies have a paltry 7% of global sales but a 
whopping 70% of their domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the U.S. medical technology industry say those figures 
demonstrate that Japan doesn't play fair with offshore competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare has established a 
confusing array of regulations that make it difficult for U.S. firms with new 
medical technology to get their products into the hands of Japanese doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese government is very creative in thinking of new regulatory 
impediments," said Terri Ethridge, director of global strategy and analysis for 
the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn., a Washington trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 After a new medical technology has been deemed safe by Japan's version of the 
Food and Drug Administration, the Japanese ministry often requires a second 
round of clinical trials. The maker of a new medical testing device could be 
required to provide its products free to a hospital during this process, which 
can take two or more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For lots of medical technology, the life cycle is only three years," Ethridge 
said. "By the time you can sell it (in Japan), it is obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 The regulatory process also buys time for Japanese competitors to develop 
similar products, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Croce, group chairman of a Johnson & Johnson unit that markets endoscopic 
surgical equipment, has been frustrated by Japan's regulatory procedures. 
Although endoscopic devices are commonly used for a variety of surgical 
procedures in the United States and Europe, the Japanese ministry considers the 
devices experimental. Except for gall bladder surgery, Japan refuses to 
reimburse doctors and hospitals for their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan "has a regulatory system in place that is not in tune with the dynamic 
growth of this industry," Croce said. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is also irked by new Japanese price controls on heart valves, 
pacemakers, catheters, respiratory equipment and artificial limbs. U.S. and 
foreign firms are by far the leading producers of such products, which account 
for about $1 billion in annual sales in Japan, according to the manufacturers 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support measures to contain health care costs, but we believe the burden 
should be spread" so it doesn't discriminate against foreign suppliers, said Ed 
Rozynski, a group vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. companies say they don't find Japan's policies discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw Inc., an Irvine supplier of intravenous products, sells more than $50 
million of products annually through its Japanese distributors. Larry Watts, a 
company spokesman, described the Japanese regulatory process as "fair but 
demanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Hideki Tarumi, a health and welfare official at the Japanese Embassy in 
Washington, said price controls are not as onerous as the U.S. industry 
suggests. And the Japanese regulatory process, he added, is "almost the same as 
the FDA." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, some U.S. firms don't do well in Japan because they lack understanding 
of foreign markets, added David Anast, publisher of the Biomedical Market 
Newsletter in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people seem to mistakenly have the idea that you set up shop, and if 
you don't immediately have sales, then it's the fault of that country's 
government," Anast said. "But our problems are not always someone else's 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 This story was reported and written by Times staff writers Martha Groves in 
San Francisco, Thomas S. Mulligan and David Olmos in Los Angeles and Donald 
Woutat in Sacramento. Trade Among Giants 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the $59.3-billion imbalance in U.S.-Japan trade lurk complex flows of 
goods across the Pacific. The bulk of Japan's sales to America are cars and 
high-technology manufactured products. America sells a substantial amount of 
aircraft and computers to Japan, but much of America's exports consist of 
unprocessed commodities such as food and wood. Chart shows the 15 
highest-volume trade flows between the two countries in 1992. Arrows point in 
the direction of trade flow. 
</P>
<P>
 15 LEADING ITEMS TRADED BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE U.S. IN 1992 
</P>
<P>
 (in billions) *: Exports from the United States to Japan. **: Exports from 
Japan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Cars & other motor vehicles ($20.11 in Japanese exports): U.S. car makers 
complain that government and business practices lock foreign car makers out of 
the Japanese market, where imports make up only 3% of sales. American firms 
have little to lose under U.S. proposals to hike tariffs on Japanese minivans 
and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Computers ($8.59 in Japanese exports): While claiming a substantial share 
of the Japanese private sector, U.S. computer firms say sales to government 
agencies still fall short of international targets. Any sanctions against 
Japanese exports could backfire on U.S. firms that depend on Japanese 
electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Motor vehicle parts & accessories ($5.45 in Japanese exports): U.S. auto 
part makers have been boosting sales to Japanese car makers as they produce 
more vehicles in the United States. Japanese buyers might reduce their U.S. 
purchases should tension and trade barriers increase. ** Integrated 
circuits($5.01 in Japanese exports): The current U.S. share of the Japanese 
computer chip market, about 18%, has fallen below levels agreed to by both 
countries. But few expecting the market to turn into a trade war battleground, 
because companies on both nations depend on each other's specialized exports. 
** Telecommunications equipment ($5.00 in Japanese exports): Complicated and 
obscure Japanese government buying policies appear to favor domestic 
manufacturers. But the success of some U.S.-made products such as fiber-optic 
cables could be jeopardized as tensions rise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aircraft & associated equipment; spacecraft & parts ($3.81 in U.S. exports): 
Japan is the single largest export market for U.S. manufacturers, which have 
established close ties to Japanese suppliers. Even short-term animosity could 
prompt the Japanese to begin shifting orders for new equipment and parts to 
European and other foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Parts for computers ($3.76 in Japanese exports): Although Japanese exports 
are twice American levels, the Japanese market is still a lucrative one for 
U.S. firms. Dependence on each other's products might limit what the United 
States and Japan can do without harming their respective interests. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Sound recorders, tv recorders, recording media ($2.94 in Japanese exports): 
The United States has virtually ceded the manufacture of products such as 
videocassette recorders to the Japanese. Higher U.S. tariffs might hurt 
Japanese firms but would also raise the ire of U.S. consumers, who would have 
few alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Internal combustion piston engines & parts ($2.94 in Japanese exports): 
Most exports from Japan are destined for Japanese-owned automobile plants in 
the United States. American manufacturers have pushed hard for a bigger share 
of that "transplant" market and would welcome any boost from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Electrical machinery & apparatus ($2.46 in Japanese exports): Japan 
dominates trade in this sector, which includes everything from home appliances 
to industrial tools. Even many home appliances sold under a U.S. brand name are 
manufactured by Japanese firms. Again, U.S. consumers would feel the fallout of 
a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Baby carriages, toys, games & sporting goods ($2.16 in Japanese exports): 
U.S. firms have made some inroads into the Japanese market; the growth of U.S. 
retailers, such as Toys R Us, bodes well for American firms. Many of the 
Japanese imports represent computer games. Could Washington deny American 
youngsters their Nintendo and Sega fixes? 
</P>
<P>
 * Computers ($2.05 in U.S. exports): Japan is the world's second-largest 
market for computers after the United States. Both U.S. and Japanese firms are 
vulnerable to sanctions and higher tariffs on finished computers and 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Printed circuits ($1.68 in Japanese exports): The trade in computer circuit 
boards is dominated by the Japanese. But few expect U.S. sanctions in this 
sector, as many American-made computer chips are included on Japanese-produced 
circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Office machines ($1.65 in Japanese exports): Japanese firms dominate U.S. 
sales of low-end photocopiers and are major producers of other types of 
equipment, such as electric typewriters. This could be a tempting target for 
U.S. sanctions as a way to deny Japanese companies greater market share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parts for computers ($1.57 in U.S. exports): U.S. firms have found a large 
market in Japan for computer disk drives, memory storage units and other 
computer and office machine parts. Japan could easily retaliate against U.S. 
sanctions and hurt American firms, so Washington will probably leave Japanese 
exports alone. A Swelling Deficit 
</P>
<P>
 After decreasing in the late 1980's, America's merchandise trade deficit with 
Japan-the amount by which U.S. exports of goods to Japan fall short of Japanese 
exports of products to the United States-has grown dramatically in the last two 
years.

THE GRAYING OF HMOS; MEDICARE RECIPIENTS ARE WOOED AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by Southern California's big players, health maintenance organizations are 
spending millions of dollars to sign up Medicare recipients -- and thereby 
assure themselves a steady flow of revenue, whatever the results of the tumult 
over health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare is not likely to change much amid the reform efforts. By contrast, 
the health plans HMOs offer through employers are approaching the saturation 
point in the Southland, even before the first reform bill has been passed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Fountain Valley-based FHP and its Cypress-based competitor, 
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., are spending heavily to woo seniors -- through 
television, radio and print advertisements, billboards, telemarketing, direct 
mail and in-person visits from salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives won't say how much they're spending on promoting their plans. But 
some analysts suggest that as much as 12% of the Medicare premiums HMOs receive 
from the federal government go to marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no accident that FHP and PacifiCare are so large," said Kimberly A. 
Purvis, a health care analyst with the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette 
in New York. "They have devoted hefty resources to the product." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP and PacifiCare, which offers the Secure Horizons senior plan, are far and 
away the leaders in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 With 316,000 members in its Senior Plan, FHP boasts the largest Medicare 
membership in the nation. PacifiCare, with 311,000 members, is No. 2. In 
California, FHP and PacifiCare together account for almost 60% of the 760,000 
Medicare recipients enrolled in the state's HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the big marketing budgets cut into profits, the money is well spent, 
HMO officials say. "If you aren't in the Medicare business, you aren't in the 
medical business," said FHP administrator Marguerite O'Toole. 
</P>
<P>
 Such programs are attractive to managed care companies because for each 
Medicare member they sign up, the firms receive a set monthly payment from the 
Health Care Finance Administration, the federal agency that oversees Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with FHP and PacifiCare's big numbers, the elderly represent a virtually 
untapped resource for managed care companies. HCFA figures show that only 10% 
of Medicare recipients nationwide belong to HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign up seniors, managed care companies have sought to demonstrate the 
advantages of their individual programs -- no easy feat, given that all plans 
operate on set budgets and are federally mandated to offer certain services. 
</P>
<P>
 HMO officials admit as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benefit for benefit, there really is very little difference between the 
plans," said Tracy Tellefson, a sales representative for Secure Horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of managed care say HMO plans are advantageous to older patients -- 
and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Medicare recipients can go to a single office for most of 
their health care needs without having to pay deductibles or a percentage of 
treatment costs, compared to the 20% co-payments they face in conventional 
insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, meanwhile, spends an average of $400 a month for each Medicare 
patient enrolled in an HMO, compared to the $421 cost under conventional plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the heavy emphasis on marketing, advocates for the elderly and other 
critics have questioned whether the HMOs are tempted to misrepresent 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP was sued in 1991 by three elderly San Fernando Valley women who alleged 
that sales representatives did not fully explain the benefits provided by the 
company or the limits of the HMO plan's coverage. That same year, two investors 
filed a lawsuit against FHP alleging that the company padded its Medicare 
enrollment figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors' suit was settled out of court, and a settlement of the women's 
lawsuit is being negotiated, said Kurt Eggert, the plaintiffs' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases spurred the federal government to investigate FHP. The probe 
found no evidence of wrongdoing, but questions about the potential for abuse 
prompted the Group Health Assn. of America -- the Washington-based organization 
that oversees the nation's 335 HMOs -- to issue strict guidelines for 
advertising and sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is FHP the only company whose strategies have been questioned.

 In a report last year, the Medicare Advocacy Project said that many elderly 
people are "extremely vulnerable to misleading marketing by HMOs." The report 
by the Los Angeles-based group suggested that some HMOs might cut care to 
increase profits. It said the federal and state governments should play a 
stronger role in protecting Medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the competitive nature of the HMO industry . . . and the rapid 
expansion of Medicare HMOs to new areas, the potential for future marketing 
abuse continues to exist," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Dallek, executive director of the project, said she still has some 
concerns. But larger HMOs such as FHP and PacifiCare have matured to the point 
that there are few, if any, complaints against them now, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 As such issues are resolved, health care analysts say, HMOs can concentrate on 
expanding their business and increasing their profits. One popular strategy of 
late is to add members through mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to expand its Medicare membership in Northern California and Colorado, 
FHP tried -- unsuccessfully -- to purchase TakeCare Inc., a Concord, 
Calif.-based HMO that has a strong presence in each of those areas. PacifiCare 
also has reportedly made an offer for TakeCare. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding into the Medicare business can be an expensive proposition for HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 The needs of the elderly are much different than those of younger patients, 
said Doug Sherlock, a Philadelphia health care analyst who publishes Pulse, an 
industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Refitting clinics to accommodate wheelchairs, contracting with home health 
care agencies and hiring doctors with geriatric experience can make such 
ventures money losers, he said, at least in the short term. But once a company 
passes the 50,000-member mark, he said, the profits begin to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the number of players is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Kaiser Permanente, Health Net, Aetna, Care America, QualMed and 
Foundation Health are among the managed care companies that have started 
Medicare HMO plans in the past few years. So far, most have enrolled only a few 
thousand members. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lombardi, administrator for Secure Horizons, said the new competitors 
face a daunting task catching up to FHP and PacifiCare, given those companies' 
head start in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Secure Horizons, he said, "does a nice job" of identifying potential customers 
and putting on social events that draw crowds of retirees, some of whom are 
sure to enroll. It has also developed a network of "ambassadors" -- members who 
volunteer to help enroll other elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, PacifiCare sponsored a "sweetheart breakfast" at St. 
Joseph Hospital in Orange for more than 30 attendees. While a saleswoman gave a 
presentation and answered questions, Clarence Leonardo, 70, stood at the door 
and welcomed guests. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired controller for a local concrete firm, Leonardo has been a Secure 
Horizons member for four years. He offers his services to the company for free, 
he said. "It gets me out of the house," Leonardo said, adding that he believes 
in the plan.

 In 1982, Medicare recipients were given the option of switching from 
fee-for-service providers to health maintenance organizations. The latter 
choice is becoming increasingly popular, especially in California, where HMOs 
have established a stronghold. Medicare recipients' membership in the top five 
HMOs: Southern California:

opting for HMO membership in the region has increased 91%.

THE GRAYING OF HMOS; BEFORE YOU SIGN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As health maintenance organizations scramble to sign up the elderly for their 
senior plans, the American Assn. of Retired Persons offers this advice to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if the doctor you prefer is affiliated with the HMO you are 
considering.If the doctor you see now is a confidante and friend, you may not 
want to change physicians. And Medicare will not pay the bills if you go to a 
doctor who is not a member of your HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be absolutely sure you want the plan before you sign up, especially if you 
have the so-called Medicare supplemental coverage provided by many insurance 
companies. Dropping out of an HMO's Medicare plan may be as easy as calling the 
company or the local Social Security office. But reinstating your supplemental 
coverage may prove difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though some plans have no premiums (apart from the $40 monthly Medicare Part 
B payment to the federal government), others charge extra for dental care, 
prescription drugs and eye exams. Make sure the benefits are spelled out in 
brochures and are fully explained to you by the HMO's sales representative. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though most plans offer emergency care coverage anywhere in the world, not 
all do. If you travel often, keep in mind that virtually all plans have some 
geographic limitations. And if you are on an extended trip and need routine 
care, Medicare will not pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emergency care may be disputed if your plan does not consider your illness 
or injury to be a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the plan you are considering has a toll-free hot line you can call 
if you have questions, with counselors who provide help free of charge. JAMES

 * DRUG TASK FORCE: Approved using $70,000 from the Police Department's General 
Fund to pay for the overtime work of eight narcotics officers working for the 
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force, which is under the control of 
the federal Drug Enforcement Agency. Operating throughout Southern California, 
the task force focuses on disrupting major distribution rings of cocaine, 
heroin, PCP and marijuana. The DEA will reimburse the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * WILSHIRE TRAFFIC: Approved transferring $1.7 million in parking revenues to 
a project designed to improve the flow of traffic on the Miracle Mile section 
of Wilshire Boulevard, between Fairfax and Sycamore avenues (one block east of 
La Brea Avenue). The project will include expanding left-turn capacities, 
re-landscaping median islands and lane re-striping. The plan does not include a 
synchronized lighting system for the 16-block stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEMA FUNDS: Approved using $27 million in Federal Emergency Management 
Agency relief funds to reimburse various city departments for expenses incurred 
in the recovery effort following the Northridge earthquake. The distributions 
include $10 million to the Police Department, $2.1 million to the Building and 
Safety Department, $1.5 million to the Parks and Recreation Department and 
$900,000 to the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * EARTHQUAKE BOOKLETS: Approved using $46,000 from the City's General Purpose 
Fund to buy 275,000 "Yogi Bear Earthquake Preparedness" booklets. The booklets,

languages may be printed later. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * GUN CONTROL: Approved a motion expressing the council's support for a bill 
pending in the state Legislature that would allow California cities to adopt 
their own gun-control laws, provided they are more stringent than current state 
and federal laws. Among those arguing against the motion was Councilman Nate 
Holden, who said that if the bill becomes law, Los Angeles County could 
theoretically have 86 gun control laws. Also speaking against the motion was 
Councilman Richard Alatorre. He contended that the council's action was a waste 
of time because, he said, "this bill is going absolutely nowhere." Passed 10-4. 
Voting yes: Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Jackie Goldberg. 
Voting no: Alatorre, Holden, Rudy Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

IMPOTENCE EASILY TREATED, PHYSICIANS SAY; HEALTH: THE PROBLEM CAN BE A SIDE

KEEP MEN FROM SEEKING HELP.

 With age and increasing prostate problems, Sam Brown noticed his sex drive 
starting to decline. At first he ignored it. At 62, he expected his urge for 
sex to drop. But he didn't expect the lack of desire to last for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had written it off to age and my prostate problem, but I knew there was 
something more serious, so I went to get checked out," said Brown, now 74, of 
South Los Angeles, who asked that his real first name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 What Brown discovered was that his prostate problems led to impotence. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Rodriguez of East Los Angeles never had trouble having sex until 
circulatory problems left the East Los Angeles native impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have sex," Rodriguez said while looking around to see if anyone 
could hear during an interview at a local hospital. "It was embarrassing. I'm 
only 22 and have problems with having sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Although impotence crosses age and racial lines, it is becoming increasingly 
evident among men of color as other medical problems are discovered that 
contribute to impotence cases. For many, cultural mores and language barriers 
often prohibit them from discussing the issue and lead to years of carrying a 
burden of inadequacy for a problem that doctors say is easily treatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a new problem, but (more men are seeking treatment as they) become 
aware that it's curable and that they don't have to live five to 10 years with 
impotence before getting it treated," said Dr. Miguel Martinez, a urologist at 
White Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Impotence can result from physical or psychological problems, or both. The 
most common physical conditions linked to impotence include diabetes, vascular 
disease, hypertension, neurological disorders and side effects from 
prescription medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, and 
illegal drugs. Cigarette smoking also can be a risk factor by worsening the 
effects of those other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychological factors can include depression, anxiety and loss of self-esteem. 
Psychological causes of impotence are most often found in men younger than 50 
who are not diabetic. Impotence from physical complications result more often 
in men over 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Impotence affects about 30 million mostly older men in the United States, 
according to the American Urology Assn., but no accurate figures exist because 
of inhibitions about discussing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most men who I've met who have the problem are hesitant to talk about it, 
even though I'll tell them about my problems with it," said Joseph, 65, of 
Hawthorne, who had been impotent for about three years before being treated. 
Joseph asked that his last name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are especially difficult to determine among ethnic and racial 
groups because of cultural biases and the dearth of studies on impotency's 
impact on minority males, according to the urology association.  
</P>
<P>
 For men of color, a greater risk for impotence exists because of higher rates 
of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and prostate cancer, especially among 
African American men, who have a 30% higher rate of diabetes or hypertension, 
Martinez said. These problems are additionally compounded by stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said men of all ethnic groups living in low-income areas suffer from 
stress and a variety of health problems that can lead to impotence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the inner city, with the more people you treat, you find out that stress 
is more prominent than people realize" in exacerbating the root causes of 
impotence, said Martinez, who treats several dozen Latino and black men for the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem recently discovered by urologists was that former prostate 
cancer patients were finding they could no longer have sex after undergoing 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prostate is very close to a series of nerves that are vital for 
erections," Martinez said. Doctors "were cutting off vital nerves. Now, they 
are aware and have formulated a different surgical procedure which does not 
harm those nerves."  
</P>
<P>
 Brown's problem was solved once he had surgery to correct difficulties with 
his prostate. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a man has realized there is a problem, the next issue is getting him to 
talk about it, doctors say. The stigma of impotence as being a sexual failure 
is still very common. Cultural mores, religion and family values also prevent 
patients from speaking more openly, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for men to wait six months to two years or more before 
seeking help, Martinez said. By then their medical condition is sometimes 
compounded by psychological problems caused by frustration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, to avoid embarrassment in seeing a doctor, Latino and Asian men 
will first go to herbal healers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more people with problems than we Asian urologists see, but 
culturally they feel better trying for non-traditional medicine first to fix 
their problems," said Dr. Eun-chil Park, a Koreatown urologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Asian men Park treats are over 65 and have been impotent for many 
years. Culturally, they consider it a part of aging and do not seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dr. Dominic Chu of Monterey Park: "Many will take medication to get their 
potency back, but if it doesn't work, they forget it because they figure that's 
the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu said he treats men in their 40s, but many men are impotent for years and 
do not mention it to their doctors until they are past 50, when they blame the 
problem on age. 
</P>
<P>
 Machismo is a major problem for some Latino patients, said Dr. David Sulam of 
Family Care Specialists in Highland Park. Some patients will seek help but give 
inaccurate information and try to avoid questions about their sexual 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who works in construction, twice attempted to have his impotence 
problem solved at a hospital in Los Angeles. But when the medical staff asked 
him questions in front of a female staff member, he lied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I wasn't having as much sex as usual," Rodriguez said. "But 
really, I couldn't have any sex at all." 
</P>
<P>
 After finally visiting a urologist, Rodriguez realized he was suffering from 
poor circulation largely in part to a poor diet and excessive smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I quit smoking, I felt different in less than a month," said Rodriguez, 
who is cured. "I was a new man." 
</P>
<P>
 Language barriers and finding experienced medical workers who are bilingual 
are often problems in successful treatment for impotence for Asian and Latino 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cures for impotency are not complicated and some are fairly new, Martinez 
said. Treatment includes increasing the flow of blood to the penis with 
injections of drugs that dilate blood vessels in the organ or an external 
vacuum pump used to create an erection. 
</P>
<P>
 Vascular surgery, another method used to increase blood flow, involves a 
bypass operation to route blood to the penis past blocked arteries. Penile 
prostheses, or implants, which can be rigid, malleable or inflatable, are also 
available for patients who refuse other forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once more men realize that this is a treatable problem and can be easily 
reversed, I think we'll begin to see more people breaking those cultural 
barriers and getting some help," Martinez said.

HOME DELIVERY; FACTORY-BUILT DWELLINGS ALLOW RESIDENTS TO ASSEMBLE THEIR PIECE 
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some people spend a lifetime chasing the American dream, but David Gonzales 
had his dropped off in Boyle Heights by crane. For Tanzolia Williams, it was 
brought to Watts on a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales and Williams are getting the first two deliveries of a new vision of 
home ownership -- manufactured houses for inner-city customers -- being 
marketed by an Alhambra firm. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday, Gonzales had a factory-built, 1,000-square-foot home 
hoisted by a giant crane onto the empty lot next to his home on Fairmount 
Street in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The new two-bedroom home will be occupied by his daughter, Sandy Martinez, her 
husband, David, and their daughter, Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are excited and they can't believe that they are really getting it," 
said Gonzales, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' home was delivered Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales and Williams are part of a growing wave of interest in factory-built 
homes as an affordable housing option. Last year, according to the California 
Manufactured Housing Institute, one in four single-family housing starts in the 
United States was a manufactured house. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales and Williams are buying their new homes for just over $60,000, 
including site preparation, utility hookups and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured homes, once known as mobile homes, have long conjured up images 
of trailer parks. But that is changing.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1976 Housing and Urban Development code required the homes to meet or exceed 
local building codes. Since then, the trend in manufactured homes has been 
toward permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire communities, such as Canyon View Estates in Santa Clarita and Santiago 
Estates in Sylmar, are being developed with manufactured housing. Both 
developments reportedly came through the recent earthquake unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jess Maxcy, president of the California Manufactured Housing 
Institute, manufactured homes cost about $12 per square foot less than 
site-built homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Carl Feldstein is pioneering the manufactured home's movement into inner-city 
Los Angeles. Feldstein, who was a real estate agent for 38 years before 
launching Sunset Homes last June, sells the homes at a 20% markup, for which he 
manages the details of installing the houses, including zoning regulations and 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, everything has been perfect," Gonzales said. "They've taken care of 
every detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who said her front yard "looks like a park," plans to put her new 
home on the front part of her property and move into it with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking at it as a dream house, because we never had a new house," 
said Williams, a janitorial manager with the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. "We in Watts can live like other people and have the things in life 
that we want and desire."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-WILSHIRE; MAKING THEIR MARK WITH GRAPHIC ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bresee Youth Design, a new desktop publishing service, gives kids a chance to 
use their creative talents to make their mark in the business world instead of 
on walls, signs or buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Established last month as a project of the Bresee Youth Center, the business 
offers a range of design, layout and paste-up, typesetting and printing 
services for flyers, brochures, business cards, posters, resumes, stationery 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer concept-to-completion service," said Jeff Carr, the youth center's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of the young employees were chronic taggers, they serve as role 
models for other youths who might consider trading their spray cans for a 
keyboard, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Perez, the 15-year-old student team leader, said the computer business is 
a positive way to get attention: "This will probably change some people around. 
(Graphic design) is like tagging -- but you get paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bresee Youth Design is not an after-school diversion for the 10 youths who 
launched the operation. It's a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the research and checked out the prices around town and we think we'll 
be competitive," Carr said. "Our motto is 'Good kids, good service, good 
prices.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The design team has state-of-the-art equipment thanks to a grant from the 
Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. The youth center also has a fully equipped 
computer lab funded by grants from the Whitecap Foundation and Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina, from funds she controlled when she was a 
member of the City Council. Graphic designers from Walt Disney Imagineering 
volunteer their time to offer students tips on computer techniques and, at the 
end of the training course, a tour of the Disney facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids who can develop these skills will be marketable for all kinds of jobs," 
Carr said. Jobs that require computer skills "are the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 After producing a slick promotional brochure to advertise its services, the 
Bresee Youth Design team has moved on to its first orders: six in-house 
projects for the P. F. Bresee Foundation, the First Church of the Nazarene, 
which houses the youth center, and its school. 
</P>
<P>
 The next marketing phases include spreading the word among neighborhood 
churches and organizations that work with the Bresee Foundation, and then 
training a sales team to call on local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees earn $6 an hour and charge an hourly rate for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth center at 3401 3rd St. offers academic assistance and other 
activities. Youths who drop in -- about 400 did last year -- can take computer 
classes taught by staff member Cathy Trout. The current design team members are 
regulars at the lab; future employees will be selected from the training 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, a sophomore at Belmont High School and a muralist, said he hopes his 
training will help him find a good job. But he won't forget his early 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find my ideas out there on the street and then I change them around to make 
up my own designs," Perez said of his computer-generated work. "Another one of 
our mottoes is 'Youth Making Their Mark.' We're trying to show our good 
qualities, and we want people to realize what we are."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; BOY'S CANCER LEADS TO LESSON IN GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days after basketball Coach Daniel Galvan asked Salesian High School 
students to give $1 each to help 5-year-old Alec Paez in his battle against 
cancer, they raised about $600. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the school presented the money to the Paez family at a basketball 
game, the amount had swelled to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody helped," said Adrian Mendoza, 17, a senior. "People were giving 
$20, some would get change and give it, and some would give up their lunch and 
give that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students dug into their pockets. Others collected from family members or 
gathered up all their pennies to help pay for Alec's medicine, which costs $500 
a week, and help send him and his parents to Lourdes, France, and Fatima, 
Portugal, which are considered holy places by devout Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec's cancer was diagnosed in January, 1992. He has undergone surgery, 
chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said the effort has brought the school of 300 boys closer and touched 
the hearts of the Paez family, who returned from France Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was presented to the family Feb. 11 at a halftime ceremony. Alec, 
who doctors give just a 4% chance of surviving his neuroblastoma cancer, was 
dubbed "The Mightiest Mustang" after the school mascot, and received a plaque 
and sweat shirt with that inscription. Cheerleaders gathered a box of toys and 
the football team gave him an autographed football. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother said, 'Thank you,' but I said, 'No, thank you. You've given our 
kids the opportunity to do this,' " said Principal Manuel Villareal. "It's so 
hard to educate on values and service." 
</P>
<P>
 Galvan had heard about Alec's plight through his wife, Irma, a secretary at 
Montebello's St. Benedict School, where Alex attended classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, he has only attended his favorite class, computers, and an 
occasional Friday cooking class, said Olivia Kelly, the boy's kindergarten 
teacher. Alec is a practical joker when he is feeling well, she said, but 
mostly these days the medicine's side effects wear him out and give him nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to see him, but he's very lovable. You can tell when you hug him a 
certain way, you can tell it hurts," Kelly said, adding that the 45 students in 
her class know their friend is ill. They call him frequently from the phone in 
the classroom and some end their conversations crying.  
</P>
<P>
 This morning's pancake breakfast is the latest fund-raiser that St. Benedict 
has held for the Paez family. The school's annual fund-raising St. Patrick's 
Day dance will be another, said Irma Galvan. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec's father, David, was recently laid off from his Vons supermarket job, and 
his insurance will run out in March, said Gloria Uribe, Alec's maternal 
grandmother. Uribe is the mother of Alec's mother, Jean Marie Paez. 
</P>
<P>
 The students at Salesian plan to keep in touch with Alec and help the family 
in any way they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have been very giving," Galvan said. "They ask me all the time how 
he's doing. They understand what they have and they're more than willing to be 
there. These kids have tremendous heart."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; EX-WORKERS PICKET NEW MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former employees of the JonSons Markets and members of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers International Union are picketing the company that bought 
the buildings, accusing it of hiring new workers at lower wages and providing 
fewer benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 JonSons closed its locations at 4831 and 3425 Whittier Blvd. on Jan. 7, giving 
150 employees 30 days' notice that they would be out of their jobs. K. V. Mart 
Co. of Long Beach bought the buildings and opened Top Valu markets at those 
locations in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to District Manager Rod Simpson, K. V. Mart received applications 
from 5,000 people and hired 140 in time for the stores' openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who applied, just 8% were former JonSons employees, said Steve 
Gigliotti, an attorney for K. V. Mart, and fewer than half of them were hired. 
He could not say exactly how many former employees are working at the two 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The union picketed a Valu Plus Food Warehouse opening in Maywood last week, 
with about 70 people yelling for higher wages for employees. Valu Plus and Top 
Valu markets are owned by K. V. Mart Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the picketers was Abdom Pinon, 44, who had worked for JonSons for 18 
years and was an assistant manager when the store closed. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other former employees and union officials said K. V. Mart did not hire 
many former JonSons employees because it feared they might vote in a union 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're paying $8 an hour for an experienced cashier and I was making 
$14.50," said Thanh-Thuy Alvarez, 26, who had worked at JonSons for nine years. 
"What I liked about it the best was the benefits, because when you have kids 
and you need to take them to the doctor, that was always available." 
</P>
<P>
 Cashiers at the Top Valu markets make $6 to $12 an hour, said Simpson, who 
added that K. V. Mart did not buy out JonSons and has no obligation to run the 
markets as JonSons did. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters said many of the workers are denied full medical coverage because 
they are not full-time employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said 95% of the workers qualify for full benefits without paying into 
the plan. The rest do not qualify for the package because they work fewer than 
24 hours per week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union plans continuous demonstrations at K. V. Mart stores over the next 
several weeks to discourage shoppers from frequenting them, said Brian J. 
Young, assistant to the director of special projects and organizing for the 
UFCW Local No. 770. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said non-union companies have an unfair advantage over markets with 
union contracts because labor costs are much lower. Pickets distributed 
leaflets with names and locations of markets that have union contracts and 
asked shoppers to spend their money in union stores. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; LABOR SECRETARY VISITS SKILLS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich visited the East Los Angeles Skills 
Center recently to see for himself how job training can help displaced workers 
find new careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here trying to find the kind of job training that actually works," 
Reich told students in a computer class. "This center is one of the most 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 As he moved from class to class, Reich promoted the welfare-reform and 
health-care plans proposed by the Clinton Administration. He also told students 
he was interested in increasing the number of training programs to help former 
auto and space-industry workers who have lost their jobs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "One idea that people keep coming up with is the need for better information 
on what skills are needed (in the work force)," Reich said. "The worst thing is 
to be trained for a job that doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Students told him that a lack of affordable child care is one of the greatest 
impediments to enrolling in a training program. One woman said she waited 2 1/2 
years for good child care before she could enter the school's training programs 
in an effort to get off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student said he has been put on job waiting lists with the state, 
county and city and was one of 300 applicants for a part-time job that he did 
not get. "That's the staggering reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center moved to its location at 3921 Selig Place two years ago after 25 
years on Monterey Pass Road. Of about 3,500 adults enrolled in its programs, 
about 1,200 graduates from the 1992-93 school year were employed after they 
left the school, said Assistant Principal Roger Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 The school offers programs in office assistance, medical office assistance, 
auto mechanics, mobile electronics, telephone and cable-TV installation, basic 
drafting, machinery and basic electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also enrolls about 500 high school students who have dropped out of 
other schools and are earning their diplomas through the Alternative Education 
Work Center Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich encouraged the students to continue their efforts at training for jobs 
that pay well. "The most important ingredient in getting a good job is the 
ambition. All of you deserve a lot of credit for what you're doing right now," 
he said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of unresolved paperwork with two county departments, Principal Joshua 
Smith was forced to close the Word of God Alternative School's first through 
12th grades three weeks ago. Only the preschool was in session last week at the 
Western Avenue campus, and its fate remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can get a minimum of $10,000 to make my payroll, I can keep on," Smith 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's financial troubles began in August, when it requested payment for 
three students attending through an agreement with the Department of Children's 
Services. Monthly tuition, excluding books and registration, is $325; parents 
who qualified for government aid could get most of those costs covered. Smith 
said he was expecting payment from the Department of Social Services or the 
Department of Children's Services, both of which fund school-payment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the student body swelled to 130 after Smith admitted 23 
additional students with Children's Services paperwork in September with the 
understanding that they too would be paid for by that department. But by late 
October, Smith had still received no county money, and the $400,000 that had 
been budgeted for the school year was quickly running out. He said the $20,000 
shortfall has left him unable to pay teachers or himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Chass, a finance officer with Children's Services, said the department 
is unable to help because only one of the 23 students submitted properly signed 
papers. The rest, he said, were Children's Services contracts improperly 
authorized by workers at Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to track down where these contracts came from," Chass said. 
"We've been working with Social Services to clear this up since October. 
Clearly something has gone terribly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Social Services had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, talk is purely academic for Smith, who is barely able to keep 
the electricity on and the water running. His teaching staff is down to four 
from 15, and he said Friday's preschool sessions may have been the school's 
last.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 41-year-old community activist, minister and school administrator, 
said he founded Word of God six years ago at the urging of parents who wanted 
him to use his educating skills to personalize classroom instruction. With 
about 15 students per teacher, many who had been labeled as troubled or 
academically irredeemable began to flourish. The school was lauded by local 
educators and politicians such as former Mayor Tom Bradley and state Sen. Diane 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Former students still gathered at the campus as late as last week for ad hoc 
study sessions.

<P>
 "I had never really thought about going to college until I came here and met 
Mr. Smith," said 19-year-old Michael Younger, a senior who spent a year at Word 
of God. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other former students, Carolyn Cole, 15, is reluctantly shopping for 
another school. "I got a lot more attention here," said Cole, whose sister and 
uncle also attended the school. "The environment, the lack of violence was what 
I really liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said a different environment was what he strove to create. "Kids came 
here angry enough to put holes in the walls," he said. "I was tired of seeing 
bright, talented kids not getting the attention they needed." ERIN J. AUBRY

 California's economy may still be dragging, but Ralph Smith says his newest 
venture, a training school for emergency medical attendants, is off to a brisk 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've graduated the first class of 30, and now we're halfway through the 
second," said Smith. "The wait list for the next group is filled. We're growing 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith, 64, a lifelong entrepreneur known locally as Smitty, the nonprofit 
school, called A.P.T., is a logical extension of the emergency and 
non-emergency medical transportation companies he has run for the past 14 years 
at Crenshaw and Coliseum boulevards. A.P.T. Ambulance and A.P.T. Medical 
Transportation provide backup service and personnel for cities, major hospitals 
and medical centers -- including UCLA and Midway -- as well as transportation 
for senior citizen centers, convalescent homes, centers for the developmentally 
disabled and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their service has been very good," said Roland Santos, assistant 
administrator of Golden West Convalescent Hospital in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working with them at least once a week for a few months, and 
they're always on time with the ambulance and wheelchair vans that we usually 
need. The size and efficiency of their operation is impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who founded the school in October with one instructor, wanted to start 
something in South and Central Los Angeles that would generate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The school operates out of a building at 5221 W. Jefferson Blvd., one of 
several buildings Smith owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said it costs $3,000 to train each student. He is applying for a 
government grant for funding but is paying out of his own pocket in the 
meantime. "This is my in-kind contribution to the community," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Students who complete their training must pass a county exam to become 
certified as emergency attendants for ambulances, dialysis and other medical 
centers throughout the state. The cost of eight weeks' training is $100; A.P.T. 
has a pass-or-don't-pay policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical attendants start out earning $6 to $7 per hour, students say 
the training is a good entrance into the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of hands-on experience and learned a lot of terminology that will 
be useful later on,' said 22-year-old Monique Jamison, a Crenshaw resident who 
is employed with A.P.T. and plans to become a registered nurse. "It's a great 
steppingstone in terms of a medical career."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith started his enterprise with a single ambulance in 1979. Today, his 
companies employ about 1,000 workers in medical and non-medical areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the only minority-owned emergency and non-emergency medical 
transportation business in the country," he said with more than a hint of 
pride. "But the bottom line is: We offer great service. That's why we're 
expanding." ERIN J. AUBRY

 American Tours International presented a $50,000 check to Urban League 
officials last week to launch a tourism and travel industry training program in 
March that will operate in conjunction with the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be schooled in tourism and travel trade, including customer 
relations, sales, booking and tour announcing.Once training is complete, ATI 
will place most of the graduates in positions within the company, said Urban 
League President John Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 Training, free to the participants, will be conducted at the Urban League's 
Crenshaw headquarters at 3450 Mount Vernon Drive, and ATI's corporate office at 
6053 W. Century Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the classes has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The check presentation came during the grand opening of the company's 
corporate headquarters near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old ATI has a history of involvement with the Urban League. Last 
fall, the company sponsored a two-week cross-country bus tour that allowed 69 
local teen-agers to travel across the nation and meet President Clinton at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said that ATI President Noel Irwin-Hentschel, a South Los Angeles native 
who was also recently named to the Urban League board, is setting a good 
example to other companies by demonstrating a solid commitment to building Los 
Angeles.

 A Covina church group dedicated to interracial relationships is building a 
computer and recreation room at the 28th Street/Crenshaw YMCA, 1006 E. 28th St. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to bring inner-city teen-agers off the streets so they can get 
computer education as well as recreation," said Cynthia Boutte, executive 
director of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridging the Gap, an organization with Faith Community Church and other 
congregations, was formed to grapple with deep-seated cultural 
misunderstandings after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, group member Ed Martin, who is on the board of the Crenshaw YMCA, 
suggested the project. Faith Community Church paid most of the $2,750 for 
materials, and several group members donated the labor needed to turn a storage 
room without finished walls, ceiling or floors into a teen center with space 
for computers, recreational games, music, videos, typewriters and adding 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation room would have cost about $6,500 without the donated time and 
labor, Martin said. Faith Community paid most of that, along with the First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church and Scan Health Plan. The room will open 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really exciting that so many people came together," Martin said. "In 
these times when you've got the riots saying we can't live together, this makes 
a statement that maybe we can." DEBORAH SULLIVAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; REDISTRIBUTE PUBLIC HOUSING, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling for an end to "the inequitable distribution of public housing" in Los 
Angeles, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. is asking the City Council to consider a 
motion that would require other council districts to develop more low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion calls for the city's Planning Department to submit a report 
outlining each district's share of public housing, and recommends that the 
Housing Authority "limit the development of public housing to communities that 
have not fully contributed to their 'fair share.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's motion came just days before families began moving into a new 
nine-unit public housing development in his 15th District, which includes Watts 
and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 65% of the city's public housing units are in the 15th and 14th 
districts, which include Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Highland Park and Eagle 
Rock, while Districts 2 and 11, which include parts of the Valley and West Los 
Angeles, have less than 1%, according to Svorinich's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an overproliferation of public housing in certain areas of the city 
that (has) contributed to deterioration along with the issues such as lack of 
schools, city services and economic infrastructure to support these public 
housing developments," Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem in developing public housing in other districts is the 
cost of the land, said Housing Authority spokesman Marshall Kandall. All 
funding for new public housing comes from the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, Kandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the land is too expensive, we can't even begin to think about (building). 
How can you build low-income housing on land that's above the spending limits 
you are allowed (by the federal government)?" Kandall said. "And people have an 
attitude that they don't want a Jordan Downs or a Nickerson Gardens in their 
neighborhood, but that's not how public housing exists anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's motion would allow the council to provide funding to help buy land 
in cases where the high cost of the property could be an obstacle to developing 
public housing. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; ASIANS LAMBASTE IMMIGRANT-BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With speeches, poetry, drumbeats and slide shows, local students and community 
activists put an Asian face on the topic of immigrant-bashing during the 13th 
annual Day of Remembrance program at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, the program 
marked the 1942 signing of Executive Order 9066, which sent hundreds of 
thousands of Japanese Americans to internment camps during World War II in the 
midst of war hysteria. The program aims to educate, inspire and motivate Asian 
Americans in human and civil rights issues, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of Kay Ochi, the coalition's Los Angeles chapter president, the 
Day of Remembrance "commemorates the entire experience . . . the devastating 
effects of the order" and honors "the struggle and courage of the Issei and 
Nisei (first- and second-generation Japanese American) pioneers."  
</P>
<P>
 The groups participating in the Feb. 19 program addressed the immigration 
issue and anti-immigrant sentiment. Speakers warned that immigrants are the 
scapegoats for a bad economy and other woes, and that the recent debate over 
illegal immigration has fueled negative attitudes toward all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Ancheta, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant 
Rights of Los Angeles, said racism and "mean-spiritedness" have characterized 
discussions of immigration throughout history. He said that attitudes such as 
"Immigrants use up our resources" and "Immigrants are outsiders" have 
influenced passage of restrictive anti-Asian immigration laws -- starting with 
the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act -- that blocked immigration from various Asian 
countries and prohibited citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parallels with the past are striking," Ancheta said, pointing out the 
recent debate over earthquake public assistance for illegal immigrants. But, he 
said, illegal immigrants contribute to the economy by paying property and sales 
taxes, and by taking low-paying jobs that many others disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-immigrant arguments are based "more on myth than fact, on rhetoric than 
reality," Ancheta said. "Immigrants aren't nameless faces. . . . They're 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean and Japanese 
communities brought this point home with slide presentations and musical and 
poetic compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly poignant was poetry read by Nancy Yoo, in which she honored her 
Korean immigrant parents -- her seamstress mother who works long, grueling 
hours for little pay and her father, who runs a South-Central shoe repair shop. 
Her father's fatigue is often misread by others as coldness and apathy, Yoo 
said. Though he patches shoes, "he has not the power to patch your community," 
Yoo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program concluded with a presentation of the coalition's Fighting Spirit 
Award to James Matsumoto Omura, former editor of the Rocky Shimpo newspaper in 
Denver. Omura was recognized for the courageous individualism he demonstrated 
when he took the controversial stand of supporting Japanese American draft 
resisters in World War II. IRIS YOKOI

<P>
 LAMP, a Skid Row organization that houses, feeds and employs the mentally ill 
homeless, will use a federal housing grant to hire three of its residents to 
conduct outreach in local parks, missions, shelters and encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently awarded $112,080 to 
LAMP, allowing the organization to hire workers to encourage the mentally ill 
to come in off the streets to the day center at 627 San Julian St. for 
counseling and support services. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also provides an 18-bed shelter for those with more serious 
problems, said Mollie Lowery, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 LAMP has attempted outreach on a sporadic basis but never had the staff to 
conduct a regular program until now, Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1985, LAMP also operates a transitional housing project to help 
residents ease into living on their own, a low-rent apartment building for 
those who can and wish to live on their own, and four businesses -- a 
self-service laundry, a commercial laundry, public showers and a convenience 
store -- that employ LAMP residents. The 48-bed transitional residence and the 
four businesses are at LAMP Village, 527 S. Crocker St., and the 50 furnished 
apartments are at LAMP Lodge, 660 S. Stanford St. 
</P>
<P>
 LAMP serves about 500 people annually. Rents paid by the residents and revenue 
from the businesses account for 25% of LAMP's funding. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; RECYCLING CENTER MAY FACE CLOSURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A City Council committee last week agreed with city zoning officials that a 
Skid Row recycling center should close because it is a public nuisance that has 
failed to curb its crime and trash problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The full council will review the Planning and Land Use Management Committee's 
recommendation at a future date. If the council agrees with the committee and 
zoning officials, it can order city building and safety officials to revoke 
Carousel Recycling Center's operating permit and board up the center if it 
fails to close voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Light, the center's attorney, said he will continue to challenge the 
city's orders. He has filed a lawsuit to fight a set of city-ordered 
improvements, which he has said are unreasonable and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 If a judge rules that the city's conditions, imposed a year ago, are 
reasonable, "we'll comply with the closure," Light said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents, business owners and police say the recycling center at 
612-614 E. 7th St. attracts large numbers of homeless who litter, urinate, 
drink, use drugs and engage in prostitution. In response to complaints, city 
zoning officials last year ordered the center to hire a security guard and 
clean up after and shoo away loitering customers, or face closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The center did not comply with the conditions, which Light said were too much 
of a hardship for the small business. Light then filed the lawsuit to block the 
city from requiring the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, according to Light, center operator Ruy Gomez has taken other 
steps to try to improve conditions, such as hiring an additional employee to 
clean surrounding streets and encourage loitering customers to move. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors and police officers continued complaining to city zoning 
officials. The opponents advocated relocating or closing the center, saying the 
facility's customers continued to crowd streets and that drug activity, 
prostitution and burglaries remained high. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator Jon Perica last September ordered the center to 
shut down. Light appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals, which in November 
agreed with Perica and upheld the closure order. 
</P>
<P>
 Light has consistently contended that the center is being unfairly blamed for 
the neighborhood's ills by area property owners who refuse to help solve the 
problems themselves. He accused opponents of simply being against recycling 
efforts and helping the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Light also said his efforts to meet with neighbors on behalf of Gomez have 
been rebuffed. IRIS YOKOI

 As a teen-ager in the 1960s, French longed to attend the school with her 
friends. Brain-damaged at birth, she was unable to attend a mainstream campus 
because of her physical and speech problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But French recently appeared onstage at the campus as one of the performers in 
"Breaking Through the Wall," a collection of sketches, music and poetry dealing 
with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective of the show, written and performed primarily by people with 
disabilities, was to break down stereotypes and revise attitudes toward the 
disabled, said French, who also produced the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't pity us and don't put down our lives," she said. "We really like (life) 
and we're not ready to give up or commit suicide. But that's what so many 
people expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal was to provide positive role models for the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really amazed to see me up on stage," French said. "It gives them 
something else to aim for, instead of sitting there and being a nonentity." 
</P>
<P>
 During a morning performance at Huntington Park High, French introduced 
sketches while seated in her wheelchair. But to the 500 students in the 
audience, she was standing tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a lot of courage," said sophomore Laura Vasquez, 15, who has been in 
a wheelchair all her life. "It influences other people not to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Students howled as a deaf actor performed a comic rap piece, "Deaf Master 
Jam," that poked fun at those without disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some recognized themselves in the insensitive attendant who cannot accept the 
independence of her wheelchair-bound charge. 
</P>
<P>
 And they squirmed listening to French's poetry: 
</P>
<P>
 I can be good.  
</P>
<P>
 I can be bad.  
</P>
<P>
 The wheelchair is not me.  
</P>
<P>
 What sets the show apart is that it is "not about the disabled, it's by the 
disabled," French said. "People aren't talking about us. We're doing it 
ourselves and showcasing our talent. That's important because people think 
we're dependent on other people. Yes, we need some help but, given the 
opportunity, we can do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the program were excerpted from a show developed by the Center 
Theatre Group at the Mark Taper Forum. French received a $10,000 grant from the 
Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department to hire seven other actors and stage 
the show at four district high schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, French would like to create a video of the show so its message can 
reach a wide audience without the expenses and difficulties involved with a 
live production. MARY HELEN BERG

 Four families who allege that their landlord ignored complaints of raw sewage, 
rat infestation and other health and safety problems on his property have filed 
suit against him, seeking up to $1 million in punitive damages.  
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit against Dr. Charles Sassoon, a Huntington Park-based 
obstetrician, and his brother Albert will be heard in Norwalk Superior 
Court.The trial is expected to last five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Levario, a city building inspector who will testify in the trial, said 
conditions at the detached-unit apartment complex at 5516 Gotham St. were "very 
hazardous" and called it "a pretty bad piece of property." The city inspected 
the 11-unit property at least 39 times during a two-year period, Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite numerous orders from city inspectors and the city Rehabilitation 
Appeals Board, the Sassoons failed to correct conditions that included faulty 
plumbing; broken windows, doors and security gates; a leaky roof; rusted 
showers; rodents, and garbage on the property, Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was sent to a city prosecutor and Charles Sassoon pleaded no contest 
in February, 1992, to misdemeanor charges of failing to correct substandard 
conditions, according to a city memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced to three years' probation and fined about $2,500. Albert 
Sassoon did not appear at the proceeding last year and a warrant was issued for 
his arrest. His attorney, Roger Shafer, said his client has been out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson L. Cohen, attorney for the plaintiffs, said his clients will seek 
damages of $5,000 per family in back rent, $50,000 per family for emotional 
distress and up to $1 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer refused to comment on the case. MARY HELEN BERG

COVER STORY; THE MEN RUSH EACH VEHICLE THAT PULLS OVER, COMPETING FOR THE 
CHANCE TO EARN THEIR DAILY BREAD. THE SCENE IS REPEATED ACROSS CENTRAL LOS 
ANGELES, SPARKING PROTESTS FROM RESIDENTS AND MERCHANTS. NOWHERE IS THE 
CONFLICT MORE INTENSE THAN IN LADERA HEIGHTS, WHERE COMPLAINTS HAVE PROMPTED A 
PROPOSAL TO BAN DAY LABORERS FROM SEEKING JOBS ON MANY STREETS.; JUST WHOSE 
SIDEWALKS ARE THEY, ANYWAY?

 Dawn has barely broken, but Pedro Ortiz is already at his regular spot, hoping 
to be among the lucky few picked up for work that day. It has been a week since 
his last job, yet the day laborer says he has little choice but to keep 
returning to the Ladera Heights street corner. He has a wife and three children 
to feed, and he has been unable to land a regular job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran immigrant is one of about 25 to 100 men who gather daily near 
the HomeBase home improvement store at Slauson and Fairfax avenues. Like fans 
spotting their favorite star, the men rush each vehicle that pulls over, 
competing for the day's prize -- a chance to earn $20 to $50 for anything from 
cutting grass to busting concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is repeated every day at street corners and vacant lots across 
Central Los Angeles, where hundreds of predominantly Latino immigrants satisfy 
a steady demand for cheap labor. But their presence has also fueled controversy 
and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 At sites from Atlantic Boulevard in East Los Angeles to Pico Boulevard in 
Mid-City, residents and business owners complain of what they say are unruly 
laborers. Nowhere has the conflict been more intense than in Ladera Heights, 
where the complaints prompted a proposed county ordinance that would prohibit 
day laborers from many sidewalks and streets in unincorporated areas of Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights residents say the workers litter the area, urinate in public, 
gamble, obstruct traffic and harass women. About 200 residents showed up at a 
community meeting in April, which organizers held to "take back" the 
neighborhood from day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a major, major problem. No question about it," complained Coula 
Fuller of the Ladera Heights Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their advocates counter that the workers' behavior has 
been blown out of proportion and that they are being unfairly blamed for the 
actions of a few bad apples. They charge that some of the criticism is 
motivated by racism and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here because we have to," said Ortiz, 26, who added that day laborers 
do the jobs that many others refuse to do. "We have a right to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance was introduced last year by county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, whose 1st District includes Ladera Heights. Under the 
measure, which the Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on in March, day 
laborers would be prohibited from soliciting work on public rights-of-way 
within 500 feet of churches, schools or residential areas. The ban would also 
apply to commercial parking lots, although it could be waved if a property 
owner authorizes day laborers to use the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Burke said an enforcement mechanism is needed to prevent 
workers from congregating near homes and apartments. "A residential area cannot 
accommodate that type of activity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union say the measure would 
violate state and federal constitutional rights to work and solicit employment. 
They vow to challenge the ordinance in court if it is approved. The ACLU, in 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal, is challenging a similar law in the west San 
Fernando Valley city of Agoura Hills. That law prohibits day laborers from 
soliciting work from public thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this ordinance is designed and intended to ban the speech of 
those who are most unfortunate in our society," said ACLU attorney Robin Toma. 
"You simply cannot outlaw people from a public sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
 The day labor phenomenon has its roots in the decades-old California tradition 
of relying on inexpensive Latin American labor, which dates back to the bracero 
program of the 1940s, said David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta 
California Research Center, a Los Angeles think tank that studies Latino 
issues. Under that program, thousands of Mexican citizens were brought to the 
state to work the fields during the growing season. Hayes-Bautista said day 
laborers began appearing in rural areas in the early 1960s and had spread to 
urban communities by the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the Ladera Heights day laborers have gathered at various 
sites in a parking lot of the shopping center that houses the HomeBase store. 
Groups also wait across the street on Slauson and Fairfax avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Located between Baldwin Hills and Inglewood, Ladera Heights is an affluent, 
largely African American community known for its spacious hillside homes and 
sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz and other day laborers gather there because the flow of HomeBase 
customers guarantees prospective patrones -- bosses looking for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, who rents a small South-Central home with two other families, said he 
was laid off two years ago from his minimum-wage job making lamps at a Carson 
factory. Since then, he has lived the unstable life of a day laborer, working 
two or three days during good weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want welfare. I want work," he said as he pulled his jacket collar 
over his neck, guarding against a cold morning wind. Ortiz was the first person 
at the HomeBase site that day, arriving shortly after 6 a.m. Within two hours, 
he was joined by about 30 other men, mostly immigrants from El Salvador and 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Matias Bonilla, 51, a grandfather and a deacon at the 
evangelical Church of God of Prophecy in South-Central. "We come here to earn 
our daily bread," said Bonilla, who lost his job at a South Gate metal shop 
when it failed several years ago. His wife earns $80 a week as a baby sitter to 
help care for their four children. "We do not do anything illegal -- just look 
for work." 
</P>
<P>
 Those finding work are often the ones who speak English or who reach a vehicle 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 a.m., a gray BMW pulled into the parking lot. Out stepped a 
mustachioed man who identified himself as Mikio, a Ladera Heights resident, 
offering $5 an hour to scrape and paint his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six dollars! Seven dollars!" shouted about a half dozen workers, pushing 
against the car as they bargained for more. Mikio remained firm, and only one 
worker jumped into the BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the day laborers be outlawed from the area? 
</P>
<P>
 Mikio shrugged his shoulders. "It's better than having them steal cars and 
batteries," he offered. "At least they're working." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, a blue Mercedes-Benz arrived. The driver, who said he was a 
contractor, offered $30 apiece for several workers to operate a rope pulley for 
eight hours, lifting cinder blocks up a two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a fair wage," the man said to several grumbling workers. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven hours after the day began, only five laborers had landed jobs. The 
rest -- including Ortiz -- waited. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that idle time, residents charge, that has led to many of the problems 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the day laborers pass the day gambling, drinking, wandering the 
neighborhood and defecating and urinating in the bushes and at a church across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with them working, but it's the manner that they are 
going about it," said resident Keith Linden, complaining that the workers cause 
traffic jams and aggressively solicit customers at HomeBase. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents allege that some of the workers deal drugs, break into cars 
and homes and make vulgar remarks to women. "The word harassment doesn't even 
describe it," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that day laborers have stolen gardening equipment from her home and 
that she has captured drug deals and other illegal activities on videotape. She 
declined a request to view the video because "it's very demeaning to these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said she caught the activities by accident as she was videotaping a 
piece on sidewalk improvements, but she added that she was considering sending 
copies of the video to county supervisors before they vote on Burke's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers say the incidents Fuller complains about have been blown out of 
proportion. While they acknowledge that urination and littering did occur, they 
say they now use several trash cans provided by HomeBase and use the restroom 
at a nearby McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a lot better here," said worker Juan Carlos Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase manager Frank Gomez said he does not have many problems with the 
workers. "They've been pretty well-behaved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jack Scully, commander of the Lennox sheriff's station that covers the 
area, said residents have reported that day laborers have been involved in 
thefts. But he added that most of the laborers obey the law and are just 
looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their supporters charge that racism is behind some of the 
complaints. Many opponents are African Americans, who are showing the same 
intolerance exhibited by white residents when blacks first moved to Ladera 
Heights in the 1970s, said Nancy Cervantes, an attorney with the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an intolerance of poor Latinos," Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents deny that race is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the hell can you call me a racist?" said Don Lopez, a Mexican American 
who has led the community opposition in Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no difference to anybody what ethnicity or gender these people are," 
added Fuller. "It's an issue of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly all the day laborers in Ladera Heights are Latinos, African 
Americans also occasionally seek work there and at other Central City sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Laws, 40, an African American who grew up in South-Central, has been a 
day laborer for the past six years. "If you do a good job, you can sell 
yourself," Laws said as he looked for work at Pico Boulevard and La Brea 
Avenue. "I'm trying to hustle now, get me some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in heavily Latino areas such as East Los Angeles, there are complaints 
about day laborers. Rick Esparza, who owns Manny's El Loco Restaurant near 
Pomona and Atlantic boulevards, said the 50 or so workers who congregate near 
his business each day urinate and leave trash in an adjacent lot. They have 
also scared away female customers with sexually harassing comments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not too discreet," said Esparza, who said he has had several 
fistfights with laborers who attempted to bully him. "They tried to test me. 
But when I started throwing (them) out, they got the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses in the area have reported similar problems, said Sgt. Glenn 
Peacock, a watch commander at the East Los Angeles sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mid-City, at Pico Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, the manager of Lucy's Drive 
In complains that day laborers loitering in the parking lot frighten customers 
when they rush toward cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all you know, they could be trying to carjack you," said manager Fernando 
Alvarez, who recalled that a customer in a Mercedes-Benz recently pulled a 
handgun on several workers as they surrounded his car. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez also said the restaurant's insurance carrier is threatening to cancel 
its coverage, saying it could be held liable if a day laborer is injured in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes said such problems can be addressed through communication on both 
sides. "No one denies that there are legitimate concerns," she said. "It's how 
you deal with it that is important." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ladera Heights, she and others maintain, the proposed ordinance is an 
extreme response to a situation that could have been solved without government 
intervention. They say the law will not stop day laborers from congregating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to resolve the problem or do you want to pass a law?" asked 
long-time Ladera Heights resident Faz Elahi. He said the day laborers will 
remain so long as there is a need for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she is attempting to persuade the HomeBase property owner to allow 
a day labor facility in a lower level of the parking lot away from the street, 
which would be permissible under her ordinance. She said a private company has 
donated a trailer. And CHIRLA, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and 
several other organizations have offered about $1,200 to purchase portable 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 The site would be modeled after two that are operated by the city of Los 
Angeles in Harbor Gateway and North Hollywood. There, coffee is provided to 
laborers who receive work based on a lottery. Rules are posted prohibiting 
drinking, scrawling graffiti and harassing women. 
</P>
<P>
 The facilities were established in 1989 and 1990 after residents and business 
owners complained repeatedly about unruly workers. The City Council considered 
banning day laborers but approved the worker sites as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon at the Harbor facility, at Harbor Gateway Regional Park, 
26 of the 106 workers who signed in had received work, said manager Richard 
Johnson. Workers who were interviewed said the site was more orderly than 
chaotic street corners where people scramble for work. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the possibility of a similar operation in Ladera Heights is far from 
certain. Resident leaders say their neighborhood is not the proper place for 
day laborers and vow to oppose a hiring site at HomeBase. "I will do anything 
it takes to stop this problem," Lopez said. "I've had it." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers seeking work congregate in a restaurant parking lot. The laborers 
say they are just trying to make an honest living, but opponents, who say many 
workers are unruly, have called for a county ordinance prohibiting the laborers 
from soliciting work on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people come to streets to look for work, it is because they need to. And 
they shouldn't be stopped," says day laborer Pedro Ortiz, 26. "I do not know 
what I would do" if the practice is banned in unincorporated county areas. 
</P>

VOICES: AN ISSUE OF 'NEIGHBORHOOD DECAY'; LEGISLATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO 
MAINTAIN PROPERTY VALUES, SAYS A LADERA HEIGHTS HOMEOWNER WHO ACCUSES DAY 
LABORERS OF GAMBLING, URINATING IN PUBLIC AND LEERING AT WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLA HECTOR, Willa Hector has lived in Ladera Heights for 17 years. During 
the past 1 1/2 years, she has grown concerned about the proliferation of day 
laborers seeking work near that community's HomeBase outlet. In response, she 
and a group of neighbors have joined with County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke to create legislation that would prohibit soliciting work on public 
streets and sidewalks near residential areas. Supervisors are scheduled to 
consider the proposal March 8. Hector was interviewed by Kevin Baxter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladera is characterized as an upper-middle-class neighborhood. There are a lot 
of professional people who live here. The homes are reasonably valuable. The 
apartments have rents that are reasonably expensive. But people are willing to 
pay what they pay to live here because it's always been a nice, 
well-maintained, relatively low-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
 While others assume there's no nice place to live in the inner city and move 
to the suburbs, we chose not to do that. We worked hard for these homes and we 
worked very hard to keep our neighborhood a nice place. And it's been a very 
desirable place to live over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But we don't have to go very far to take a look and see what has happened to 
some very nice neighborhoods where the neighbors did not stand up and try to 
maintain their neighborhoods. We don't want to do that. We don't want to see 
our neighborhood decay. 
</P>
<P>
 And anything that challenges that, you're going to find that the neighbors 
here are very, very active in trying to make sure that we get whatever we need 
to keep this neighborhood a desirable place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 I first started to notice the day laborer problem about a year and a half ago. 
I noticed it because I would go out jogging every morning. At least I used to. 
I had to start taking a different route because there were so many men standing 
out on the corner. It was anywhere from 40 to 100 on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time that they are standing there, some of them would get very 
bored and you'd see them start gambling. Or they would sit on our lawns. And 
there are no (restroom) facilities on the street, so they would urinate in our 
yards. The stench of human urine was so bad that you couldn't go down the 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was not something we wanted to live with. This was destroying 
the quality of life in Ladera. So one of my girlfriends and I decided that we 
don't have to take this. But when we started calling the sheriff, what we found 
is that the loitering laws that are on the books didn't really cover this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 All they could do is ticket them; they couldn't put them in jail. The 
sheriff's deputies would go to the limit to try to urge the day laborers to get 
off our lawns and move on, but there was a limited amount they could do. But 
most of the neighbors all had the same frame of mind: They were not willing to 
accept having day laborers in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 There's sympathy for the day laborers, absolutely. Everybody understands 
perfectly why they are there. Obviously they need to make a living. And we do 
understand that if people did not pick them up and utilize their labor, they 
wouldn't be doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first solution was to find a site away from the homes where people can 
find them. After we looked at the lay of the land in Ladera Heights, we found 
there isn't any place in Ladera for that to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 What we came to after looking at it and weighing a lot of alternatives was 
that there wasn't an alternative to legislation. The only choice we had is to 
try to get some kind of legislation to make it illegal for this to take place 
in a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not sophisticated politicians, and we did not know what we were opening 
up. We thought of it as a neighborhood issue. We look at it like zoning. But 
now we've been drawn into a situation where we have no choice but to understand 
that we're part of a larger picture. The people who are advocates for the day 
laborers are certainly looking at it in the bigger context. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the reason the ACLU and other groups are interested in seeing what it 
is we do here is because they're afraid that whatever happens here might set a 
precedent for other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds selfish, but we weren't concerned about what effect it would have 
overall. I find it very frustrating that we are just trying to maintain the 
quality of life in our neighborhood and that fact is being used as if we are 
being racist and trying to destroy the quality of life for other people. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a Latino issue. Everybody is trying to make it seem as though it 
is. It is not. The issue in our neighborhood is the behavior. The practice of 
blocking the streets and the practice of flagging folks down and blocking 
traffic and those kinds of things. Those are the issues. And leaving trash and 
litter and defecating and urinating. And gambling and leering at women. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope we can come up with a solution that everybody can live with. If people 
are out of work and need work, can't we find some solutions other than having 
them hang out on the streets? That should not be the only way.

By JUAN CARLOS RUIZ, Five, six, sometimes seven mornings a week, Juan Carlos 
Ruiz rides the bus from a stop near his Inglewood apartment to the corner of 
Slauson and Fairfax avenues in Ladera Heights, where he joins dozens of men in 
front of a HomeBase outlet in a long, frequently futile wait for day work. 
Ruiz, 30, has been making the trip for three years and says the routine makes 
him feel as though he has stable work. He has also managed to build a 
clientele, a second reason why he has joined with other day workers, 
representatives of the ACLU, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and 
the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles in fighting proposed 
legislation to ban the solicitation of work on public streets in unincorporated 
county areas. Ruiz was interviewed by Kevin Baxter.

<P>
 I'm one of the new ones at this corner, but I have friends who have been here 
four or five years. It's very difficult to change what's become part of your 
life and move to another corner. We prefer to remain because we're trying to 
achieve some stability in our work. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now it's very, very difficult to get work. And we have people who know 
us at that corner. It would be very difficult for us to move from that area, 
especially if it's just because of an absurd and stupid law. That's why it's 
difficult for us to say, "OK, pass the law, kick us out of here and we'll 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 No, we have to fight, because this is how we support ourselves. Being at that 
corner is how we pay our bills; it's how we survive. And we're not doing it in 
a way that's illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Our life is very, very hard. Even people who have a stable income are 
struggling, and that life is very different from ours. Sometimes we make good 
money. I'm not going to say we always get just the minimum wage. But most of 
the time, the most we're going to get in a day is $50. And we have to work 
very, very hard for that. 
</P>
<P>
 If you work three times in a week, that's $150, and with that $150 you have a 
family to support, rent to pay, bills to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 We know how to save and we know how to take care of the little money we make. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we have to go to another corner, where there's a lot more people and a 
lot less work, the amount of money we'll be able to make will be reduced 
drastically. So you can see we have a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, the dispute with the residents has been caused by a combination 
of discrimination and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 The racism comes in because there are people who only and simply see what they 
want to see there. And ignorance because people have been misinformed. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been accused of lots of silly things. They've accused us of taking care 
of our "necessities" in their yards. If I did that in front of their house, 
you're going to call the police! 
</P>
<P>
 They accuse us of abusing children with our actions. But many of us have 
children and wives, and we can't act like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us are educated and we're trying to act like civilized people. This 
really bothers me that they've taken this outlook toward us. It offends us. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the problems started, we knew we had to take drastic measures among 
ourselves to make everyone understand that we are not delinquents nor people 
who have no morals. We're good people. 
</P>
<P>
 So we talked among ourselves and came up with some rules of conduct. Whether 
you like them or not, whoever comes to the corner has to accept them because 
they are our rules of conduct and we will enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
 We've said it is prohibited to drink beer there. It's prohibited to gamble. 
Showing a lack of respect for women is prohibited. It's prohibited to litter. 
Anything that would be bad for the community is prohibited among us. 
</P>
<P>
 This was our idea and it's been a reaction to the situation. We're ready to 
reach an agreement with the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is becoming a national problem. There are a lot more corners 
where people go looking for work now than there were before. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the economy is terrible, there are going to be people seeking work 
on the street corners. That's why we're there. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's better that people go looking for work on the street corners rather 
than going on welfare or taking food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not a burden on this society. The country, the United States, the 
government, doesn't give us welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't pay our rent. It doesn't pay our bills. We have to look for ways to 
do that ourselves. I'm not going to go and sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going to do anything against my moral principles. We prefer to work -- 
even if it's only for $30 or $40 a day -- rather than stealing. But that must 
be what the people want us to do because I don't know how we're going to work 
with this new law. 
</P>
<P>
 This area, Ladera Heights, is a good area to get work. We don't want to bother 
anybody with our presence there; it's just a place to find work. Nothing else. 
We're not creating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is easy. All we have to do is really talk it out and see what 
everyone's needs are.

 Several nonprofit organizations serving Central Los Angeles have received 
earthquake-relief grants from the California Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-six organizations in the Greater Los Angeles area will eventually share 
about $579,000 in grants, the first round of grants from a pool of $1.3 million 
set aside for earthquake relief by the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants will be used for repairs, equipment replacement, relocation 
expenses and support for services affected by the quake. Those receiving 
funding were chosen from more than 225 nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles 
County that were surveyed for damage by the foundation's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the local organizations that were awarded grants are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Regis House, awarded $5,900 to move programs to another building and to 
cover the cost of buying milk for children. 
</P>
<P>

GAME OF THE WEEK; LOYOLA FOLDS IN 4TH QUARTER; PLAYOFFS: TOBY BAILEY KEPT IN 
CHECK AS MATER DEI USES ITS SIZE ADVANTAGE TO BEAT THE CUBS, 78-60, IN I-A 
SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei won as expected. But the Monarchs sweated a little more than most 
Orange County newspapers had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs used their size advantage to beat Loyola, 78-60, Friday night in 
the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals before 5,500 at Pauley Pavilion. 
The defending champion Monarchs (30-0) advanced to Saturday's finals at 
Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond, where they will play Huntington Beach Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was to be a preview of Toby Bailey, the Cubs' talented forward who is 
headed to UCLA next fall, versus Arizona-bound Miles Simon. But the 6-foot-5 
Bailey had only 16 points and 13 rebounds. He made seven of 17 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, a 6-7 senior forward, scored 30 points, and 6-5 freshman forward Schea 
Cotton added 21. Moose Bailey, Toby's younger brother, led the Cubs with 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very physical game," Loyola Coach Bill Thomason said. "They pounded 
the ball inside. We didn't have the size to compete with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Give the Cubs credit. They kept the game close for three quarters, trailing 
36-34 at the half and 53-46 entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simon opened the final quarter with two free throws and two field goals to 
put the Monarchs out front, 59-46. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs began to unravel with six minutes left when Toby Bailey tried to feed 
the ball to Bobby Thomason, the coach's son. Simon bumped Thomason and the ball 
went out of bounds. When Thomason complained, he was called for a technical 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs went to the free-throw line 12 times in the fourth quarter, 
connecting on 13 of 20 attempts. The Cubs did not attempt a free throw in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a very difficult team to play because of their press," Mater Dei 
Coach Gary McKnight said. "But this is as focused I've seen our team play all 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not Toby Bailey's best performance, but he had an excuse. The 
Monarchs not only defended him, they mugged him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They rotated three different guys on me," Bailey said. "Their job was to foul 
me as many times as they could before they fouled out. . .It was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 A player who once demanded to have the ball so he could score, Toby Bailey has 
developed into a team player. He rarely forces a shot, but scores often enough 
to lead the team in scoring for the fourth consecutive season. He averaged 22 
points, 11 rebounds and four assists this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toby is very confident in himself and very at ease. If he doesn't take a 
shot, he doesn't gripe. He doesn't need to score 20 points to feel he's played 
a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey was the first freshman to start for the Cubs, and most likely the last 
under Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started every game we played," Thomason said. "That's 103 games he put up 
with me and that's not an easy thing to do."

SETTING THE PACE; TRACK PREVIEW: SOPHOMORE MICHAEL GRANVILLE IS ALL BUSINESS AS 
HE GETS SET TO BUILD ON HIS RECORD-SETTING FRESHMAN YEAR AT BELL GARDENS HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year was a whirlwind for ninth-grade runner Michael Granville of Bell 
Gardens High. He came away with two freshman national records, an age-15 
national record and a state freshman record. 
</P>
<P>
 And from the looks of his 1994 debut, at the Sunkist Invitational at the 
Sports Arena, Granville will be picking up the pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Feb. 19 meet, Granville shattered the national sophomore indoor record 
for 500 yards, clocking 57.7 seconds, besting the 10-year-old record of Gus 
Envela of Salem, Ore., by 0.7 seconds, and beat the 1976 record of Carson's 
Henry Williams by 0.1. Granville's time is the fifth fastest on the all-time 
U.S. high school list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laps started going by faster and faster," Granville said. "I accelerated 
on the last lap and I got the record." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a feeling the 6-foot, 165-pound Granville knows well. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he set national freshman records at 800 meters and the indoor 500 
yards, timing 1 minute 51.03 seconds and 1:00.01, respectively. And he lowered 
the freshman 400 record by 1.14 seconds to 47.24 and holds the distinction of 
being the state's only ninth-grader to break 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The only freshman boy to advance to the 1993 state finals, Granville 
culminated his season with a third-place finish in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Hi Sports named Granville the magazine's State Freshman of the Year last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accomplished all I wanted to and more my freshman year," he said. "I think 
I did pretty good for a 15-year-old guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, now 16, is not ready to predict what is in store for his sophomore 
year: "People are entitled to their opinions, but I don't like to stress my 
mind thinking about records. Each time I race, my goal is to win, and if I 
continue to progress positively, the records will come." 
</P>
<P>
 He will set his sights on the 800 and a shot at the national sophomore indoor 
record of 1:54.28 in next month's National Scholastic indoor meet at Syracuse 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one record I'm sure everybody would like to have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And what would Dorsey High Coach Ralph Tilley like to have this year? A fifth 
City Section boys' championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Anthony Wheeler and Leo Settle return from last year's team, which won 
the school's fourth championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler was fifth in the state meet at 800 meters in 1:55.45, while Leo 
Settle, who has run the 100 meters in 10.62, finished second in the 200 and 
third in the 100 in last year's City finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The other City finalists for the Dons were Anthony Williams, who was second in 
the 400, and Jabulani Smith-Freeman, who was fifth in the long jump. Williams' 
fastest 49.14; Smith-Freeman's best is 23 feet, 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Dons won the 400- and 1,600-meter relays and scored in 12 of 
15 events to easily outdistance defending champion Birmingham, 81-55. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilley expects Birmingham, Taft, Washington and Fremont to be the Dons' 
biggest opposition in the quest to become the first school to win consecutive 
titles in seven years. "The competition is a lot more even this year," Tilley 
said. "I won't be disappointed if we don't win, but I will be upset if we don't 
score well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey and Washington, with junior Keisha Griffis, are among the contenders to 
unseat University for the girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis won the 300 hurdles and placed third in the 100 hurdles in last year's 
City finals. She also ran legs on the Generals' 400- and 1,600-meter relay 
teams that finished third and fourth, respectively, to give Washington a 
third-place showing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing second two of the last three years, the Cal State Los Angeles 
men will rely on strength in the sprints in the hope of capturing their first 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in five years -- and a top-five 
national finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Glenn Stewart has bests of 20.80 and 46.86 in the 200 and 400 meters, 
and junior John Hensley has run 21.57 and 47.31. 
</P>
<P>
 Keadrick Washington, a junior, was the 1992 CCAA champion in the 110 high 
hurdles and 400 intermediate hurdles. That season, he placed fourth in the 
longer race at the NCAA Division II national meet with a personal best of 
52.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In the field events, the Golden Eagles are paced by triple-jumper Dale Johnson 
and pole vaulter Danny Tapia. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has leaped 51-6 1/2, finished third at last year's national meet. 
Tapia was the 1991 state community college champion at East L.A. College and 
has cleared 16-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Padilla, the CCAA 10,000-meter champion (30:42.18), also returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State L.A. women are seeking their third consecutive CCAA title and to 
improve upon their third-place national finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Janet Hill set Division II meet records of 52-10 and 178-4 in winning 
the shotput and discus at last year's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Kimya Phillips and Marisol Cossio are other returning All-Americans in 
the discus and 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen Oshonda Posey and Marisa Avendando and sophomore Genet Gorgis are the 
top newcomers. Posey was the City Section champion at 100 meters and was third 
in the 200 for North Hollywood last season. Avendando was third in the CCAA 
cross-country championships last fall. Gorgis was the State community college 
cross-country champion at Trade Tech in November. Top Individuals to Watch

 Garfield's quest for its sixth City Section championship continues as the 
Bulldogs defeated visiting San Fernando, 2-1, Friday in a second-round City 
Section match. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldog Gerardo Gomez converted a penalty kick late in the second half for the 
winning goal, setting up a quarterfinal match worthy of a final. Undefeated 
Garfield (8-0-3) will host Belmont (7-1-2) in a rematch of the 1991-92 final 
where the Bulldogs garnered their fifth City title with a 2-1 win. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield dominated most of the game Friday, outshooting the Tigers, 6-2 in the 
first half and 7-3 in the second. Oscar Fuentes found the net first on a 
half-volley at close range in the 15th minute. The Tigers (4-4-1) tied in the 
52nd minute when striker Ruben Bolanos broke from his defender and tapped the 
ball over the goalie's head. The decisive goal came with 10 minutes remaining 
after a Tiger defender tripped up Bulldog Giovanni Hernandez inside the goal 
area to set up the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando replaced South Gate in the match after the Rams were forced to 
forfeit all their games because of an academically ineligible player. South 
Gate school officials hadn't noticed that striker Carlos Osorio's new name 
wasn't in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't tell me that he changed his name on his school records (after his 
mother married in December) so we didn't notice that he was on the 
(academically) ineligible list," said Rams Coach Tony Dauer. 
</P>
<P>
 Osorio was instrumental in the Rams' advance to the playoffs, Dauer said, 
scoring five goals in the season. "Without him we probably wouldn't done as 
well as we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garfield-Belmont winner will play San Pedro (10-0-1) or Locke (6-3-1) in 
the semifinals Thursday. In the upper bracket, Bell (10-0-1) will meet Van Nuys 
(7-2-2) and Hamilton (8-2) will play Kennedy (8-1). The final will start at 2 
p.m. Saturday at East Los Angeles College. The girls' final will start there at 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
 In other second-round action: 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont 3, North Hollywood 1 -- An 11th-minute goal by Carlos Tejas inside of 
the penalty area put the Sentinels on the board, but the Huskies (4-5-2) tied 
it 10 minutes later. Midway through the second half, defender Fernando Bautista 
scored on a rebound to put Belmont out front and striker Jose Salmeron secured 
the win with a goal five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 4, Granada Hills 2 -- The Eagles' short one-touch-passing style paid off 
with four goals in a tense match. Bell striker Jorge Iberri led scorers with 
two goals, the first at the five-minute mark. Maynor Alvarez's goal gave the 
Eagles a 2-0 lead going into the second half. After Iberri's second talley, the 
Highlanders (4-2-2) closed the gap to one. With four minutes left, Hector 
Galdamez ended the drama with the security goal. In 11 games, the Eagles 
scoring machine has made 50 goals, allowing just eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke 2, Wilson 1 -- Orlando Ortega and Oscar Zendejas put the the Saints 
(6-3-1) up 2-0 by the half, to upset the Mules (6-2-2) at Wilson. Senior Victor 
Arana scored the Mules' only goal in a collision with Saint goalie Fernando 
Tizcarino. Tizcarino will miss the next match. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday first-round action: 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont 5, Carson 0 -- Salvador Gochez sealed the playoff victory with two 
goals in the second half, eliminating the Colts (3-5-2) in the first round.  
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills 3, Roosevelt 2 -- With 15 minutes left to play, the Highlanders 
scored three times to knock out the Roughriders (3-4-1). Roosevelt had been 
leading on goals by Jesus Perez and Alfonso Fuentes. Girls' Playoffs 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth 2, Garfield 0 -- The Bulldogs (7-2-1) held off the five-time 
defending City Section champions to just one goal each half. Senior Liz 
Oyarzabal finished the season with five goals and junior Erica Herrera led 
Garfield with seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant 6, Bell 0 -- Last year's City Section finalist had no trouble handing 
the Eagles (8-1-1) their only defeat of the season to advance to the

HOLLAND'S GARDEN OF DELIGHTS; DESTINATION: NETHERLANDS; KEUKENHOF CELEBRATES 
400 YEARS OF TULIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE M. BROWN, Brown is a Time-Life Books editor in charge of the Lost 
Civilizations series. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a way, I was reminded of Oz. 
</P>
<P>
 As we entered Holland's Keukenhof gardens last spring, instead of poppies to 
either side of our path, there were tulips, big red ones, the size of candy 
apples. And like Dorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man, we were 
drawn forward. The enchantment grew. Along one pond's edge, tulips and 
daffodils presented double images -- as white swans sliced through the rippling 
reflections in the water's surface. Spring flowers of every sort caught the eye 
-- fragile anemones spreading little carpets along the edges of the beds, 
fritillaria blossoms hanging bell-like from tall stalks, cherry trees dipping 
pink-laden branches to the ground. One breathtaking vista ran arrow-straight 
back through the woods in an avenue of tiny, deep-blue grape hyacinths bordered 
by yellow daffodils and more red tulips. 
</P>
<P>
 People who love spring can do no better than visit Keukenhof, the world's 
largest flower garden -- and just possibly the world's most beautiful one as 
well. Over 6 million bulbs -- tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, amaryllises -- 
bloom here each year on some 70 exquisitely landscaped acres. And the effect 
is, well . . . intoxicating. 
</P>
<P>
 I never grow tired of Keukenhof. I have been there three times over the years, 
and would go again now, if I could. It is an elixir. There couldn't possibly be 
a place where flowers delight more. And probably no more so than in 1994, which 
marks the 400th season that tulips have bloomed in the Netherlands. The 
anniversary is to be celebrated in grand style (see accompanying story on L13), 
and amid much public relations hoopla as an opportunity to lure visitors and 
their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I paid our most recent visit last spring in mid-April. We were 
staying in an Amsterdam hotel and could have taken a guided tour of the park, 
driven there in a tourist bus. But we preferred to be on our own, so that we 
could wander freely and, later, explore some of the surrounding countryside. 
Since Keukenhof lies only a half hour or so by car southwest of Amsterdam's 
Schiphol Airport, we decided to take a train from the city's main railroad 
station to the arrivals terminal and there rent an automobile for the day. This 
would save us from having to drive through city traffic and to skirt the 
omnipresent bicyclists.  
</P>
<P>
 We started early, eager to arrive at Keukenhof as close as possible to the 8 
o'clock opening. We knew from experience that Dutch spring mornings are often a 
whole lot brighter than the afternoons, and that there is nothing like crisp 
sunshine to bring out the flowers' colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving was easy. We found the roads on the way well marked, with signs 
pointing the way to Lisse, the town nearest to Keukenhof. Even if we had lost 
the way, we would not have been at a loss for directions: Almost every 
Netherlander speaks English to one degree or other.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For so beautiful a place, Keukenhof has quite an ordinary name. It means 
"kitchen garden," dating from the time when this was a vegetable patch and 
hunting park for a noble family. Entering the garden, we were instantly 
enveloped in the perfume of thousands of hyacinths. And if this weren't enough 
of a special welcome, we were serenaded by birds chirping in the newly leafed 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 H.N.T. Koster, the landscape architect who designs the flower beds, uses color 
like an oil painter, setting up strong contrasts, or subtly blending pinks, 
whites and pale blues. His intent is never to overwhelm the eye, but rather to 
lead it on. With little rises, ponds, streams and canals to separate areas, and 
the flowers winding brightly around these, he has made this an intimate place 
despite its large size. And such is Keukenhof's magic that though it can become 
very crowded (almost a million visit during the April-May season when it is 
open to the public), people seem never to get in the way. Perhaps that is 
because almost everyone walks slowly, with head bowed, mesmerized by the sight 
of flowers, flowers, flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the excitements of Keukenhof is its dazzling variety. Tulips appear not 
only in their ordinary globe-like form in a range of solid colors, but also 
with striped or variegated petals, some of the edges shirred, some ruffled, 
some fringed. Several seem more like peonies than tulips, and a few are even 
sweetly scented. Many stand only inches tall; others rise proudly on sturdy, 
three-foot stems. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 or so Dutch bulb growers and exporters who participate in the garden 
are eager to display their finest here. The growers are forever experimenting 
with crosses, seeking new strains. In a way, it is as though tulipmania, the 
obsession that seized the Dutch in the 17th Century, never quite abated. Then 
people squandered fortunes investing in bulbs that promised different colors 
and markings. The desire for rarity ran so high that individual bulbs could 
command extravagant barter prices; a single bulb was said to have been 
exchanged for a silver goblet, a bed, a fine suit of clothes, 12 sheep, eight 
pigs, four oxen and a thousand pounds of cheese. When tulipmania had reached 
its peak in 1637, the market -- as so often happens when unreality overtakes 
such ventures -- went bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanity may rule now, but the quest for the exotic continues. It is a matter of 
good business: The Dutch command the international bulb market, and they see 
the advantage in delivering to gardeners everywhere the showiest, the 
prettiest, the latest. Indeed, 95% of the bulbs planted in the world come from 
the Netherlands. Nowadays much attention is being devoted to developing bulbs 
that will withstand diseases and flourish in warm climates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As my wife and I knew from past experience, there is no one route to follow in 
Keukenhof. We found more than once that we had doubled back on ourselves, and 
didn't mind. In fact, on a couple of occasions we deliberately returned to 
spots for another view of them. The goal is to amble, to relax, to enjoy, to 
drink it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for seemingly so easy a place, nothing is left to chance. Thirty gardeners 
tend the flowers and lawns, part of a staff of 350 that includes costumed 
hostesses to answer visitors' questions. So that the garden is continually in 
bloom during the two months it is open, the flowering time of each variety is 
taken into account, and the bulbs are planted accordingly. While some are 
fading, others are just coming into full glory. From year to year the beds 
themselves are shifted, another means of cutting down on the risk of soil 
infection, and keeping the garden continually fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather can be a problem in Holland. What is spring without rain? But even 
here, only a few miles from the sea and its storms, the Dutch have taken care 
of everything. They have built a gigantic greenhouse at the center of the park, 
and it encloses another garden that presents, just like the beds outside, a 
carefully timed, ever-changing flower show.  
</P>
<P>
 Scattered throughout the garden are exhibition areas and cafes, and there is a 
large restaurant as well. Feet can grow tired on Keukenhof's 10 miles of paths, 
and we retreated to the restaurant for a cup of strong Dutch koffie and Dutch 
apple cake, made with tart apples and served under a couple of clouds of 
whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors who are stirred by the displays can buy cut flowers or, better yet, 
order bulbs to plant. Keukenhof lies in the heart of the Netherlands 
bollenstreek , the 49,000-acre bulb district between Leiden and Haarlem. 
Stretching out from the garden's boundaries in all directions are the fields of 
some of the many growers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where we headed after our morning in the park. We drove past row upon 
row of tulips, hyacinths and daffodils running straight to the horizon in 
precise rows that narrowed and converged in the distance, drenching the 
landscape in color. And more than once we saw a bulb grower wandering up and 
down his rows, wooden shoes on his feet, eyes cast down, looking for the 
genetic sport, the one unique flower that might be the basis for a whole new 
line (and make him rich). This spring, when I go out to our garden to admire 
the tulips we bought at Keukenhof (bulbs intended for the U.S. are specially 
inspected and approved for shipment), I will think gladly of him and all those 
other Dutch farmers who down through the years have given so much pleasure to 
the world. GUIDEBOOK

 Keukenhof gardens: In 1994, open 8 a.m.-7:30 p.m. from March 24 to May 23; 
admission $8 per adult, seniors $7 and children $4; local telephone 
25-211-9144. Those preferring a guided tour can obtain information about tour 
agencies from the VVV tourist office in Amsterdam, located at the main railroad 
station (tel . 20-551-2512). Travelers without cars who want to be on their own 
can avail themselves of the Netherlands Railways' Keukenhof day trips (a 
train-bus combination), leaving from the same station daily. The adventurous 
can rent bicycles in Noordwijk, a seaside resort town near the bulb district, 
and pedal through the tulip fields to Keukenhof; for information about rentals 
and routes, get in touch with the Tourist Information Board Noordwijk (tel. 
17-191-9321). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: A personal favorite in Amsterdam is the Hotel Ambassade 
(Herrengracht 335, 1016AZ; tel. 011-31-20-626-2333; double rooms $135-$145), 
consisting of several joined, 17th-Century patrician homes. It's small, 
charming and well-located, and the antiques in its lounge can rouse covetous 
instincts. We're also fond of the Hotel Pulitzer (Prinsengracht 315, 1016HX; 
tel. 011-31-20-523-5235; doubles $190-$215), bigger than the Ambassade, but 
intimate. Also made up of old canal houses, it offers a refreshing variety of 
rooms, no two of which seem alike. The Amsterdam Marriott (Stadhouderskade 
19-21, 1054ES; tel. 011-31-20-607-5555; double rooms $230-$250) lacks Old World 
qualities but is crisply efficient and well located near the Rijksmuseum, an 
advantage for art lovers. Car renters who would like to spend a night in the 
bulb district might stay at the Witte Raaf, Duinweg 117, 2204AT, Noordwijk 
(tel. 011-31- 25-237-5984, $90-$110); it's the Dutch version of a motel.

a Smile 
</P>
<P>
 Tulips have bloomed in the Netherlands for 400 years, but the flower the world 
associates with Holland isn't Dutch at all. It came to Holland via Turkey, 
where it had become the favorite of the sultans. And the Turks had gotten it, 
in turn, from the steppes of western and central Asia, its home in the wild. 
Thanks to their love for its enameled beauty, the Turks bred the little flower 
into something to bedazzle the eye. Sufficiently impressed, the Austrian 
ambassador to Turkey had several bulbs sent to the Dutch botanist Carolus 
Clusius, who in the autumn of 1593 planted them as a novelty in the garden of 
the Hortus Botanicus (Botanical Garden) in Leiden. The Dutch took to the new 
flower with a vengeance; in time even the Turks were importing breath-taking 
varieties that the Dutch had created through cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 17th Century the craze for tulips in Holland got out of hand, with 
furious speculation going on over bulbs that promised breakthrough colors and 
patterns. Three bulbs of one strikingly variegated type, Semper Augustus, sold 
for three times the price of a house on one of Amsterdam's canals just before 
the 1637 collapse of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are more than 2,700 tulip varieties, identified by name and color 
and described in the finest detail in a 300-page official registry. Many bear 
the names of famous people -- and then there are some that have made their 
namesakes famous, such as Madame Lefebre, a particularly popular bloom the 
world over. 
</P>
<P>
 In celebration of their 400-year-old love affair with the tulip, the Dutch are 
putting on many special exhibitions and garden shows from March through May 
this year. Here are a few of note: 
</P>
<P>
 Tulipmania, Inside and Out, Frans Hals Museum, De Hallen, Haarlem; local 
telephone 23-319-180. Worth a visit at any time of year for its fine collection 
of paintings, this museum increases its drawing power between March 24 and May 
23 with an exhibition of objects, paintings and prints associated with the 
17th-Century craze, and some of the rare tulips that were the cause of it. 
</P>
<P>
 400 Years of Tulips: A Source of Inspiration, Museum for the Bulb-Growing 
District, Lisse; tel. 25-211-7900. From mid-March until the middle of June, the 
museum will hold an exhibition showing how Dutch artists -- painters, weavers 
and potters -- have been inspired by the tulip. 
</P>
<P>
 Hortus Botanicus, Leiden; tel. 71-275-144. During April and May, this 
botanical garden -- the very one in which Clusius planted the first tulips in 
1593 -- will have a living tulip display featuring the tulip's family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hortus Bulborum, Limmen; tel. 22-051-529. This outdoor museum of living bulbs 
will have in bloom -- between April 10 and May 15 -- several tulip varieties 
dating back hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hortus Haren, Haren; tel. 50-632-010. From March 26 until May 22, three 
million tulips will bloom in the Tulpenhof garden; a special Turkish garden 
will trace the tulip's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Keukenhof, Lisse; tel. 25-211-9034. In addition to its spectacular sea of 
flowers, Keukenhof will present a special exhibition of paintings by European 
masters in which tulips are the focus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corso: Each year, the famous colorful parade wends its way from Haarlem to 
Noordwijk through the Bulb District with flower-decorated floats. This spring, 
the parade is scheduled for April 23, with special emphasis on the tulip's 
400th anniversary in Holland. The floats can be viewed the day before the 
parade at Hobaho Hall, Lisse.

TRAVEL INSIDER: FOR HOTEL DISCOUNTS, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD BOOK; 
BARGAINS: BOOKLET PROGRAMS AREN'T FOR EVERY TRAVELER, BUT THE RIGHT ONE CAN PAY 
FOR ITSELF IN ONE RESERVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, the flood of hotel and restaurant discount books seems to rise a 
bit higher, and the choices among them seem to get a little more complicated. 
But don't turn and run. The right booklet could easily pay for itself with the 
first reservation you make. 
</P>
<P>
 The big pitch of most programs is that once you buy their annual book (with an 
ID card included that's valid for one year), they get you a 50% discount at 
selected hotels. Most programs also offer various further discounts, such as 
special offers from cruise lines and airlines and discounts of 10% at chain 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The two catches are: a) the discount is calculated from the hotel's advertised 
"rack rate," which is much higher than most shrewd travelers pay, and b) the 
discount offer is based on availability, so if your chosen hotel expects to be 
80% full on the night of your stay, it probably won't be willing to rent any 
rooms at half off. There's a further potential complication if you usually make 
reservations through a favorite travel agent: These programs are designed for 
travelers who book their own trips, and there's no financial incentive for a 
travel agent to participate in or recommend them. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're willing to book your own room (usually between two and 30 days 
in advance) and use the hotels listed (some programs will disclose them in 
advance and some won't, but they usually cover a broad range), the savings 
possibilities are substantial. Last month, in listing the best deals to be 
found in 1994, editors of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter opined that "every 
traveler should belong to at least one half-price hotel program." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest discount book company of its kind is the 33-year-old Entertainment 
Publications Inc. (40 Oakview Drive, Trumbull, Conn. 06611; tel. 800-445-4137), 
which publishes more than 125 different discount books. When those Consumer 
Reports editors evaluated 10 discount book programs last year, they pronounced 
Entertainment their favorite "for its extensive coverage and diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Entertainment books are keyed to specific North American cities, 
from Fresno to Toronto, cost $28-$48, and offer discounts on hotels, 
restaurants and various leisure activities. But the company also publishes a 
National Dining and Hotel Directory (50% off at more than 2,800 hotels, and 20% 
off at 2,000 restaurants, for $37.95) and an Entertainment Europe book (more 
than 700 hotels in 35 nations for $48). And the Entertainment people are 
starting to market discount books based on specific areas within Europe. In 
addition to London, which was available last year, the company this year is 
adding Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden; Denmark, and the Netherlands, and next 
year plans to add Paris. (An Entertainment operator would not disclose 
participating hotels when I called as a prospective customer, but the list 
features many respected names, including branches of the Hilton, Ramada, 
Sheraton and Holiday Inn families.)  
</P>
<P>
 Another widely popular program is run by Encore Marketing International (4501 
Forbes Blvd., Lanham, Md. 20706; tel. 800-638-0930), which describes itself not 
as a publisher but a travel savings club. Still, the principles of the 
discounts are the same. Members get directories and cards; participating hotels 
offer 50% off or a second night free (which forces guests to stay two nights 
before they can capitalize on their membership). Members are also told of 
special package travel offers, rental car deals and other potential bargains. A 
year's Encore membership costs $49. The directory includes 4,000 U.S. hotels, 
another 1,000 foreign properties and several hundred restaurants, which offer 
discounts varying from 20% off to second meals for free. (When I called an 
Encore operator, she was happy to cite participating hotels in a sample city; 
the properties were roughly comparable with the Entertainment book's list.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of other programs: 
</P>
<P>
 * America at 50% Discount (1031 Cromwell Ridge Road, Baltimore, Md. 21286; 
tel. 800-248-2783). Includes roughly 1,300 hotels in the United States and 
Caribbean with half-off offers. Membership cost is ordinarily $49.95, but in a 
special promotion, callers who mention "Money" magazine are quoted a discount 
rate of $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carte Royale (131 N. State St., Suite J, Lake Oswego, Ore. 97034; tel. 800- 
847-7002). A smallish, relatively young program that specializes in more 
upscale properties (on the Automobile Club of Southern California's 
five-diamond scale, a representative said, all of these hotels would merit at 
least three diamonds). Includes about 800 hotels, the vast majority of them in 
the United States. Membership runs $71 for a year, or $131 for two years. (A 
life membership runs $301.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Great American Traveler (P.O. Box 27965, Salt Lake City, Utah 84127; tel. 
800-548-2812). Includes about four foreign hotels and 2,000 in the United 
States. No restaurants. Representatives say the usual membership rate is 
$49.95, but a current special is being offered at $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
 * ITC-50 (6001 N. Clark St., Chicago, Ill. 60660; tel. 800-342-0558). Includes 
about 2,700 hotels worldwide (a representative had no figure available for U.S. 
hotels) at 50% off, along with 300 restaurants with discounts of some kind. 
Cost is $36 yearly.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; A MILESTONE AT THE GRAND CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's millions of years old but celebrating a 75th birthday this weekend? 
None other than the Grand Canyon, which received national park status on Feb. 
26, 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 If the date slipped your mind, don't worry: The rededication ceremony isn't 
until Oct. 9, when there won't be a foot of snow on the ground, says Dennis 
Hamm of the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other commemorative events are being planned for this spring and 
summer, Hamm says, including a guest lecture series, special nature displays, 
and dramatic portrayals of Teddy Roosevelt, who first visited the area in 1903 
and who created the Grand Canyon National Monument in 1909. Details will be 
spelled out in seasonal park publications . 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4 million travelers visit the Grand Canyon each year and Maureen 
Oltrogge of the National Park Service urges travelers to begin planning now. 
"If you just show up, you're going to be disappointed," she says. "We recommend 
making (lodging and camping) reservations at least nine months in advance. 
Reservations for mule trips are taken up to two years in advance."

WEEKEND ESCAPE: CENTURY CITY; THEY CAME TO L.A. FOR A DINNER-AND-PLAY EVENING 
THAT INCLUDED TICKETS AND A ROOM WITH A VIEW OF THE THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For some weekend getaways, Los Angeles is the place to escape to , not from . 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I have always lived on the outer fringe of Los Angeles. We're 
dyed-in-the-wool suburbanites who never felt so cosmopolitan as to want to live 
in the city, or visit it regularly. Instead, we play it as a tourist 
destination when we feel beckoned to a concert, a play, a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 And from where we live in northern San Diego County, it's more than a night 
out, both in time and experience; it's an overnight getaway to the Big City, 
when I change out of my Levis and boots for a sportscoat and loafers and make 
sure the Visa card balance is paid down enough so it won't snarl with each 
swipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert Theatre 
in Century City was compelling enough reason to visit L.A. again. The last time 
we were at the Shubert was for "Les Miserables." Before that, "Chorus Line." 
"Phantom" got us to the Music Center a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We Webber fans were eager to see the composer's twist, starring Glenn Close, 
on the 1950 Billy Wilder story. But when my wife Jeanne saw a newspaper 
advertisement offering one of those overnight package deals -- $275 for a night 
at the Century Plaza and box seats for "Sunset Boulevard" -- it made a getaway 
to L.A. sound that much more attractive, earthquake-damaged freeway 
notwithstanding.  
</P>
<P>
 We thought of purchasing theater tickets separately (dates into September are 
now being sold), and then finding a place to stay nearby. But if we're going to 
pay $65 per ticket for a 2 1/2-hour play, we thought, why not go top-drawer? 
Why not really live it up and spend the night at the Century Plaza, where we 
can ditch the car and walk across the street to the Shubert?  
</P>
<P>
 We assumed, too, that the Century Plaza box seats might be especially good, 
since they're neighbors and probably worked out a nifty deal. But we'll get to 
that . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For an extra $25, we splurged for a room in the hotel's newer, 30-floor tower. 
A Friday night show was selected, and the drive that afternoon into the city 
was nothing short of spectacular. It was windy, almost blustery, and the snow 
atop Mt. Baldy glistened beneath a sparkling blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 As we crested over Interstate 10 past Claremont, the skyscrapers of downtown 
L.A., nearly 30 miles away, appeared like stalks of asparagus, shooting up from 
the basin. It was about 2 p.m. and out-bound traffic heading east on Interstate 
10 already was crawling, while we traveled at full speed. By 3 p.m. check-in 
time we pulled into the Century Plaza and with little fuss were installed in 
our quarters: a spacious and beautiful corner room on the 11th floor. The king 
bed -- one of the hardest we've experienced -- was in an alcove, helping to set 
apart the sitting area and its love seat, coffee table and desk. The room was 
done in grays, mauves and whites, with the television hidden in the whitewashed 
armoire. There were three telephones, a wet bar and a spacious bathroom with a 
double-sink vanity, ample shower and a separate deep tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Out the two sets of sliding glass doors was a view of a smog-free downtown Los 
Angeles out the front balcony, the "Sunset Boulevard" marquee and fountains on 
the Avenue of the Stars below us and, from the side balcony, downtown Santa 
Monica and the ocean. With enough wind, the city really can sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked out the goodies in the in-room mini-fridge, and was confused. Among 
the soft drinks, beer and mini-bottles of liquor (presumably for sale, but 
there was no price list), there was a carton of rice, another of macaroni and 
cheese, and a paper bag containing a piece of fried chicken, dated a week 
earlier. A touch of home? I called the front desk and alerted them, and we 
changed for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 We could have enjoyed a totally car-less weekend by dining at one of the fine 
restaurants at Century Plaza or within walking distance nearby. But in my 30 
years as a Californian, I had never done Lawry's. Quite aware of the reputation 
of the prime rib restaurant on La Cienega Boulevard, we decided to find out for 
ourselves. We had made dinner reservations for 5:30 -- plenty of time for a 
non-rushed dinner before the 8 p.m. curtain.  
</P>
<P>
 Lawry's is an elegant dining room, in a kind of Renaissance-English decor. But 
this was Valentine's weekend, and we thought the red-and-white balloons 
streaming from the recessed ceiling were a little tacky. 
</P>
<P>
 You have five choices of what to eat at Lawry's: four different cuts of prime 
rib, or fresh fish. When in Rome, do what the Romans do. The Lawry's cut, 
please. 
</P>
<P>
 Our waitress was efficient, if not a bit Stepford-cool. She spun the house 
salad, one of their gimmicks, and drizzled the Lawry's "Vintage" dressing onto 
it from arm's height. In due time, the "certified" meat carver maneuvered to 
our table the stainless steel serving cart -- gimmick No. 2, and almost large 
enough to pass as a techno-age casket. It contained a couple of cooked cows, it 
seemed, and he sliced off our orders. We took the mashed potatoes over the 
a-la-carte baked potatoes, and ordered creamed spinach and creamed corn 
side-dishes (a la carte). So tell me, does anyone really enjoy Yorkshire 
pudding? 
</P>
<P>
 The prime rib was every bit as good as we've eaten at a couple of our favorite 
restaurants back home -- where the service and surroundings aren't nearly as 
pretentious.  
</P>
<P>
 A sign by the front door advised that the valet charge was $2.50. But after a 
half-dozen parties who presented their stubs after us got their cars before we 
did, I rebelled and paid him only a buck.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On to the play! We drove away from Lawry's at 7:15, were back at the Century 
Plaza by 7:30 and freshened up. The 10-minute stroll from the hotel to the ABC 
Entertainment Center is easy enough, through a shopping promenade beneath 
Avenue of the Stars. We followed directions to the upstairs entrance for our 
box seats in the mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
 We had front-row seats in the upstairs wing, allowing us to peer almost 
directly into the orchestra pit. I watched the horn player chat with the 
trombone player between pieces, like a couple of school kids furtively talking 
in the back row when the teacher's not watching. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been told, when I booked the reservations, that these would be great 
seats. Special for Century Plaza guests, the lady had promised. Special indeed. 
We were so far off to the side that in several critical scenes played upstage, 
away from the audience, the main characters were totally hidden from our line 
of sight, and we could only hear them. For the most part, though, we enjoyed 
the play and admired how Glenn Close must have conditioned herself on a 
Stairmaster.  
</P>
<P>
 The play let out just before 11 p.m., and we considered topping off the 
evening with a night cap or dessert, but the only place we saw open between the 
Shubert and the hotel was a subterranean deli that offered sandwiches, ice 
cream and cappuccino. Jeanne didn't want to eat beneath a street. We thought 
about lounging in the Century Plaza's bar but opted, instead, to buy a couple 
of sodas and chips from the deli, and retreated to our room to enjoy the night 
view of the L.A. basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, I complained to an assistant manager at the hotel about our 
seats and how we felt cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember such-and-such scenes?" I asked him. "Well, we couldn't see them from 
your box seats." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my," he replied, sounding genuinely surprised. We were the first guests 
ever to complain about them, he said, and he promised to pass our grievance on 
to the Shubert, which had arranged the block of seats for Century Plaza guests. 
 
</P>
<P>
 We ordered room-service breakfast. It was delivered in time, and hot. But our 
room, despite its swank amenities, had only one chair. I perched on the foot of 
the bed.  
</P>
<P>
 The hotel offers a liberal 1 p.m. checkout, and we took every minute of it. We 
could have spent the early part of the day walking around the vast Century City 
Shopping Center across the street, but we figured since we'd spent this much 
money on a room, we'd soak up every available minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But we had to get back home to Escondido, which was left in the care of two 
teen-agers. We collected our belongings, swiped the unused bars of fancy soap, 
but left behind the rice, the macaroni and cheese and the fried chicken. Budget 
for Two

 JOURNEY TO KHIVA: A Writer's Search for Central Asia by Philip Glazebrook 
(Kodansha International, $23 hardcover) and CENTRAL ASIA: The Practical 
Handbook by Giles Whittell (Cadogan Books/ Globe Pequot Press, $15.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 "What child," asks British author Philip Glazebrook rhetorically, "has not 
responded to the ring of (the) names, Bokhara, Khiva, Samarcand, and their 
images of cupolas and courts and shadows in the sand, images glinting with the 
scarlet thread of cruelty and spilt blood . . . ?" Well, probably most of the 
kids in Los Angeles today for starters -- not more than a dozen of whom are 
likely to know Samarcand (or Samarkand, as it is more usually spelled) from 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 But never mind. For anyone who has heard of them, these cities -- all of them 
in the newly independent Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan -- are 
fascinating, mysterious, places; a domain (or so we imagine) of capricious 
khans, wily merchants, dashing nomads, colonial adventurers, beautiful 
sequestered princesses. Such characters pop up in Glazebrook's book, in his 
many historical and literary references, as he visits and travels between the 
three aforementioned Uzbekistani cities plus a fourth, Tashkent. He deftly 
blends his colorful history with contemporary anecdote, though, and with 
observations both appreciative and ironic, and he writes in an accessible, 
evocative style -- so that we can easily picture him fending off a murderous 
attacker in a Moscow hotel room or defending Mrs. Thatcher at an inn outside 
Bokhara or standing alone before the slender jade tombstone of Tamerlane in 
Khiva itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Giles Whittell's extremely well-researched and enjoyably crafted Cadogan 
guide, which covers not just Uzbekistan but also Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, 
Kyrgystan, Kazakhstan and a bit of western China, establishes practical 
parameters for a Glazebrook-style jaunt. The history is sound, the fables and 
tales amusing, the details riveting.

 ADVENTURES IN CHEAP EATING: HAWAII: The Comprehensive Guide to Righteous Deals 
& Authentic Meals on Oahu by March Egerton (Tsunami Press, $9.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 I was going to mention this book -- which offers short reviews of some 175 
restaurants, bakeries, takeout stands, coffeehouses, etc. on the island of Oahu 
-- as a "Quick Trip." Its subject is relatively minor in the greater scheme of 
things, after all. But it turned out to be such pure delight to read -- full of 
color and unforced humor and good-natured commentary -- that I think it 
deserves slightly more space. March Egerton has obviously not just visited 
every place he writes about (by no means common practice in the 
restaurant-guide business, I'm sorry to say), but has made an attempt to 
understand each one and find its strong points. Of a dish of seaweed, bamboo 
shoots and pickled plums served at the Japanese noodle house called Tentekomai, 
for instance, he notes, "It's not for everyone, I grant you, but damn tasty if 
you're feeling open to a little adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 His frame of reference is also sometimes astonishingly wide. In reviewing the 
wonderfully named Masu's Massive Lunch Plate, for instance, he writes that, 
"Common to all the specials is enough meat to make 'The Jungle' seem like a 
stroll in the garden." A typical repast here, he adds, might include "Fried 
pork chop with tonkatsu sauce, charcoal-broiled top sirloin steak, fried shrimp 
tempura, baked Spam, Melveen's famous Tita-style Vienna sausage and tuna-potato 
salad." Aloha, heartburn.

 A SENSE OF MISSION: Historic Churches of the Southwest, photography by David 
Wakely, text by Thomas A. Drain (Chronicle Books, $18.95 paper, $35 hardcover). 
Twenty-nine churches in adobe, wood or stone, many of them little jewels, most 
of them from the 18th and 19th centuries, presented handsomely and respectfully 
in luminous photographs and clean, crisp prose. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ORLEANS by Bethany Ewald Bultman (Compass American Guides/Fodor's, $16.95 
paper). Music, food and Mardi Gras are (not surprisingly) among the principal 
themes of this affectionate portrait of New Orleans. Like all the Compass 
guides, this one has plenty of bright photography, lots of local color and 
plenty of boxes and sidebars on various subjects. There's no great depth here, 
but a pretty good portrait of the city shines through.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: BEING A ROAD WORRIER CAN HELP TRIP PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of auto accident fatalities has been declining in recent years, yet 
statistics are still sobering for travelers making vacation plans. More than 
22,000 people died in car and taxi accidents in the United States in 1991 (the 
most recent year for which statistics are available), according to the National 
Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In our travel planning, it helps to know which states and countries pose the 
greatest risks, which are safest, which cars hold up best in accidents, and 
under what circumstances it is statistically safer to fly than to drive.  
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, it is safer to drive on limited-access highways, such as 
interstates, than on other roads, according to Michael Sivak, a research 
scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. And 
driving in certain states and countries is statistically safer than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the safest U.S. states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey and Virginia, according to the National Safety Council, 
which gathers motor vehicle death statistics from each state and then 
calculates the rate of fatal accidents per mile driven for each. California is 
termed relatively safe, according to NSC statistics, as are Wisconsin, North 
Dakota, Minnesota and Washington. Arizona and Nevada are classified as more 
hazardous for drivers. And deemed least safe by the NSC, because of the higher 
number of per-capita fatalities, are New Mexico, Arkansas, Alaska and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the United Kingdom and Netherlands are among the countries with the 
lowest auto fatality rates, according to John M. Allen of the British Vehicle 
Rental and Leasing Assn. Allen cited information from the British Department of 
Transport's International Road Traffic and Accident Database, which tracks road 
deaths in selected countries, including Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries reported 1.9 road deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles in 1991. In 
other countries, the deaths per 10,000 vehicles were: West Germany, 2.0; Italy, 
2.2; Luxembourg, 3.5; France, 3.6; Belgium, 3.7, and the Irish Republic, 4.0. 
Less safe are Spain, with 5.0 deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles, and Greece, 
with 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you are renting or buying, choosing a safe car can also reduce the 
chance of accident and death. Many organizations test cars for safety, but 
among the most respected sources are Consumers Union, publishers of Consumer 
Reports, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Consumers Union rates cars for safety and publishes those findings 
in its April car evaluation issue. Cars are rated for both passenger and driver 
protection, as well as on how well the passenger compartment holds up in an 
accident. Among 1993 vehicles, for example, 14 cars and trucks received better 
than average ratings (the highest possible) in all three categories, while only 
two vehicles (Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari minivans) got the worst possible 
ratings for driver and passenger protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also tests domestic and 
foreign passenger cars and light trucks. For detailed information on a specific 
crash test, by model, consumers can call the agency's toll-free Auto Safety 
Hotline, (800) 424-9393, and ask that findings be mailed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If traveling with children in a rental car, make sure the car will contain a 
child safety seat. If the rental car company cannot provide one, take one 
along. Child safety seats reduce minor injury by half, Hoskin said, and trim 
the death risk by 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask rental personnel for specific directions to your next destination and, 
when traveling overseas, ask about signs and roadways peculiar to the country 
you are visiting, suggested Ardis Berghoff, a spokeswoman for Budget Rent a 
Car. Many accidents that occur to U.S. travelers driving overseas occur because 
of lack of familiarity with local driving habits and road systems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the safest way to travel isn't by car. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are 32 times more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane crash, 
given the same amount of miles," Hoskin said. Add that some of us are less than 
perfect drivers and that some drivers take the wheel while under the influence 
of alcohol and drugs, and the open road becomes a little less inviting. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't yet decided to fly or drive, calculate your risk, Sivak said. 
According to his research, risk is affected by the number of airplane stopovers 
and total trip length. For example: the average driver traveling more than 37 
miles is safer on a non-stop flight than driving. 
</P>
<P>
 If the flight has two legs, the average driver is safer flying than driving if 
the trip is more than 74 miles. If the flight has three legs, we are safer 
flying if the trip is more than 111 miles. Yet risk also depends, Sivak said, 
on the traveler's driving habits. The worse the driver, the safer it can be to 
fly. 
</P>

DESTINATION: GOA; INEXPENSIVE PLEASURES IN AN OCEANFRONT STATE BATHED IN 
EUROPEAN CULTURE AND ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Every morning here in Goa, we follow our chutney with a cashew liqueur, 
whisper a grace to Lord Shiva and St. Francis Xavier and plunge headlong into 
the emerald waters of the Arabian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Portuguese left much behind when they left Goa in 1961," explained my 
government guide, who introduced himself only as Boagem. "They left their 
language, their faith, their style and their culture, and most of all, their 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where men wear loincloths to the bank and robes to the beach, 
where cows are pampered and humans must fend for themselves, the Indian state 
of Goa plays the game by different rules. It's where Indians go to party. 
</P>
<P>
 Goa is a narrow strip along India's southwest coast comprising 82 miles of 
squeaky-clean beaches, of sidewalk cafes, of spectacularly beautiful baroque 
basilicas, of Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva the Destroyer, as well as to 
Durga, goddess of peace. You can rent jet skis or go windsurfing here, or you 
can steep yourself in another culture, in fact two of them. All for peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-day bus tour of the state, including churches, temples and beaches -- 
and a chance to meet Indians at play -- cost me $1.60. Oh, yes, I did have to 
pay for my own lunch. But checking out the menu at a beachfront cafe in Colva 
Beach, I could find no entree over $1, including steak and fresh fish. I gave 
my waiter a 30-cent tip and made a friend for life. Afterward, I paid $3 for a 
garish shirt that would have cost me at least $60 in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Goa is so cheap that it draws large numbers of Europe's thriftiest tourists, 
the British. A brochure published in Britain says, "In the best five-star hotel 
in Goa, a steak fillet with all the trimmings will set you back well under 
three pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the British, I was here as part of a broader trip to India, a planned 
respite from the noise and squalor of India's big cities. My wife stayed home 
because she was sure she would hate India. For the most part she was probably 
right. But she would have loved Goa. 
</P>
<P>
 I stayed at the Fort Aguada Resort, a world-class luxury hotel built in a 
17th-Century Portuguese fort. The rate was $100 a night and for this I got a 
huge room just feet away from the crashing surf, a daily basket of tropical 
fruit and a welcoming gift of fresh cashews and a bottle of excellent port. 
Everything in the mini-bar was free. 
</P>
<P>
 For Europeans on cheap package vacations, life in Goa centers around their 
hotels. The British in particular stay for as long as two weeks at a time in 
Goa's luxury resorts. With water sports, giant bottles of Indian beer and BBC, 
CNN and MTV coming in by satellite, there's more than enough to keep them busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians come to the luxury resorts here, south of Bombay, but not necessarily 
with purity of heart. While the men of Goa are liberated and wear swim trunks, 
the women wear full-length saris even at the beach. Indian men roam the beaches 
for hours staring at Western female visitors in bikinis -- or less. Signs on 
Goa's beaches warn that nudity and drug use are prohibited, a reminder of the 
hippie invasion of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The government runs an all-day $1.60 leering expedition, known officially as 
the North Goa Tour, in which all the stops are at beaches. Toplessness is rare 
these days, but Indian men go pop-eyed even at the sight of Western women in 
shorts, let alone bikinis. Indian women, even in enlightened Goa, rarely expose 
so much as an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Goa tour, however, focuses on churches and Hindu temples. My fellow 
passengers were Indian families visiting from other Indian states. Unlike 
Americans on bus tours, they did not bond with one another. They spoke to me, 
but not to each other. They did not sing, "Here Is to the Bus Driver" or other 
camp songs, not even "Can't Get to Heaven in a Rockin' Chair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When we stopped at the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa, where St. Francis 
Xavier is buried, the Indians took off their shoes. Actually only part of St. 
Francis is buried there. Two toes of his preserved body were bitten off in 1554 
by a devout Portuguese woman, and part of St. Francis' right hand was shipped 
to the Vatican in 1615. St. Francis' semi-preserved head and shoulders are 
displayed in a silver casket in the 16th-Century church, which also contains 
the events of his life in brightly colored paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Goa is the heart of the original Portuguese settlement in India, dating 
from 1510, and Goa's first capital. St. Francis roamed Asia as a missionary and 
won tens of thousands of souls for Christianity between 1541 and his death in 
1552. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portuguese took Goa from the local Muslims for mixed motives, from Christ 
to spices. Christ won for a while, and St. Francis Xavier even persuaded Lisbon 
to introduce the Inquisition, which held on until 1812. Meanwhile, trade 
boomed. By 1600, Old Goa had 75,000 people, more than Madrid, nearly as many as 
Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
 During those golden years, faith began to decline. Old Goa became better known 
for its bordellos than its cathedrals. Goan Royal Hospital records show that, 
by the early 1600s, 500 Portuguese men were dying each year of venereal 
diseases. Local married women, according to church records, "drugged their 
husbands, the better to enjoy their lovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indifference to the church went hand in hand with a spirit of tolerance 
unknown in much of the colonial world, and that tolerance continued even after 
the Indian government took Goa bloodlessly in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The time of piety left its largest landmark at the baroque Se Cathedral, built 
from 1562 to 1652, and the largest Catholic church in Asia. On my bus tour, my 
fellow sightseers pointed and marveled at an oil painting there of the patron 
saint of travelers, a work that Americans I met called St. Christopher in 
Shorts. The Indians were agog. Hindu gods do peculiar things -- they cut off 
their children's heads, smoke ganja and ride geese and rats -- but they never 
wear shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At our next stop was the first of two Hindu temples remarkable for the Roman 
Catholic influence on their architecture. Each has a free-standing tower, much 
like a campanile in Italy. Shri Mangueshi Temple, a little gem with blue 
pillars, crystal chandeliers and large silver idols, is dedicated to Shiva, one 
of the three major Hindu gods. He is in charge of war, famine, death and 
destruction and despite these penchants is highly regarded in Goa. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day progressed, we stopped at the pagoda-like Shri Shantadurga Temple, 
built for Durga, and at three beaches, as well as the laid-back seaside town of 
Miramar, where a food and drink fair was in full swing. In a traffic island in 
the middle of the road, a family clearly high on drugs and feeling no pain 
asked me to take their picture. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite stop was at 12-mile-long Colva Beach, where we paused for lunch. 
The Indians went to the packed and stifling Silver Sands restaurant, but I 
found an outdoor cafe near the water that looked better to me. The eight-page 
menu at the Falcon ran from chicken vindaloo to steak to fresh tuna sauteed in 
olive oil and seasoned with garlic, chili and ginger. All were under $1. I 
ordered the tuna and a King's Black Label beer, made in Goa . . . and 8.75% 
alcohol. The beer elsewhere in India is less than 5% alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Our last beach stop was Dona Paula, named for the daughter of a long-ago 
Portuguese viceroy. It's the water sports capital of India, with jet skiing, 
para-sailing, snorkeling, scuba diving and windsurfing, all in a carnival 
atmosphere with ice cream parlors, tavernas and the Indian equivalent of a swap 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us, the highlight of the South Goa tour was the conclusion, when 
we returned after a steamy day in the low 90s, and no air-conditioning on the 
bus, to our hotel rooms for bottled water and a cold shower, followed by a Goan 
buffet. At the Fort Aguada Resort Hotel, the buffet was a $9 splurge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the seafood station, I had a choice of clams, tiger prawns, mussels and a 
local flounder-like fish, the pomfret. Although tap water is iffy in Goa, fresh 
shellfish from the clear waters of the Arabian Sea off the coast caused no 
problems for anyone I talked to, even the easily sickened British. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian specials included vegetable curry, chicken tandoori and lak paneer -- a 
delicately seasoned spinach and cheese casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 On the charcoal grill, a chef was barbecuing hamburgers and brochettes of 
beef. And at the dessert table, I watched as vacationing Britons loaded up 
their plates with fruit trifle, creme caramel, Swiss chocolate rolls and 
strawberry ice cream. I tried an Indian dessert called gajar ka halwa, made of 
carrots, sweet spices and milk, and I went back for seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The buffet is served at the water's edge. A local band plays music from an 
international repertoire, including that old Indian classic "Hava Nagila." 
</P>
<P>
 Life is good at the resort hotels -- besides the Fort Aguada and the Oberoi, I 
visited the Taj Holiday Village and the Aguada Hermitage -- and it's tempting 
to plant yourself there and see little else of this picturesque and exotic 
state. Goa is filled with palm trees, mango groves, rice paddies and majestic 
forests of ebony and teak. It smells like vanilla and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the resorts make it easy for you to escape. The Fort Aguada 
doorman, for example, negotiated reasonable taxi fares for me and charged them 
to my room, making it unnecessary for me to deal with unfamiliar currencies or 
exchange any money with the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxury hotels pick guests up and drop them off at the airport at no charge. 
This policy does not protect the traveler against an occasional gouge. My own 
"free" ride to the airport cost me $10 -- the amount the driver demanded before 
he would turn on the air-conditioning. A better deal, and a better time, was my 
$6 round-trip taxi ride to the Goan state capital, called Panaji by ethnic 
Indians and Panjim by the Portuguese, 35 minutes each way from the Fort Aguada. 
The trip would take 10 or 15 minutes if not for all the cow-dodging. Although 
Goa is 31% Catholic, it is 68% Hindu (the rest are mainly Muslims) and cows are 
allowed to roam the roads. Street scenes were colorfully chaotic, with 
frantically buzzing bikes and scooters, as well as armies of women carrying 
heavy loads on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Panaji, on the banks of the Mandovi River, is a great strolling town and the 
only city I saw in two weeks in India with no beggars, no street hustlers and 
no touts. It was also the only one with Mediterranean-style piazzas and 
pastel-washed villas with balconies, pillared porches and red-tiled roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a sunset cruise on the Mandovi, enjoying a live band, for $1.60. As the 
boat, the Santa Monica, left its jetty, I saw the tall twin towers of the 
Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception silhouetted against the sky. 
And at nightfall, the lights of the Campal, the riverfront boulevard, 
illuminated the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 While this was advertised as an evening of Indian folk music, the songs one 
night included "Old McDonald Had a Farm," "She'll Be Comin' 'Round the 
Mountain," "All Day, All Night, Mary Ann" and "Red River Valley." The band 
topped off the evening with "When the Saints Go Marchin' In." GUIDEBOOK

THE TIMES SHOPPER: WORLDWIDE; MARKET STRATEGIES; FROM LONDON'S PORTOBELLO ROAD 
TO TIBET'S BARKHOR BAZAAR, THE WARES AND ENERGY OF THE OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE ARE 
IRRESISTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE WOOLDRIDGE, Wooldridge is assistant travel editor of the Miami Herald. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sea of silver stretches down the hill and around the block. Silver coffee 
services. Silver bangles. Exquisite, twisted silver iced-tea spoons, wedged 
next to tables of old-fashioned cameras, antique toys, old war badges and 
bric-a-brac. 
</P>
<P>
 I've rarely bought anything at the weekly Portobello Road market. But if I'm 
in London on a Saturday, you can be sure I'll stop in. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the energy is irresistible. Vendors crow their bargains, their meaning 
unmistakable even when the language is beyond me. The unadulterated zest for 
wheeling and dealing stirs my little capitalist soul, and the bargaining that 
seems so bothersome in a stateside car showroom becomes a gleeful game. The 
smells waft past: corn on the grill, musty incense, strange pungent spices, the 
oh-so-airy fragrance of orchids, the less glamorous scents of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, there are the items for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas packages I recently wrapped were full of them: antique jade 
dragons and hand-painted perfume bottles from Hong Kong, handcrafted belts from 
Guatemala, miniature statues from Bolivia, wooden musical instruments from 
Thailand, wooden ornaments from Mexico, all marking traditions far different 
from my own. My apartment overflows -- with weavings crafted by careful hands 
through countless days, amulets promising good health and fortune, masks 
signifying hundreds of years of traditions. My wardrobe is packed with shirts 
and sweaters purchased on the streets at a fraction of their U.S. cost. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the people I really go to see. Markets are living museums, portals to 
local lifestyles outside the usual tourist experience. Conversation comes 
easily with eager sellers; when we don't share a language, we simply smile and 
gesture, depending upon calculators to indicate price. In Tibet, for instance, 
a friend and I had long, laughing "chats" with colorfully dressed women who 
scoffed at the cheap cosmetics we offered to trade them and instead chose 
samples of expensive, designer perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
 I often can learn about a country from the way the vendors bargain, bicker and 
trade goods. Those with little will settle for almost nothing; those with more 
will refuse to go too low. In some places it is a laughable game; in others, 
business is downright cutthroat. And buying leather sandals as a free-roaming 
cow looks on, as I have in India, is about as cultural an experience as I can 
imagine. (In the Hindu religion, cows are sacred, left to wander through 
markets, railway stations and even homes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many worthwhile markets are unmentioned here. Some -- such as Otavalo in 
Ecuador and the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul -- I have yet to see. Maybe it's time 
for another run out to the market. BANGKOK'S WEEKEND MARKET 
</P>
<P>
 That strange reed contraption covered with beads and one-inch, silver-colored 
balls is not somebody's idea of a bizarre holiday decoration. No, that thing on 
my wall is actually a tribal headdress from northern Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first visited Thailand five years ago, I went trekking in this region, 
staying in the homes of tribeswomen who wore such extraordinary headgear above 
the odd combination of hand-woven skirts and Nike T-shirts. I was too shy -- or 
too foolish -- to buy a headdress from these people, but when I spotted them 
earlier this year at Bangkok's Weekend Market for $22, I couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto the wooden musical flute ($16), the fanciful puppet with a beard made of 
real hair ($15), the hand-carved Burmese figures dressed in sequined jackets 
($4). 
</P>
<P>
 Bangkok is home to so many markets that there's a special map to find your way 
around them -- Nancy Chandler's Map of Bangkok: The Market Map and Much More 
(sold at tourist haunts in Bangkok). One section specializes in Buddha images, 
another in cheap clothes. I was disappointed to find that two of my favorites, 
the orchid market, with its blocks of fresh blooms, and the Thieves Market, 
filled with furniture and housewares, seemed to be shadows of their old selves. 
But the Weekend Market, near the northern bus terminal, was as jam-packed as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The place sprawls, as unstoppable as science fiction's "The Thing," in 
makeshift stalls and more permanent booths. Anything you can think of is 
probably there somewhere: cocktail clothes and T-shirts, fish for the aquarium 
and fish for dinner, semiprecious beads and stones, antiques and handicrafts. 
Despite its name, the market is open daily. PIKE PLACE MARKET, SEATTLE 
</P>
<P>
 As a child I was enthralled by the baskets of polished vegetables and the 
overall-covered folks who sold them at the local farmers' market. I'm still 
fascinated . . . all the more so when a market includes sea creatures and fresh 
eats. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, I'm not alone. One of the last authentic farmers' markets in 
America, Pike Place Market draws 9 million visitors a year, making it one of 
Seattle's top tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Piles of tomatoes, apples, lettuce, cherries, beets, beans, radishes and 
eggplant line the unheated halls of this 1907 structure, brought by the farmers 
who have grown them. But the big draw is seafood. Massive king salmon, as big 
as 50 pounds, and giant geoduck clams sit upon mounds of ice. Dungeness crabs, 
the local specialty, are artfully arranged; hand-drawn signs advertise them at 
$3.49 per pound, cooked. The salesmen often put on a show, calling to each 
other and flinging their catch over the heads of watching visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are trendy restaurants there, but though the day was cold we opted for a 
little outdoor stand called Jack's Fish and Chip Spot. The shrimp and crab were 
well worth the chill, which gave my sweetheart and me a chance to snuggle a 
little, anyway. MACAU FISH MARKET 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the fish market in Macau might sound a bit like Pike Place. It is 
not. For one thing, there are no tourist shops or restaurants, no chic coffees. 
What's more, many of the offerings are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Macau, near Hong Kong, is a colonial outpost (Portugal will turn it over to 
the Chinese at century's end) turned gambling town, and most tourists head 
straight for the casinos and European-style historic sites. My friend, Stetson, 
and I followed a resident and ended up in the market, an entirely Chinese place 
filled exclusively with locals. 
</P>
<P>
 And what fun! As the only tourists -- and the only Westerners -- in sight, we 
were a great curiosity. The fishmongers joked for our cameras, hoisting frogs 
the size of a head of lettuce, squirming eels and wiggling fish and pretending 
to toss them in our direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Grouper the size of a family dog leered at us from beds of ice. Creatures 
unlike anything found in American waters crawled through plastic bins gurgling 
with water. Some looked quite scary, and even if I'd been visiting for 
practical reasons instead of for ambience, I wouldn't have bought any of these 
very strange things. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's better to eat than to be eaten. PORTOBELLO ROAD, LONDON 
</P>
<P>
 England is a stolid place, where the rule of thumb has long been "older is 
better." No place is this more evident than on London's Portobello Road, where 
vendors set up each Saturday to display the revered remains of days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is best known for its silver, often tucked in indoor mazes of tiny 
stalls. There are few bargains, however; my mother and I found lower prices on 
old silver in the Cotswolds, last spring. In London, the market at Camden 
Passage on Saturdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays also specializes in collectibles 
and is preferred by some to Portobello Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will find few goods that are new, though a few vendors sell casual 
clothes made in India. That -- along with turbaned vendors and Middle Eastern 
accents -- remind one of England's colonial past and the fact that even England 
changes, after all. Still, some things are immutable. And when the feet grow 
weary, a proper cuppa English tea is only a step away. HONG KONG'S JADE MARKET 
</P>
<P>
 One splendid exception to Hong Kong's high-price shopping is the daily Jade 
Market, tucked beneath a freeway under a canopy of tents in Kowloon. Here, 
beads, discs, rings and amulets are tossed into baskets or piled high upon the 
floor. They are priced about $1.50 each, though one must bargain and bargain 
hard, and not be persuaded by those silvery words, "Special price for you, 
lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Earrings and necklaces in malachite, lapis lazuli and other semiprecious 
stones sell for about $10, and freshwater pearls are abundant. Some of the most 
fascinating pieces are the old bits of jade -- aged, imperfect beads; carvings 
of monkeys, Buddhas and mythical creatures; smoking pipes -- which may run to 
$50 or more. CHICHICASTENANGO, GUATEMALA 
</P>
<P>
 Intriguing religious ceremonies that mix Mayan traditions with Catholicism are 
one reason to visit Chichicastenango in Guatemala. The other is the market that 
is said to have been meeting regularly for 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, the two can coincide. Ceremonies take place on Saturday evening, 
about sundown, and early Sunday morning. The market is Sunday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought rough-hewn, hand-carved statues of saints, wooden masks, splendid 
weavings, hand-tooled belts, leather hair bands, whimsical jewelry, bright 
woven purses, pot holders, aprons and children's outfits. Most items cost less 
than $10, though a very fine antique mask and an exquisite weaving were closer 
to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day grows older, the twisting little rows become so packed with 
shoppers that forward motion is impossible. We are gone by noon -- our car 
full, our pockets empty. BOLIVIAN WITCHES' MARKET 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of offering a dried llama fetus to the Pachamama may seem both 
bizarre and gruesome to microchip sensibilities, but in La Paz, Bolivia, it 
seems neither. Not bizarre, because making a present to the Mother Earth seems 
an oddly fitting thing to do in one of the Earth's highest cities (11,000 to 
13,000 feet above sea level). Not gruesome, because it turns out that llamas 
self-abort when they become pregnant with more babies than they can carry to 
term, and because once dried, these fetuses look like a mere twist and tangle 
of sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the idea appeals to you -- or if you are simply curious, as my friend and I 
were -- you can check out these and other offerings to the Pachamama, along 
with amulets and medicinal herbs, along Linares Street, also known as the 
Witches' Market. 
</P>
<P>
 I expected some impressive gathering of herbalists and was disappointed; the 
stalls that hawk these mystical herbs are simple stands set up occasionally 
along several blocks between shops touting more "regular" souvenirs: leather 
jackets, alpaca sweaters, weavings, leather purses, traditional musical 
instruments called charangas. But a closer look at the herb stands -- and some 
explanation about their use -- reveals a little of the fascinating mysticism 
that thrives on Bolivia's Altiplano. Certain amulets improve your chances for 
love; others are used to bring trials to your enemies. If your lungs are weak, 
try baked garlic; if your head aches, eat cooked corn. If you opt for the more 
traditional crafts shops in this area, remember that vicuna and several species 
of armadillo (used to make the fancier charangas) are endangered and may not be 
brought into the United States. TIBET'S BARKHOR BAZAAR 
</P>
<P>
 The Barkhor Bazaar is more than just a shopping area; it's a religious 
experience. Literally. The bazaar encircles the Jokhang, the holiest of all 
Lamaist temples in Tibet, located in central Lhasa. Pilgrims flock to the 
Jokhang from across Tibet to prostrate themselves, light candles and chant. And 
to circumambulate -- which is a fancy way of saying that they walk around the 
temple chanting their prayers, counting their prayer beads and spinning their 
prayer wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 As tourists, my friend and I did far more shopping than praying. We spent 
countless hours joyously sifting through elaborate teapots carved from yak 
bone, curly-toed boots made from yak hide, old brass bits of bowls and locks, 
hand-painted religious paintings called thangkas (prices vary), prayer beads, 
tapestries, coral jewelry, brocade hats lined with fur. Though small items cost 
only a few dollars, the elaborately carved teapot and fine jewelry cost closer 
to $75. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought plenty -- truthfully, too much. But what we hold most dear are 
memories of the people we met there: country women in colorful garb who danced 
each afternoon, young city women with turquoise woven into their hair who tried 
to sell us their jewelry, a poor but proud pilgrim who sold us his prayer beads 
to raise enough money to get back home. Where can you wear yak boots, anyway?

HIKING: JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL MONUMENT: BLACK ROCK CANYON, THE 'COMPLETE' DESERT 
TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hike through Black Rock Canyon has just about everything a desert hike 
should have: plenty of cactus, pinyon pine-dotted peaks, a sandy wash, dramatic 
rock formations, a hidden spring, grand vistas . . . and much more.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in the northwest corner of Joshua Tree National Monument, at 4,000 
feet elevation near the town of Twentynine Palms, the Black Rock Canyon area 
also contains forests of the shaggy Joshuas. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit off the tourist track, the canyon rarely makes the national monument's 
"must-see" list. Ironically, though, Black Rock is one of the easiest places to 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has a trail for hikers of all abilities. Families with kids enjoy 
poking around the campground, taking a ranger-led walk or sauntering along 
nearby nature trails. More experienced hikers follow trails and cross-country 
routes to the tops of nearby peaks. Well-prepared "desert rats" can wander for 
days without seeing a soul in the rugged and remote Little San Bernardino 
Mountains.  
</P>
<P>
 To learn more about desert flora, take the 1 1/4-mile Hi-View Nature Trail. 
Numbered posts en route are keyed to an interpretive pamphlet available at 
Black Rock Ranger Station. To reach the trail head, double back to the 
campground entrance and follow the signs 3/4 mile to the Yucca Valley Park and 
Recreation District's South Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Rock Canyon Trail follows a classic desert wash, then ascends to the 
crest of the Little San Bernardino Mountains at Warren Peak. Desert and 
mountain views from the peak are stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From California 62 (Twentynine Palms Highway) in 
Yucca Valley, turn right on Joshua Lane and drive five miles through a 
residential area to Black Rock Ranger Station. Park at the station. The station 
has some interpretive displays and sells books and maps. Walk uphill through 
the campground to campsite No. 30 and the trail head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the upper end of the campground, the trail leads to a water 
tank, goes left a very short distance on a park service road, then angles 
right. After a few hundred yards, the trail splits. The main trail descends 
directly into Black Rock Canyon wash. A quarter-mile from the trail head, the 
path drops into the dry, sandy creek bed of Black Rock Canyon. You'll bear 
right and head up the wide canyon mouth, passing Joshua trees, desert willow, 
cholla and rabbit brush. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile of wash-walking leads to the remains of so-called "tanks," or rock 
basins built by early ranchers to hold water for their cattle. Another 
quarter-mile up the wash is Black Rock Spring, sometimes dry, sometimes a 
trickle. Beyond the spring, the canyon narrows.  
</P>
<P>
 Near the head of the canyon, the trail splits. Turning left (east) 
cross-country will lead along a rough ridge to Peak 5195. 
</P>
<P>
 If you follow the right fork of the rough trail, you'll climb to a dramatic 
ridge crest of the Little San Bernardino Mountains, then angle right along the 
crest. A steep, 1/4-mile ascent past contorted, wind-blown juniper and pinyon 
pine brings you to the top of Warren Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, what a grand clear-day view! North is the Mojave Desert. To the west is 
snowy Mt. San Gorgonio, Southern California's highest peak (11,485 feet), as 
well as the San Bernardino Mountains and the deep trough of San Gorgonio Pass. 
To the southwest lies mighty Mt. San Jacinto, and to the south are Palm Springs 
and the Coachella Valley. The peaks of the Little San Bernardinos extend 
southeast, marching toward the Salton Sea. Black Rock Canyon Trail WHERE: 
Joshua Tree National Monument. DISTANCE: From Black Rock Campground to Warren 
Peak, 6 miles round trip, with 1,000-foot elevation gain. TERRAIN: High desert 
canyon, juniper and pinyon pine-dotted crest of Little San Bernardino 
Mountains. HIGHLIGHTS: Joshua trees, desert flora-filled wash, panoramic views. 
DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate to strenuous. PRECAUTIONS: Don't hike during 
storms (lightning, flash floods in desert washes). FOR MORE INFORMATION: 
Contact Joshua Tree National Monument, 74485 National Monument Drive, 
Twentynine Palms, Calif. 92277, (619) 367-7511.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; IRISH HOSTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For less than $50, travelers based in Dublin can have round-trip rail 
transportation to Killarney, two nights' accommodations at the international 
youth hostel, advice on what to see and where to eat with a budget in mind, and 
information on the local pubs that offer both traditional and contemporary 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just one of a number of economical, do-it-yourself packages being 
offered this year to visitors to Ireland by An Oige (the Irish Youth Hostel 
Assn.). 
</P>
<P>
 There are 50 An Oige hostels in the Republic of Ireland. The Youth Hostel 
Assn. of Northern Ireland (YHANI) has six facilities. Hostels range from 
primitive farmhouses to castles. Rates for 1994 range from about $3.50 to $8.50 
per night for a bed in a dormitory room. The exception is the Dublin 
International Youth Hostel, where rates run $10-$13 for members of Hostelling 
International, slightly more for non-members. 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage for independent travelers who buy the do-it-yourself packages is 
that lodging, transportation and ancillary costs are usually known in advance, 
and yet travelers retain a lot of freedom. The disadvantage is that you commit 
yourself to using certain services before you know whether other facilities 
might better suit your tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it makes sense to research the areas you intend to visit before making 
decisions. A good source for budget travelers to Ireland would be the new 
382-page "Let's Go: Ireland" (Harvard Student Agencies; $15.99). 
</P>
<P>
 The An Oige budget weekend to Killarney is priced at $42. Similar weekends, 
which also include two nights' accommodations and return rail from Dublin, are 
available for Limerick ($42), Cork ($42) and Galway ($48), or from anywhere in 
Ireland to Dublin ($49). 
</P>
<P>
 The hostels are open to travelers of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get more information or book these packages by contacting the An Oige 
Head Office, which is within the Dublin International Youth Hostel at 61 
Mountjoy St., Dublin 7, telephone from the U.S. 011-353-1-304555 or fax 
011-353- 1-305808.

'WOLVES NEED YOU'

<P>
 Thank you for acknowledging the sad story of wolves in Alaska ("Howling 
Controversy Over Wolf-Killing," Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who love wolves hope that other Americans will realize that Gov. 
Hickel is destroying a magnificent resource that belongs to all Americans, not 
simply greedy hunters looking for easy kills! 
</P>
<P>
 We urge all travelers to become involved and informed on this issue. The 
wolves need you. Help save them before they are cruelly decimated.

 Much to my amazement, your section highlighted Alaska. In view of the horrific 
slaughter of wolves, you certainly could have chosen a far better article. 
Alaska should be boycotted for the continuous wanton slaughter of animals.

 In "Putting the Official Stamp on Middle East Border Crossings" (Feb. 13), 
Christopher Reynolds recommends that prospective travelers to Israel and Syria, 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia or one of several smaller Gulf states pursue one of three 
options to sidestep Arab countries' unilateral boycott of travelers whose 
passports bear an Israeli stamp: Ask Israeli immigration officers to stamp a 
separate piece of paper; get a temporary second U.S. passport, or make Israel 
the final stop on your itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 I would rather propose three substitute options more consistent with 
fundamental American values: Visit Israel and skip your trip to any of these 
Arab nations; inform the local consulate of any Arab nation that you will visit 
as soon as their government lifts its unilateral travel and economic boycott of 
Israel, and inform the consulate that as an American who values freedom, you do 
not appreciate arbitrary and unsupportable restrictions upon your travel based 
on hatred of any people, race, ethnic group or nation.

 Regarding Claude Molveau's "My Best Shot" (Feb. 6): Salvador Dali could not 
have done it better! With its peering viewpoint, vast landscape (of a desolate 
world only "inhabited" by objects), and ethereal colors, Molveau should title 
his photograph of Monument Valley, Ariz., "The Persistence of Camera and Eye."
