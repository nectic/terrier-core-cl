RELATIONSHIPS: MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS LETTING GO; IT'S NOT EASY TO BREAK ROLES

 When Emily Keech's daughter, Jean, suggested that they attend a 
mother-daughter workshop aimed at improving their relationship, Keech didn't 
think the group counseling would do any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I was concerned, our relationship was irreparable," says Keech, 83, 
of Tustin. "Jean and I never agreed with one another. Without fail, she'd say 
'black' and I'd say 'white.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although she felt it was hopeless, Keech decided to honor her daughter's 
request and try the workshop. To the older woman's astonishment, she was 
thrilled with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally surprised at how we've managed to work things out," she says. 
"My daughter and I have become much more tolerant of one another. Now instead 
of constantly battling and criticizing one another, we actually talk." 
</P>
<P>
 As Keech sees it, one of their main problems was a failure to reach an 
adult-to-adult relationship. Keech continued to play the mother, and her 
60-year-old daughter kept rebelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we should have been over this a long time ago, we weren't," Keech 
says. "Because my daughter and I are very different, we do things differently. 
My biggest mistake was running with a safety net, instead of letting her bounce 
and do things her way. From the day your daughter is born, you want to protect 
her. It took me a while to realize that even if I didn't agree with what she 
wanted to do, it was her responsibility and life, and I had to let go." 
</P>
<P>
 Not letting go of daughters is a common problem for many mothers, says 
licensed clinical social worker Lynne Conger of Orange Outreach in Orange, 
which provides individual, marriage and family counseling, including regular 
mother-daughter workshops. Conger says it's harder for mothers to treat 
daughters as adults because of the parallels inherent in the mother/daughter 
bond. "Even though life circumstances are different, mothers were once 
daughters themselves and daughters often become mothers," says Conger. "Being 
of the same gender also means that mothers and daughters face similar 
challenges throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural for mothers to want to spare their daughters any pain and to be 
threatened when their children show a need to be different. But it's an 
important part of maturation for daughters to experience struggles for 
themselves," Conger says.  
</P>
<P>
 Mothers and daughters need to develop separate identities, Conger says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother-daughter bond is our first attachment in life, and it's a profound 
one," she says. "Our relationship with our mother influences the way we connect 
with other people and how we feel about ourselves. If women have issues with 
their mothers that don't get resolved, they are likely to struggle in other 
relationships, such as with spouses and their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Keech's daughter, Jean Braun, agrees that the mother-daughter bond is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the only mother I have, which is why I wanted to get on better footing 
with her," says Braun, an Irvine accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 For Braun, the key to getting along with her mother was simple. "Once I 
started treating my mother like I treat friends and co-workers -- with respect, 
patience and tolerance -- our relationship improved," she says. "Unfortunately, 
I think we often feel that our family will be tolerant, so we don't treat them 
as well as we do other people, and that really isn't fair. (Now) we look at 
each other as people, not mother or daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun has a daughter and says that their relationship is the best it's ever 
been. "Although we experienced some problems when she was growing up, my 
daughter has been married awhile and has four children. We can really talk as 
adults now. After she had the kids, we started seeing more eye-to-eye, which 
has made our relationship very comfortable," she says. "She has started 
thinking that maybe she doesn't know everything after all and will even ask for 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun says that one of the things that helped her relationship with her 
daughter was Braun's ability to let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will tell my daughter when I see her doing something that might cause 
trouble at some point, but I state it as my opinion. Telling her my beliefs is 
something I'd feel guilty (about) if I didn't. Once I tell her, what she does 
with the information is her business," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This method of distributing advice works well for Braun's daughter, Lisa 
Cuomo, 32, a stay-at-home mother of four who lives in Murrieta. "My mother is 
not a meddler. She never tells me what to do, and I appreciate that. I do ask 
for advice sometimes, and what she has to say can be very helpful." 
</P>

 Claudette Varanko and her daughter Natalia were ready to experienced a change 
in their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stop being the perpetual mother with my daughter -- it was really 
weighing me down," says Claudette, 50, a legal nurse consultant in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcomed moving from an adult-child relationship to an adult-adult 
relationship. Before things changed, I found myself doing most of the talking 
and telling my daughter what to do. Now I do a lot listening. It was nice to 
put the responsibility for my daughter's life in her lap. When she succeeds, 
it's on her own merit, not because of what I suggest. And when she fails, it's 
not my fault, and that's a relief," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Varanko, 23, also welcomed the change in their relationship. "We had 
gotten to the point where we had to let go of each other," says Natalia, an art 
exhibits administrator in Pasadena. "I was graduating from college, starting a 
new job and living with my boyfriend. I really wanted a friendship with my 
mother, but every time we talked, I felt like a 5-year-old again. She would 
constantly remind me to do things like pay my car insurance. Although I 
understood that she was just worried about me, I would get angry when we talked 
and not call for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 By attending the mother-daughter workshop at Orange Outreach and learning to 
communicate with and understand one another, the Varankos now have a better 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 One fundamental lesson for them was learning how to communicate effectively 
and express their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned how to tell people how I feel and why I'm feeling that way, 
which is something my mother and I never did before," Natalia says. "We've both 
learned how to communicate our true feelings to one another and with other 
people in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 While talking to each other, Natalia came to understand that her mother also 
has needs and feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "As children grow up, they are very needy, and everything revolves around 
them," Claudette says. "Now that Natalia is an adult, I wanted her to realize 
that moms and dads are people too, and we have our needs. When she started 
asking me about my days and took an interest in what was going on in my life, 
that made me view her as an adult, and our relationship improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Delving into their family history has also given Natalia a better 
understanding of her mother. "Finding out about my grandmother and how she 
treated my mother has really helped me understand my mother," Natalia says. 
"Because of restrictions in my grandmother's past, she tended to limit my 
mother, which just made my mother more determined. As a result, my mother is a 
very driven woman, which is something I really admire and try to emulate." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as she enjoys their adult relationship, however, Natalia admits there 
are times when she just wants her mother. "During tough times, you never stop 
wanting your mom there to hold your hand, and the great part is I know my mom 
will always be there for me."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: THE CARE OF OUR KIDS IS A CONCERN FOR US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any parent who leaves a child in someone else's care, I am anguished by 
stories about people like Toni Majoy-Young, whose 9-month-old son died after 
being cared for by an unlicensed baby-sitter in Reseda in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That tragedy is back in the news this week, as jury selection in the 
baby-sitter's second trial starts today. (The first jury deadlocked two years 
ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, the issue of child care snatches headlines only when it comes up in 
the context of woe. Most of the time, stories about child care are a snooze, 
total yawners to people who don't have to find a safe, affordable haven for 
their preschoolers every Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't force people to get worked up about something in which they have no 
vested interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, child care is an issue we'd all do well to get worked up about. How 
kids are cared for in the first years of life -- the connections they make to 
people, what they learn, the messages about themselves they absorb -- is 
critical to later success in school and, of course, in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dependable child care is more than a children's issue. It's a family issue, a 
mother issue, a father issue. It is also a work issue. Try, for instance, 
concentrating on your job if you don't think your child is safe. Enlightened 
companies see the correlation between child care and worker productivity -- and 
act on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies can only afford to offer pretax savings accounts for child-care 
expenses, or a place for nursing mothers to express milk. Others have invested 
millions of dollars in on-site child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers who don't give any support at all to working parents should be sent 
to bed without their suppers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a popular (and, sadly, correct) notion that we are a country fond of 
giving lip service to our love for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a walk through your local public high school and tell me if it doesn't 
look just like you imagine public schools in the Bronx might look; witness the 
move to cut welfare benefits for women with children; check out the 
ever-shrinking hours of your local public library. 
</P>
<P>
 We like kids all right -- as long as we don't have to prove it with taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other industrialized nations -- which have mandated parental 
leaves and subsidized, quality child care -- we leave workers and employers up 
to their own devices. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the arguments often used against government-supported child care is the 
primacy of the family. How dare the government, in other words, butt into 
family business? 
</P>
<P>
 This argument is as loony -- and anti-child -- as the one used by Vista 
Unified School District trustees last year when they rejected a $400,000 state 
grant for low-income minority children. Part of the money was to have been 
spent on providing breakfast to hungry youngsters, a violation, apparently, of 
the sanctity of the family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 American families have shown over and over again that they need help, not 
illusions of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Families and Work Institute in New York released the results 
of a five-year study showing that children in the care of relatives receive 
substandard care far more often than children in the care of non-relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the sanctity of blood ties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively speaking, Los Angeles is a child care-friendly place. It is easy to 
obtain a license to provide home-based child care, for instance, and both city 
and county have full-time child-care coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to determine just how "family friendly" local companies are, the 
county child-care coordinator, Kathleen Malaske-Samu, undertook a survey of 300 
L.A. employers. She wondered how the depressed economy had affected child-care 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 To her surprise, the survey revealed a steady growth across the entire range 
of benefits -- from allowing employees to set aside pretax dollars for child 
care to on-site child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county itself is the largest sponsor of on-site child care, with six 
centers scattered around Los Angeles. The entertainment industry -- portrayed 
by Republican forces as so hostile to "family values" in the last presidential 
election -- provides 15% of the workplace child-care centers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the county Board of Supervisors and the Child Care Advisory 
Board will honor companies whose employees think have given more than lip 
service to supporting children and their working parents. Anyone who wants to 
pat the boss's back can contact Malaske-Samu this week at (213) 974-2440. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for anything that has made a difference for families -- 
lactation rooms, beepers, flex time," she said. "You don't always have to build 
a $4-million child-care center to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as big a story as the death of a child and a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But which would you rather read about?

ADOPTING A CAUSE: SINGLE MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a taboo subject, unwed mothers were very much the topic at a recent tea 
staged by the Adoption Guild of Southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ortega, chairman of the board and co-founder of Clothestime Inc., opened 
his contemporary, bay-side estate on the Balboa Peninsula to about 200 women 
for the guild's "Patroness Tea." Many guests paid more than the minimum $40 
donation to attend and raised about $10,000 for the guild, a fund-raising 
auxiliary of Holy Family Services Counseling and Adoption in Santa Ana and Los 
Angeles. Changing Attitudes 
</P>
<P>
 For an unmarried pregnant woman, life has changed dramatically since Holy 
Family Services opened its doors in 1949 in Los Angeles and 1961 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, (unwanted) pregnancy was something that wasn't even discussed," 
said Gladys Buller, co-chairwoman of the tea. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days a single pregnant woman was often shunned by friends and family. 
Typically she was "sent away," often to another state, to have her baby, said 
David Ballard, executive director of HFS. 
</P>
<P>
 "In secrecy you'd deliver a child and almost invariably put the baby up for 
adoption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual revolution changed all that, he said. Society is far more accepting 
of single parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not such a stigma (today) for unwed mothers," Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwed mothers still face a serious dilemma: deciding whether to keep the baby 
or give it up for adoption. HFS provides counseling to help them decide and, if 
they choose adoption, assists with placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't pressuring anybody (to choose adoption). We just give them an 
opportunity to understand it as an option," Ballard said. Adoption Option 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption, too, has changed radically since the days when the entire procedure 
was conducted in secrecy. "Some still think of adoption the way it was in the 
'50s," said Sheila Arnold, HFS program manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women don't realize that, if they go through an agency such as HFS, they 
pick the adoptive family that will raise their child, Arnold said. They can 
also maintain contact with the child as long as all parties are agreeable, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year HFS placed 42 children in Orange County homes. HFS board member 
Debbie Mammen adopted two children, a 4-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl, 
before having her surprise "bio baby" a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, both adoptions were positive experiences. She is still in contact 
with the birth mothers. She was present for the births and invited the mothers 
to her home to see the babies' rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worked out really well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 HFS provides adoption placement, pregnancy and post-delivery counseling, child 
care, counseling for teens in schools, foster care and care for battered 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the tea will go to the guild's 33rd annual Charity Tennis 
Tournament, a major fund-raiser for HFS. The tournament will be held May 29 
through 31 and June 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sipping tea and wine, guests enjoyed hors d'oeuvres and sweets 
prepared by Creme de la Creme and viewed fashions from 341 Bayside in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests: Patricia Houston, event co-chairwoman; Rita Mungia, guild 
president; Lesley Covillo, Martha Crowner, Joan Fimiano, Joann Larson, Sassy 
Luby, Hedda Marosi, Rosemary Pfahler, Nancy Popejoy and Gini Savage. KATHRYN

 An old but still very funny joke, courtesy reader Chris Street of Malibu: 
</P>
<P>
 A salesman was in the bar at Rockefeller Center when he noticed the great man 
himself. The salesman approached Rockefeller, introduced himself and asked a 
favor. "I am meeting some very important clients here shortly," the salesman 
said, "and if you came to our table and introduced yourself, they would be so 
impressed that my sale would be guaranteed."  
</P>
<P>
 Impressed with the salesman's spunk, Rockefeller said he would be pleased to 
do so.  
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the salesman was talking to his clients when Rockefeller 
walked up and said, "How are you, my boy? Good to see you."  
</P>
<P>
 The salesman turned to him and said: "Buzz off, Rocky. Can't you see I'm 
busy?" *

 Quick takes from the Gags Gang/Funny Stuff newsletter:

 * Beware of any psychiatrist who validates your existence . . . but makes you 
pay for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never take a memory course from a man who has his pants on backward.

 * On this day in 1968, Charles Manson was overheard saying: "Is it hot in here 
or am I crazy?"

radio was jazz. He said it sounded like rock 'n' roll, and she asked if he

</P>
<P>
 "I said I like classical music better and asked if she liked Beethoven, fully 
expecting her to ask 'who's that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought for a moment, then said, 'Sure, I saw the movie.' "

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; TRY PUTTING A 'CARE MANAGER' ON THE CASE

<P>
 Trying to arrange long-distance care for elderly or ill parents can present 
adult children with a maze of confusing providers and sources. The way out may 
be a professional care manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Care managers, also called case managers, often have a background in nursing, 
social work or gerontology, according to Good Housekeeping magazine, and they 
have taken over the role of health service brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 They arrange and supervise health and social services for elderly and disabled 
clients, overseeing home health care staffing needs, monitoring the quality of 
in-home services and equipment, and acting as a liaison with families living 
far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Private care managers can be expensive -- $50 to $150 an hour. Medicaid or 
other publicly funded programs may provide care managers to qualifying 
families. Some insurers also provide care managers. Health Can Mirror Beliefs, 
Study Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional beliefs can affect the survival of people with serious disease, a 
study of Chinese Americans in California has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with European Americans who died of the same illness, the Chinese 
Americans who believed that they had been born in an ill-fated year died 
anywhere from one to four years sooner, the Harvard Mental Health newsletter 
reported in its May issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional Chinese astrology and medicine, people born in certain years 
are thought to be more susceptible to certain diseases. The authors speculated 
that people born in such years died because they thought death was inevitable. 
'Theme Gardens' Help Grow Green Thumbs 
</P>
<P>
 Planning a "theme garden" is one way to get children interested in gardening, 
says Lawn and Garden magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a "pizza garden" could include basil, oregano, tomatoes and 
peppers.  
</P>
<P>
 Other suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Grow "fun foods," such as sunflower seeds, popcorn and purple pod beans, 
which change color after cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try varieties suited for little hands, such as miniature pumpkins, cherry 
tomatoes and "baby" carrots.

 Family Portrait: The Sutphins of suburban Baltimore are picture-perfect: 
Eugene Sutphin is a successful dentist. Daughter Misty is a budding flea-market 
entrepreneur, and son Chip is in high school. Caring for all three is Beverly, 
a sunny, meatloaf-making, gum-eschewing paragon of motherhood.

 Back Story: But a weird mind lurks behind Beverly's Betty Crocker facade. When 
a neighbor refuses to recycle, Beverly hints that "for the good of the planet," 
someone might kill her.

 Fuse Time: A lot of things tick Beverly off. But her homicidal tendencies

runs him over.

<P>
 Prescription Pad: Actually, Beverly is seriously out of whack. But one of her 
reactions -- lashing out any anyone who dares to criticize or hurt her children 
-- isn't that far-fetched, says Edna Herrmann, a clinical psychologist who 
practices in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents who feel inadequate come to view their children as extensions of 
their personalities, she says. In extreme cases, they become obsessed with 
ensuring their children's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel compelled . . . to remove all obstacles, to right all wrongs, to 
punish or eliminate all those that stand in the way of the children's success 
and well-being," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there's no quick cure for such a parent, Herrmann says. In 
theory, a child could gently tell a parent to butt out.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a well-functioning family, these dialogues occur," she says. "But you are 
not talking about a healthy family."

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE MIDNIGHT RIDER; PAUL REVERE'S 
RIDE BY DAVID HACKETT FISCHER ; OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, $25, 430 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the many surprises in "Paul Revere's Ride" by David Hackett Fischer is 
the revelation that Revere -- the so-called "Mercury of the American 
Revolution" -- did not shout: "To arms! To arms! The British are coming!" 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1775, the people of Massachusetts still thought that they were British," 
Fischer explains. "One of them, when asked why he was preparing to defend his 
house, explained, 'An Englishman's home is his castle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Revere's Ride," as the title suggests, is a detailed account of the 
legendary "midnight ride" as narrated by a professional historian with a 
scholar's command of the facts and a gift for storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the book turns out to be a tale of adventure and intrigue so vivid and 
so colorful that it sometimes reads like a thriller rather than a historical 
monograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer complains, incidentally but intriguingly, of certain prejudices that 
have discouraged earlier historians from focusing on Paul Revere -- "a broad 
prejudice in American universities against patriotic events of every kind," as 
Fischer puts it, and "an abiding hostility" to the history that focuses on 
great men or great events rather than social, economic or political factors. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Fischer manages to evoke Paul Revere as a striking heroic 
figure while, at the same time, giving us the particulars of the world in which 
he lived and the cause he served. And so "Paul Revere's Ride" turns out to be 
both a well-executed biography of Revere and a refresher course on the American 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 So thorough is Fischer's research that he describes not only how Revere looked 
but even how he spoke: "His spelling tells us that Paul Revere talked with a 
harsh, nasal New England twang." And he reveals that Revere's much-cherished 
handiwork as a silversmith tended toward inferior soldering and off-center 
engraving! 
</P>
<P>
 Revere was "a gregarious man, a great joiner," an active Freemason, a veteran 
of the French and Indian War. Long before his famous ride, Revere was already 
ranging far and wide through the colonies as a mounted courier in service of 
the American Revolution. And he was celebrated in both drinking songs and 
British intelligence reports at the very moment that he carried out his secret 
missions under the eyes and guns of the "lobster coats." 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterpoint to Revere, Fischer gives us a parallel account of Thomas 
Gage, the last royal governor of Massachusetts and the British 
commander-in-chief whose military operations in America sent Revere on his 
midnight ride to Lexington and Concord. An aristocrat with an American-born 
wife -- Fischer speculates that she may have passed along military secrets to 
her countrymen -- Gage wavered between civility and coercion in dealing with 
the unruly colonials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gage," insists Fischer, "was truly a tragic figure, a good and decent man who 
was undone by his virtues." 
</P>
<P>
 As Fischer shows us, Revere and his brothers-in-arms proved to be too 
resourceful, too intrepid and too zealous to be put down by Gage and his army 
of occupation. As we watch the increasingly desperate measures that Gage 
adopted in a futile effort to suppress the Revolution, the whole British 
enterprise in North America begins to resemble other imperial adventures of 
more recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think ten thousand men sufficient, send twenty," Gage told his 
superiors in London. "If one million is thought enough, give two; you save both 
blood and treasure in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer gives us a richly elaborated account of Revere's daring ride and the 
fighting that followed along "Battle Road" at Lexington and Concord. For 
example, the author tells us that Revere was actually scolded by one constable 
along the way for making too much noise while the townsfolk were trying to 
sleep. And, once his mission was discharged, Revere undertook a new struggle 
against bureaucratic indifference when he tried to collect on the expense 
account that he submitted for "for self and horse." 
</P>
<P>
 "A tight-fisted Yankee committee," Fischer discloses, "insisted on reducing 
his daily allowance from five shillings to four." 
</P>
<P>
 A subtext of "Paul Revere's Ride" is Fischer's reminder that Revere and his 
comrades were revolutionaries with a strikingly conservative agenda. They 
sought to preserve the age-old traditions of self-government in New England 
against the "new-fangled" exertions of British imperialism -- and, Fischer 
argues, they valued "the integrity of the group" at least as highly as the 
rights of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Town born! Turn out!" was the traditional call of the town crier in Colonial 
Boston at times of peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "We misunderstand Paul Revere's revolutionary thinking if we identify it with 
our modern ideas of individual freedom and tolerance," writes Fischer. "We 
remember individual rights and forget the collective responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message that Fischer intends to understand in taking a fresh look 
at the legend of Paul Revere: "When Paul Revere alarmed the Massachusetts 
countryside," Fischer concludes, "he was carrying a message for us."

MUSIC REVIEWS; SONOR ENSEMBLE SHINES ON CONTEMPORARY TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the UC San Diego-based 
contemporary music ensemble Sonor, making it one of the older such groups 
around. If new-music concerts often seem like a cross between a revival meeting 
and a day in court, Sonor has become expert at pleading its case. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday at the Japan America Theatre, part of the L.A. Philharmonic's "Green 
Umbrella" series, Sonor delivered an often compelling program in which the 
best-known composer was Iannis Xenakis. Xenakis' "Thallein" was certainly the 
concert's high point, an undulant, polyphonous mass of sound that begins with a 
thunderous monster chord and oozes to a murmuring halt with an ambivalent 
polychord in the strings. In between lies a fascinating primitive emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining works, by UCSD-affiliated composers, painted an impressive 
picture of that faculty's resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the brightest moments came in small packages, as with the concert 
opener, Robert Erickson's witty "Kryl," for solo trumpet. Here, trumpeter Edwin 
Harkins worked between the cracks -- of the tempered scale and of standard 
techniques. He engaged in a quirky conversation of opposites such as super low 
blatting notes and falsetto sung notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, percussionist Steven Schick was the sole sonic perpetrator in Brian 
Ferneyhough's "Bone Alphabet," a striking array of shifting timbres, dynamics 
and rhythmic organization. On a grander scale, Ferneyhough's fearsome "Carceri 
d'Invenzione I" (inventive dungeons), is full of clenching and releasing balls 
of energy passed among 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Sollberger's "The Advancing Moment," a requiem for modern warfare, 
slides from gripping bellicose musical activity to an incongruous martial drum 
pulse that pulls the grim appeal out from under it. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's greatest revelation was Franco Donatoni's "Arpege," a refreshingly 
non-classifiable little marvel. With its fascinating linear stitchwork that 
weaves in and out of pulse and tonality, it comes from somewhere between rustic 
folklore and academia, a place typically well-represented by Sonor. JOSEF 
WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; GUITARIST COBO PLAYS AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guitarist Ricardo Cobo came to Ambassador Auditorium with what looked like an 
adventurous and even exotic program in tow, but in the end it seemed as if we 
hadn't gone anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there was very little variety in the music chosen Monday night and, 
given Cobo's own untheatrical musical disposition, the recital became 
needlessly tedious.One felt that he hadn't put his best foot forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiple-prize-winning Colombian musician certainly has a full technical 
arsenal at his disposal, and for guitar groupies -- who knows? -- it might have 
been a stunning show. With gentle amplification applied, Cobo offered a wealth 
of quiet detail, nuance and tone color, in fluent, easygoing readings. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing in this final concert in the 1993-94 Gold Medal series was 
contrast from piece to piece -- all written by conservative modern composers, 
and generally Latin-flavored -- and direction and drama in the music making. 
</P>
<P>
 Short works by Francis Kleynjans, Salvador Brotons, Nikita Koshkin, Roland 
Dyens and Leo Brouwer might be fine to visit on occasion, but they hardly 
seemed the material to base a concert on. Cobo wasn't unearthing lost, or 
discovering new, treasures here, though his apparent attempt to do so is, of 
course, admirable. Rodrigo's "Invocacion y Danse" was a welcome classic to 
throw in, but he played it with such contemplative quietude that it failed to 
take off. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Cobo's own piquant arrangements of two tangos by Piazzolla really 
sparkled. And when the last piece, Dyens' "Fuoco," suddenly (finally) caught 
fire, catching the audience by surprise, it was too little, too late. TIMOTHY

MOVIE REVIEW; 'IN CUSTODY' A PAEAN TO A DYING LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the wise and rueful comedy "In Custody," Ismail Merchant, the producing 
half of the distinguished Merchant-Ivory team, turns director. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant and his longtime partner, director James Ivory, have been responsible 
for such celebrated films as "Howards End" and "The Remains of the Day," and he 
brings to his film of the Anita Desai novel the same kind of civility and 
sophistication that has characterized Merchant Ivory productions for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary point of this leisurely and engaging film is to celebrate Urdu, a 
Northern Indian language cherished by poets and writers for its beauty, that is 
on the verge of extinction. In selecting Desai's novel to adapt to the screen, 
however, Merchant has wisely chosen humor as the most effective way to protest 
a great cultural loss. Indeed, his film is at times almost literally 
excruciatingly funny, striking a perfect balance between laughter and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Om Puri stars as Deven, a poorly paid, badly treated professor of Hindi at a 
backwater college in the ancient town of Mirpore. He has had a lifelong passion 
for Urdu and would love to devote his life to writing poetry in that language, 
but has a wife (Neena Gupta) and small son (Sameer Mitha) to support. When a 
friend (Tinnu Anand), the publisher of a journal devoted to Urdu culture, 
suggests that he interview Nur Shahjehanabadi, the man widely regarded as the 
greatest living Urdu poet, Deven cannot resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Deven inadvertently has embarked upon a journey fraught with comic peril. 
After no small difficulty he finds Nur (Shashi Kapoor) living in a crumbling 
Bhopal palace with his two wives, (Sushma Seth, Shabana Azmi), who detest each 
other ferociously. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Nur himself, he has slid into a life of indolent despair, surrounded by 
freeloading admirers who drink and feast at the poet's expense far into the 
night. As soon as Nur is convinced of Deven's sincerity, he agrees to the 
interview, but Deven doesn't reckon with the wives; worse luck, he lets himself 
get carried away with the possibility of videotaping the master reciting his 
own work, settling for a used tape recorder.  
</P>
<P>
 At every turn Deven meets fresh, costly complications, and the humor of these 
encounters makes bearable the massive indifference he faces without exception. 
Even those fully aware of Nur's stature are so immersed in their own petty 
concerns they actually tend to hinder rather than help Deven in his modest but 
important quest. 
</P>
<P>
 With his gallery of beautifully observed characters Merchant has evoked a 
genuine sense of the human comedy. The smallest role is sharply, comically 
defined, and Om Puri's heroically patient Deven, a much put-upon middle-aged 
man, offers a sharp contrast to Shashi Kapoor's selfless, majestic portrayal of 
Nur, a man only too well aware of his own sad decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense "In Custody" is an homage to Kapoor as much as it is to the late 
Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the poet whose words Kapoor recites with such eloquence and 
passion.

TV REVIEW; ONE LAST, MEMORABLE JOURNEY ON CHARLES KURALT'S ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome back to CBS -- when CBS was CBS. "One for the Road With Charles Kuralt 
and Morley Safer" is the closest thing to a valedictory statement by the 
network on its once glorious self. That is because Kuralt always represented 
the best face of CBS, when it believed in the human face of news. 
</P>
<P>
 In what marks Kuralt's last "assignment" for CBS News, he chats and reminisces 
and reflects with Safer in a reading room at the New York Public Library. And 
because he has always been a reporter deeply affected by the place he is in, he 
looks around at one point, astonished at all of the books surrounding him, 
frustrated that he can't read them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment is spontaneous, thoroughly revealing of the man best known for his 
regular "On the Road" features for the "CBS Evening News" in the '60s and '70s. 
Safer, looking slightly envious at a colleague able to retire at 59, has only 
to mention the names of the people in the "On the Road" pieces and Kuralt 
bursts forth with charged, eloquent memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Bill Bodisch, the farmer who sold his farm and built a yacht to sail around 
the world. Of the poor sharecropping Chandlers, all nine of whose children 
graduated from college. Of Jethro Mann, who created a "lending library" of 
bicycles for the poor kids in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's community he's teaching," Kuralt tells Safer, but he might as well be 
talking about himself. Kuralt doesn't blush when Safer calls him "an 
unreconstructed patriot," because he deeply believes in the country's culture 
of possibility, of rewriting one's life. 
</P>
<P>
 As the choice clips appear, listen to Kuralt's leads. He's a real writer, 
which is what he's now becoming full time, as he plans a book on his 12 
favorite American places. Say goodby to a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
 * "One for the Road With Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer" airs at 8 tonight on 
CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

LAWYERS' DISPUTE INTERRUPTS GATES' KING TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates took the stand briefly in 
Rodney G. King's civil damage trial Tuesday, portraying himself as a model for 
his troops before his testimony was interrupted by a legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers wanted to confront Gates with evidence of racism in the Police 
Department, as detailed in a report by the Christopher Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the police officers being sued in the beating of King objected 
that the information was unrepresentative and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, who initially said he found that the 
figures in the report "do not show a trend" of racism, sent jurors home while 
attorneys debated the issue. He ordered Gates to return Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The former chief, a defendant in the suit, spent barely 20 minutes on the 
stand, during which he was asked to detail his 43-year career as a policeman 
including his 14 years as chief. 
</P>
<P>
 His exchanges with King's lawyer, Milton Grimes, had a prickly tone from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked if Gates had tried to "set the tone" for his department, and the 
former chief said that was part of his job. He said he tried to be an example 
for his officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked if Gates ever rode along with his officers while he was chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "More often than any police chief in the history of the department," Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that mean in 150 years?" asked Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, yes," said Gates. " . . . Certainly in my time, 43 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Grimes if he was involved in setting up the Christopher Commission, 
Gates said he was not. Gates said the real name of the body is the "Independent 
Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was known by the name of one of its leaders, Warren 
Christopher, a private attorney at the time who is now President Clinton's 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't you refer to it as the Christopher Commission in your book?" Grimes 
asked Gates, but the answer was interrupted by objections. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gates and Grimes fenced, the judge interrupted, asking Gates: "Did you 
refer to it as the Christopher Commission?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone has at some time. But we're in court, and I thought you 
wanted to be as accurate as possible," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission investigated the Police Department in the wake of 
King's beating and concluded in its report that racism, sexism and use of 
excessive force existed in the department. It criticized Gates' leadership and 
ultimately led to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers told the judge outside the jury's presence that they wanted to 
show that Gates is liable for damages to King because he should have known 
about misconduct in his department and should have stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies asked lawyers to present further legal briefs on the issue before Gates 
resumes the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, jurors heard from a use-of-force expert, retired Kern County 
Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth Terry, who said that excessive force was used on King 
and that bystander officers at the scene should have intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury already has awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages to be 
paid by the city. The panel is hearing more evidence to determine if 15 
individuals, including Gates, should pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 King's March 3, 1991, beating, videotaped by a nearby resident, led to 
criminal charges against four officers. Not-guilty verdicts in their state 
court trial set off three days of rioting in Los Angeles. In 1993, a federal 
jury convicted two of them, Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon, of violating 
King's civil rights. Two others, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno, were 
acquitted but are defendants in the lawsuit.

 After Charles Biggam's contribution was reported in Only in L.A., the KFI-AM 
radio team of John and Ken asked listeners to start setting aside items for a 
yard sale to raise more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a date set," producer Johan Beckles said. "But the idea is we'd 
turn over one check from the proceeds." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, which has its pride, later sought to distance 
itself from the event, saying it "is not soliciting contributions and has no 
connection with any attempt by the station to raise contributions for such a 
purpose." In fact, a spokeswoman said the county would accept no donations.  
</P>
<P>
 In view of the result of the first trial, let's hope prosecutors will at least 
take some free legal advice.

 No Mother's Day cards for them: While the animated children's movies churned 
out by Hollywood purport to advance "family values," an uncanny number feature 
a main character who has no mother, or whose mother suffers an unfortunate 
fate. With Mother's Day approaching, our hearts go out to the heroes of:  
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Little Mermaid": No mom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Bambi": Mom snuffed out by hunter. Largely absentee Dad portrayed as hero. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Beauty and the Beast": No mom for either. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Snow White": Evil stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Cinderella": Evil stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Pinocchio": Just a stepdad (a nice one, interestingly enough). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Jungle Book": Abandoned as baby to be raised by wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Land Before Time": Mom dies in attack by rival dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Aladdin": No mom for street rat (or princess). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Dumbo": Mom sent to jail for physical assault on big-eared son's 
attackers. She'd probably have been found not guilty if John and Ken had held a 
yard sale for her. 
</P>

 It must be a health food center: That was the reaction of Judi Birnberg and 
several other readers who spotted this supermarket sign in Monterey Park (see 
photo). Actually, an employee said, the name loosely translates in Chinese as 
"prosperous."

 Mom's expanding power base?Walking Downtown, we were reminded of the no-doubt 
apocryphal story about the lowly employee of an aspirin company who was 
promoted to vice president decades ago for making one suggestion to the boss. 
He proposed back then that the company's bottles instruct customers to take two 
aspirins every four hours, not one. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought of that tale when we saw this questionable announcement at a flower 
shop: "Mother's Week -- May 2-8." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it may increase profits. But don't Bambi, Pinocchio, the Beast, et al., 
suffer enough this time of year? LAny:

 Norm Sklarewitz noticed that Poppy Cleaners displays a sign that says: 
"Wedding Gowns and Leather." Well, Poppy is located in West Hollywood.

REMEMBERING RICHARD NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While I join the nation in mourning the death of Richard M. Nixon, I cannot 
forget the impact that his Administration had on my life. Twenty-one years ago, 
you published a list of 575 "enemies" of the White House that had been 
unearthed in the course of the Watergate investigation. My name was one of 
them. That list went from the Executive Office to the Internal Revenue Service 
with a suggestion that an IRS tax audit be performed on each listee's income 
tax return. This produced the first and only tax audit I ever experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial you published was headlined "Totalitarian State of Mind" and 
read: "The disclosures reveal a rot far more dangerous than dollar corruption 
in government. It was an intrigue to subvert the democratic political process 
by men who were not content to lead but who wanted to rule." 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokesman subsequently stated that the President was unaware of 
the list at the time. Of course, he was aware thereafter; however, not once in 
the intervening two decades did any of us receive an apology from him or anyone 
else. 
</P>

<P>
 * Thank you for Robert Scheer's balanced assessment of our 37th President ("A 
Major Leader, a Double Standard," Commentary, April 25). I had the unexpected 
pleasure to work with President Nixon in conjunction with his presidential 
library in 1984. I was struck at the time by two things: 
</P>
<P>
 The first, how adamant President Nixon was about immediate, worldwide nuclear 
disarmament; and the second, how that message was obscured by a gruesome 
obsession with Watergate. The same question was rephrased and asked dozens of 
times during the 20-minute press conference: "Will your White House tapes be in 
the Nixon Library?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon answered graciously every time, saying that the tapes would be in the 
library. He was appropriately contrite that these profane tapes would scar his 
presidency. Yet the thirst for Watergate was unquenchable. All attempts to 
steer the discussion towards topics that showcased Nixon's statesmanship were 
thwarted. At the end of this frightful frenzy, which was meant to introduce the 
library to the public, a chastened ex-President climbed back into his car. As 
he sped away, I found myself wondering how such an obviously brilliant man 
could have been eclipsed by his own shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 I only hope, as Scheer speculates, that in the end, he was at peace with 
himself.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The conventional wisdom concerning Nixon, which Scheer reflects in his 
article, is that Nixon's foreign policies were brilliant and his domestic 
policies, a disaster. Surely, Nixon's Vietnam policy, however, cannot be 
considered brilliant, in any sense of that term. 
</P>
<P>
 What Scheer and most of those in the media commenting on Nixon since his death 
fail to note is the significant human cost of Nixon's Vietnam policies. During 
all of the years of its involvement in the Vietnam War, the United States lost 
58,135 of its citizens to the war. Of these, 20,553 died during the last four 
years of the war. Did the U.S. achieve any goals worth the sacrifice of these 
20,553 Americans in those four years? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was an additional cost for Nixon's Vietnam policies. Prof. George 
Herring, author of an outstanding history of the Vietnam War, wrote: "More than 
any other single issue, Vietnam brought a premature end to the Nixon 
presidency. The extreme measures he took to defend his Vietnam policy against 
all enemies real and imagined led directly to the Watergate scandal which would 
eventually force his resignation. Thus, when the final Vietnam crisis came in 
1975, the architect of peace with honor was no longer in the White House and 
the nation was in no mood to defend the agreement he had constructed at such a 
great cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Nixon's reputation was an additional casualty of Vietnam. But that loss 
pales in comparison to that of his 20,553 fellow citizens who gave their "last 
full measure of devotion" to the war Nixon prolonged.

 * On April 22, the day one of the greatest Presidents in this country's 
history died, a Times reporter called me for comments on my longtime friend, 
Richard M. Nixon. I spoke sincerely and openly with this reporter because 
President Nixon and I stuck by each other through good times and bad times. I 
have always publicly stated that I thought he was unfairly treated with respect 
to Watergate and he publicly supported me last year when the Board of Directors 
attempted to oust me from the company I founded. It was and is important to me 
that people know the high regard I have for this man I was privileged to call a 
friend.  
</P>
<P>
 I told the reporter that I considered President Nixon one of the great 
peacemakers of our time. Only a man with his courage and foresight could open 
up China, initiate detente with the Soviet Union and lay the groundwork for the 
successful conclusion of the Cold War and the defeat of communism. I was born 
in 1917 and moved to California during the Depression. I have lived through 
times when we all questioned with fear where events were leading us. I have 
watched many great people leave their mark on our country and our world. I know 
of no man who left a greater or more meaningful mark than Orange County's own 
Nixon. I hope that in death he will get what often eluded him in life, credit 
for the good he accomplished for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, my only comment which made it into the paper was that in the 
early years of our friendship, President Nixon used to spell Carl with a K as 
he autographed his book for me. He had a very human side that few people ever 
really saw and I have no objection to this inside joke being published if it 
helps show him in a more personal way. Yet, I simply could not let my last 
quote on this great man be about a spelling error. He deserves much better.

at San Clemente General Hospital, I remember with deep fondness the 
conversations with President Nixon. He was just as at home with his remarks 
about the Rams and football as he was about my country of birth, Croatia. He 
was very much touched by the warm reception the people gave him in Zagreb. I 
recall with fondness when he responded in 1991 with an endorsement of the 
Croatian state. God bless you, Mr. President.

 * We should take advantage of the Clinton presidency example and elect 
co-presidents in the future.My first candidate pair would be Garrison Keillor 
and Rush Limbaugh. If they ever agreed on an issue, the result would probably 
be in the direction of common sense. In the meantime, we'd be entertained. I'd 
give them each a half-hour on C-Span, but if Keillor came after Limbaugh, he'd 
get 45 minutes, because he talks more slowly. If there is fantasy baseball, can 
fantasy politics be far behind?

DEADLY REALITY: RWANDA IS DYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body count has climbed past 100,000 in Rwanda with no end of killing in 
sight. The corpses pile up on land; mutilated bodies float down rivers. Half a 
million refugees are fleeing the latest round of mass murder by the Hutu and 
Tutsi tribes. There can be no doubt that this is a crisis demanding strong 
outside intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the United Nations' expensive effort in Somalia and numerous 
on-going peacekeeping operations, an all-African peacekeeping force with U.N. 
support may be the only politically palatable response to this tribal war. 
Mounting such a force won't be easy because the Organization of African Unity 
prohibits meddling in the affairs of its members. The challenge is also 
complicated because one of Rwanda's neighbors, Uganda, a logical source of 
troops, already has taken sides. But there is a precedent for the kind of 
peacekeeping force that's needed -- Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
 When the world ignored massacres in Liberia, the Economic Community of West 
African States (ECOWAS) organized a regional peacekeeping force to intervene. 
For three years the troops, led by Nigerians, have patrolled the area around 
Monrovia, sometimes engaging rebel fighters. The perseverance of these 
peacekeepers has paid off with negotiations and plans for an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Neutrality was an issue in Liberia's civil war too. Charles Taylor, the rebel 
leader, questioned the neutrality of Nigerian troops because their president 
had supported a political rival. In response to Taylor's concerns, the United 
Nations, the OAU and the United States helped to bring in troops from Uganda 
and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda needs similar help. The United Nations ought to find a way to provide 
it. U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called on Africans to 
provide troops for a peacekeeping force financed by Western countries. The 
Clinton Administration, though against sending U.S. ground troops, is sending 
$15 million for humanitarian aid and would consider an airlift. So far, no 
African nation has pledged troops. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is safe today in Rwanda. Children and Red Cross workers have been 
killed in an orphanage. Patients have been murdered in a hospital. Parents have 
been massacred in their homes. Diplomacy has failed. Intervention is in order 
-- but Africans must take the lead.

DON'T FIRE UP THE BULLDOZERS YET; GNATCATCHER RULING NEED NOT SIGNAL A RUSH TO 
DESTROY THE BIRD'S HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge's ruling that the federal government erred in listing the California 
gnatcatcher as a threatened species is cause for concern, but not panic. Rather 
than retreat from habitat preservation, which is a sensible approach to saving 
species, federal and state officials and local planners and developers should 
reaffirm their support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington had reasonable grounds for 
ruling this week that the Interior Department should have provided opponents of 
the listing with the raw data the department used in reaching its decision. An 
ornithologist who studied the tiny birds concluded in 1988 that the California 
gnatcatcher was essentially the same as the one found in Mexico; but two years 
later he said he was wrong, that the two were different. Interior officials 
said they relied solely on the 1990 report in finding the bird "threatened." 
Both sides should have had access to all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers filed suit because the listing sharply limited their ability to 
build on coastal scrubland favored by the gnatcatcher. Although the judge's 
ruling removes a barrier to development, builders should not rush for the 
bulldozers. Indeed, two large developers, the Irvine Co. and the Santa 
Margarita Co., sensibly say they are planning to follow the habitat 
preservation program proposed by Gov. Pete Wilson and instituted last December 
by the federal government. The state Resources Agency oversees that program, 
which allows property owners to set aside habitat for rare animals, birds and 
plants in exchange for speedier approval to develop the rest of their land. 
That's a smart balance between competing concerns for jobs and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much balancing of anything in the tentative decision of the 
University of California at Santa Cruz to sell hundreds of acres of redwoods to 
a logging company because the trees serve no academic purpose. The money 
involved is small, and old-growth stands shouldn't have to be justified on the 
basis of research value alone. University regents should rethink or at least 
review that decision.

CITY WATCH; 'NO' TO A FEW THUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sponsors are right to plan to hold Fiesta Broadway again in 1995, despite 
the gang violence that forced last Sunday's street fair to close early. It 
would be sad indeed if a handful of hoodlums were to kill an annual event that 
has become the biggest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the United States, drawing 
half a million people to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 How easily a few can spoil the enjoyment of thousands was illustrated when 
promoters canceled Santa Ana's fifth annual Mariachi Festival and Fair, 
scheduled for next weekend, because of the Los Angeles disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that most gangbangers consider mariachis and other facets of 
Latin American folklore a colossal bore. They prefer the rock music that 
everyone involved agrees was the flash point at Fiesta Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 So one lesson for next year is obvious: De-emphasize entertainment that draws 
mostly teen-agers and young adults in favor of that which draws families and 
thus people of many ages. All but hard-core gang members usually behave when 
children and parents are near. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those thugs who just won't get the message any other way, make them 
unwelcome next year with a lot more security. Los Angeles police handled this 
year's trouble about as well as could be expected. Next year they must have 
more backup. A total ban on alcohol sales in the area is also a must. 
</P>
<P>
 Events like Fiesta Broadway can do so much to enliven life in a big, often 
impersonal city and are too important to surrender to a few violent losers.

STAVING OFF THE GHOSTS OF JAN. 17; LOAN PLAN WOULD BOOST CRIPPLED NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because rebuilding their Sherman Oaks homes after the Jan. 17 earthquake 
seemed too arduous, members of a condominium association have decided to move 
on. The ripple effect from loss of these consumers will feel like a tidal wave 
to nearby businesses striving to survive or weighing whether to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Situations such as this have fueled fears of economic "ghost towns" in 
quake-ravaged parts of the San Fernando Valley and other Los Angeles areas. Now 
those concerns have spurred Mayor Richard Riordan to call for an ambitious 
rebuilding plan in which at least $150 million would be loaned soon to property 
owners and banks for rapid repairs. The key beneficiaries would be those who 
otherwise might give up on rebuilding homes, particularly large apartment 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the funds would come from U.S. Community Development Block Grants 
originally designated for social services and public-structure repair. About 
$50 million would come from federal housing repair monies and $30 million from 
city-issued bonds. Flexibility in this matters has been granted by federal 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor, a shrewd businessman, feels that loans can help revitalize 
neighborhood economies, the plan certainly is worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
 A prime motivation can be found in the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern 
California: Almost five years later, many damaged communities still are 
struggling to recover economically. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council, whose approval is needed, must quickly study the 
proposal with an open mind and awareness of potential downsides. The proposed 
approach is untested; also, the plan might be turned aside by communities or 
officials who felt left out. However, an argument for experimenting is that if 
the plan works in areas bearing the brunt of the worst quake in L.A. history, 
it surely could be made to work almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Important to any finely tuned rebuilding effort is a close look at why areas 
like Sherman Oaks sustained more damage than some neighborhoods closer to the 
quake epicenter. The Ventura Boulevard area's preference for "soft story" 
construction, for example, in which a building's first floor is its parking 
garage, contributed to the massive damage there; soil conditions were another 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever heightened the damage, Riordan is right to seek a quick infusion of 
cash into once vibrant communities that otherwise might be consigned to slow, 
spreading decay.

THE 'OUTING' OF A PRO-LIFER; WHEN A DECADES-EARLIER ABORTION IS REPORTED, A 
PUBLIC PERSON MUST EXPLAIN A MOST PRIVATE DECISION.

 It was nearly 5 a.m. when my husband walked up the stairs and handed me the 
newspaper. I had drifted in and out of sleep the entire night, after receiving 
the call informing me that the article would be in the morning paper. Even now, 
as I begin to remember that morning four years ago, I can feel a knot forming 
in my stomach. I was so worried that my mom would wake up early and get the 
newspaper first. After all these years, I still couldn't tell her. Just my 
luck, the View section that day wrapped the entire paper. Maybe it always did, 
and I just never noticed before. I couldn't believe the size of the picture or 
the length of the article. Did they have to make it so big? My best friend and 
husband, Bill, and I scanned the piece first and then slowly I read and reread 
that article over a dozen times, always hoping that it really didn't say what 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline was so bold: "No More Denial." For 13 years, I had been the media 
spokesperson for the Right to Life movement in Southern California, constantly 
working with the media on any story pertaining to abortion, whether it was a 
Supreme Court decision or a demonstration in front of a clinic. So it was not 
surprising when a Times reporter called to interview me. As I quietly lay in 
bed, I remembered that horrible day 21 years ago. The drive to the abortion 
clinic, the waiting, the other women. In those last seconds of consciousness 
before the anesthesia set in, lying alone on the gurney before the abortion I 
had undergone as a pro-choice college student years ago, I remembered placing 
my hands on my stomach and inwardly screaming, "I'm so sorry."  
</P>
<P>
 Then the phones started ringing, first reporters, then friends. I didn't want 
to talk to anybody. It wasn't that my abortion was now public, although that 
hurt. But my deep pain came in reading about the unnecessary death of a child 
-- my child. It was like reading an obituary. I knew by 9 a.m. that the story 
could not be contained, it was just too juicy: the voice of Right to Life 
having undergone an abortion herself. I kept thinking, I was pro-abortion then. 
Why is this so fascinating? After all, it's not like I had an abortion after 
becoming pro-life. Who knew better than I the pain of killing? 
</P>
<P>
 My husband took our daughters to school. It was time to go next door and face 
my mother. I walked in and handed her the newspaper. I couldn't look at her. I 
just said, "I didn't tell you 21 years ago and since Dad died without ever 
knowing, I had hoped you also would never find out. If you have any questions, 
I'll be at home." I didn't see her the rest of the day, and though we remain 
extremely close, we've never spoken about my abortion since.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, I took press interviews, all separate. I couldn't face a group. But 
surprisingly, each interview became a healing catharsis. By noon I felt I would 
survive the day. Friends came over and support poured in from everywhere. I was 
truly touched. Then 3 o'clock rolled around, school was out, and it was time to 
tell my girls, then 6 and 11. I took them out to dinner away from the ringing 
phones and TV reporters. I had always intended to tell them, but I wanted to 
wait until they were old enough. I wanted to choose the time and place. Now 
that had been taken from me. I'll never forget my elder daughter's response. 
She sat quiet for a few moments and then said almost matter-of-factly, "Mom, 
you knew I always wanted an older brother or sister, so why did you kill them?" 
I had no answer.  
</P>
<P>
 Other memories are kinder, like the hundreds of letters I received over the 
next month from women I would never meet. One said, "I never told anyone in 30 
years about my daily pain, but when I read your story, it was mine." I know 
millions of women across this country feel as I do about abortion. We all 
somehow know deep down inside that we alone made a horrible decision and no 
coined phrase about choice and rights or the denial of biological and fetal 
facts can ever erase the truth. For we as mothers instinctively know during 
those moments of aloneness, that we ended the lives of separate human beings 
growing inside us. I guess I am blessed, for I strongly believe in an 
afterlife, where I will someday be reunited with my child, the life that was 
destroyed in my womb.

THE BEAN-COUNTERS TARGET HANDS-ON CARE; HEALTH REFORM: CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY 
FEELING THE PINCH AS AIDES REPLACE HOSPITAL NURSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE GORDON and JUDITH SHINDUL-ROTHSCHILD, Suzanne Gordon, author of 
Prisoners of Men's Dreams, is working on a book about nursing. Judith 
Shindul-Rothschild is an assistant professor of nursing at Boston College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For ordinary Americans, the original idea of health-care reform was not just 
expanded access to health insurance. There was also the promise of more contact 
with primary-care physicians, bedside nurses, nurse practitioners and 
physicians' assistants -- the people who, unlike expensive specialists, have 
the time and inclination to reach beyond their patients' diseases and into 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's initial focus on instituting balance in a system overly 
dependent on specialists thus gave cause for rejoicing. As the political debate 
has progressed, however, the presidential and congressional embrace of a pure 
marketplace health-care system dominated by HMOs, managed-care companies, giant 
hospital chains and insurers has produced a version of reform that will manage 
care-giving right out of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 All over the country -- and particularly in states like California and 
Massachusetts, where managed care has achieved "great market penetration" -- we 
are seeing the future in action. Hospitals are laying off bedside nurses and 
replacing them with untrained, unlicensed aides. Those nurses who remain 
operate under assembly-line conditions: The patient is a human widget who must 
be rapidly moved into and out of the hospital, no matter what the human and 
social cost. 
</P>
<P>
 These hospitals are paying tens of thousands of dollars to high-priced 
national consultants who apply business' bottom-line imperatives to health-care 
delivery. Patients facing some of the most difficult dilemmas any human being 
encounters are turned into "customers" and health care is actually compared to 
the activity of filling the tank at the local gas station. The new goal is 
"turnaround" -- or, as other hospital administrators and consultants call it, 
"through-put." To maximize efficiency, corporate managers who have no 
understanding of the devastating realities of illness dissect the complex 
activities of care-giving, fragmenting it into a series of discrete tasks that 
can be delegated to less costly aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Nurses Assn. reports that just when hospitalized patients are 
more acutely ill than ever before and discharged at an increasingly rapid pace, 
the expert nurses who can quickly evaluate their conditions, intervene on the 
spot to prevent complications and help them make the transition from hospital 
to home are the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 To cite an example, one of California's biggest HMOs has proposed widespread 
substitution of "multidisciplined care-givers" for registered nurses. The very 
heart of nursing -- the hands-on care essential to nurses' ability to diagnose, 
educate and comfort patients -- will be farmed out to aides. At some other 
hospitals, aides with only six weeks' training and no health-care background 
already are asked to do complex dressing changes and electrocardiograms, insert 
catheters and intravenous drips and draw blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring techs and firing nurses also allows hospitals to increase 
nurse-to-patient ratios. An intensive-care nurse who cared for one or two 
patients may now be asked to tend three or four, and a medical-surgical nurse 
with four or five patients may now be asked to care for seven or 10. How, 
nurses respond, can they manage the patient if they no longer have the patient 
contact that makes quality case management possible? 
</P>
<P>
 This assembly-lining of care has not only invaded the hospital, it is now 
increasingly common in HMOs and other settings where the caseloads of 
physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants are exponentially 
enlarged. Family physician caseloads at some California HMOs are rising to 
2,700 patients. The average for British doctors, who opponents of 
government-financed care cite as desperately overworked, is under 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs that are increasing patient loads acknowledge that "the numbers are 
large," but reassure physicians that their patients won't be very sick. This is 
of little consolation to the patients, sick or well, who need time to describe 
their complaints and concerns. Such assembly-line conditions significantly 
compromise the very essence of prevention and early detection. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of all of this is that managed care does not save money. With 
administrative and marketing overhead of 14% and profits running as high as 
20%, managed care is one of the costliest alternatives in the system today. 
</P>
<P>
 The least costly is the kind of single-payer, Canadian-style health-insurance 
program championed by Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) and Rep. Jim McDermott 
(D-Wash.) Congress, awash in insurance-industry campaign funds and lobbyists, 
is now trying to persuade the American public that single-payer is a political 
impossibility. What ought to be politically impossible is the kind of assault 
on real care that is now jeopardizing patients' health and making a mockery of 
the ideal of health-care reform.

PERSPECTIVE ON ISRAEL-PLO ACCORD; A VICTORY FOR MUTUAL SELF-INTEREST; ISRAELIS 
AND PALESTINIANS SHED YEARS OF ILLUSIONS IN COMING TO TERMS ON A SETTLEMENT 
ADVANCING THE MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBA EBAN, Abba Eban is a former foreign minister of Israel and a former 
ambassador to the United States and United Nations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Israeli-Palestinian agreement to be signed today in Cairo means that the 
Mideast peace process is going to be implemented despite all attempts to derail 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a victory not for virtue or conscience but for reciprocal self-interest. 
It has become possible because the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships have 
awakened from illusions. The mainstream Palestinians, after years of trial and 
error, must know that their prospect of freedom is contingent on Israeli 
security. This perception owes much to American policy which, under the Bush 
and Clinton administrations, has made Israel strong enough to accept courses 
not politically feasible before. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Israelis now understand that the greatest of all fallacies is the idea 
that one nation can rule another without consent. What the British could not do 
any longer in India or the French in Algeria or the Dutch in Indonesia or the 
Belgians in Congo or Rwanda or the Soviets in Afghanistan or the Americans in 
Vietnam or the South African whites in South Africa has also become impossible 
for Israel, despite ancient Jewish memories and pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel is not a colonial newcomer to the land of its national birth, but it is 
undoubtedly alien to the people whom it holds under rigorous military rule. The 
peace process gives Israel a chance to redeem its own democratic identity. It 
is not in the nature of democracies to rule over 1.8 million members of a 
different nation without offering them either equal justice as citizens or a 
chance to establish their own separate jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 After 27 years of military rule, the West Bank and Gaza are among the most 
chaotic, explosive and socially incoherent areas in the world. Ethnic identity 
is the pervasive criterion for the application of flagrantly unequal 
enactments. It was largely in order to liberate Israel from this incongruous 
condition that the new Israeli government received a mandate in 1992 to 
establish a Palestinian self-governing authority as the first cautious stage 
toward equality of rights and coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the policies that he now espouses, Yitzhak Rabin is not leaping into a new 
uncharted field. He is returning to the essential truths that launched Israel 
on its breakthrough to statehood under David Ben Gurion's leadership. The 
partition principle, without which Israel could not have emerged in 1948 as a 
recognized sovereign state, reasserts itself now as the only viable formula. It 
is as true in 1994 as it was in 1948 that the Israeli and Palestinian nations 
can find their harmony only by living side by side in separate areas of 
jurisdiction with integrated economies and mutual accessibility for their 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians will have to pay for prolonged rejectionism by gaining less than 
they could have obtained years ago. Israelis of the radical right will have to 
renounce the dream of establishing a colonial regime in the post-colonial age. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cairo accords will be irreversible. Despite their boasts and threats, 
Rabin's opponents will not lead Israeli occupation forces back to Gaza and the 
West Bank to re-create the kind of repressive and discriminatory regime that 
will by then be obsolete even in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 No government has a watertight formula against individual violence, but the 
peace process has greatly transformed Israel's overall economic, security and 
diplomatic situations. The number of states maintaining or seeking relations 
with Israel has jumped from 40 to 120. Israeli isolation is a thing of the 
past. At the same time, the Gulf War, the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the 
arms sales authorized by the Bush and Clinton administrations have assured 
Israel of an unprecedented predominance in the strategic balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Treaties already formulated with Jordan, and likely to be concluded with other 
negotiating partners, open spacious horizons for economic growth similar to 
that achieved by the newly industrialized nations on the Pacific Rim. Openings 
in the Arab states of the Gulf area are already beginning to appear. So are 
possibilities of trade and cooperation with the former Soviet republics, 
including those that are faithful to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's liberation from the burdens of ruling over a foreign nation will 
enable the Palestinians to advance toward self-government and thereafter to 
possible evolution to more advanced forms of independence. This must involve a 
purposeful decision on the PLO's part to thwart terrorist assaults. Skeptics 
should not doubt this possibility before the physical and technical 
opportunities have even been provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The fulfillment of the peace process will not immediately bring utopia, but 
its failure would condemn the region to profound despair of peace. Nobody in 
the Middle East or in the world community will try in the foreseeable future to 
construct a brighter opportunity for a new Middle Eastern era. Much depends on 
the willingness of the United States to carry the momentum forward in Damascus 
and Amman.

HERSHISER REMAINS BIG HIT FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: HE FAILS IN HIS BID FOR A HOME 
RUN, BUT PITCHES TEAM TO RARE 10-4 ROUT AT MONTREAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a seven-run lead, Orel Hershiser took the chance. He grabbed Mike 
Piazza's bat and took a couple hacks at the plate, swinging from his heels on 
both and missing home run glory by a couple of feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We proved it's the guy, not the bat," Hershiser said of Piazza. "He hits it 
out to right and I fall a few feet short in left." 
</P>
<P>
 With his sinker and breaking ball, though, Hershiser showed Tuesday night that 
he's the guy for the Dodger pitching staff, although his two runs batted in 
were appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by a potent offense, Hershiser pitched Los Angeles to a 10-4 victory 
over Montreal, ending the Expos' six-game winning streak and restoring some 
pride after Monday night's demoralizing 10-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser has held opponents to three earned runs or less in six starts, and 
in five of them he has turned a lead over to the bullpen. His 2.75 earned run 
average ranks seventh in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to see how he took over once the game started and came right 
out and was aggressive against the heart of their order," said Piazza, who was 
three for five with a two-run homer and two doubles. "It's good to see him step 
up and take over and that may follow suit with a couple other (pitchers) who 
see that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the Dodgers' fifth victory at Olympic Stadium in five seasons. The 
game typified how good this team can be if its pitchers can keep things close. 
It also helps if the fielders execute the game's fundamentals, a subject 
Manager Tom Lasorda addressed a little loudly before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good speech, I got up at the end and said, 'That was a good one,' " 
Hershiser said. "I think he was real rested and delivered well." 
</P>
<P>
 So imagine Lasorda's reaction in the first inning when the Expos scored two 
runs when Piazza's throw to third on a steal attempt sailed into left field 
past Tim Wallach, who was nowhere near the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Let's reverse it,' " Lasorda said. "Let them score first tonight and 
we will end up getting 18 hits. But we only got 17." 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs, Marquis Grissom broke from second and Larry Walker from first 
on a double-steal attempt. Moises Alou swung at the pitch, and Piazza fired to 
third. "We should have had some communication," Wallach said. "We will get that 
cleared up." 
</P>
<P>
 And Wallach's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first inning, the Expos, who had 19 hits against the Dodgers on 
Monday night, were held to four hits by Hershiser until the eighth inning, when 
Hershiser gave up three more, including a two-run homer to Mike Lansing, who 
hadn't hit one out in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I should have used Lansing's bat to try and hit the homer," Hershiser 
joked. "He had a couple left in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Rodney Henderson (0-1) the Dodgers tied the score in the second, 
capitalizing on an error by third baseman Jeff Gardner on a lead-off grounder 
by Eric Karros. Henderson, making his second career start, lasted only two 
batters into the fourth inning, when the Dodgers scored four runs, two on a 
two-run homer by Piazza off reliever Gil Heredia and another by Jose Offerman, 
who knocked in four runs, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman, who has a seven-game hitting streak, had his best game of the season 
-- he was three for four with a triple, two-run double and a sacrifice fly to 
increase his batting average to .221. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing well and he has a great attitude and he will get that batting 
average up," Lasorda said. "I talked with him (during the winter) about being 
happy and enjoying things and playing with enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hershiser is also happy with his pitching this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated, last season my biggest problem was consistency and this season I 
have been consistent, knock on wood," said Hershiser, who gave up four runs, 
two earned in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first six outings, that has been the key. I haven't been unbelievably 
dominating, just solid. Last season it was like, 'Who's going to show up?' This 
season, I think I have an idea that I'm the guy who is showing up."

MORNING BRIEFING: BARKLEY CAUTIONS YOUNG RIVALS TO PLAY WELL FIRST, TAUNT LATER

 Phoenix Sun star Charles Barkley believes an NBA player must pay his dues 
before taunting opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 He is annoyed by what he has heard from young Golden State players during the 
best-of-five playoff series, which Phoenix leads, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited until I became a very good player before I talked trash, probably 
four or five years," Barkley told the Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add Suns: Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that former 
Laker A.C. Green, now with the Suns, seems to get a little nastier on the court 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a dirty player," Sprewell told Jenkins. "He throws elbows, takes 
cheap shots. I've seen it on film, and now I'm seeing it on the court. Nothing 
new. It's not like somebody just told us."

 Robinson's legacy: More on standout basketball-track athletes. UCLA's Jackie

 Robinson was a Pacific Coast Conference Southern Division first team player in

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; SWEENEY'S OVERTIME GOAL LIFTS BRUINS OVER DEVILS 
</P>

<P>
 Don Sweeney, denied in the opening minutes of overtime, scored on a great pass 
by Adam Oates 9:08 into overtime Tuesday night to give the Boston Bruins a 6-5 
victory over the New Jersey Devils at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, which gave the Bruins a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinal 
series, came only seconds after Boston goaltender Jon Casey stopped Bill Guerin 
on a two-on-one with the teams skating four-on-four. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates took a pass entering the Devil zone and skated around defenseman Scott 
Niedermayer before giving the puck to Sweeney, who beat Martin Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adam made a hell of a move on Niedermayer," said Sweeney, who sat out the 
first game of the series because of a broken finger and wasn't cleared to play 
in Game 2 until after the pregame skate. "I was a little surprised that he got 
it over to me; he was in himself. But that's the kind of guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Oates, who outscored Sweeney during the regular season, 32-6, said he passed 
up the shot because Sweeney had a better one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice give-and-go," Oates said. "I didn't know he was there until the 
last second because I was concentrating on the move. I got by the guy and went 
to my backhand and I saw Donny creeping up the edge. I figured the goalie had 
to be facing me, so I gave him the quick pass and actually, I was surprised 
where he shot it, (between Brodeur's legs). That's usually a top-shelf shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brodeur: "I never saw Sweeney. But on a breakaway in overtime, you just 
don't pass the puck. When he did I tried to cover as much of the goal as 
possible, but he crossed it and it slipped between my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had come within 3.5 seconds of winning in regulation, but New 
Jersey forced the overtime on a goal by defenseman Bruce Driver after a mistake 
by Bruin defenseman Al Iafrate. 
</P>
<P>
 N.Y. Rangers 5, Washington 2 -- Adam Graves and Stephane Matteau scored in a 
19-second span in the third period at New York, helping the Rangers take a 2-0 
lead in the Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers broke open a close game with the rapid-fire goals by Graves at 
10:47 and Matteau at 11:06 of the final period to win their club-record sixth 
consecutive playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves scored from the low slot, set up by Steve Larmer's pass from the right 
corner. Matteau scored from in front on a pass from Alexei Kovalev along the 
right boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers had previously won five consecutive playoff games in 1972 and 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Esa Tikkanen gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead at 10:44 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers have outscored the opposition in their first six playoff games, 
33-8.

NBA PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE; MALONE HELPS JAZZ PUSH SPURS CLOSER TO 
OUSTER 
</P>

<P>
 Karl Malone had 24 points and 13 rebounds as the Utah Jazz rolled past the 
cold-shooting San Antonio Spurs, 105-72, on Tuesday night at Salt Lake City, 
pushing the Spurs to the brink of first-round playoff elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek scored 15 points and John Stockton had 13 points and 12 assists 
for the Jazz, who took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five Western Conference 
quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs, who are 0-4 this season and have lost 20 of 21 in Salt Lake City, 
played without Dennis Rodman. The league's three-time rebounding champion was 
suspended for one game and fined $10,000 for flagrant and technical fouls in 
Utah's 86-84 victory in Game 2 on Saturday at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson and Antoine Carr scored 16 points each for the Spurs, who made 
only 32% of their shots. Robinson made eight of 21. Terry Cummings, who started 
in place of Rodman, finished with six points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman will return to action for Game 4 on Thursday night, but it was shooting 
-- not rebounding -- that failed the Spurs on Tuesday night. The two teams were 
nearly even on the boards, but Utah was far ahead on its field-goal shooting, 
making 53% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 14 points at halftime, the Jazz outscored the Spurs, 32-16, in the 
third period to put the game away. Hornacek made four of five shots in the 
quarter, and Malone, Stockton and Ty Corbin each scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah led going into the final quarter, 78-48. A 9-2 run gave the Jazz a 
37-point lead, its largest of the game, with 9:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 118, Houston 115 -- Rod Strickland scored 25 points, 10 in the fourth 
quarter, and tied a team playoff record with 15 assists at Portland as the 
Trail Blazers avoided a first-round sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon Maxwell made two three-pointers in the final 27 seconds, one from 40 
feet, to give the Trail Blazers a scare. But Portland's Clyde Drexler deflected 
Maxwell's forced three-point shot with three seconds to play and Houston 
trailing, 117-115. The Rockets didn't get off another shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers missed five free throws in the final 54 seconds, two by 
their best shooter from the foul line, Terry Porter, to give Houston a final 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland led most of the game and withstood a 36-point performance by Hakeem 
Olajuwon, but the Rockets lead the series, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams made nine of 10 shots, scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds for 
Portland. Drexler also scored 22 points and Clifford Robinson had 18 points and 
10 rebounds as the Trail Blazers defeated the Rockets for the first time in 
seven games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Horry scored 24 points and Maxwell 19 for the Rockets.

NBA PLAYOFFS EASTERN CONFERENCE; HEAT CLOSING IN ON A HISTORY-MAKING FEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Smith scored 25 points and made three free throws in the final 18 
seconds to help the Miami Heat defeat the Atlanta Hawks, 90-86, on Tuesday 
night at Miami in Game 3 of a first-round NBA Eastern Conference playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat, which leads the series, 2-1, is trying to become the first 
eighth-seeded team to eliminate a top-seeded team in the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cleanly played game, after the Game 2 brawl Saturday. Three players, 
including Heat starting forward Grant Long, sat out Tuesday's game while 
serving suspensions that resulted from the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final 76 seconds, Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock made three three-point 
shots for his only points of the game. That cut Miami's 85-77 lead to 87-86 
with 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Smith made two free throws with 18 seconds to play, Blaylock missed 
a three-point shot. Miami got the rebound and Smith made a clinching free throw 
with 6.7 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many things went through my mind," Smith said. "My muscles got tight, but 
I tried to concentrate and follow through." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's Kevin Willis, who averaged 19.1 points during the regular season, 
missed all eight of his shots and scored two points. 
</P>
<P>
 John Salley played all 48 minutes and had the primary defensive responsibility 
for Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were coming from the weak side. They were coming over the top. They were 
coming from the baseline. They were coming from all angles," Willis said. "It's 
tough to see the basket when they're triple-teaming like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Heat Coach Kevin Loughery, "Defensively, we did a sensational job." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock made three of 15 shots and is nine of 41 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's Rony Seikaly, replacing Long for his first start since March 26, had 
20 rebounds and 12 points in only the second playoff game at Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Ehlo scored 20 points for the Hawks, who posted the best record in the 
Eastern Conference during the regular season. Danny Manning had 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 95, Cleveland 92 -- Scottie Pippen made the go-ahead basket on a 
driving left-handed layup with 1:25 to play in overtime at Richfield, Ohio, 
helping the Bulls complete a three-game sweep of a first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fourth consecutive year that the Bulls have swept a first-round 
series, and each of the previous three started the Bulls toward the NBA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fifth time in seven years that the Bulls eliminated the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen struggled against the defense of the Cavaliers' Chris Mills, but still 
led the Bulls with 23 points and 11 rebounds. He also had six assists to go 
with eight turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Kukoc scored 18 points for the Bulls, who meet the winner of the New 
Jersey-New York series in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, a rookie from Arizona and Fairfax High, scored a career-high 25 points 
and had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price scored 22 points and Tyrone Hill had 15 points and 13 rebounds 
before fouling out with two minutes to play in overtime of what turned out to 
be the last game at Richfield Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers are moving to an arena adjacent to the Cleveland Indians' Jacobs 
Field next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied for the last time at 92-92 when Bobby Phills of the 
Cavaliers made a layup with 1:49 to play in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen answered with the basket that put Chicago ahead for good, and after 
Cleveland's Gerald Wilkins missed a three-point shot with eight seconds to 
play, Horace Grant made one of two foul shots for a 95-92 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins missed another three-point attempt at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had our big guns, I think we would have won the series," Mills said of 
the Cavaliers, who played without the injured Brad Daugherty, Larry Nance and 
Hot Rod Williams. "Tonight, all the guys just gave it their all."

DESPITE HIS SLAM, CHILI LEFT WITH HOLLOW FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under different, happier circumstances, Chili Davis might have been giddy 
after slamming another ball over the outfield fence Tuesday night at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have smiled broadly, accepting post-game congratulations from 
teammates and Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He have might entertained reporters with witty banter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said Tuesday he can't feel good when there's chaos all around him. 
He can't go home content that he has done his best to help the Angels (9-18) 
win when they keep losing. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows one man can't carry a major league baseball team, even if he happens 
to be having one of the best starts of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really frustrating," Davis said after the Angels' 6-5 loss to the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing is frustrating. You lose as a team. I can't walk around and be all 
happy. It's like when everybody in your house is sick, but you're feeling good. 
You can't be happy then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel for the rest of the team. I'm kind of pleased with the way I'm going. 
It's gratifying to go home after you've played well and won. It's not 
gratifying when you've played well and lost." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Davis' lot in early May, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He's ripping the ball to all fields, terrorizing American League pitching with 
a .378 average, six home runs and 23 runs batted in. But the Angels are in a 
funk, losing six in a row and 10 of 11, and one can only wonder the trouble 
they would be in without Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, they were down, 6-1, when he stepped to the plate with the bases 
loaded and two out in the eighth inning. Yankee starter Terry Mulholland was 
teetering on the brink of disaster, and Davis pushed him over the edge, hitting 
a grand slam over the 386-foot sign in left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 It sent the crowd of 22,592 into delirium, and energized the Angels, but it 
couldn't bring them back to win. Davis' fourth career grand slam will be a 
pleasant personal memory to be sure, but he downplayed its long-term impact on 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't rely on that to happen to get us back in the ballgame," he said. 
"It's not going to happen all the time. We just have to do the little things to 
keep us in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis wasn't willing to elaborate further on what's wrong with the team, 
saying only: "I'd like to see more of a team concept. Instead of guys trying to 
do everything individually, I'd like to see a walk, a single. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty tough to carry 24 other guys on your shoulders."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS GUM UP THE WORKS AT WRIGLEY AGAIN, MAKE IT DIRTY 
DOZEN 
</P>

<P>
 The Chicago Cubs have tried almost everything -- changing uniforms, holding 
chats with fans, juggling the batting order. Still, they can't win at home in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 They broke a 92-year-old club record by losing their 12th consecutive home 
game, falling to the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2, Tuesday as Tony Fernandez and Hal 
Morris drove in two runs apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record was set in 1902, when the Cubs played at West Side 
Grounds. The previous Wrigley Field record was 10. The NL mark is 14 by the 
1911 Boston Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think about the (NL) record," said Cubs manager Tom Trebelhorn. 
"It's getting urgent for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cub starting pitcher failed again, dropping to 4-14 this season. Mike 
Morgan (0-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in four innings, struck out three 
and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Atlanta 3: Chuck Carr had the Marlins' first five-hit game and 
Florida moved two games above .500 for the first time in their two-year history 
with a 6-3 victory over the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Braves' fourth consecutive loss and ninth in 11 games, their worst 
skid since April 13-24, 1992, when they also dropped nine of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Hough (3-0) limited the Braves to four hits over six innings before 
giving up a two-run homer to Charlie O'Brien in the seventh. He gave up three 
runs and six hits, didn't walk a batter and struck out five in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hough, 46, in his 24th major league season, last beat the Braves on Sept. 17, 
1979, when he was with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 6, New York 5 -- A ninth-inning sacrifice fly by Barry Bonds 
gave the Giants the victory at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants scored two runs in the ninth against John Franco (0-1), who blew a 
save for the first time in seven opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Joe Orsulak hit a grand slam in the seventh inning to give the 
Mets a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Martinez singled to open the ninth and Jeff Reed, pinch-hitting for Mike 
Jackson (2-0), singled to put runners at first and third. Darren Lewis hit an 
infield grounder to score Martinez and tie the score at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Robby Thompson was then safe on second baseman Fernando Vina's error, and Matt 
Williams drew a walk to load the bases for Bonds. Bonds hit a drive to the wall 
in right that was grabbed over the wall by Jeromy Burnitz, robbing Bonds of a 
grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 8, Philadelphia 3 -- A.J. Sager earned his first major league 
victory and Tony Gwynn hit a home run at Philadelphia, helping the Padres end a 
five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sager (1-2) relieved starter Pedro Martinez in the third and shut out the 
Phillies on two hits for 4 2/3 innings. He walked none and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Pittsburgh 4 -- Doug Drabek survived a bullpen scare to win at 
Pittsburgh for the first time since leaving the Pirates, getting help from 
Andujar Cedeno, who hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (3-1), who left the Pirates and signed with the Astros before the 1993 
season, won his third consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek left with a 6-2 lead after giving up eight hits in seven innings. The 
Pirates scored twice in the eighth against Mike Hampton on run-scoring singles 
by Orlando Merced and pinch-hitter Lloyd McClendon. Tom Edens worked out of 
bases-loaded, one-out jam with the go-ahead run on base by retiring Carlos 
Garcia and Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Williams, who blew a save in his last appearance, pitched the ninth for 
his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 10, St. Louis 1 -- Charlie Hayes hit a three-run homer through a 
heavy rainstorm and Armando Reynoso limited the Cardinals to five hits at 
Denver.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HENTGEN PITCHES TWO-HITTER IN 1-0 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Pat Hentgen struck out a team-record 14 and pitched a two-hitter for the first 
shutout of his career Tuesday night, leading the Toronto Blue Jays past the 
Kansas City Royals, 1-0, at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Appier (2-3) lost despite pitching a three-hitter and striking out 10. 
Joe Carter drove in the only run with an infield single in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had good stuff when I was warming up in the bullpen," Hentgen said. 
"When I got to the mound to start the game, I was concentrating on keeping it 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (4-2) broke the club record for strikeouts of 12, shared by Pete 
Vukovich, Jim Clancy and Tom Candiotti. He struck out the side in the first and 
eighth innings. The 14 strikeouts are the most in the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout came in Hentgen's 41st start. He walked two in his third complete 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen him pitch any better," Royal Manager Hal McRae said. 
"Unfortunately for us, he picked a night when our guy was super, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Appier walked one in his first complete game of the season. He struck out the 
side in the third and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those games when there isn't much you can do," Appier said. 
"I had great stuff tonight, but the other guy was just a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 7, Seattle 6 -- The Red Sox lost two pitchers to injuries in the third 
inning at Boston, one during a bench-clearing brawl, but still won their sixth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Frank Viola, who underwent surgery on his left elbow last Sept. 29, 
clutched the same elbow after throwing a wild pitch far behind Eric Anthony in 
the third inning. X-rays were inconclusive, and he was scheduled for more tests 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Quantrill relieved Viola and threw a high-and-tight pitch that sent 
Anthony to the ground. Anthony was then intentionally walked, and got halfway 
to first base when he ran at Quantrill and tackled the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Quantrill wound up on the bottom of a pileup. When order was restored, the 
right-hander left with numbness in his pitching hand. Anthony was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Bankhead (3-0) pitched 3 1/3 hitless innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 9, Oakland 1 -- Ben McDonald pitched a five-hitter to become the 
American League's first six-game winner and Mike Devereaux hit two home runs at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the 13th in 14 games for the A's. Baltimore won for the fifth 
time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald (6-0) struck out eight and walked three in his second consecutive 
complete game. It was Devereaux's fourth career multi-homer game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Darling (2-3), unlucky in his last outing when he went the distance in a 
1-0 loss to Frank Viola and the Boston Red Sox, was tagged for six runs and 
nine hits in six-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Detroit 2 -- Juan Gonzalez had four hits and three runs batted in, 
and Kevin Brown pitched a complete game at Detroit to help the Rangers hand Tim 
Belcher his career-worst fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave up eight hits, including home runs by Mickey Tettleton and Tony 
Phillips, struck out eight and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (0-5), who lost four consecutive games in 1989 while pitching for the 
Dodgers, gave up six runs on nine hits and walked three in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 12, Cleveland 1 -- Alex Fernandez gave up six hits in eight innings 
and Frank Thomas hit a three-run homer for the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez (3-3) gave up a leadoff homer to Jim Thome in the eighth, ending his 
scoreless streak of 19 consecutive innings. Fernandez, who has two shutouts 
this season, walked none and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Raines had three hits, and Robin Ventura had three hits and two runs 
batted in for the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Minnesota 6 -- Greg Vaughn, who made the final out in Scott 
Erickson's no-hitter last week, drove in five runs with a homer and double as 
the Brewers rocked Erickson at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson (2-4) gave up nine hits and seven runs in five innings. Erickson, who 
led the major leagues in hits given up and losses in 1993 and brought a 7.48 
earned-run average into last Wednesday's 6-0 victory over the Brewers, hasn't 
won consecutive decisions since September 1992.

CUBS NOW 0 FOR 12 AT WRIGLEY; BASEBALL: TREBELHORN TRIES A NEW LINEUP, BUT REDS 
WIN, 5-2. 
</P>

 The Chicago Cubs have tried almost everything -- changing uniforms, holding 
chats with fans, juggling the batting order. Still, they can't win at home in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 They broke a 92-year-old club record by losing their 12th consecutive home 
game, falling to the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2, Tuesday as Tony Fernandez and Hal 
Morris drove in two runs apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record was set in 1902, when the Cubs played at West Side 
Grounds. The previous Wrigley Field record was 10. The NL mark is 14 by the 
1911 Boston Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think about the (NL) record," Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. 
"It's getting urgent for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The players are frustrated, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying hard but nothing helps," said pitcher Jose Bautista. "When we 
pitch good, we don't hit. When we hit, we don't get the pitching. We need our 
starters to go six innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn, who tried new uniforms on Monday, juggled his lineup Tuesday. 
Sammy Sosa moved from fifth to leadoff, Karl Rhodes dropped to second and Ryne 
Sandberg went from second to fifth in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get more speed at the top and some more power in the middle," 
Trebelhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 But starting pitching failed again, dropping to 4-14 this season. Mike Morgan 
(0-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in four innings, struck out three and 
walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this team was going good, like in 1992, I'd win that game 5-4," said 
Morgan, who knows about losing. "I was on the Baltimore team (in 1988) that 
lost 21 in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Hanson (2-1) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits in five 
innings. Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have my good stuff today but I hung in there," said Hanson, who 
didn't want to be the guy who lost the first game at Chicago in 1994. "It's in 
the back of your mind. You don't want to be that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds sympathize with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a streak where we lost nine or 10 in a row. They just have to 
bear it. They are going to win. They are a good team," said Barry Larkin, who 
had two of Cincinnati's 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati went ahead, 3-0, in the second. Fernandez, six for 10 with nine 
RBIs against Chicago this season, doubled in the first run and Morris drove in 
two with a bases-loaded single. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony has just been playing great, getting those big, key RBIs," Red Manager 
Davey Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's sacrifice fly in the third scored Thomas Howard, who doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick May left after spraining his left wrist stretching for Howard's hit 
into the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Buechele and pinch-hitter Kevin Roberson had RBI singles in the fourth 
as the Cubs closed to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin drove in a run with a bases-loaded bunt single in the sixth.

 If Ramon Martinez could pitch in a game the way he throws in practice, he 
probably wouldn't have an 0-2 record with a 5.23 earned-run average.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he threw on the side before his last couple of starts, it was really 
unbelievable," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "The movement on his 
fastball and his location was great and he had his curveball and changeup 
working. Then he shows up for an inning or two in the game and has a bad 
inning, like in New York, and before you know it. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has given up 10 earned runs in 11 1/3 innings during his last two 
starts. Perranoski said that in spring training, they were able to pinpoint 
problems by looking at films. By the time camp broke, Perranoski said he 
believed Martinez was on his game.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to weather the storm," Perranoski said.  
</P>

 With his payroll at a low $18.8 million, Expo General Manager Kevin Malone 
said he has been told by management that he doesn't need to make any trades to 
cut costs further. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is interest (by other clubs) in (Marquis) Grissom and (Larry) Walker, 
Mel Rojas and a lot of our players," Malone said. "Rojas is leading the league 
in saves, yet John Wetteland is one of the premier closers in the game, so I 
like having two guys in the bullpen who can close." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone said Grissom and Walker are not available, but the club has a top 
outfield prospect, Rondell White, at triple A, waiting for a spot to open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got Rondell White if we did do something with one of our outfielders," 
Malone said. "If somebody made us an offer I can't refuse, well . . . But it 
would come with a price tag for a high-quality player." 
</P>
<P>
 With Wetteland activated after Tuesday's game, Rojas will move back to a setup 
role. Rodney Henderson, who started Tuesday's game, was scheduled to be sent 
back to triple A.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the Dodgers' 26 games have been decided by two runs or fewer and 
in those games, the Dodgers have a 7-10 record. . . . Raul Mondesi, who did not 
play Monday because of a bruised heel, started in right field Tuesday. . . . 
Brett Butler left the game after the fifth inning because of a sore back.

 Joe Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery Feb. 8, will make his 
season debut tonight against the New York Yankees. Although he pitched Saturday 
for triple-A Vancouver, the Angels are bringing him back one day early to face 
the primarily left-handed Yankee lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I let the club down," said Magrane, who's guaranteed $3 million 
through 1995, and is eligible to earn $9.3 million over three years. "They put 
a lot of faith in me, and I got hurt. That's why I want to bust my (butt) for 
them.

 "I also have re-appreciation of the game now. Let's face it, this is one of 
the most exclusive men's clubs in the country, and you can't buy your way in.

 Angel pitcher Mark Langston is progressing so quickly from his April 12 elbow 
surgery that he is planning on returning to the starting rotation May 13-15 
against the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said he threw without pain for 75 pitches Tuesday. He is scheduled to 
throw lightly Thursday, then pitch a simulated game Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, Dr. Lewis Yocum agrees there is no reason Langston can't 
pitch against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a big day for me for turning it up a notch," Langston said. "I 
didn't throw 100% (velocity), but I got close. It's a tremendous relief for 
me."

 Former Angel left fielder Luis Polonia, after seeing the hole at Anaheim 
Stadium caused by the Northridge earthquake: "That thing cost $10 million? They 
could have paid me that." 
</P>
<P>
 Polonia, who signed a two-year, $3-million contract with the New York Yankees, 
went to the Angel bench before the game and planted a kiss on 92-year-old coach 
Jimmie Reese's cheek, telling him how much he missed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Polonia says he doesn't accept the juiced-ball theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the ball's juiced," Polonia said, "but if it is, why don't I have 
five to 10 homers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Polonia has hit more than two homers only once, in 1987, when he had four. 
That was the last season that the ball was "juiced."

 Angel left-handed reliever Ken Patterson underwent elbow surgery Tuesday and 
will be sidelined for at least a year, Yocum said.

eight-ounce Corazon Elizabeth was born. . . . The Angels pushed Mark Leiter 
back two days in the rotation, and he will now start Saturday, allowing rookie 
Brian Anderson to pitch on his fifth day. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Sylmar High defensive back Dwight Patton signed a letter of intent to play 
football at Utah State, Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound All-East Valley League selection, took a 
recruiting trip to Utah State last weekend, one week after receiving a score on 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test that met NCAA requirements.It was the only 
recruiting trip taken by Patton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big load off his mind," Engilman said. "He's been rejuvenated." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, who was also the Spartans' leading receiver with 24 catches for 468 
yards and five touchdowns, is the third Sylmar player from the 1993 team to 
earn a scholarship. Running back Tyrone Crenshaw signed with Michigan State and 
defensive back Robert Camacho will play for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. PAIGE A.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: WHAT'S NEXT, ROTISSERIE TROUT STATS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How successful were you on opening day at Crowley Lake? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to statistics compiled by Department of Fish and Game biologists, you 
can measure your success against others', provided you were one of the 5,000 or 
so trout fishermen who dropped a line into the popular Eastern Sierra reservoir 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 3,000 anglers fishing from boats, and of those, the average 
catch was 4 1/4 fish, meaning many fishermen landed the five-fish limit.  
</P>
<P>
 If you were among the 2,000 or so shore fishermen and didn't do so well, you 
weren't alone. Shore fishermen averaged only about two fish apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, according to DFG biologist Curtis Milliron, might be that the 
Kamloop-strain rainbow trout normally caught by shore anglers were sexually 
mature, thanks to several weeks of spring-like weather before the opener, and 
already in the streams and tributaries to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The average size of the trout caught was 1.11 pounds and 13 3/4 inches long. 
Of fish that were stocked last year, Milliron said, the average weight was .98 
pounds and the length 13 1/4 inches. Of carry-over fish -- those stocked at 
least two years ago -- the average weight was 2.17 pounds and 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing slowed some on Sunday and remains fair at best, possibly, Milliron 
said, "because the fish that were easy pickin's were caught on opening day." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that fishing typically picks up again at the end of May or early 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all DFG wardens had submitted their opening-day reports as of Tuesday 
afternoon, but those who had said the new wear-your-license rule seems to be 
working.  
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen wardens who had submitted reports -- 25 wardens were in the field -- 
made a combined 4,340 contacts with fishermen and reported compliance rates as 
high as 98%. Anglers were warned to display their licenses if they were seen 
without them, and only two citations were issued for fishing without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 wardens issued 28 citations for over-limits, six for illegal use of 
gear, four for fishing before the season began on Saturday, three each for 
using two fishing poles, night fishing in Mono County (night fishing is legal 
in Inyo County), catching undersized fish and using illegal gear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley Lake might be the most popular place for Southlanders on opening day, 
but last Saturday the spotlight in Northern California was on the Dunsmuir 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a much larger number of people than we expected, and some of them were 
even fishermen," said Alan Harvey, city manager. "There were a lot of news 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of the Upper Sacramento River devastated by a pesticide spill 
after a train wreck in 1991 was reopened for fishing for the first time since 
the disaster, which killed an estimated one million fish. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fisher, a Dunsmuir businessman and president of the Chamber of Commerce 
when the spill occurred, said he and a few others counted more than 125 people 
fishing the six-mile stretch of river that had been stocked with small 
hatchery-raised trout by the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all catching fish," Fisher said. "Kids were catching them, grandpa 
was catching them. I saw two kids standing under the (Interstate 5) bridge and 
they had an 18-inch fish that had survived the spill. A guy down at Soda Creek, 
and we were all watching, pulled out a 22-inch trout that had to weigh 5-6 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the native trout in the river, all but the six-mile stretch -- in 
which anglers can keep five trout a day -- has been designated as catch and 
release only. Fishery experts predict a strong comeback on the part of the 
native fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harvey said, the opening of another trout season in Dunsmuir marks 
"an end of a disappointing and unhappy time for our city." SALTWATER FISHING 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the fleet is still waiting for things to pick up. White seabass 
surfaced last weekend at Catalina, but only a dozen or so fish were caught by 
anglers aboard three boats. There is, however, a steady bonito bite at the 
island, but little elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all eyes are on the horizon. Large schools of albacore, 1,200 miles 
west of Point Loma, are moving east toward San Diego. According to Cortez Yacht 
Charters in Lemon Grove, the fish are traveling about 18-20 miles a day, which 
would bring them within range of the fleet in late June or early July. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: The Polaris Supreme returned Sunday from Mexico's 
Revillagigedo Islands with a small load of giant yellowfin tuna. Two fish 
weighed more than 300 pounds each, and a 258.2-pounder caught by Tom Pfleger 
will be a world record in the 30-pound line class if approved by the 
International Game Fish Assn. Pfleger is a partner in the vessel's ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Marlin activity is improving, but the bite is anything but 
consistent. Strong winds have not helped matters. Yellowfin tuna, however, 
remain plentiful and apparently hungry, with some pushing 50 pounds. Dorado are 
becoming more prevalent by the week, but most of the fish are small, with few 
topping 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Del Cabo: Yellowfin tuna activity has slowed some, but fishermen are 
still landing one or two per trip. Winds have hampered the fishing effort, but 
trips to Destiladeras and Los Frailes are proving worthwhile for marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Yellowfin tuna are providing plenty of action, especially the 
50-pounders cruising beneath the porpoises. Dorado and wahoo are making their 
presence known as well. A 102-pound wahoo was the week's top catch. MISCELLANY

FISHING REPORT: LUNKER BASS AT CASITAS THE RULE, NOT EXCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the size of the bass coming out of Lake Casitas in recent weeks, it's 
not surprising that a recent tournament at the Ventura County reservoir 
produced outstanding results. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place team of Dana Rosen and Darin Tochihara set a record for any 
major bass tournament with a six-fish limit totaling 63.26 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The catch last Saturday included three fish weighing more than 10 pounds, 
including a 13.52-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest bass of the tournament, however, was a 15.47-pounder caught by 
Brian Mitchell of Ventura. Mitchell and Todd Holder of Ojai finished second 
with six fish totaling 36.97 pounds.

LOS ALAMITOS; AT 82, HE STILL HAS TROPHY TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quarter horse owner since 1944, and a fan even before that, Spencer Childers 
is still finding the best parts of the game. With a barn full of promising 
2-year-olds and a race named after him, the 82-year-old Childers should be easy 
to spot at Los Alamitos this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be the one presenting the trophy to the winners of the Spencer 
Childers California Championship on Saturday night. And he probably will be the 
one accepting the trophy in a later futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since buying his first horse 50 years ago, Childers has become more involved 
each year. A former president of both the Peninsula Racing Assn., which raced 
at Bay Meadows, and the Pacific Quarter Horse Racing Assn., which represents 
owners, breeders and trainers, he now serves on the board of directors at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 And still, he was surprised to learn that Ed Allred, who owns Los Alamitos, 
had named a race in his honor. "I asked Ed about that," Childers said. "I said, 
'How come you named one for me? I'm not dead yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Childers already has two winners among the nine juveniles he sent to trainer 
Daryn Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hardly know yet which are the better ones," Childers said. "Only six have 
started, but of the six, two were very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlasting, by Chicks Beduino, and That's Pretty Easy, by Easy Brace, have won 
allowance races. Mind Your Heart posted faster qualifying times, but then 
disappointed in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 The race named for Childers is a 400-yard test for older horses bred in 
California. Four Forty Blast leads the list of 16 nominees for the $40,000 
race. Trained by Jaime Gomez, Four Forty Blast won six consecutive starts last 
year. The richest runner in the race, his earnings total $319,894 and his 
record shows 13 victories in 22 races. 
</P>
<P>
 The other stake this weekend is the Grade III War Chic Handicap. Mr. Diddy Wa 
Diddy, Nicotine and Rapid Champ head the field of nine in the $20,000 race for 
3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Pete won the 870-yard race last year, becoming the first thoroughbred 
to do so in the 23-year history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Meier, a jockey turned trainer, has decided to return to riding again, and 
started by accepting mounts in two states last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he rode Skirt Chasing Alibi in the Dixie Downs Futurity at Dixie 
Downs in St. George, Utah. He then drove back to Las Vegas and caught a flight 
for Los Angeles. With an hour's time difference in Utah, he was able to arrive 
at Los Alamitos in time to ride in the seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
 Meier quit riding last July. He wanted to train and chose to study with Hall 
of Fame thoroughbred trainer Jack Van Berg. "He's like a dad to me," Meier 
said. "But after seven months, I'd gone as far as I was going to go. I was 
running a barn for him and the next step was assistant trainer. Neither of his 
sons (Van Berg's assistants) are leaving any time soon, so I went on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarter horse owners whom he had ridden for supported him and Meier started 
with one horse in training at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried training, but I saw guys who were riding two or three times a week 
last year were riding two or three times a night," Meier said. "With two of 
last year's top riders gone, it seemed there was an opportunity. I really think 
I can be in the top five." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Cardoza, who has the most victories as a jockey at Los Alamitos, won his 
first stakes race as a trainer with Pretty Sensation in the Orange Stakes last 
Saturday. . . . Jockey Carlos Bautista, who suffered a shoulder injury when he 
was thrown in late April, will be out of action for another two or three weeks. 
What doctors originally thought was only a strained shoulder turned out to be a 
break. . . . With cross-simulcasting of the Hollywood Park races on Friday 
night, Los Alamitos Race Course handled $1,852,231, which tops all of its 
Friday night handles, including this year's opening night.

the day tied for first and Riverside had rallied for three runs in the top of 
the sixth to tie it, 3-3. But Hodges led off bottom of the seventh with a home 
run, his second of the game, and Cypress went on to a 4-3 victory. He finished 
the three-game week going six for 11 with three home runs, five runs scored and 
four RBIs. Hodges starts this week hitting .368 with 10 home runs, and he has

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FOUNTAIN VALLEY RIPS HUNTINGTON BEACH, 16-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's Deric Yanagisawa called it a huge game. He came up with a 
performance of equal proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa, a senior third baseman, drove in five runs as the Barons crushed 
Huntington Beach, 16-2, Tuesday at Huntington Beach to move closer to their 
second consecutive Sunset League championship. Fountain Valley (21-2, 9-2), the 
No. 1-ranked team in Orange County, has a two-game lead with three games to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was so huge," Yanagisawa said. "We came out here ready to play. We 
showed them we were ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa and company ought to have been prepared. The Barons took four hours 
of batting practice Monday in an effort to shake off a recent hitting slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it paid off," Coach Ron LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley edged fourth-ranked Huntington Beach (16-7, 6-4), in the first 
meeting, 1-0. Tuesday's game was over when the Barons scored eight runs in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa, the team leader in RBIs, had the biggest hits. He broke the game 
open with a two-run single in the second. He then doused any ideas of a 
comeback with a three-run home run in the fourth, giving him 29 RBIs for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got the single my first reaction was relief," Yanagisawa said. "I was 
not going to be in a slump the rest of my life. The home run was a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa wasn't the only Baron to shake loose. Designated hitter Chris 
Ponchak, who has struggled much of the season, had three hits, including a 
double that tied the score, 1-1, in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Roman, Geoff Wilson and Danny Hoppie each drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 It all supported pitcher Jason Liuzzi, who gave up one hit and two earned runs 
in four innings. Liuzzi (5-0) has given up only two earned runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be happier than I am right now," said LaRuffa, whose teams have won 
37 of 40 games over the last two seasons. "I think we're peaking at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 6, Ocean View 5 -- The Friars rallied in the bottom of the sixth, 
scoring five runs on five hits to take a 6-5 lead. Eric Jekums had a two-run 
double and Kirk Rossi doubled in the winning run in the inning. Kevin Krotz was 
three for three with two RBIs for Servite (13-8-1, 7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster 4, Santa Ana 3 -- John Matlock's sacrifice fly with one out in the 
seventh inning scored Brian Rinkowski with the winning run for host Westminster 
(12-10, 5-6). Kent Montgomery (8-2) gave up seven hits and no earned runs in 
his sixth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 3, Edison 1 -- Justin Lynch (6-1) pitched a five-hitter, striking out 
five, for visiting Marina (15-9, 5-6). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Arrowhead League: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Christian 12, Sherman Indian 1 -- Keith Ridgeway pitched a 
four-hitter with 11 strikeouts and also hit a home run for visiting Southern 
California Christian (12-4-1, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Century League: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 8, Foothill 7 -- Eric Valent had a double, a triple, and a three-run 
home run for Canyon (17-5, 10-2). Valent finished with six RBIs and two runs 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 5, Santa Ana Valley 4 (11) -- Matt Brady scored on a throwing error 
in the bottom of the 11th to break a 4-4 tie for host Villa Park (14-8, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Express League: 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Christian 14, Claremont 1 -- Dave Acheson had three hits and two RBIs 
for Heritage Christian (8-7, 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran 4, Brethren Christian 3 -- Adam Cavaness pitched six innings, 
striking out five and giving up one earned run for Orange Lutheran (8-12, 4-4). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 15, Laguna Hills 0 -- Ryan Poe (3-0) pitched a four-hitter with 
five strikeouts as host Trabuco Hills (17-5, 12-0) clinched the league title.  
</P>
<P>
 Jake Anderson and Matt Rechner each had two hits and two RBIs for Trabuco 
Hills, the ninth-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 3, Century 0 -- Jairo Arceyut (3-6) struck out 10 and gave up two 
hits to record his second shutout for Estancia (10-12, 6-6).

PREP ROUNDUP; PACIFICA HANDS KENNEDY ITS FIRST LEAGUE LOSS IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toni Mascarenas scored on a bases-loaded bunt by Shelly Dunn in the bottom of 
the eighth inning to give host Pacifica a 2-1 victory over Kennedy in softball, 
handing the Fighting Irish their first Garden Grove League loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the eighth, Mascarenas walked, stole second and moved to third 
on a wild pitch.Natasha Sisco was intentionally walked to load the bases, and 
Dunn, who had previously bunted into a fielder's choice and for a sacrifice, 
bunted again. Mascarenas slid home under the tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (15-5-1, 9-1-1 in league), which tied Kennedy this season, moved a 
half-game behind first-place Kennedy (17-5-1, 10-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Val Downen started Pacifica off in the first inning with a single to 
short, went to second on an error, was sacrificed to third and came home on a 
sacrifice fly by Andrea Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy answered in the second. After loading the bases, on a hit batter, 
error and single by Erryn Gutjahr, Kristy Hensel was thrown out at the plate on 
a grounder by Summer Perkins. The next batter, Leslie Prochaska, drove in Joy 
Hannifin with a groundball out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, Pacifica's Kristin Freed struck out with two outs and the bases 
loaded. She redeemed herself in the eighth, catching Perkins' line drive on the 
run with two outs and two on. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica Coach Rob Weil had to shuffle the lineup in the second inning when 
right fielder Kristina Carlson injured her knee while at bat. Dunn replaced 
Carlson and went to left, while Freed and Amy Smith each moved over one spot in 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Carlson) before she went to the hospital, 'There's a reason for 
everything,' and now was (Dunn's) turn," said Weil. "She's been patient, 
waiting to play for three years." HEATHER STEVENS

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL; BELOVSKY, HODGES PUSH CYPRESS CLOSER TO ORANGE 
EMPIRE TITLE

<P>
 Cypress is within a game of the Orange Empire Conference baseball title 
largely because of Josh Belovsky's pitching and Jason Hodges' hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky pitched a three-hitter and Hodges hit a home run as the Chargers beat 
host Rancho Santiago, 1-0, Tuesday.Belovsky, a sophomore right-hander, had 
beaten Rancho Santiago, 4-0, earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory keeps Cypress (32-10, 17-5 in conference) one game ahead of 
Riverside with two left. Cypress has beaten Riverside three of four times this 
season, so if the teams tie, the Chargers would get the No. 1 seeding into the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky (7-2) got the first two outs in the ninth before walking Matt 
Kastelic. That brought up Toby Sanchez, who leads the conference with 14 home 
runs. Kastelic went to second on a wild pitch but Belovsky struck out Sanchez 
on a breaking pitch in the dirt. The ball bounced off catcher David Trentine 
and back to Belovsky, who threw to first to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that I couldn't give (Sanchez) anything to hit out of the 
yard," Belovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges' home run opened the seventh and was his 11th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended any chance for Rancho Santiago (31-10, 14-8) to win a fifth 
consecutive conference title. STEVE KRESAL

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vince Roman set a school record by driving in nine runs in Rio Mesa's 26-2 
Channel League victory over San Marcos on Tuesday at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman, a junior first baseman, broke Dmitri Young's record of eight runs 
batted in set in 1991. Young plays in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman drove in four runs in the first inning with a single and double. He 
added a two-run single in the third and hit a two-run home run in the fourth. 
Roman's final RBI came on a sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus 5, Canyon 3 -- The Cowboys took a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth on a 
two-out, two-run home run by Mike Bench, but Danny Cato of Saugus came through

EL CAMINO REAL RIDES WOLF PAST TAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Camino Real High gave Taft plenty of chances to steal a victory in a West 
Valley League baseball game Tuesday, but the Toreadors stumbled nevertheless 
because of sloppy baserunning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores overcame four errors and rode the strength of Randy Wolf's 
arm in the late innings to hold on for a 2-1 victory and move into second place 
in the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf allowed two hits and an unearned run. Wolf (9-1) had 10 strikeouts, 
including six in the final three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real improved to 15-4, 7-3 in the Northwest Valley Conference; Taft 
fell to 12-11, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's biggest pitch came in the sixth inning with two runners on base, two 
out and a full count on Dave Helman. In the first inning, Helman had let his 
bat fly after a swing, and it sailed over the screen and into the El Camino 
Real dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Helman held onto the bat in the sixth but still struck out on a curveball to 
end the Toreadors' best late inning threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was kind of a lucky day," Wolf said. "We weren't playing our best in 
the field but I guess we were able to do it when it counted." 
</P>
<P>
 One break came after Taft's Chad Marriner led off the sixth by reaching base 
on an error. Before his next pitch, Wolf picked off Marriner. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the seventh, Taft pitcher Dusty Cook reached first on an 
error. Wolf struck out Mike Ferguson, but Cook, thinking the ball had eluded 
catcher Steve Riback, tried to advance. Cook was caught in a rundown and tagged 
out to end the game.

in two runs and Cesar Martinez broke a conference record with his 30th stolen 
base. He has 38 steals overall.

 Bakersfield 7, Glendale 6 -- Three singles, three doubles and a sacrifice fly 
led to five Bakersfield runs in the sixth inning as the Renegades (24-16) 
remained one game behind Pierce. Brian Warner hit his eighth home run for 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons 20, Valley 9 -- Canyons had seven players with at least two hits,

<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Mortensen placed 10th in the Foot Locker West regional 
cross-country meet in December, and her success has continued this spring. She

3,200 in Friday's finals. "She has a good work ethic, but she is an absolutely 
fierce competitor," Thousand Oaks distance coach Jack Farrell said. "I think 
that's what sets her apart."

GRANADA HILLS ADVANCES IN 4-A VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Granada Hills High volleyball team marked the day that Mike DiSimone 
signed to play for San Diego State with a three-game victory over South Gate 
Tuesday in the first round of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 15-12, 15-3, 15-8 victory over the 14th-seeded Rams was not as 
impressive as the third-seeded Highlanders -- especially DiSimone -- would have 
liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "To fall behind the 14th-place team, 12-8 (in the first game), that's pretty 
bad," said DiSimone, the lone returning starter from last season's team. "I 
don't know if we thought it wasn't going to be hard, or if we were looking 
ahead, but if we play like that again I'm pretty sure we'll be out of it pretty 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (13-1) will play host to a quarterfinal match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSimone, a 6-foot-5 senior outside hitter, led the Highlanders with 15 kills 
and also officially announced his signing with San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-City selection said last week he favored San Diego State over UCLA, 
Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine because of its coastal location and its 
scholarship offer. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSimone had six kills during game two, sparking Granada Hills' game-ending 
14-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders blew an 8-5 lead in game one and trailed 12-8, but Highlander 
middle blocker Earnest Yun had three kills during a 7-0 run to close out the 
comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yun finished with seven kills and three blocks and setter Victor Chang had 30 
assists, overcoming a shaky start and finishing strongly.

<P>
 Rodney Peete, a part-time starter for the Detroit Lions the last four years, 
signed a one-year contract Tuesday with the Dallas Cowboys, filling a vacancy 
created when backup quarterback Bernie Kosar signed with the Miami Dolphins. 
Peete had worked out for Ram coaches Monday at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed, but his salary was expected to be less than the $1.2 
million he received last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete, who will back up Troy Aikman, was drafted in the sixth round in 1989 
after playing at USC. He was a college rival of Aikman, who played for UCLA, 
but said last week, "I know my place with the Cowboys. It would be as insurance 
for Troy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peete started 47 games for the Lions. He completed 489 of 873 passes for 6,494 
yards.

 The Washington Bullets will hire Philadelphia 76er General Manager Jim Lynam

 Lynam, who met with Washington Bullet General Manager John Nash on Saturday to 
discuss the position, made his decision Tuesday night during a talk with 
Philadelphia owner Harold Katz, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynam was head coach with the San Diego and Los Angeles Clippers from 1983-85

OPPONENTS ASSAIL RV PARK PLAN; PORT HUENEME: POLICE BRIEFLY SUBDUE SOME IN 
CROWD OF NEARLY 300 RESIDENTS PROTESTING CITY BEACH PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 300 residents packed a raucous Port Hueneme City Council meeting 
Tuesday night to express concerns about a proposal to build a recreational 
vehicle park on a city-owned beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying signs that said "Save Our Wetlands," and "City Officials, Your Jobs 
Are at Stake," many in the overflow crowd booed and hissed -- or cheered -- as 
speakers addressed the council at the special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were forced briefly to subdue some residents in the crowd who yelled at 
city officials during a slide presentation of the project at the beginning of 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a proposal to build a 144-space RV park on a 10-acre beachfront 
site at the end of Ocean View Drive at Port Hueneme Beach Park. The council was 
scheduled late Tuesday to vote on an addendum to an environmental impact report 
that said the RV park would cause minimal harm to its surrounding natural 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and some residents have long opposed the plan and many of 
them spoke at Tuesday's meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to buy a home near an RV site," said Katy Greenstreet, who said 
the value of her condominium has dropped about 30% since the park was first 
proposed. "If they put the RV park on the beach, their toilets will be facing 
my windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Grissinger, a resident of the Port Hueneme beach area since 1977, said 
the park would diminish the quality of life in the area. "I'm concerned about 
what type of people would come here. Would crime increase? How about 
pollution?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, some residents who support the park came to its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Nichols, an RV owner and city resident since 1957, said the park would 
benefit the city. "It is hard to find a good RV resort and that is what the 
city is proposing to do here," he said. "I definitely support the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. and the Sierra Club 
said they plan to file a federal lawsuit against the city if the project is 
approved. They charge that the park would violate the federal endangered 
species act and would also be in violation of federal laws because the park 
would limit access to public land. 
</P>
<P>
 "If by chance hell freezes over and you gain approval at the (state) Coastal 
Commission, we will go into the courts and tie up this project for years," said 
Tom Brigham, president of the homeowners association. "Believe us, we know how 
to do it. The first volley is being fired tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The city must obtain approval from the state Coastal Commission to move ahead 
with its plan, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has maintained that the RV resort is the most feasible means for the 
city to raise money without raising taxes or assessments, said City Manager 
John R. Velthoen. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say the park would significantly obstruct their ocean views and 
said the city is violating their property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bought property, the city promised us that the beach would remain a 
park," said homeowner David Kanter in an interview before the meeting. "Now I 
feel they are breaking their word. They are breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have argued that the park would disturb the habitat of the 
California least tern, an endangered shorebird that nests on Ormond Beach, just 
south of the proposed site. But city officials dispute that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday marked the second time the council has considered an environmental 
impact report for the project since it was first proposed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, under pressure from the state Coastal Commission and the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service over the project's effect on the environment, the 
council sent the original environmental impact report back for revision. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has also been criticized by some as a potential money loser that 
would not fulfill the city's stated goal to raise $400,000 in revenues a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, an economic study by a group opposing the RV resort asserted 
that the project would lose $190,000 in its first two years and would never be 
a good investment for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, contend the financially strapped city would offer an 
RV resort that would provide more amenities than any RV park in the area.

RESIDENTS PLEAD TO BE LEFT OUT OF OXNARD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 100 residents of Oxnard's La Colonia barrio crowded City Hall on 
Tuesday to beg city officials to exclude them from a proposed redevelopment 
area they fear would expose them to bulldozing or higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker after speaker, many of them addressing the City Council in Spanish, 
made emotional pleas to be left out of a redevelopment district that would 
collect extra property taxes to help renovate blighted neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project purports to give us services which we as taxpayers are already 
paying to receive," said La Colonia resident Patrick Barrios. "We did not ask 
for this project. It's being imposed on us." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly two hours of similar comments, the council decided to move 
forward with the redevelopment district that could include much of the city, 
but would exclude La Colonia and the Cal-Gisler neighborhood in south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two council members actually voted for the plan because a majority of the 
council withdrew from the discussion on the advice of City Atty. Gary Gillig. 
Mayor Manuel M. Lopez and Councilmen Bedford Pinkard and Thomas E. Holden own 
property within the redevelopment district boundaries, and Gillig urged them to 
exclude themselves from the discussion and vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state Fair Political Practices Commission had adopted provisions 
for such circumstances that allow just two members of an elected five-member 
board to approve a redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Tuesday's action instructs city staff to pursue the second phase 
of a redevelopment plan that was initially approved last December. During the 
second phase, staff and consultants can spend $227,000 to determine exactly 
what areas are blighted and come up with a list of potential redevelopment 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the funding for this study will come from general fund reserves. But 
the city would also borrow $180,000 from the Ormond Beach Redevelopment Fund 
and repay its reserves with interest next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment agencies generate extra tax revenue for cities by drawing a line 
on property taxes, then diverting what additional taxes are paid over future 
years when taxes rise because of increasing property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Richard Maggio said the proposed district could 
raise tens of millions of dollars over the next several decades to be used for 
various projects to give face-lifts to specific neighborhoods or business 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies often borrow against the anticipated increase in property taxes and 
spend the money on renovations in blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a funding tool which allows current improvements to be made with future 
tax revenues," City Manager Thomas Frutchey told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents do not see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Branthoover of the Rio Linda Neighborhood Council said the plan would 
create "another layer of debt we don't need." She also complained that 
residents never get a say in how the money is eventually spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Others criticized project consultant Vern Hazen, who was hired to sell the 
plan to neighborhood leaders after quitting as city manager late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazen's reports to the council that most of the 17 community groups approve of 
the plan are "inaccurate, incomplete and misleading," said Alfred Zarate, who 
said he owns four lots in the La Colonia neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilmen Michael A. Plisky and Andres Herrera, the only two council 
members left to vote on the matter, agreed with Frutchey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good tool for cities and governments to use in their planning 
processes," Plisky said before suggesting La Colonia and Cal-Gisler 
neighborhoods be left out. "But if the community doesn't want it, I don't think 
we should force it on them."

STORM DRAIN CLEANUP FEES MAY RISE; POLLUTION: THE COUNTY AND ITS 10 CITIES 
WOULD USE THE MONEY TO MONITOR RUNOFF IN CATCH BASINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County residents may have to pay up to $15 more per year to meet 
federal regulations to clean up storm drains, the largest unregulated source of 
pollution in county rivers and coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 188 miles of storm drain channels collect runoff from city 
streets and gutters, emptying fertilizer residue, bits of car tires, crank case 
oil and other pollutants into waterways that empty into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a $3-million plan presented to Ventura County supervisors Tuesday, the 
county and its 10 cities would use the increased fees to monitor pollution in 
catch basins and step up street sweeping and storm-drain cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will also spend a good deal of time and money on public education, 
said Alex Sheydayi, manager of the county's Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to teach people: 'Don't use too much fertilizer; don't let the guy 
who mows your lawn blow leaves into the gutter, and don't drain the oil from 
your car into the catch basins,' " Sheydayi said. The county has already begun 
installing blue-stenciled signs next to catch basins that state: "Don't dump; 
drains to ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is designed to comply with the federal Clean Water Act, which 
requires storm drains to be monitored, assessed for their pollutant content, 
and eventually cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 But some around the county complained that the federal government should not 
mandate work without paying for it, and that other sources should be found to 
offset the cost of the cleanup to homeowners and business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county should request more favorable treatment from the state and federal 
government," said Michael L. Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman James Monahan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against any kind of mandate," he said. "If (the federal government) is 
going to mandate what we are doing, they should send along the money to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors Tuesday asked Arthur Goulet, director of the county's Public 
Works Agency, to prepare a list of alternative means of funding before the 
first public hearing on the fees, scheduled for 10 a.m. June 7. A second public 
hearing is set for 10 a.m. July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, which will be reviewed at both public hearings before it is 
approved or implemented, annual flood control assessments would increase by 
$1.08 in part of Thousand Oaks and by as much as $15.82 in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents of Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo would pay from $7 to $8 more. 
Santa Paula residents would be tapped for another $10.98, and Fillmore 
residents for an additional $5.33. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees in the rest of Thousand Oaks would go up by $4.92. Residents of Simi 
Valley would pay about $5.16 less on their annual flood control assessments 
because their city has decided to pay for its program with existing property 
tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, our residents are already under economic strain," 
said Anne Alloway, a Simi Valley environmental official. "The City Council 
wanted to keep the fees as low as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, city officials also decided to use existing funds to pay for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county proposal, all other cities and unincorporated areas in the 
county would fund their portions of the program with an increased annual 
flood-control assessment on property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The total flood-control assessment, which also includes fees for normal 
operation and maintenance of flood control channels, now ranges from $12.23 in 
part of Thousand Oaks to $40.76 in unincorporated areas around Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are to be spent by the cities within their boundaries and by the 
county in unincorporated areas to educate people to keep storm drains free of 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials also must monitor pollutants in the storm drains and 
clean them out periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities will gradually assume more responsibility for the program, Sheydayi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new law, the county is authorized not to notify all the affected 
residents by mail, but to advertise instead in a newspaper. That would save the 
county about $60,000, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said they were concerned that people would miss the 
advertisement and be surprised when they saw the increase on their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call my office when they get increases on their bills," Supervisor 
John K. Flynn said. Supervisors will discuss whether to mail notices at the 
public hearings.

3 PLEAD GUILTY IN DEFENSE FRAUD CASE; OXNARD: A BARGAIN IN THE $3-MILLION CASE 
IS REACHED BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CONTRACTOR ON EVE OF THE TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two officers and an employee of a small Oxnard defense contractor have pleaded 
guilty in connection with a scheme to defraud the government of more than $3 
million, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ceniseroz, 42, of Oxnard agreed to the stiffest penalty under the plea 
agreement reached earlier this week, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles 
Kreindler. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz, the company's finance director, pleaded guilty to two counts of 
government theft and two counts of false claims, and will probably serve two 
years in federal prison, Kreindler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz is also expected to pay a fine of $50,000 when he is sentenced Sept. 
12 in a Los Angeles federal court, Kreindler said. Nine other counts related to 
the fraud scheme were dropped in return for the plea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz also agreed to make restitution to the government of $2.8 million, 
but Kreindler said there is little likelihood prosecutors can collect that 
amount. "These are not rich people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz's cousin, Paul Delgado, 40, of Ojai, pleaded guilty to one count of 
obstruction of a federal audit and will serve six months in a halfway house. 
The cousins' aunt, Teresa Delgado, 65, admitted falsifying records and lying to 
the grand jury, Kreindler said. She has agreed to be confined to her Oxnard 
home for six months, where she will be monitored with an electronic ankle 
bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Delgados have also agreed to pay fines of $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement was reached Monday, one day before trial was set to begin, 
Kreindler said. The company, which went bankrupt in 1992, was producing 
aircraft parts for the Department of Defense. It was run by the same family for 
several decades in an industrial section of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants agreed to plead guilty to restore some order to their shattered 
family, said a Los Angeles attorney representing Paul Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Janet Levine said the family had opened an aluminum wheels company 
that was losing money and was also starting to see their profits from defense 
contracts dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a case where economic circumstances got the better of the 
individuals and they go in over their heads," Levine said. "They didn't go out 
and buy yachts. They were just trying to keep their business running." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the three defendants have taken full responsibility for their actions 
by entering their guilty pleas and are repentant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very traumatic for the whole family," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into Del Manufacturing, on Richmond Avenue in Oxnard, began 
in the summer of 1992, when investigators from the Army and Navy, working with 
the FBI, removed several boxes of administrative files from the company after 
it failed to deliver the promised parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal grand jury indictments against the company, Ceniseroz and the Delgados 
were handed down in the fall of 1993, Kreindler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. attorney's office in March announced it was dropping fraud 
charges against Del Manufacturing, saying the likelihood of collecting fines 
against the bankrupt company were slim. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutions against Ceniseroz and the Delgados continued, however, focusing 
on contracts the company made with the government in 1989 to manufacture lug 
nuts. The government paid Del Manufacturing $3.3 million to produce the parts, 
but a investigation showed it had shipped only 28% of the completed lug nuts to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Delgado, the company's general manager, and Teresa Delgado, its corporate 
secretary, falsified business records to hide the scheme, Kreindler said. They 
also both lied to a federal grand jury when asked about it, Kreindler said, 
although Paul Delgado's perjury charge was later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz was also charged with collecting twice on a $800,000 claim he made 
under a contract to produce practice bombs for the Army, Kreindler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government paid both $800,000 checks in 1988, but the double billing was 
not discovered until two years ago during a routine contract audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have returned the second check," Kreindler said. "Instead, they 
spent it." 
</P>
<P>
 The money apparently did not go for luxury items, but to help the company bail 
out its aluminum wheels division, Kreindler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz's attorney, Mark Heaney, said his client candidly acknowledged in 
court that "some things were done wrong with its billing practices." Ceniseroz 
decided to accept the plea agreement out of a desire to get the case resolved, 
the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very concerned about the impact of this on his family," said Heaney. 
Ceniseroz is married and has three children. 
</P>
<P>
 All three defendants remain free on bond until sentencing.

3 ARRESTED IN VENTURA GANG SWEEP; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE RAID FOLLOWS A 
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOOTING SPREE. IT IS THE FOURTH SUCH OPERATION IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For the fourth time in two weeks, Ventura County authorities conducted a 
surprise gang sweep early Tuesday, waking up suspected gang members in Ventura 
and searching their homes for weapons and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest raid at 7 a.m. targeted Ventura Avenue residents suspected of 
terrorizing the area with several shooting sprees in recent weeks. More than 
100 police and probation officers served 10 search warrants on the suspected 
gang members and prowled through their homes looking for guns used in the 
random shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Three suspected gang members were arrested, and two guns that may have been 
used in the shootings were confiscated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This neighborhood has been held hostage by these gangsters with guns," said 
Sgt. Carl Handy, who heads the Ventura police gang unit. "There's no gang war. 
It's just stupid acts of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, authorities have arrested 17 suspected gang members during the 
four sweeps, which were conducted once in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard and twice in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested Tuesday were Jesus Magallanes, 22, and Daniel Munoz, 19, both of 
Ventura, who were taken to Ventura County Jail. Magallanes, who was being held 
in lieu of $5,000 bail, was arrested on suspicion of possessing or 
manufacturing a dangerous weapon. Munoz, who was being held in lieu of $250 
bail, was arrested on suspicion of attacking a police officer with a club. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old girl, whose name was withheld, was also arrested on a weapons 
charge and was being held at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids are part of a regional push by area police agencies that began in 
1992 to quell street gangs in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual police departments or the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
organize the operations and ask for assistance from the other agencies. 
Representatives from the Ventura County district attorney's office and 
probation officers from the county's Corrections Services Agency also come 
along on the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the individuals targeted are on probation and are subject to random 
searches as a condition of their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Cmdr. Mark Hansen, who has been involved in several sweeps, 
said local police agencies like to do the raids periodically to keep gang 
members on their toes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to let these rascals sit around," Hansen said, adding that 
such operations are clearly warranted. "It's not like we're raiding the ladies' 
bingo parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 21, 50 police and probation officers swept through Thousand Oaks and 
raided 10 houses in the aftermath of a series of gang-related street fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Ventura police raided two houses in the Ventura Avenue 
neighborhood and arrested five people in connection with the random shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 29, a sweep was conducted in Oxnard and gang members were served 
warnings that illegal gang activities could result in stiff prison sentences. 
One man was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's sweep was a follow-up investigation to the shooting sprees on 
Ventura Avenue, police said. Residents complained that the area last month was 
plagued with random late-night shootings and flooded the Police Department and 
City Hall with phone calls. No one has been hurt by the gunfire, but several 
houses and cars have been struck by bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this sends a message to the gang members that we're not going to 
tolerate this," Lt. Steve Bowman said. "They're endangering a lot of innocent 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said residents in the neighborhood and street informants have told them 
that local gang members are responsible for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 After one incident, police found more than 50 shell casings on the street. In 
another, more than 30 spent cartridges were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were looking Tuesday for an assault rifle they know is being used, but 
did not find it. They did confiscate an illegal sawed-off shotgun and a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Avenue residents on Tuesday said they were pleased to wake up and see 
police officers swarming their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're doing fantastic," said Larry Bacca, a retired firefighter who 
moved to the Ventura Avenue area last year. "If they continue doing these 
raids, they'll send a message. It's been really quite an ordeal for the 
residents here." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents are also meeting with city officials and police next week to 
discuss long-term solutions to the drug and gang problems that have long 
plagued the working-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy said the meeting will help residents take control of their neighborhood. 
The sweeps can squelch gang activity only temporarily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a long-term fix," Handy said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford will hold a meeting at 6 p.m. May 12 to discuss crime 
problems in the Ventura Avenue area. Residents are invited to suggest solutions 
to the drug and violence in the neighborhood. The meeting will be at Sheridan 
Way School, 573 Sheridan Way.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SULPHUR MOUNTAIN; AGENCY WILL STUDY CONCERNS ON 
TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials with the Department of Commerce have agreed to consider a list of 
concerns raised by U. S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) regarding the National 
Weather Service's radar tower on Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer and other elected officials have urged the agency, which oversees the 
weather service, to re-examine the placement of the radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar, which will monitor approaching storms, fear that it 
could pose health risks and are angry that they weren't notified that it would 
be built in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge has ruled that adequate health studies were conducted and 
that the government's action in erecting the tower was not capricious. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 45-minute telephone conference call Monday, Deputy Secretary of 
Commerce David Barram, National Weather Service Director Joe Friday and two 
representatives from Boxer's office discussed the residents' concerns, said 
Boxer's chief of staff, Sam Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I conveyed the senator's strong feeling that the tower is not there 
legitimately," he said. "They agreed to look at the senator's concerns before 
we discuss specific action." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials agreed to return in about a week with a response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Arguelles, a spokeswoman for the weather service, said: "It was a 
dialogue that had not been established before. We'll have some answers and 
we'll just have to take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting with about 50 Ojai residents Friday, Boxer said she found the 
government's installation of the tower during the Thanksgiving holiday last 
fall "sneaky." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Arguelles nor Chapman would say what action might come out of the 
discussions. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY TO NAME STREET AFTER CESAR CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a year after the death of Cesar Chavez, the Oxnard City Council 
agreed Tuesday to recognize the United Farm Workers union organizer with a 
street named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval to name a new street after Chavez came without any of the 
acrimony that has accompanied previous proposals to rename a street in La 
Colonia, where Chavez spent part of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel M. Lopez has worked since Chavez's death on April 23, 1993, to 
name a street in Oxnard after the union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 But respondents to a survey of 139 residents and property owners in La Colonia 
said they opposed a plan to rename Garfield Avenue after Chavez, said Community 
Development Director Richard Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight of the 33 residents who responded to the survey said they opposed 
the name change, Maggio told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Chavez Street would most likely run south of Gonzales Road on either 
side of Rose Avenue when construction begins on the Northeast Community 
Specific Plan neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bedford Pinkard requested Tuesday that a second proposal to name a 
future street after Martin Luther King Jr. be continued. JEFF McDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A traditional trick riding and roping show will be one of the highlights of 
this year's Cinco de Mayo festivities, which begin Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The riding show, called a jaripeo, is similar to a rodeo and features trick 
riders who have performed internationally. There will be a jaripeo twice during 
the four-day Cinco de Mayo Festival that is sponsored by the Hispanic Chamber 
of Commerce for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival section of the festival will open at 5 p.m. Thursday at College 
Park in Oxnard. To commemorate Cinco de Mayo, several dance groups will 
perform, including Los Kyles de Oaxaco Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 The carnival will remain open Friday, beginning at 5 p.m., but no performances 
are scheduled. Admission is $3 per day for adults and $2 for the handicapped 
and seniors. Children under 12 are admitted free, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The 
jaripeo , which costs $12, will be staged at 4 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend portion of the festival also will feature food booths and live 
entertainment on two stages. Federico Villa will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday on 
the Amphitheatre Stage and Yolanda Del Rio will perform on the same stage at 7 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other performances at the festival include the Ballet Folklorico from Hueneme 
High School from 11:30 a.m. to noon Saturday and the musical group Nuestro 
performing Latin jazz and salsa beginning at 4:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events around the county include a five-kilometer race and one-mile fun 
run sponsored by Oxnard College. The 3.1-mile run around Oxnard College and 
surrounding streets is scheduled for Saturday at 8 a.m. Entry fees are $15 for 
the five-kilometer run and $12 for the fun run. Proceeds will be used to help 
Oxnard College build a training site for World Cup soccer athletes. KAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEACHERS WIN $10,000 EACH FOR EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five Ventura County teachers, whose specialties range from music and video 
production to counseling and elementary education, have each won $10,000 cash 
awards for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients of this year's Amgen Award for Teacher Excellence included a 
counselor and two teachers in the Conejo Valley Unified School District and 
teachers in Camarillo and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third year in a row, the Thousand Oaks-based pharmaceutical company 
granted the awards through an affiliated nonprofit foundation. An anonymous 
panel of three community leaders chose the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 633 teachers throughout Ventura County were nominated in 1,400 letters 
sent by past and present students, colleagues, parents and community members. 
Winners can spend the $10,000 however they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Norberg, who teaches a video production class at Buena High in Ventura, 
said he was shocked to learn over spring break that he was one of the five 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Norberg said he plans to invest the money with his wife, Kerry, and recover 
the cost of equipment he's purchased for his video class. In another two years, 
he said, the money might fund a vacation to Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Another winner, Sam Kane, a counselor at Colina Intermediate School in 
Thousand Oaks, said he plans to donate the bulk of the money to groups 
committed to fighting bigotry and racism and use the rest to repair earthquake 
damage to his Woodland Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three winners were Thousand Oaks music teacher Carol Alexander, 
Camarillo drama teacher Marilyn Bjork, and Jeneen Vetrovec, who teaches 
kindergarten through second grade at Conejo Elementary in Thousand Oaks. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL MAY DILUTE NEW SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than one week after Ventura's strictest anti-smoking law ever went into 
effect, City Council members have proposed weakening it to respond to 
complaints by owners of some of Ventura's oldest restaurants, who say the 
near-total ban is driving away their most faithful customers. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than an hour of sometimes heated debate, the Ventura City Council 
voted 4 to 3 Monday to revisit the smoking issue, organizing a council 
committee to study whether a device called a Smokeeter really can suck up 
enough cigarette fumes to make the air reasonably clean for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the committee decides the air filtration system is successful, council 
members said they might allow some restaurants, particularly those with bars, 
to install the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do make exceptions (to the ordinance), we are going to cause future 
problems," acknowledged Councilman Greg Carson, who joined council members Jack 
Tingstrom, Jim Monahan and Rosa Lee Measures in voting for the measure. But 
with the current ordinance, he added: "We have also caused hardship to some 
restaurants that have been around for years."  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city staff performed their own assessment of the air filtration system 
after Lyn Flores, co-owner of Tony's Steak and Seafood restaurant, urged the 
council earlier this year to investigate it as an alternative to the ban. Staff 
members told the council Monday that as effective as the Smokeeter might be, it 
was no substitute for not smoking at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members said they were swayed by Flores' emotional testimony 
Monday, when she said she might lose her business if she had to turn away all 
her smoking customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are over 10 of us (restaurant owners) that cannot conform in any way 
that is economically feasible," she said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY MANAGER ASKED TO PICK SEARCH FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than leaving the responsibility to one of their own, Ventura City 
Council members have asked their city manager to recommend the firm that will 
choose his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly an hour of bickering among themselves, council members concluded 
about midnight Monday that leaving the responsibility to a committee composed 
of three council members would not be "egalitarian."And having each council 
member check up on each possible search firm would be chaotic, they decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt it would be very efficient for seven council members to be calling 
all the references," Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council learned last week that John Baker, who has served as city manager 
since November, 1981, will leave in July to start a private consulting 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after announcing his resignation, Baker contacted five executive 
search firms and asked them to have their proposals on his desk by 5 p.m. 
Friday. On Monday, council members tried to decide how to check references for 
each of the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The only method that they could all agree on was to have Baker and his staff 
do the checking and then have Baker report back to the council Monday.

RIVALS FOR SCHOOLS CHIEF DEBATE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fielding questions on topics ranging from the new state assessment exams to 
school safety, the two candidates for Ventura County superintendent of schools 
squared off in a forum Tuesday before more than 100 county educators and 
members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 County schools Supt. Charles Weis and school Principal Dan Flynn, who is 
challenging Weis for his job in the June 7 election, differed most markedly on 
their views about the California Learning Assessment System exams and school 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering a question from the audience at the Camarillo Airport conference 
center, Flynn said he has concerns about the content of the CLAS exams and 
proposed that the state halt the tests immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis, on the other hand, said many of the criticisms of the content of the 
tests are based on misinformation. But he suggested that local school districts 
take over administration of the assessment tests in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 On school vouchers, Flynn and Weis both said they adamantly opposed last 
year's Proposition 174 school-voucher initiative. But Flynn said he supports 
some form of tuition assistance to families with children in private schools, 
if it would not financially harm public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he has four school-age children in private, parochial elementary 
schools, although he and his wife may send the children to public high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also answered questions on budget priorities for the 
superintendent's office, school safety and their views on state curriculum 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate was sponsored by the Ventura County League of Women Voters and the 
Ventura County Federation of School Employees, a union representing 123 
teachers, psychologists and other educational specialists who work for the 
county superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The office runs 13 schools, and educational programs for special education 
students and youths who are in trouble with the law. The office also acts as an 
arm of the state Department of Education, distributing materials, equipment and 
advice to Ventura County's 20 school districts. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CARNIVAL REPORTS SMALL REVENUE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attendance and total revenue from this year's Conejo Valley Days carnival 
narrowly outpaced last year's figures, Conejo Valley Days officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because organizers spent more money on the event this year, the fate 
of an $11,000 debt owed the city of Thousand Oaks remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers will not finish tallying expenditures from the event until June, 
said Linda Graham, who is in charge of finances for the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the five-day event, 50,725 people attended the annual 
country and Western extravaganza at Conejo Creek Park. That is up slightly from 
1993, when 50,645 attended the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's total receipts from carnival rides was $209,735 and admissions 
sales totaled $172,265 for a total revenue of $382,000. In 1993, gross earnings 
from the rides was $195,185 and admissions sales were $105,739 for a total 
revenue of $300,924. 
</P>
<P>
 All the money spent on concessions and food went directly to the specific 
nonprofit groups that ran each booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think we were successful," said Jennifer Cummings, who was hired 
by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce to organize the five-day carnival. 
"Our main focus was to make Conejo Valley Days profitable and leave a clean 
slate for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chamber Director Steve Rubenstein said it was too early to know for 
certain that this year's carnival raised enough money to wipe clean the $11,000 
debt to the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The debt arose two years ago, when event organizers were unable to pay $22,000 
to the city for security and other expenses. The chamber paid half of the debt 
to the city after last year's carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it's premature until we see how much we've spent," he said. 
"All I know is that the community had a rip-roaring party that they really 
enjoyed." MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST DRUG DEALER 
DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted Newbury Park drug dealer will not be retried for allegedly trying 
to run down a sheriff's deputy with a pickup truck, a judge has ruled.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of convicting Jeffrey Hedlund on 
two charges of assault on a police officer in connection with his June 30 
arrest on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury convicted Hedlund of one count of transportation and sale of 
cocaine. He had previously pleaded guilty to a separate drug-possession charge 
stemming from the same case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had asked to retry Hedlund, 26, once again on the assault charges. 
But Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath refused the request Monday and 
dismissed the two assault counts against the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund faces up to 7 3/4 years in state prison on the drug convictions, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund slammed his pickup truck into reverse and sped toward Deputy Patrick 
MacCauley on June 30 after realizing that a man he had just sold cocaine to was 
a police informant, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCauley managed to dive out of the way to avoid serious injury, he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors had told McGrath that they did not think that prosecutors had enough 
evidence to convict Hedlund on the assault counts. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 Authorities Tuesday were still looking for a man who robbed a Thousand Oaks 
bank using a demand note. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials said no arrests have been made in connection with the robbery 
that occurred about 2 p.m. Monday at a branch of California Federal Bank at 
1330 N. Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber waited in line with customers before approaching the counter and 
handing the note to a teller, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then fled with an unknown amount of cash and was last seen walking through 
the bank's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He was described as a white male about 35 years old, 6 feet tall and 180 
pounds, with wavy reddish-blond hair and freckles. He was carrying a red 
backpack.

 No one was injured and no weapon was seen, deputies said. CHRISTINA LIMA

SIMI VALLEY HIGH COACH IS REMOVED OVER INQUIRY; SPORTS: POLICE ARE 
INVESTIGATING THE FINANCES AND DISCIPLINE IN MIKE SCYPHERS' BASEBALL PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers, among the most successful high school baseball coaches in 
Southern California, has been removed from coaching at Simi Valley High School 
because of a police probe into possible financial and disciplinary 
improprieties, Simi Valley police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has brought the Simi Valley program to national prominence in 
his 16 years as coach, denied any wrongdoing. The 41-year-old coach will keep 
his position as a physical education teacher and has not been arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials declined to elaborate on the charges, but the police 
confirmed that the Simi Valley school district is auditing the baseball 
program's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the investigation was prompted by school district 
officials, who contacted authorities last month to request assistance 
investigating "possible financial improprieties, improper discipline practices 
and other conduct which may have criminal application related to the boys' 
baseball program at Simi Valley High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Police Lt. Mark Layhew said, "(The school district) contacted us April 
19. I'm reluctant to identify their source of information. Disclosure of any of 
those specifics may compromise the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he was unaware he was under investigation until he arrived at 
school Tuesday morning and found a substitute teacher in his class. He said he 
was told to report to Principal Kathryn Scroggin's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin, Scyphers said, then informed him that he was removed as baseball 
coach pending the completion of the police investigation. He was told to remain 
on campus until he met with the team early in the afternoon, then go home, 
Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin refused to comment, referring all inquiries to the school district. 
Mary Beth Wolford, the school district superintendent, would not give specifics 
on the nature of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bitter about it," Scyphers said. "I've built a real good name for 
this program and someone out there is trying to tear it down. I don't think 
someone realizes what they're doing. . . . I think it's a disgruntled parent 
who has not taken everything into consideration before making that phone call." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers stood quietly outside a school building with his head down and 
continued to defend his practices. Scyphers also works as a college basketball 
referee and is part-owner of a batting cage business in Camarillo. 
</P>

 "They can't even begin to say I've taken more money out of this program than 
I've put into it," Scyphers said. "I paid $600 for vans one year (on a team 
trip to) Florida. I didn't get reimbursed for that because money was tight. The 
'SVs' on our helmets, I paid for those and never got reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were at Simi Valley High on Tuesday interviewing baseball players. 
Members of the team declined comment, saying police ordered them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Scyphers, police asked players about a traditional team 
disciplinary practice called "the block." When a baseball player violates team 
rules, his teammates bid for the opportunity to administer a single swat with a 
wooden paddle to the offending player. 
</P>
<P>
 Players pay cash to Scyphers, who said he used the money for incidental team 
expenses such as a team party at the end of the season or gasoline for the 
baseball field lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is about 'the block,' that's ridiculous," Scyphers said. "It ranged 
from $2 to $4 and we've only done it, maybe five times, this year. . . . It's 
been a tradition at this school since 1980, but I've really slacked off lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it. They'd rather take a quick swat on the butt than miss a 
game. Every year we vote on it and the vote has to be unanimous." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hankins, whose sons Ryan and Mike have both played for Scyphers, was 
surprised by the charges, saying he has never written a check to Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real shocked about it," he said. "(Scyphers) has always handled himself 
real well as far as handling all the money that went through." 
</P>
<P>
 In 15-plus seasons, Scyphers has led Simi Valley to a 314-109 record and eight 
Marmonte League titles. During the 1986 and 1993 seasons, Simi Valley was 
ranked No. 1 in the country by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Coach Russ Stephans and Scott Radinsky will take over the team, 
Scyphers said. Both are Simi Valley graduates. Radinsky is a member of the 
Chicago White Sox, away from the team because he has been undergoing treatments 
for a form of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the latest developments, this had been a tumultuous season for 
Simi Valley. The team had lost four of its past five games and was in danger of 
missing the playoffs. Senior Bill Scheffels, the team's best player, dropped 
out of school Monday rather than face an expulsion hearing for making a phony 
bomb threat at school last week.

SUSPECT SOUGHT AS 3 PLEAD NOT GUILTY; COURTS: BAIL IS KEPT AT $50,000 APIECE 
FOR THE YOUTHS HELD IN THE WOUNDING OF TWO WESTLAKE HIGH STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Authorities stepped up their search Tuesday for 16-year-old Westlake High 
School student James Lee, accused in a shooting that left two classmates 
injured, as three of Lee's alleged accomplices pleaded not guilty in their 
first appearance in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, charged with assault in the Feb. 4 melee at a park near the school, 
apparently fled to his native Taiwan after he was released on $5,000 bail, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Lee's disappearance and the seriousness of the shooting case, which 
erupted from a feud between Lee and a school football player, the three 
16-year-old accomplices should be held in lieu of $200,000 bail, Vanarelli told 
Ventura County Municipal Judge Steven Hintz. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors fear the other defendants, who were being held in Juvenile Hall 
late Tuesday, would also jump bail, Vanarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments angered defense attorneys, who said their clients' cases should 
stand on the merits of the evidence against them and not on Lee's apparent 
bail-jumping. The attorneys requested bails of $5,000 on each of the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hintz, however, kept the bail at $50,000 apiece. The attorney for one 
defendant -- John Yi of Thousand Oaks -- said his client would soon raise that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the other two defendants -- Oubonsack (Andy) Sonethanouphet of 
Brea in Orange County, and William Huang of Rowland Heights in Los Angeles 
County -- said their clients could not afford the bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl occurred after Lee and football player Curtis Simmons agreed to meet 
after school at North Ranch Park to engage in a fight, according to 
investigators, who said Lee showed up with five carloads of supporters, some of 
whom were armed with bats, sticks and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Two football players who were at the park to support Simmons were shot and are 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi faces four charges, the most of any of the defendants. The charges involve 
assault with a firearm, shooting at a motor vehicle, discharging a firearm in a 
negligent manner and possessing a gun on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet faces two charges of assault with a firearm. Huang is charged 
with two counts of assault with a firearm and one count of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee faces one count of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Huang and Yi are upset with Lee for failing to appear in court because it has 
made it harder for them to gain their release, their attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli and Sheriff's Detective Ernest Montagna said the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Special Enforcement Detail has been looking for Lee. The detail -- 
made up of the sheriff's undercover anti-gang unit -- has searched areas Lee is 
known to frequent and his family's $1-million home, Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Vanarelli said Lee's parents posted a $5,000 cash bail to get their 
son out of juvenile custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is a U. S. resident -- but not a citizen -- and has lived in Thousand Oaks 
for about five years, Vanarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli said Huang, like Lee, is a native of Taiwan and has been a resident 
of the United States for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet is a native of Thailand and has been here for 14 years, while 
Yi is the only one of the defendants who is a U. S. citizen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Yi "comes from an extremely wealthy family in Korea" and has 
spent time there in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David E. Brockway, Yi's lawyer, said it would be "wholly 
inappropriate" for his client to be held in lieu of a $200,000 bail. He 
acknowledged that Yi took part in the melee, but said his client "has expressed 
his remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, the defense attorneys accused prosecutors of lumping the cases 
of their clients together. Earlier in the court proceedings, Lee's attorney was 
granted permission to have Lee tried separately from the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's theory is if you charge 10 people and one doesn't 
show up, then they are all tainted," said Huang's lawyer, John E. Meyers.

QUAKE 'HERO DOG' TO HAVE HER DAY; ANIMALS: CANINE WILL BE HONORED FOR RESCUING 
HER SLEEPING MASTER IN SIMI VALLEY IN JAN. 17 TEMBLOR. PET WAS SERIOUSLY 
INJURED. 
</P>

 Given the option between making the mortgage payment on her Simi Valley home 
or paying the veterinarian bills to save her dog Stella, Myrna Huffman said 
there was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used my mortgage to pay the bill," Huffman said. "There's no way I'd put 
(Stella) to sleep. She saved my life. As far as I'm concerned, she can eat 
prime rib for the rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella, a fluffy, white-haired Samoyed dog, was seriously injured and nearly 
lost a paw during the Jan. 17 quake when she risked her life and limb to save 
her sleeping master. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying next to Huffman's bed, Stella threw herself on top of her owner just as 
the earthquake knocked a huge oak cabinet onto the bed. Meanwhile, Wilbur, an 
English sheep dog, bolted for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman came out unscathed, but the battered 6-year-old Samoyed was in a 
veterinary hospital for more than a week. Stella has undergone several 
surgeries to repair her shattered left front leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know if it wasn't for her I would have been maimed or killed," said 
Huffman, 51. "I'll tell you if something like that had happened to me I would 
have been howling, but she was pretty calm." 
</P>
<P>
 For her heroics that morning, Stella will be given the highest honor awarded 
by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the 
Southern California Humane Society. Next Tuesday, she will be named this year's 
"Hero Dog" as part of the 12th annual Bruce Farrell Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one amazing story from what I am sure are numerous amazing stories of 
pets who are willing to sacrifice their lives to protect their human 
companions," said Rose Channer, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. "When we recognize Stella, I think we're 
giving another example of what a major part animals play in our daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman has received about $400 from the two animal welfare groups to help 
defray the more than $1,600 in veterinarian bills she has paid since the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused extensive damage to her house, but with the help of 
federal emergency loans and earthquake insurance, Huffman said she will be able 
to keep the home and make repairs. Huffman is the manager of a Mail Depot near 
Simi Valley's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella's recovery will likely take several more months and she probably will 
always have a limp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her left paw was dislocated, the ligaments were severed and the bones were 
out of alignment," said Debbie Novy, the veterinarian who treated Stella. 
</P>
<P>
 Novy recently removed the pins used to set Stella's leg and paw. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a happy dog who wants to be with her owner," Novy said. "I think she'll 
do the best she can on her three good legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella appears to be content hopping around on three legs, said Huffman. She 
plays with Wilbur and walks carefully about the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman said she is sure that Stella was motivated by an instinct to protect 
her master rather than out of fear. She points out that Wilbur, a nervous sheep 
dog that barks at the slightest disturbance, was also sleeping near the bed. 
But Wilbur took off when the shaking started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have always felt very safe with Stella," Huffman said. "She's calm 
and loving, but looks out for me. I know if she barks that I should pay 
attention."  
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's biggest worry is taming Stella's unruly fur for the awards ceremony 
in Los Angeles next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got that cute face like a baby seal," Huffman said, petting her dog. "I 
want to make sure they notice."

 FDIC Loosens Appraisal Rules: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it will 
no longer require banks to make appraisals for real estate loans of less than 
$250,000. The previous limit was $100,000.The agency made the change in an 
effort to make home loans easier to obtain and to cut lenders' red tape, but 
appraisers warned that it could lead to an increase in the number of bad loans 
and create a 1980s-style banking crisis. The FDIC's new rule won't save many 
consumers money, some lenders said, because it does not apply to thrifts and 
because the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and most other companies that buy 
notes from lenders on the secondary market still require appraisals for all the 
loans they purchase.

PEOPLE: TIMES OF LONDON EDITOR NEIL TO ANCHOR NEW FOX PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has tapped Andrew Neil, editor of 
the Sunday Times of London, to develop and anchor a new current affairs program 
for the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 The move appears to signal that Neil, 44, will play a larger role in Murdoch's 
plans to compete more aggressively in the news arena against ABC, NBC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil will relocate to New York to head development of a new "hard-hitting" 
current affairs program that Fox plans to put on after its NFL football 
broadcast. In many markets, the show could go head-to-head with "60 Minutes" on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 In recruiting Neil, Murdoch continues to bring in trusted News Corp. 
executives and assign them key posts in the United States. A pugnacious 
Glaswegian, Neil has been editor of the Sunday Times since 1983, during which 
it achieved record circulation and advertising levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Neil's editorship, the Sunday Times pioneered what became known as 
"quality pop" journalism -- a mix of investigative reporting combined with 
lifestyle features that struck a middle ground between the highbrow and popular 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my time, the Sunday Times has been at the center of every major 
controversy in Britain," Neil said. "These are the kind of journalistic values 
I want to reproduce at Fox." 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders said Neil had grown restless after 11 years as editor of the Sunday 
Times -- considered one of the top jobs on Fleet Street -- and was looking for 
new challenges. He recently was up for anchor of "Question Time," the BBC's 
popular weekly public affairs show. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil is not the only News Corp. official Murdoch appears interested in getting 
more involved at Fox. Sam Chisholm, a News Corp. director who oversees Star TV, 
has recently been spending time at Fox and telling associates he will be moving 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fox executives deny there are any plans for Chisholm to move to the 
studio, a source close to Murdoch said he had recently considered such a plan 
but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. announced the appointments of Carmelo J. Santoro as 
chief executive and Michael J. Simmons as chief financial officer of the 
Irvine-based company.  
</P>
<P>
 The two positions were vacated April 18 by the resignations of former CEO 
Gerald Blackie and former CFO Jon Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro, who has been serving as interim CEO, has served on Platinum's board 
since April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Platinum, Simmons was executive vice president and chief 
financial and administrative officers of Dynasty Classics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel Inc. said it has named James DeRose president of Mattel USA. 
</P>
<P>
 The position had been vacant since January, 1993, when David Mauer resigned. 
Mauer is now chief executive of Riddell Sports Inc., a maker of football 
helmets.

 Delta Loses Bid on Pan Am Lawsuit: The carrier lost its motion for dismissal 
of key parts of the suit Pan Am Corp. filed after the collapse of Pan American 
World Airways in 1991. U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. in New York 
instead ordered that a trial begin today to determine whether Delta Air Lines 
breached a contract obligating it to rescue Pan Am from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
Delta had sought to have the breach-of-contract claim dropped. Pan Am and its 
creditors allege that Delta reneged on a cooperation and financing agreement 
that could have spared the already bankrupt Pan Am from having to shut down.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; YOUR MONEY; DOW RISES 13, BUT DOLLAR TUMBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks finished mixed Tuesday, while bond yields edged up and the dollar slid 
sharply against key currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A late burst of buying pushed the Dow industrials up 13.39 points to 3,714.41, 
the third gain in a row. The Dow was helped by another rally in shares of 
Eastman Kodak, which rose 1 3/8 to 46 1/8 on news that it will sell its drug 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers edged winners by about 9 to 8 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Still, some key indexes moved higher with the Dow, including 
the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks. It rose 0.46 point to 254.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts expressed surprise at the stock market's continuing resilience 
despite rising interest rates and a weak dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday, the stock market has overcome a renewed surge in bond yields, as 
bond traders focus on the potential for higher inflation in a growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday interest rates moved up again, though long-term yields closed only 
slightly higher. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 7.34% from Monday's 
7.33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term yields, however, were up sharply for a second day in a row. The 
yield on three-month T-bills closed at 4.14%, compared to Monday's 4.10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the bond market's woes Tuesday were sparked by news that the 
government's leading economic indicators rose 0.7% in March, the highest figure 
since the government began keeping the index in 1948. Economic strength is 
boosting the odds of higher inflation and of another credit-tightening move by 
the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on bonds was another steep drop in the dollar, which could add 
to pressure on the Fed to raise short-term interest rates further. Higher rates 
could help defend the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar sank to a six-month low of 1.637 German marks, from 
1.649 on Monday. It also fell to 101.05 Japanese yen from 101.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of dollar's decline in New York occurred late in the day after it became 
evident that the Fed would not intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The 
Fed intervened heavily on Friday, buying dollars and selling marks and yen to 
support the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, speculators attempted to test the Fed's tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of those instances where there might be rewards for taking on the 
Fed," said John Rothfield, economist at First National Bank of Chicago. He and 
other analysts noted that supporting the dollar could become a costly exercise 
for the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say the dollar's weakness may be due to global investors' 
perception that the U.S. economy is threatened by higher inflation as growth 
picks up.  
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, trading was dominated by news of more 
consolidation in the health care sector and by rumors of a takeover bid for 
Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner leaped 3 7/8 to 40 in heavy trading on fresh rumors that Seagram 
is preparing a hostile bid for the media giant. 
</P>
<P>
 To make such a bid, speculators suggested that Seagram could enlist the help 
of 24%-owned DuPont Co., which announced last week set plans to raise $3 
billion in a debt offering. None of the companies would comment on the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the health care field, United Healthcare jumped 2 3/8 to 46 1/2 on news 
that it will sell its drug-management unit to SmithKline Beecham. And Value 
Health rocketed 3 1/4 to 44 1/4 on news of a joint venture with Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were generally weaker. London's FTSE-100 index fell 25.3 
points to 3,100.0, and Frankfurt's DAX index lost 16.36 points to 2,252.29. The 
Tokyo market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index added 8.50 points to 2,239.23.

 A late flurry of buying lifted the Dow Jones industrial average to a third 
straight winning session Tuesday, buoyed by a solid gain in shares of Eastman 
Kodak, which said it was selling its drug and personal care businesses. The 
broader market finished lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the late rally, stocks were mired in a narrow trading range as 
investors focused on individual stocks. At the end, blue chip averages rose 
13.39 to 3,714.41 as Eastman Kodak and several economically sensitive stocks 
climbed. It was the best close since March 28, when the popular market 
indicator ended at 3,762.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak's shares climbed on news that the photographic firm was selling its 
$3.7-billion drug and personal care units to focus on its core imaging 
business. Kodak closed up 1 3/8 at 46 1/8 after climbing initially to 47. 
</P>
<P>
 But more comprehensive measures of market performance turned in so-so 
readings. Two days of advancing stock prices encouraged investors to sell and 
collect profits, which contributed to a downward bias on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, stocks that declined outnumbered advancing issues by 
about 9 to 8 on New York Stock Exchange volume of 288.02 million shares, down 
from 296.11 million late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE composite index finished nearly in neutral at 251.36, off 0.04, and 
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index ended almost unchanged at 453.03, up 0.01. 
Among other indicators, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues 
fell 1.31 to 739.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond prices fell for the fourth straight session amid concern about 
the weakening dollar and speculation that the Federal Reserve might soon raise 
short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether long bond's yield edged up to 7.34% from 7.44%, which pushed 
its price down 5/32 point, or $1.56 per $1,000 in face value. Prices and yields 
move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said bond prices dropped mostly in response to the continuing decline 
of the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The greenback fell against most 
major currencies, although it recovered slightly against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that another buyer might be accumulating Time Warner Inc. shares pushed 
the price of the entertainment giant's stock up 3 7/8 to 40 in heavy trading. 
Seagram Co. has acquired 14.6% of the stock but would trigger Time Warner's 
newly adopted "poison pill" if it acquires more than 15% and fails to make an 
offer for the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has speculated that Seagram might test Time Warner's defensive 
measure in court, but no such action has materialized.  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's recent slide against the Japanese yen and the German mark has 
intensified speculation that U.S. rates will be lifted to prop up the flagging 
dollar. Higher U.S. rates would tend to boost the dollar by making returns on 
dollar-denominated investments more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell Tuesday to a 6 1/2-month low against the mark amid continued 
concerns about U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon in New York, the dollar fetched 1.637 marks, down from 1.649 
marks late Monday. That's the lowest point for the dollar against the mark in 
New York since a 1.617 mark rate on Oct. 15. The dollar gained on the Japanese 
yen, rising to 102.0 yen from 101.65 yen the day before.  
</P>
<P>
 Gold and silver prices declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were generally weaker. London's Financial Times 100-share 
average closed down 25.3 at 3,100.0, and Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended 
at 2,252.29, down 16.36 points. The Tokyo stock market was closed for the 
"Golden Week" holidays and will reopen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index closed up 8.50 points at 2239.23.

THEATRE REVIEW; DIRECTOR HAS A CLEAR 'VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In today's social climate, it's very hard to feel much empathy for Eddie 
Carbone in Arthur Miller's "A View From the Bridge." Pity, yes, but not the 
sympathy that was his due when the play first opened in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 In director Andrea La Vela's production at the Garden Grove Community Theatre, 
none of the emotional turmoil and pain is toned down to change this, and it's a 
very wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian American longshoreman Eddie has raised his niece Catherine from 
infancy. Now she's an adult, and Eddie still treats her like his little 
princess. Eddie is the only one who doesn't accept the fact that he also lusts 
after her. He says she "walks too wavy." He doesn't want her to date or take a 
job. He wants her waiting for him when he comes home beat from work on the 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has other things to talk about, like integrity and honesty and not 
judging a book by its cover. But like the protagonist in a Grecian tragedy, 
Eddie's real flaw is that he can't see his flaw. He destroys his marriage, the 
innocent love Catherine bears for him, the respect of his wife's illegal-alien 
relatives who are staying with them and, eventually, himself. 
</P>
<P>
 La Vela knows Eddie's world, the volatile Italian family ties and the rhythms 
of their emotional bumper-car existence. Jeff Branman knows it, too, and gives 
a fine, rigorous performance as Eddie, a tower of self-righteousness and 
self-pity slowly self-destructing. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Hamilton is close behind him as the niece about to find the strength to 
break the glass case Eddie wants to keep her in. Hamilton's slow, deliberate 
progress to Catherine's maturity is touching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Gaitatjis gives an impressive solidity to the gentle assurance of the 
older immigrant brother Marco. Alberto Moreno, as the younger brother Catherine 
begins to love, effectively blends a sensitive Latin masculinity with enough 
poetry to make Catherine's love and trust believable. 
</P>
<P>
 If Carrie Tigner appears too young for Eddie's belabored wife, Beatrice, and 
doesn't always have the emotional size Beatrice should have, she does capture 
the honest anger and sense of dignity in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodwin's attorney Alfieri also has dignity and a genuine warmth but 
introduces an odd note by being too Ivy League for the grizzled waterfront 
lawyer who should have a more Old World comprehension of the storms that rage 
inside Eddie's tortured heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scenic design by La Vela and Philip Weitzman, Eddie's Brooklyn-tenement 
apartment and Alfieri's dockside office both look too fresh and pristine to 
convey the world in this time and in this corner of Brooklyn, and Lee 
Schulman's lighting design throughout is a bit bright. But La Vela has brought 
to the production insights that ring true. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; KAHRS PUTS METTLE TO THE PEDAL DURING JOY RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The low-key atmosphere of Orange County's coffeehouses is at the opposite end 
of the spectrum from the high-energy ambience of the Crazy Horse Steak House, 
but Till Kahrs made the transition with ease Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 70-minute, 15-song set, the local cafe favorite proved that his music 
loses none of its appeal when plugged into a full six-piece country band. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with his good-natured honky-tonk anthem "Heartache Band-Aid," Kahrs 
and his Heartache Band ran through most of the material on his new CD, "Playing 
for Keeps." The set was Kahrs' last stand locally before he tours Europe, where 
the CD's title track is a radio hit. (His European popularity brings Kahrs' 
life full circle: Although he grew up in Placentia, he was born in Germany.) 
</P>
<P>
 He was a little stiff during his first couple of numbers but soon warmed to 
the supportive crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah! The Crazy Horse! This is cool," he said after the second song, as 
though it suddenly had hit him that he was standing on a stage regularly 
occupied by such legends as Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Ray Price. 
</P>
<P>
 He settled down, told a few jokes and even got the crowd to help him sing 
"Happy Birthday" to his mother, who was in the audience. Throughout the 
evening, he connected to his fans with his easygoing charm. As much fun to 
watch as he was to listen to, he moved around the stage punctuating his music 
with energy that seemed to flow naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 His greatest asset was his winning baritone, which added expressive dimension 
to his songs. During "Kickin' Back," which is about withdrawing from the 
stressful 9-to-5 working life, he emphasized the line "the doctor told me to 
slow down/or I might be working underground" by descending to the bottom of his 
register. On "Rekindle the Flame," an infectious romantic ballad, he dueted 
with keyboard player Tricia Flannick, and their harmonies soared through the 
refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a songwriter, Kahrs is a master of hooks; his best numbers, such as 
"Rekindle the Flame," "Playin' for Keeps" and "The Joke's on Me," are peppered 
with catchy phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 His band allowed his voice and lyrics to dominate. Lead guitarist Robert Dahms 
played with taste and restraint while steel guitarist/dobro player John 
Calazavara lent a gentle flavor to the light country tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The set included one of Flannick's original songs, "If This Picture Could 
Talk," and a killer version of the Travis Tritt ballad "Anymore." There was a 
nice balance between ballads, like the sentimental story song "Billy and the 
Bible," and such humorous numbers as "Just Lookin'," which makes fun of people 
who can't stand to see a friend over 30 stay unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs might have been better sequenced, though. His strongest songs came 
early in the set, making the second half something of a letdown.

AMERICAN YOUTH 'DOING OK' AS SINGAPORE WEIGHS APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother of an American teen-ager sentenced to a flogging for spray-painting 
cars said after visiting him in prison Tuesday that he is "doing OK" but still 
has not heard a reply to his appeal for clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, Michael P. Fay, 18, is reading books and exercising but looked "a 
little pale," said his mother, Randy Chan. "He is anxiously awaiting word of 
whether the government will accept his clemency appeal. We haven't heard 
anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20, lawyers for Fay filed the appeal, his last chance to be spared 
from a sentence of six strokes of a rattan cane, with Singaporean President Ong 
Teng Cheong. The Cabinet must make a political decision on the matter; the 
government has not indicated how soon that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But statements by ministers have left little doubt about government 
intentions. Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was quoted 
by Time magazine Sunday as saying that if Fay is not caned, "we'll lose our 
moral authority and our right to govern." 
</P>
<P>
 The world's news media have descended on Singapore as the drama enters its 
final stages. President Clinton has called the flogging "extreme" and appealed 
for clemency. But the Singapore press has reprinted articles and letters from 
Americans expressing support for the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to counter the huge publicity given the impending caning, the 
government has issued clarifications designed to put the punishment in a better 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the government-controlled Straits Times newspaper published a 
prisons department statement saying that caning "does not cause 'skin and flesh 
to fly' as alleged by critics" but that it may leave "bruises and marks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Was this supposed to make people think it wasn't so bad?" Fay's mother asked 
Tuesday. "I think they are really reaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Many journalists, including The Times, had based their accounts of caning and 
its effects on a September, 1973, Straits Times interview with then-prisons 
director Quek Shi Lei. He was quoted as saying that most prisoners lose blood, 
go into shock and are scarred for life. But government spokesmen now say the 
account was designed to scare Singaporeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday report, the first official description of caning since Fay was 
sentenced, acknowledged that a four-foot, half-inch-thick rattan cane -- soaked 
in water -- is used to flog prisoners. But the officer who carries out the 
punishment is "not necessarily" a martial arts expert, as Quek suggested.

HOUSE VOTES TO BOLSTER FLOOD INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More people in flood-prone areas would have to purchase flood insurance under 
a bill passed Tuesday by the House that is aimed at rescuing the National Flood 
Insurance Program from insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, approved by a 335-60 vote, requires that all mortgage lenders 
make sure that borrowers in flood-hazard communities purchase federal flood 
insurance as a condition of their loan. 
</P>
<P>
 It also provides up to $65 million a year to reinforce or relocate structures 
in flood-prone areas and to acquire frequently flooded land for public use. 
Another section sets up a study on the economic impact of coastal erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The current program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is 
"technically insolvent," said Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee panel on consumer credit and 
insurance. "This is a program that is crying out for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, established in 1968, is a perennial money loser because only 
about 17% of the estimated 10 million residential properties in flood-hazard 
areas are insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said that billions of dollars paid out in disaster relief after last 
year's Midwest floods could have been saved if more people had been insured.

RICHARD SCARRY; CHILDREN'S AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard McClure Scarry, whimsical American author and illustrator of popular 
children's books featuring Lowly Worm, Huckle Cat, and Mr. Frumble the Pig 
among others, has died. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Murphy Scarry said Tuesday that her husband died Saturday of a heart 
attack at a hospital near their home in Gstaad. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarry's 200 or so books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and 
have been translated into 30 languages. 
</P>
<P>
 His books are filled with gentle-looking puppies, kittens, rabbits, pigs and 
other creatures, sometimes driving bizarre vehicles in unlikely shapes, such as 
toothpaste tubes, carrots, eggs and loaves of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarry, which rhymes with "carry," was born in Boston in 1919 and studied 
drawing at the Boston Museum School. He served in the U.S. Army during World 
War II. After drawing for other authors, he decided he wanted to write as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He considered himself an educator more than anything," his wife said. "He 
thought any child could learn to read and absorb other things if they were 
having fun."

A.A. BOONE JR.; FILM MARKETING CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ashley A. Boone Jr., one of the first black executives in major film studios, 
who marketed such blockbuster movies as "West Side Story" and "Star Wars," has 
died. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone died Sunday of pancreatic cancer in his Los Angeles home, 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, the veteran film distributing executive was a 
marketing consultant for MGM and United Artists Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Springfield, Mass., and educated in economics at Brandeis 
University, Boone became the first African American to hold top marketing 
positions at United Artists, 20th Century Fox, the Ladd Co., Columbia Pictures, 
Lorimar Pictures and finally MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are saddened by the passing of a true professional," said MGM Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer Frank Mancuso. 
</P>
<P>
 When his friend Alan Ladd Jr. left 20th Century Fox in 1979, Boone rose from 
senior vice president for domestic marketing and distribution to succeed Ladd 
as one of two co-presidents. But after only five months, Boone left as well to 
follow Ladd to his new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladd praised Boone after learning of his death, noting that Boone had broken 
Hollywood's executive color barrier through intelligence, talent and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Over his 30-year career, Boone was responsible for the innovative publicity 
and marketing campaigns of the James Bond films, "Star Wars" and its sequel 
"The Empire Strikes Back," and the Academy Award-winning "West Side Story" and 
"Chariots of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 He also handled such films as "Julia," "The Turning Point," "Alien," "The 
Right Stuff," "Ghostbusters" and "Thelma and Louise." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone managed international campaigns for such outstanding hits as "Lilies of 
the Field," "Tom Jones" and the original "Pink Panther." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a member of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences along with his sister, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, senior vice 
president of publicity at Paramount. They were the first brother and sister to 
serve concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, Boone earned a master's degree in business administration 
from Stanford University and taught for eight years at USC's film school. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Boone is survived by his companion, Mark Bua; his 
father, Ashley Boone Sr., and stepmother, Doris Boone; another sister, Velma B. 
Fahrer; a brother, Richard T. Boone, and several nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 At Boone's request, no services are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the United Negro 
College Fund.

RACE TO SUCCEED METZENBAUM IS DOWN TO WIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A contentious U.S. Senate primary race went down to the wire Tuesday with 
voters choosing nominees to succeed retiring three-term Democrat Howard M. 
Metzenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio voters also picked a Democratic candidate to run against first-term 
Republican Gov. George V. Voinovich. 
</P>
<P>
 In Indiana, U.S. Sen. Richard G. Lugar was unopposed in the Republican primary 
for nomination to a fourth term. Jim Jontz, a former congressman, was heavily 
favored on the Democratic side. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of 12 House seats in North Carolina were up for grabs because of 
retiring incumbents: Democrats Tim Valentine and Stephen L. Neal and Republican 
Alex McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine; Bernadine P. Healy, former director of the National 
Institutes of Health; state Sen. Gene Watts, and aviation consultant George 
Rhodes sought the GOP nomination for Metzenbaum's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats running were lawyer Joel Hyatt, Metzenbaum's son-in-law; Cuyahoga 
County Commissioner Mary Boyle, and Columbus businessman Ralph Applegate.

 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday issued what it called its last, best 
offer for a two-year contract with police officers, but the police union's 
president said the $40-million package of wage increases and benefits was sure 
to be rejected without some modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest settlement proposal, reached during a lengthy closed-door session 
of the council, would give the LAPD's 7,500 officers a 3% pay raise Oct. 1 and 
again the following October. Officials said it also would include a 2% pay 
bonus for patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we have offered is an exceptionally good deal," Council 
President John Ferraro said after the session, refusing to provide details of 
the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the offer, which one source said was approved by a 12-3 vote of the 
council, was virtually identical to one already assailed by Los Angeles Police 
Protective League President Danny L. Staggs after it was recommended by a panel 
of city lawmakers including Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Monday to lawmakers, Staggs said the raises should begin July 1 of 
each year, when the new fiscal year begins. Otherwise, league officials say, 
the raise would amount to only a 2.25% net increase in each of the next two 
fiscal years. And, Staggs said, the city must significantly improve the 
benefits package offered to officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, Staggs stood by that criticism of the city's contract offer. And 
he repeated his belief that the union's rank-and-file members will reject any 
offer that delays raises beyond July because officers, like most other city 
workers, have gone without raises for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been negotiating for two years and for (the city) to ask (officers) 
to wait until October is adding insult to injury," said Staggs, who said the 
police union board will meet today to draft a counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration of officers was evident at a league meeting Tuesday night, 
when union delegates representing the LAPD's 18 divisions responded with a 
unanimous and thunderous "no" vote when asked if the rank-and-file should 
accept the city's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last two years they've been blowing smoke. . . !" one delegate 
shouted during the discussions at the Police Academy in Elysian Park. "It's 
union busting. . . . Let's go to war!" 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the delegates suggested that the union might wage some sort of 
protest on the eve of the World Cup soccer playoffs next month, when massive 
police deployments are planned to help keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would give us an opportunity to hold (the City Council) hostage," a 
delegate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates unanimously approved a no-confidence vote for the mayor and Bill 
Violante, a former president of the police union now serving as Riordan's 
deputy mayor.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, several council members strongly defended the offer, 
describing it as generous -- especially when the city's financial woes have 
precluded raises for virtually all city workers in the last two years. Indeed, 
several council members noted that the city's continuing budget problems may 
mean that all but emergency personnel will go another two years without a pay 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good deal, and I hope they (police officers) take it," said 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, one of several council members whose pro-labor 
views have been tested against the city's budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want pie-in-the-sky," Goldberg said, "but you are talking about a 
considerable amount of money" in the $20-million-a-year contract package 
offered to police. 
</P>
<P>
 But police union officials countered that the city could easily increase its 
contract offer by tapping into a large police overtime fund and by lowering its 
estimate of the LAPD's size to more accurately reflect the number of officers 
likely to be hired by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And while acknowledging that most city workers will go without a raise in the 
coming two years, police union officials said that fact should not undermine 
their right to better wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police officers should be treated (as) unique and special because their jobs 
are unique and special," said Geoffrey Garfield, communications director for 
the league. "They exist with a lot of difficulties and danger that other city 
workers do not face." 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs added: "I think you should give (a pay raise) to everyone. But most of 
all, I think you should give it to police." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the association representing city firefighters agreed to accept 
whatever wage increase police wind up getting.

CAR SEAT CRACKDOWN; SAFETY: SOUTH GATE POLICE CITE 140 DRIVERS WHO DON'T HAVE 
CHILDREN PROPERLY RESTRAINED. AUTHORITIES SAY THE LAW IS OFTEN BROKEN 
THROUGHOUT SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wendy Diaz was in tears. There she was, standing on the sidewalk, her 
7-year-old sister tugging at her hand, her 4-month-old baby, Joshua, rocking 
forlornly in his car seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz, 17, had been nabbed Tuesday in an unusual checkpoint -- one designed to 
snare drivers who fail to buckle children into car seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the car seat harness tended to jam, Diaz hadn't buckled up her young 
son as she drove to her Lynwood home after attending high school and picking up 
the children from the sitter's house. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate police caught her and slapped her with a $271 ticket. And they 
didn't stop there: Because she had no driver's license, they impounded her car 
and planned to charge her $140 to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair," Diaz sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 140 or so drivers cited Tuesday, emotional reactions were common. 
But law enforcement officials and child safety advocates say there is a 
powerful reason for such tactics: During a five-year period ending in 1992, 360 
children under the age of 4 were killed in California car accidents. Of those 
deaths, 84% would not have occurred if an adult had correctly buckled up the 
child, experts say. An unrestrained child in the front seat is three times as 
likely to be killed or seriously injured in an accident as a properly 
restrained child sitting in the rear of the car, according to the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's child restraint law, which went into effect in 1983, was 
strengthened two years ago with higher fines. A number of police departments 
are getting tough on violators. In addition to South Gate, checkpoints have 
been staged recently in Long Beach, Torrance, Signal Hill and Seal Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Some cities, such as South Gate, allow violators to pay $25 for a two-hour 
child safety class instead of coming up with the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say drivers throughout Southern California are routinely flouting the 
law, which requires them to use a safety seat for any children under 4 and 
weighing less than 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this area, the statistics make me sick -- probably more than 50% of 
drivers who have children here are not using child seats," said Field Training 
Officer Keith Hupp of the South Gate Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who do have car seats, about 70% don't use them correctly, Hupp said. 
Babies were not strapped into their seats -- or they were strapped in loosely. 
They were facing the wrong way or plunked down in a seat that was the wrong 
size. Straps were improperly adjusted or the seat was inadequately anchored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major problem," said Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of 
SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A., a safety advocacy organization. "The most important 
thing is to use a safety seat, use it every time, and use it 100% correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey, Tombrello said, her national organization found that 40% of 
drivers had made four errors in the way they buckled their child into a seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to improve their community's safety track record, South Gate police 
obtained a $140,000 grant from the state's Office of Traffic Safety to conduct 
a series of checkpoints over a one-year period. Twelve checkpoints will be the 
standard road blocks to catch drunk drivers; the other 12 will be to snare 
drivers with improperly harnessed youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate police issued 122 violations to drivers during the five-hour 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Baynori, 21, was one of them. Her 3-year-old was not in a car seat and 
her 1-year-old's car seat faced the wrong direction (babies under 20 pounds 
should face the rear). But Baynori took it in good stride and applauded the 
police effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't protect ourselves, somebody has to," said Baynori, of Huntington 
Park, one of 30 motorists whose car was impounded Tuesday for the unrelated 
violation of driving without a license. "It's something some people think is 
unnecessary; they say (an accident) won't happen to me. But in an accident, 
mostly the victims are kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Most drivers offered a range of excuses for not using car seats. Martha 
Saucedo, 20, of Gardena said there was no room in the car for her mother, 
father and five car seats for the children (two of whom were hers). Francisco 
Garcia, 23, of South Gate said he had to send money to Mexico for an emergency 
and had no time to haul the car seat from his apartment to the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Flores said he was taking a friend with a sick, 1-month-old baby to 
the hospital. After Flores and his friend waited for an hour sitting on the 
curb, South Gate police took them to the hospital. Hupp explained that officers 
had offered to call an ambulance but Flores turned it down. The police took 
them as quickly as they could, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said they had no money. Others, such as 29-year-old Josephina Rivera, 
simply did not know that a 3-year-old required a car seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought that a short trip wouldn't endanger their children. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nancy Hernandez's brother called and asked if she could drop off lunch, 
she packed up some leftovers from dinner and piled her four children into her 
car, heading along Long Beach Boulevard a few blocks to where her brother 
worked.  
</P>
<P>
 "You figure you are just going a few blocks," sighed the 27-year-old South 
Gate woman, acknowledging she had made a mistake, "but that's all it takes, 
going around the corner or around a street."

SANTA MONICA BAY'S EFFECT ON HEALTH TO BE STUDIED; ENVIRONMENT: PEOPLE WHO SWIM 
IN CONTAMINATED OCEAN AREAS WILL BE INTERVIEWED. FOLLOW-UP CALLS WILL SEEK TO 
DETERMINE IF THE SURF IS SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study on the health effects of swimming in Santa Monica Bay could be 
launched as early as this summer, after the Los Angeles City Council's approval 
Tuesday of much of the funding for the ambitious effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and government scientists said the survey is needed to 
answer one of the region's most nagging public health questions: Is it safe to 
swim in the bay? 
</P>
<P>
 Although no epidemiological study has been attempted, stories of surfers with 
skin rashes, swimmers with stomach flu and lifeguards with ear infections have 
become part of coastal lore. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports have become so pervasive among the 60 million people who visit 
Santa Monica Bay beaches each year that it has apparently kept many out of the 
water. A 1992 study found that more than half of 500 beach-goers surveyed said 
they did not swim, most of them because of pollution concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this study, the public will finally know the risk and whether that 
changes depending on where you swim," said Mark Gold, staff scientist for the 
environmental group Heal the Bay. "This is the No. 1 question everyone asks and 
this is the study that will finally answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
 The study will include interviews with 9,000 people to determine if visitors 
to the beach become ill after swimming in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special vote, bypassing its usual committee system, the City Council 
unanimously approved a $300,000 payment for the $650,000 study. The vote was 
hurried in hopes of getting the project organized in time to begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the prompt action by Los Angeles will help assure that other 
agencies contribute funding so that the study can begin in June. Two-thirds of 
the city's payment will be refunded by the state, and officials hope to obtain 
the rest of the money or other assistance from the city of Santa Monica, a 
South Bay hospital district and the agencies that operate sewer systems in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good that we will get the money. The study is absolutely essential," 
said Catherine Tyrrell, director of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, 
an alliance of government and private groups that is overseeing efforts to 
clean up the bay. If the project proceeds as expected, teams of student 
investigators directed by a UCLA biologist will interview ocean swimmers during 
a 16-week period this summer. The subjects of the survey will be contacted by 
telephone three days after they leave the beach and then a week after that to 
see if they become ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey will focus on swimmers at two beaches -- one at the base of 
Chautauqua Boulevard in Pacific Palisades and the other in Santa Monica, a mile 
south of the Santa Monica Pier. High levels of bacteria have been measured at 
both locations, where storm drains spew urban runoff into the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 These contaminated concrete streams have become the primary concern of 
environmentalists, after the reduction of pollution from sewers and industry. 
The storm drains carry a witch's brew of plants, pet droppings, pesticides, oil 
and other street wastes with health effects that have not been assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will measure the health effects on those who swim near the drains 
and compare the results with a control group of swimmers who enter water that 
is not directly polluted by storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as two other beaches may be added to the study later, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time swimmers are being surveyed, researchers will sample ocean 
water for bacteria and a variety of viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings might be used to create better tests to assess the safety of 
swimming in the water. Public health and water officials generally agree that 
the E. coli bacteria that are now routinely measured by city and county 
investigators are a poor indicator of swimming safety. The organisms are too 
common and not necessarily associated with the transmission of diseases, said 
David Cohen, chief of planning and standards with the State Water Resources 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a very important study because the standards we use now are 
very old," Cohen said Tuesday. "This might provide some new tools to find some 
better testing organisms" to warn when water is not fit for human contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the surveys could be available by the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 A second round of interviews may be conducted at beaches next winter, Cohen 
said. The later surveys are needed because health risks may be greatest after 
it rains, when the ocean is polluted with a deluge of contaminated storm water. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Health Services recommends against swimming in Santa 
Monica Bay for three days after substantial rains because of contaminants. But 
many swimmers and surfers ignore the warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the problems are real, we need to do something about them," said 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, who sponsored the council action. "If they aren't 
real, we need to start beating our drums and say, 'Come one, come all to our 
beaches.' "

DISTRICT TO CUT BUS SERVICE TO MAGNET SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: SOME STUDENTS' STOPS 
WILL BE FARTHER FROM HOME. REDUCTIONS COULD SAVE $2 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Expansion of the Los Angeles Unified School District magnet program will 
require some parents to take their children to bus stops farther from their 
homes as officials reduce bus service to help pay for additional magnet 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a Board of Education decision Monday to open 24 new magnet 
schools, district officials said they will overhaul the transportation 
arrangements for the 37,000 magnet students. The magnet school program costs 
about $376 million a year, $44 million of which is spent on busing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and magnet school officials said they are concerned that the 
busing changes could make it more difficult for students to attend school far 
from their homes and that some students might drop out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet program guarantees bus service to students who do not live in the 
school's attendance area. About 29,000 magnet students are bused -- often from 
one end of the sprawling district to the other -- to attend the schools of 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said the busing service has become too costly and would 
have prevented the magnet school expansion. By adding 24 magnet schools, the 
district has created 8,000 classroom seats. Changing bus service could save the 
district $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather put the money in instruction than transportation," said Richard 
Battaglia, the district's magnet school specialist. "It will affect all parts 
of the city and it will hit everyone equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Ted Alexander, who oversees the district's integration 
program, added: "Parents will have to get more involved in getting their 
children to school. It's something we just couldn't afford anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials said they are still examining bus routes, they 
said there will be fewer pickup points and more students at each bus stop. 
Transportation times will not be extended, however, because bus drivers will 
use more main thoroughfares and fewer smaller, residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, some students are picked up and dropped off in their neighborhoods 
and others must get to their local elementary, middle or high school to catch 
the bus to the magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and magnet school principals say they are worried that it could 
become too difficult for some students to get to school, especially if they are 
in the lower grades and must walk to bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bus stops are any farther, it could be too hard to juggle getting my 
kids to the bus stops and getting to work," said Jeanne Guzman, a Sylmar parent 
who has four children at magnets. "I might have to put my kids in the local 
schools and I wouldn't be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Bostwick, who lives in South-Central Los Angeles and whose son attends 
Monlux Fundamental Center in North Hollywood, said her son already walks about 
13 blocks to the bus stop and that she would be opposed to any changes. "I 
definitely have problems with the distance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some magnet school principals and coordinators say parents typically 
appreciate the convenience of the magnet busing service. Most home-to-school 
busing ended in the Los Angeles school district, and the only busing provided 
is to relieve overcrowding or for voluntary integration purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really isn't fair if they make a lot of changes," said Diane Seligson, the 
magnet coordinator at Monlux, which will become a math, science and technology 
center next fall. "It could be very difficult for parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Some principals of magnet schools said the demand is so high that even longer 
bus rides wouldn't deter parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people would drive 10 miles each way to the bus stop to get 
their children here," said Joyce King, the magnet school coordinator at the Los 
Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. "We have 2,000 people on the waiting list. 
They'll find a way here."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PANEL 
SEEKS TO EXTEND LAX SMOKING BAN TO BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Airport Commission asked the City Council on Tuesday to 
include bars in airport smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners want a total ban in bars, rather than 75% of their floor area, 
as outlined in an ordinance that the council passed last year. That law also 
barred smokers from lighting up in public circulation and waiting areas, 
ticketing lines and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the smoking ban, smokers have been congregating in bars, Commission 
President Ted Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 One-quarter of the waiting area in the in-transit lounge would remain a 
designated smoking zone, Stein said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; AUDIT OF CAL 
POLY URGES TOUGHER FINANCIAL CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A comprehensive audit of two departments at Cal Poly Pomona has found various 
personnel and policy violations and recommends that the university tighten 
financial controls at two campus offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche said the violations appear 
to be the result of a series of miscommunications, inexperience, lack of 
information and appropriate guidance.It adds that the violations are isolated 
incidents that do not reflect a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Cal Poly President Bob Suzuki said he was pleased 
that only minor problems were uncovered and called the violations "honest 
mistakes made by people trying their best to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Irregularities in Cal Poly's continuing education department and its 
foundation were first revealed in The Times last year, detailing how friends of 
Suzuki were hired to promote the university in Asia. Henry and Jennifer Whang 
received $239,569 in salary, commissions and travel expenses over a one-year 
period.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $500,000 
AWARDED TO FAMILY OF MAN SLAIN BY DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to award $500,000 
to settle a civil rights claim filed by the mother of a mentally ill man who 
was fatally shot by sheriff's deputies nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Keith Hamilton was one of four deputy-involved shootings within a 
one-month period in the summer of 1991 that sparked community outrage and 
eventually led to a sweeping reform of the Sheriff's Department's use-of-force 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said deputies shot the 33-year-old Hamilton eight times in the 
back and once in the shoulder as he lay face-down after they were summoned to 
his mother's Ladera Heights home because he was behaving erratically. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Hamilton was wearing a sheathed knife but later acknowledged 
that he had not threatened anyone with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies involved were cleared of criminal wrongdoing but two were later 
fired and a third was disciplined.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; SLAYING TURNS A 
FRIEND INTO MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>

<P>
 Roque Villalobos was killed the other day. Stabbed to death by a friend, 
police say. Apparently, it was one of his few friends, because police had a 
hard time finding either relatives or acquaintances to notify. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing didn't get much attention. TV ignored it. So did radio. In fact, 
you probably didn't hear about it at all unless you are in the habit of reading 
those three- or four-paragraph items tucked in the back of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1,058 homicides in the city last year, and 213 this year as of April 14, 
murder is not big news any more. 
</P>
<P>
 But every death has its story and every murder impacts those who witness it. 
</P>
<P>
 Police know little about Villalobos, but they know enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time after midnight on April 22, Villalobos and his friend, Joseph 
Garcia, 24, arrived at Garcia's North Hollywood apartment after a night out. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-bedroom apartment housed Garcia, his girlfriend, Roxanne Carillo, the 
couple's 3-month-old daughter, and Carillo's two other children from a previous 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had had a rough time of late, but appeared to be turning things around, 
said his landlord, Ardy Bojko. After months of unemployment, Garcia found a job 
working the night shift in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still unclear how it started, but, with Carillo apparently asleep in one 
bedroom, and the three children sleeping in the other, police say the two men 
began fighting about 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos ended up with several stab wounds in his chest. Garcia ran, leaving 
the apartment, his children and his girlfriend behind, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 When detectives arrived, Villalobos was dead on the living room floor and 
Carillo and the children were frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood was splattered about Apartment 17. 
</P>
<P>
 There was blood on the brown carpet. On the toilet seat and bathroom floor. On 
the wall behind the front door. A sliding glass door was broken, blood covering 
the edges of broken glass. On the wall, a decorative hanging read: "Love is 
patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love always trusts." 
</P>
<P>
 In the adults' room lay a half-packed suitcase, a pair of blue jeans on top. 
In the kids' room, two beds and a cradle. The kids had drawn on the walls. 
"Ohh," groaned the apartment manager when he saw the mess. In the kitchen, a 
plastic bag of beer cans -- Budweisers -- sat on the floor ready to be 
recycled.  
</P>
<P>
 As the detectives investigated, Garcia called, knowing the police would be 
there. He hung up, then phoned from somewhere else. A couple hours later, 
Garcia phoned for the fourth time and told police where he was: a 7-Eleven 
convenience store about two miles away. He was arrested and has been charged 
with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, shielded from the blood-soaked apartment by two patrol officers, life 
went on in a relatively orderly way at the Kona Isle Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 A roach exterminator came and sprayed several apartments, including the one 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we've had some roaches recently," admitted one of the tenants whose 
apartment was infested. "I don't know where they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Children played on bicycles out front. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one woman remembered hearing any of the violent exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this kind of 'boom' and then you could hear a window breaking," 
said a woman who lives in the apartment downstairs. "Then there was a woman 
screaming 'Help me! Help me!' and a man came running out the door."  
</P>
<P>
 As word of the death spread, residents gathered outside Apartment 17. Dolores 
King, a 22-year resident, was describing how it used to be at the Kona Isle 
Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, she said, a murder in a place that used to look like paradise: "The 
place looked like a Hawaiian village," she said. "It was painted green and 
orange and yellow. And had totem poles. But they had to be taken out because 
kids used to swing on them."  
</P>
<P>
 She looked at the building's faded brown paint job. "Now it looks like dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 "Earth colors," Bojko said smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Others described Garcia as a nice guy. He was always working on his car, a 
white Toyota. Always offered to help others when they had car trouble. Drank a 
lot of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the coroners came out, carrying the body wrapped in white, everyone got 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked that the children's eyes be shielded. "I can't believe it," 
someone else said. "It's so sad," said another.

BLOSSOMING HILLSIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire is part of the natural life cycle in the mountains, one that is 
destructive, yet also restorative. Hillsides blackened in the fall's fires have 
sprung to life with pink, yellow, blue and purple blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 These "fire followers," a they are called, appear only after fires and have 
joined the usual display of wildflowers that bloom every spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of some plants actually need the heat of fire to germinate and can 
remain dormant for decades before sprouting. Scientists are also discovering 
that a chemical in charred wood or smoke seems to trigger germination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires clear away competing plants, allowing these specialilzed wildflowers to 
grow. Fire followers are the showiest flowers to appear after a fire, and will 
predominate the next few seasons until they are crowded out by other 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Where To Go Family nature walks through Eaton Canyon are held every Saturday 
at 9 a.m., led by volunteer naturalists of Eaton Canyon Nature Center 
Associates. These walks are free. Meet in the parking lot at 1750 N. Altadena 
Drive, Pasadena, one block north of New York Drive. For information, call (818) 
821-3246 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun Valley conducts walks on the foundation's 
Flower Hill every Saturday at 9 a.m. at 10459 Tuxford St. just east of Sunland 
Boulevard. A $2 donation is requested. For wildflower updates, call the 
foundation's hot line (818) 768-3533. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountain Parks Information Service provides hiking and 
wildflower information for the Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains and the 
Verdugo Hills from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Call (800)

</P>
<P>
 Cycle of Life 
</P>
<P>
 The showy rebirth of wildflowers after fire is just one link in a cycle that 
has been occurring for thousands of years in our mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Fires burn hillsides in fall and winter, clearing brush and leaving a layer 
of ash. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Rains fall the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ash acts as fertilizer for wildflowers, which are the first plants to 
bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The following year, larger plants continue to grow. Wildflowers come back 
for second season. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Next year, woodier plants take over, smothering wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Fires burn hillsides and cycle starts again.

GATES SAYS HE WAS A MODEL FOR LAPD OFFICERS; COURT: KING'S LAWYER TRIES TO SHOW 
THAT THE FORMER CHIEF WAS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEATING OF HIS CLIENT. 
A DISPUTE OVER USE OF CHRISTOPHER COMMISSION REPORT CUTS TESTIMONY SHORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates testified for the first time 
Tuesday about his role as chief when Rodney G. King was beaten, portraying 
himself as a model for his troops, but his testimony was cut short after 
lawyers became embroiled in a legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 During Gates' 20 minutes on the stand, King's attorney, Milton Grimes, 
attempted to confront him about evidence of racism outlined in the Christopher 
Commission report in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants named in the lawsuit immediately objected, arguing 
that the report was untrustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute brought an abrupt end to Gate's testimony Tuesday as U.S. District 
Judge John G. Davies sent the jury home to allow attorneys to debate whether 
the commission's report should be entered into evidence. Davies asked the 
attorneys to present further legal briefs on the issue before Gates returns to 
the stand today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, probably the most affluent of the 15 defendants in King's lawsuit, had 
several testy exchanges with Grimes as the former chief detailed his 
43-year-career with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had tried to "set the tone" for the department, Gates said that 
was part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popular term is 'the buck stops here,' right?" Grimes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the chief of police," said Gates, leaning forward with his mouth close 
to the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked if Gates ever rode along with his officers while he was chief, 
and Gates replied that he had done so more than any other chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was involved in setting up the Christopher Commission, Gates said 
he was not. Gates said the real name of the body was the Independent 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 'Didn't you refer to it as the Christopher Commission in your book?" Grimes 
asked.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission became known by the name of one of its leaders, Warren 
Christopher, a private attorney at the time who is now President Clinton's 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the questioning, King's attorneys sought to show that Gates was 
ultimately responsible for the deeds of his officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission investigated the LAPD in the wake of King's beating 
and concluded in its report that racism, sexism and use of excessive force 
existed in the department. It criticized Gates' leadership and ultimately led 
to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers told the judge outside the jury's presence that they wanted to 
show that Gates is liable for damages because he should have known about 
misconduct in his department and should have stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davies questioned how the commission's report could be used to show that 
Gates would be held responsible for the actions of those under his command. He 
said that he would hold King's attorneys to a strict and narrow standard to 
prove that Gates is personally accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first phase of the trial, the jury awarded King $3.8 million in 
compensatory damages to be paid by the city. In the second phase, the 10-member 
panel is seeking to determine whether 15 individuals, including Gates, should 
pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 3, 1991, beating led to criminal charges against four officers. 
Not-guilty verdicts in their state court trials set off three days of rioting 
in Los Angeles. In 1993, a federal jury convicted two of them, Laurence M. 
Powell and Stacey C. Koon, of violating King's civil rights. Two others, 
Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno, were acquitted but are defendants in 
the lawsuit.

BILL BOYARSKY: SNEAKING SUSPICION ON THE PHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about the time the story broke about Mayor Richard Riordan's secretary 
listening in on his telephone conversations, I received a call from a retired 
mayor, Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised to hear his voice. Bradley hadn't talked to me since 1989, 
when I began writing about his junkets and calling him "Traveling Tom," a name 
inspired by the journeys of his junketing predecessor, Traveling Sam Yorty. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, I wish I had taken notes on the exchange. Unlike Riordan, I 
didn't have a secretary to transcribe our conversation. Anyway, we're forbidden 
to surreptitiously record phone conversations here at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice was the same -- monotone, expressionless, although there was a 
slight gravelly quality that I didn't remember from before. Maybe it was age, 
or a cold. But what startled me was his vocabulary. Bradley had chewed me out 
before, but never with this assortment of hells and damns. He told me I had no 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was angry because of a column I had written about Robert Inouye, who 
had been awarded $400,000 in damages after he was fired from his county 
transportation job for being a whistle-blower. Among other things, Inouye 
charged that contracts had been steered to a friend of Bradley, then a powerful 
member of the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 I told Bradley my views of the story and pointed out that we'd never agree on 
this issue. He agreed with that, and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My conversations with Mayor Riordan, on the other hand, have been unfailingly 
pleasant, even after I've been critical of him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got sort of a soft, hesitant phone manner. You feel easy talking to him. 
Pretty soon, you're calling him Dick and thinking he's your pal. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's dealt with politicians can tell you that's as dangerous as 
playing cards with a stranger who says he's not too familiar with the game. I 
could see how, during Riordan's corporate raider days, company owners might 
have been lulled by his unassuming manner, and then found themselves 
unexpectedly unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 I particularly remember one call last November after I had written a column 
criticizing the mayor's performance at a news conference during the fires. He 
had boasted on television how the fire was held at the Los Angeles city 
boundary, prompting me to say that he "looked like an old fashioned, small-town 
political hack." 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rang in midafternoon. I think it was Riordan's secretary, Carole 
Guillen, placing the call, although I can't swear to it. As I said, I don't 
have a secretary to keep track of these things. At any rate, in a moment I was 
on the line with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess you're mad about the column, I said. No, Riordan replied. He said I 
was right, that he knew he'd screwed up. 
</P>
<P>
 I was impressed. I said I had covered a lot of people, but I couldn't remember 
any who would have made such a call after that sort of criticism. We chatted 
for a bit, and then hung up.  
</P>
<P>
 I felt good about the conversation. I didn't even ask myself what the catch 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, I found out when Times reporter Marc Lacey wrote about how Riordan 
has had his secretary eavesdrop on many of his phone conversations and take 
notes on them. Those confidential phone chats with the mayor might not have 
been so private. 
</P>
<P>
 I was bothered about this, although at first I couldn't understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it might be a violation of laws against bugging private 
conversations. Reporters at The Times are forbidden to record phone calls 
unless they tell the person being interviewed. The ban was instituted several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't the law so much as the offensiveness of the practice. In earlier 
days, when surreptitious taping by reporters was permitted, I thought it was a 
tacky, sneaky practice. 
</P>
<P>
 I often think about those days when I'm working at my second job, teaching 
reporting in the USC journalism department. 
</P>
<P>
 We're supposed to devote part of the semester to journalistic ethics. I know 
that might seem a contradiction to some of you, but there are a few basic 
principles that govern our conduct. One of them, I tell my classes, is to be 
honest with your news sources. Don't be a sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan wouldn't be guilty of that if he would just tell his callers they are 
being monitored. There's nothing wrong with the mayor having his secretary 
listen in to his conversations. He's not a good listener. As Linda Griego, 
executive director of RLA, said: "During all those conversations where I 
thought Dick Riordan wasn't listening to me, I'm glad to know Carole was." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he forgets. Maybe he doesn't know how to take notes. Big business 
tycoons like him have probably forgotten how. But tell us what's going on, 
mayor. Don't be a sneak.

LAWYER BILLS L.A. $185,000 FOR HOLDEN'S DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lawyer defending Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden against sexual 
harassment allegations has submitted bills totaling more than $185,000, which 
is likely to force the City Council to lift the $150,000 cap it has placed on 
his legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With a trial as far off as next year, the payments are expected to keep 
growing. Bills are coming in at the rate of $25,000 a month, said Senior 
Assistant City Atty. Fred Merkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden's lawyer, Tim Agajanian, said the payments are cost-effective for the 
city, which he said could owe much more if it failed to provide Holden with an 
adequate legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said privately that they are uncomfortable with the 
payments but that they have been told the city is legally required to provide 
Holden with a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the City Council rejected an offer to settle a lawsuit filed by 
one of three former Holden aides who have accused him of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Onetime aide Carla Cavalier had offered to drop her lawsuit against Holden for 
$400,000, according to her attorney. Cavalier and the two other women have said 
they were subjected during their employment to a variety of unwanted advances, 
ranging from ogling and suggestive comments to lewd acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden has denied all the charges and maintained that they were made to ruin 
his campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy discussion of the Cavalier case Tuesday in a closed session, 
several council members said they thought the settlement offer was premature, 
coming before they had enough information to assess the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lawsuit, by onetime aide Marlee Beyda, is also pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third case, a state agency early this year declined to file an 
accusation after complaints by aide Connie Collins that she also was harassed. 
The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing has declined to say how it 
reached its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members have been cautious in dealing with the accusations and 
Holden's request for a legal defense. They discussed the matter several times 
last year before leaving the decision to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's legal advisers said that Holden had to be provided with a defense, 
at taxpayers' expense, because the accusations grew out of his employment.

GLENDALE JUDGE WINS ELECTION TO NOLAN'S SEAT IN ASSEMBLY; POLITICS: JAMES ROGAN

 Glendale Municipal Judge James Rogan, who pitched himself to voters as a man 
who had raised himself up by his bootstraps and is tough on crime, was elected 
Tuesday to fill the state Assembly seat left vacant by the resignation of Pat 
Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Final returns showed Rogan, a Republican, winning 53.9% of the votes in the 
seven-candidate field. He easily outdistanced Democrat front-runner Adam 
Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, who had 25.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, 36, will immediately be sworn in as the representative of the 43rd 
Assembly District, which includes Glendale, Burbank, Los Feliz and Silver Lake. 
He will fill out the remainder of the current term, which expires Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy arose when Nolan was forced to resign after pleading guilty Feb. 
18 to one count of racketeering, a charge stemming from an FBI sting operation 
against Sacramento lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, Schiff and the other candidates are not finished with each other, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 43rd District voters will go to the polls again on June 7 to pick 
their party's nominee to run for the district's new two-year term that begins 
on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominees picked from that election will face each other in the final 
election Nov. 8. In addition to the seven candidates featured in Tuesday's 
election, three more will enter the June 7 contest, one Democrat and two 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout Tuesday was extraordinarily light. One man went to his polling 
place at mid-morning and was the fourth to cast a ballot in a precinct with 
more than 400 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 There were foul-ups that may have contributed to the skimpy turnout. Some 
Democratic voters, for example, got conflicting signals about where to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare," said Barbara Grover, a Schiff political consultant. 
Grover said some voters were instructed in the official sample ballot they 
received from the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder to vote in one place 
but told to vote in another place by a Schiff mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion occurred when the county sent some incorrect information about 
the whereabouts of some polling places to the Schiff campaign, which reproduced 
the wrong addresses and mailed them to voters. SOUTHLAND ELECTION

COURT SAYS STATE CAN'T GIVE LOWER WELFARE PAYMENTS TO NEW RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a blow to Gov. Pete Wilson's effort to cut welfare costs, a federal appeals 
court ruled Tuesday that California cannot give lower payments to new residents 
than are offered to longtime California residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-page order affirming a 
lower court ruling that the proposal violated federal constitutional guarantees 
of the right to migrate from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a suit by the American Civil Liberties Union, the court said that if 
welfare benefits could be limited for new residents, their access to education, 
police and fire protection, and medical care also could be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson contends that California's benefits, which are higher than those in 
many other states, are a magnet for poor people. The Legislature agreed to cut 
benefits for new arrivals in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the ACLU suit, however, U.S. District Judge David Levi issued 
an injunction blocking the cuts. Other states that were considering similar 
restrictions for new residents had been watching the California case.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: DESPITE DIFFERENT APPROACHES, MAINFRAMES 
STILL ALL-POWERFUL; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the enduring notions in the world of personal computing is that the 
desktop (and laptop) computers of today are as powerful as the mainframe 
computers of just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But is that really true? And how do personal computers stack up against 
today's mainframes? 
</P>
<P>
 For answers, I called upon Jack Eberth, program manager for IBM's large-scale 
computing division in Fishkill, N.Y. His unit has announced a new generation of 
mainframe hardware and software -- additions to its ES/9000 family of mainframe 
computers and S-390 system architecture, which is a combination of hardware and 
software products. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM is the world's greatest mainframe proponent, of course, but it's also 
betting heavily on microchips for its future, making it the only company that 
truly covers the computing gamut, from biggest to smallest. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, it's not very easy to compare personal computers and 
mainframes, because the two take more or less opposite approaches to computing. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, stating the processing speed differences in millions of computer 
instructions executed per second (MIPS) isn't a very accurate comparison 
because the actual work accomplished by an instruction on one kind of system 
differs from that accomplished on another. 
</P>
<P>
 But for what they're worth, the numbers are dramatic. The fastest Intel Corp. 
Pentium-based PCs these days can execute about 166 MIPS, and the fastest 
IBM/Motorola/Apple PowerPC 601 chips can do 300 MIPS. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-performance IBM system can execute 15 billion instructions per 
second by simultaneously distributing the computing load among 32 of its 
fastest ES/9000 9X2 mainframes. A single ES/9000 9X2 runs at about 400 MIPS and 
costs $15 million to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One should not believe, however, that a $5,000 Pentium PC is only 60% slower 
than a $20-million IBM mainframe, nor that a PowerPC-equipped Macintosh can run 
three-fourths as fast as the mainframe. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference lies in keeping the processors actually supplied with the 
maximum amount of work they can do every second of the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 A single user, even one doing the most intensive kinds of graphics 
manipulations, doesn't keep a processor supplied with millions upon millions of 
instructions to execute every second of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why mainframes were designed from the beginning to simultaneously serve 
lots of people, each with a relative handful of requests to process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The design philosophy behind a mainframe computer, as Eberth explained it, is 
to keep its very expensive central processing unit, or engine, full of data so 
that few of its valuable nanoseconds are wasted with nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 That's contrary to the design of a personal computer, where a relatively cheap 
central processor is placed at the disposal of one person. And if it sits there 
doing nothing while that person mulls what to say next in a memo to the boss, 
so what? 
</P>
<P>
 Because personal computing is, well, personal, performance begins to bog down 
as soon as you start linking personal computers together to try to make PCs and 
Macs do jobs that are simple for mainframes, such as hosting a central 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mainframes do those things much more robustly than the best PC local area 
network because they are designed from the beginning to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the big IBM mainframes have 256 channels for data to flow in and 
out of, and it races along at 17 megabytes per second. That kind of capacity 
can be carved up in many ways before it gets slowed down to the 1 to 3 megabits 
per second (remember, 8 bits equals one byte) typical of a PC local area 
network. One channel on a big mainframe is about 45 times faster than the PC 
LAN. 
</P>
<P>
 In a PC, you may have 4 or 8 or 16 megabytes of random access memory where 
programs and data are stored temporarily while they await action by the central 
processing chip. 
</P>
<P>
 In the big IBM mainframe there are two kinds of memory. The most expensive, 
called central storage, contains up to 2 gigabytes (2,000 megabytes, in PC 
terms) of ultra-fast microprocessor chips dedicated to memory tasks. There can 
be up to another 8 gigabytes of expanded storage memory. It runs just 3% slower 
than the fast stuff but costs only half as much. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainframe really is a main frame, a big steel box that houses the 
components that make up the computer. The largest IBM model requires 251 square 
feet of floor space and weighs about 16 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest models don't have microprocessors like the ones we're used to in 
the personal computer world. Instead, the actual computing is done by hundreds 
of bipolar chips, each 63 layers thick, of metal circuits lithographically 
etched onto thin slabs of glass ceramic material. Because the circuits are much 
closer together than those of even the most densely packed microprocessor, they 
run much faster. And they generate a lot more heat. 
</P>
<P>
 These top-of-the-line computers are water-cooled, but the water doesn't get 
near the chips. Heat is transferred from the chips to helium gas that passes 
very close to each chip in an intricate plumbing system that won't hurt the 
electronics, or people, if it should leak. Water circulates through 
radiator-like devices a safe distance away to cool the helium. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-powered bipolar chip is nearing the end of its economic life after 
serving the mainframe industry for years. Because of its multilayered 
construction, adding more performance requires adding more layers, which raises 
the price exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
 The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) microprocessor, which can 
be mass-produced more easily and runs cooler, although more slowly, is poised 
to take over. IBM offers some models of the S-390 family with CMOS 
microprocessors, which contain 6 million transistors. It is actually a package 
of four separate chips grouped together on a circular connector with a heat 
dissipator on top. Among the new S-390 systems are a couple that can house up 
to 192 of these microprocessors running in parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, IBM's PowerPC 601 chip, which it shares with Motorola and 
Apple, has 2.8 million transistors. Intel's Pentium chip has 3.1 million. Both 
also are CMOS technology and are packaged as single chips. (Strictly speaking, 
the Pentium chip is BiCMOS because about 10% of its circuits are bipolar, added 
by Intel to boost performance. Also, the PowerPC is a RISC chip because it uses 
reduced-instruction set computing, compared to the complex instruction sets 
built into the mainframe and Pentium, known as CISC chips.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another critical requirement for feeding data to hungry mainframe processors 
is enough disk storage to contain the huge databases required in banking, 
ticket, credit card and financial trading systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the personal computer world, we call it hard disk storage. IBM calls it 
DASD (direct access storage device) and it's like PC hard disks, only larger. 
Currently the disk platters are 10.8 inches in diameter, but it's expected that 
3.5-inch units -- the same diameter found in most PCs and Macs -- will become 
standard this summer. However, mainframe DASD has a lot more capacity than 
we're used to in the PC world. Typically it comes packaged in 50-gigabyte units 
consisting of four physical hard drives and a controller. 
</P>
<P>
 What does all this power add up to? According to a study last year, Eberth 
said, the typical large IBM mainframe installation has 300 gigabytes of data 
storage and handles millions of data access requests per day. But if your PC is 
beginning to sound puny, remember, it can be connected to a mainframe. The days 
of dumb terminals are fading. PC LANs now are the preferred way to connect to a 
mainframe, giving you the best of both kinds of computing.

TV RATINGS; 'SEINFELD' IS NO. 1, BUT NBC STILL FINISHES THIRD

 With a one-hour episode, Jerry Seinfeld, with Michael Richards, overtook 
fellow comics Tim Allen ("Home Improvement") and Roseanne Arnold ("Roseanne") 
to nail down the No. 1 spot in the prime-time ratings for last week. But the 
A.C. Nielsen numbers released Tuesday showed that the strong performance by 
"Seinfeld" didn't help NBC: It still finished third for the week behind 
season-champion CBS and runner-up ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS was bolstered by its Sunday night movie, "Oldest Living Confederate Widow 
Tells All (Part 1)," which was seen in about 14.8 million homes, 
</P>
<P>
 beating ABC's "A Place for Annie" (13.9 million) and NBC's "Cape Fear" (11.7 
million). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the highest-rated programs of the week doesn't show up on the Nielsen 
list because it was broadcast without commercials. "Kids Killing Kids," a 
special aimed at giving young people ideas for resolving problems without a 
gun, was carried simultaneously by CBS and Fox April 26 and, accordingly, 
reached an estimated 13.5 million homes--which would have made it No. 10 for 
the week. Southland Ratings

 HOMECOMING: It was not a pretty sight nearly four months ago when the 
Universal Sheraton, as one employee put it, turned into the "Poseidon 
Adventure." He was referring, of course, to the Jan. 17 quake, which threw 
plants, trees, television sets and lamps all over the place. . . . Finally, on 
Tuesday, the hotel reopened, much to the relief of staff members who had been 
out of work (B2).

 HISTORY: Last week was some week for CSUN biology professor Tacheeni Scott. 
Along with other Native Americans, Scott, a Navajo, was in Washington for 
historical meetings between the U. S. government and long-neglected tribal 
leaders. . . . Scott had mixed emotions. "I felt grateful to be there," he 
said, "and angry that it took so long. My father should have been the one to

 BIRD FEUD: There's a new battle in Topanga, and it has nothing to do with big 
land developments. This one is over big birds. Ostriches (above), to be exact, 
which some neighbors say have scared horses and kept people awake. Others are 
also concerned by the number of drive-by gawkers (B3). . . . Ostriches are very 
valuable, in fact, and were the target of thieves in the Valley last year.

 BAD CHOICE: CSUN volleyball coach John Price is mad as, well, you know what, 
and wants to do something about it. His beef is the NCAA selection committee, 
which left third-ranked Stanford out of the Final Four, picking 
Indiana/Purdue-Fort Wayne instead. . . . Price said the choice was 
"ridiculous," and he may avoid scheduling road trips to the Midwest and East 
Coast (C8).

 TOUGH LOSS: Author Richard McClure Scarry, whose death was announced Tuesday 
(A16), will always mean something to kids everywhere. After all, generation 
after generation grew up with his gentle animal illustrations. . . . "People 
don't ask for him by name," said Ellen Tanner, children's coordinator at the 
Burbank Public Library, "but his books are still very popular." Michael Arkush

MAGNET SCHOOL TRANSIT MAY REQUIRE OVERHAUL; EDUCATION: SOME FEAR BUSING CHANGES 
COULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND CLASSES FAR FROM HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The large-scale expansion of the Los Angeles Unified School District's magnet 
school program will require some parents to take their children to bus stops 
farther from their homes as officials reduce bus service to help pay for 
additional magnet campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a Board of Education decision late Monday to open 24 magnets -- 
10 of them in the San Fernando Valley -- district officials said they will have 
to overhaul the massive transportation program for the 37,000 magnet students. 
The magnet program costs about $376 million, $44 million of which is spent on 
busing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and magnet school officials said they are concerned that the 
busing changes could make it more difficult for students to attend school far 
from their homes and that some students could drop out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet program guarantees bus service to students who do not live in the 
school's attendance area. About 29,000 magnet students are bused -- often from 
one end of the sprawling district to the other -- to attend the schools of 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said the busing service has become too costly and would 
have prevented the magnet school expansion. By adding 24 new magnets, the 
district has created 8,000 new classroom seats. Changing bus service could save 
the district $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather put the money in instruction than transportation," said Richard 
Battaglia, the district's magnet specialist. "It will affect all parts of the 
city and it will hit everyone equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Assistant Supt. Ted Alexander, who oversees the district's integration 
program: "Parents will have to get more involved in getting their children to 
school. It's something we just couldn't afford anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 While district officials said they still are examining bus routes, they said 
there will be fewer pickup points and more students at each bus stop. 
Transportation times will not be extended, however, because bus drivers will 
use more main thoroughfares and fewer smaller, residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, some students are picked up and dropped off in their neighborhoods 
and others must get to their local elementary, middle or high school to catch 
the bus to the magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, whose district has the highest number of 
magnet students, said she would prefer to maintain the current bus routes. But 
she said the reason is purely financial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather keep the transportation the way it is and expand the program, but 
we don't have that option," Korenstein said. "The money is finite." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and magnet school principals say they are worried that it could 
become too difficult for some students to get to school, especially if they are 
in the younger grades and must walk to bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bus stops are any farther, it could be too hard to juggle getting my 
kids to the bus stops and getting to work," said Jeanne Guzman, a Sylmar parent 
who has four children at three magnets, Sepulveda, Nobel and Monlux. "If they 
change them (the bus stops), I might have to put my kids in the local schools 
and I wouldn't be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Bostwick, who lives in South-Central Los Angeles and whose son attends 
Monlux Fundamental Center in North Hollywood, said her son already walks about 
13 blocks to the bus stop. "I definitely have problems with the distance," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some magnet principals and coordinators say parents typically appreciate the 
convenience of the magnet busing service. Most home-to-school busing ended in 
the Los Angeles school district, and the only busing provided is to relieve 
overcrowding or for voluntary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really isn't fair if they make a lot of changes," said Diane Seligson, the 
magnet coordinator at Monlux, which will become a math, science and technology 
center next fall. "It could be very difficult for parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Rubin, principal at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, which 
has 1,769 students and uses 38 buses, said he is concerned that parents might 
decide to leave the magnet program. "When you put roadblocks in their way, it's 
always easier for people to just say 'forget it,' " Rubin said. "You always run 
that risk. But it's going to save millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other magnet principals said the demand is so high that even longer bus 
rides wouldn't deter parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people would drive 10 miles each way to the bus stop to get 
their children here," said Joyce King, the magnet coordinator at the Los 
Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 2,000 people on the waiting list. They'll find a way here."

ATTACK FORCES NEIGHBORS TO GET DEFENSIVE; CRIME: ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH 
GROUP TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday night, about 30 residents of an affluent, suburban neighborhood 
stood in an orderly line near a back-yard pool, each of them waiting to test 
their aim with a water-filled bottle of pepper spray. As they reached the head 
of the line, they sprayed at a mask in the likeness of Charles Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get 'em, Linda!" cheered Terry Tobin, the neighborhood organizer of the 
event, as one resident of the 12500 block of Addison Street took aim and fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Ellen Schwartz, said as she waited her turn, "I've never 
shot anything, not even a BB gun when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not your usual "make my day" crowd. But this state-required training 
session for pepper spray certification -- the first involving an entire 
Neighborhood Watch group, according to trainer Milo Speriglio -- was not just a 
case of well-off people overreacting to urban crime. Six weeks ago a doctor in 
the neighborhood was shot three times in his front yard during an attempted 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 After several meetings, the neighbors decided to get a license to spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly better than nothing, and people were concerned after what 
happened across the street," said Larry Tobin, referring to the attack on 
physician Paul Hackmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, 41, had just returned from delivering a baby at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center when he was ambushed and shot in the chest. He is reportedly 
recovering from his injuries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin said that after the attack, he considered purchasing a gun to protect 
his home, even with four children under age 14 in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the residents of the 12500 block of Addison Street have opted to 
pack pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the watchful eye of Speriglio, a state-certified pepper spray trainer 
who is also a private detective in Van Nuys, the participants, most of them 
women, stood about eight feet from the bushy-haired Manson mask mounted on a 
wooden pole. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one the neighbors raised the pepper spray bottle and then blasted away. 
Some of the participants laughed nervously before firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that we have to live like this," said Schwartz as she watched her 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray has become the citizen weapon of choice for many in the state. A 
state official, who did not wish to be identified, said an estimated 100,000 
Californians will be certified to carry it this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour session in North Hollywood included a 30-minute video that 
informs pepper spray users about the chemical makeup and proper use of the 
spray. The tape provided a few examples of how not to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd howled as the video showed an upset wife who used the spray to end 
an argument with her husband at the dinner table. In another example, a woman 
shopping at a store accused the clerk of shortchanging her and zapped him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Addison Street group might have been the first in the area to be group 
certified, but they will probably be joined by others soon. Speriglio said 
another Neighborhood Watch group in North Hollywood and one in Woodland Hills 
have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mood at the training session was generally upbeat and optimistic, 
some residents acknowledged that there is a vast difference between spraying at 
a mask on a pole next to a swimming pool and spraying a human attacker. But 
many of them declared themselves ready to use it if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police officers at the last Neighborhood Watch meeting told me that we 
should always have it ready, which I think is good advice," said Rose Gitlin, a 
watch group member. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone comes at me, I'll be scared and shaking, but I'll be ready."

GLENDALE JUDGE WINS RACE FOR SEAT IN ASSEMBLY; ELECTIONS: GOP'S JAMES ROGAN 
WILL FILL PAT NOLAN'S UNEXPIRED TERM IN THE 43RD DISTRICT. HE IS EXPECTED TO BE 
SWORN IN MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Municipal Court Judge James Rogan, who pitched himself to voters as a 
man who had raised himself up by his bootstraps and was tough on crime, was 
elected Tuesday to fill the state Assembly District seat left vacant by the 
resignation of Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Final returns showed Rogan, a Republican, winning 53.9% of the votes in the 
seven-candidate field. He easily outdistanced Democratic front-runner Adam 
Schiff, a former assistant U. S. attorney, who received 25.6% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, 36, is expected to be sworn in Monday as the representative of the 43rd 
Assembly District, which includes Glendale, Burbank, Los Feliz and Silver Lake. 
He will fill out the remainder of the current term, which expires on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "This catches me and everybody else by surprise," Rogan said Tuesday night. "I 
just got off the phone from Gov. Wilson and looking forward to going to 
Sacramento to work on the Wilson team."  
</P>
<P>
 The temporary vacancy arose after Nolan was forced to resign after pleading 
guilty Feb. 18 to one count of racketeering, a charge stemming from an FBI 
sting operation against Sacramento lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 To win election Rogan had to deal with questions about his past as a former 
activist in the Democratic Party. In 1988, Rogan switched parties after being a 
member of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Central Committee for a 
number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Sen. Pete Wilson even held up Rogan as a trophy convert at a news 
conference, and within two years Gov. George Deukmejian had appointed Rogan to 
the judgeship. Rogan's switch has been the target of some criticism from his 
Republican foes, who have called it a character issue. It was even suggested 
that he changed parties to get a seat on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rogan countered that his credentials and the integrity of his beliefs have 
been well-tested, enough so that he won the endorsement of a majority of 
Assembly Republicans and the backing of Allied Business PAC, a conservative 
Christian group run by four wealthy businessmen and investors and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan is anti-abortion, a strong foe of gun controls and a supporter of 
voucher programs to provide financial help to parents with children in private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's toughest GOP challenger was Julia Wu, a member of the Los Angeles 
Community College District board of trustees.  
</P>
<P>
 In the final days before the election, Rogan and Wu traded charges and 
counter-charges as they vied for Republican votes and tried to paint the other 
as the more liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu accused Rogan, who was formerly a deputy district attorney, of being softer 
on crime than his tough campaign posturing would indicate. And she raised the 
issue of Rogan's former Democratic Party involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, on the other hand, countered that Wu had a record of casting fiscally 
irresponsible and self-interested votes as a college trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu received 10.2% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan concentrated his campaign efforts on courting the conservative Glendale 
Republicans that formed the backbone of Nolan's political support with a 
message that highlighted his Horatio Alger origins of overcoming a broken 
family life to become a top prosecutor and judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's goal during the campaigning was to introduce himself to voters and 
map out a strategy aimed at wooing Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, Wu, Schiff and the other candidates are not finished with each other, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 43rd District voters will go to the polls again on June 7 to pick 
their party's nominee to run for the district's new two-year term that begins 
on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominees picked from that election will face each other in the final 
election on Nov. 8. In addition to the seven candidates featured in Tuesday's 
election, three more will enter the June 7 contest, one Democrat and two 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new Republicans will be Peter Repovich, a Los Angeles police officer 
who works a community relations detail in Hollywood. Although a political 
newcomer, Repovich has raised more than $300,000 for his campaign -- making him 
the top fund-raiser in the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the polls had closed Tuesday, Repovich was challenging his GOP 
cohorts, Wu and Rogan, to debate him in the run-up to the June 7 Republican 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout Tuesday was extraordinarily light. One man went to his polling 
place at mid-morning and was the fourth to cast a ballot in a precinct with 
more than 400 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were foul-ups that might have contributed to the skimpy turnout. 
Some Democratic voters, for instance, got conflicting signals on where to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare," said Barbara Grover, a Schiff political consultant. 
Grover said some voters were instructed in the official sample ballot they 
received from the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder to vote in one place 
but told to vote in another place by a Schiff mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion occurred when the county sent some incorrect information about 
the whereabouts of some polling places to the Schiff campaign which unwittingly 
reproduced the wrong addresses and mailed it to voters. SOUTHLAND ELECTION

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HOME SOUGHT FOR 11 PUPS, MOTHER DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A yellow Labrador retriever lay nestled with her 11 pups at the base of a 
60-foot Chatsworth hill. The family rested under a makeshift cave the dog had 
built out of brush to shelter her pups. It was pouring rain and the animals had 
been dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 The people at the West Valley Animal Shelter would like this story to have a 
happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Dennis Kroeplin and Alex Rico of the West Valley Animal Shelter 
rescued the canine family eight days ago from the 21300 block of Candice Place 
and on Tuesday, the whole canine family was put up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 With unrivaled optimism, the shelter hopes to find one home for all 12 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The puppies -- at less than 2 weeks old -- are too young to be separated from 
their mother and must be nursed, shelter officials said. Unweaned puppies or 
kittens would die under most care if they were separated from their mothers, 
Kroeplin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and pups are healthy and doing fine, the shelter reports, although they 
clearly got off to a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rainy afternoon, Kroeplin carried the mother -- who had been abandoned -- 
up the 45-degree hill and hoisted her over a fence. He returned with a burlap 
bag for the newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rescuers were drenched, the mother and her pups kept dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Since no one has claimed the homeless animals, the shelter put the entire 
family up for adoption Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The puppies' eyes are still closed and they're not able to lap milk. Putting 
out a pan of milk and expecting them to lap it would be like trying to give a 
newborn baby a glass of milk and expecting him to drink it, Kroeplin said. They 
would need a pet nurser (baby bottle). 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the pups would have to be fed every two hours with a special 
formula both day and night, and they would need a heating pad to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to take a chance that the puppy is going to be neglected and 
die because someone doesn't know how to care for it," Kroeplin said. "It's the 
mother and all her 11 or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeplin, who has worked for the shelter for 27 years, is convinced that 
"there are a lot kind people out there" and that someone will once again rescue 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In six to seven weeks, he said, the pups will be weaned and the owner can sell 
them. "We're hoping for someone to adopt her and the puppies, and because of 
being celebrities, there probably won't be a problem finding homes for all the 
puppies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost $60 to adopt the family. The shelter, at 20655 Plummer St., 
Chatsworth, is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. TERESA ANN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; U.S. LABOR SECRETARY WARNS OF JOB CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is at risk of developing into a two-tiered society in which 
only a small, well-educated minority holds good jobs, warned U.S. Secretary of 
Labor Robert B. Reich during a meeting Tuesday in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot live in a society . . . in which one big portion of the population 
is going on a downward escalator while the other small portion that has 
received an education is going on an up escalator," Reich said. "That great 
divide is going to fragment our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's remarks came at a meeting of business people, educators and students 
at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's computer center. He learned 
about work-study programs in Los Angeles and how they give high school students 
work experience that will help them find jobs after graduation. The DWP site 
was chosen for the meeting because it is involved in a youth-employment program 
that hires students from John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich also planned to meet with labor leaders and make an appearance on "The 
Tonight Show" with Jay Leno during his Los Angeles visit Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor secretary noted that today President Clinton will be signing into 
law the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, a bill that will fund more programs 
like those in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shell Oil Co. built a $2-million institute to house its youth-employment 
program in February, 1993, to "give something back to the community" after the 
Los Angeles riots, community relations manager Robert A. Russ told Reich. The 
Shell Youth Service Academy places students in jobs with small businesses and 
gives merchants incentives to join the program by paying for workers' 
compensation insurance, payroll taxes and 50% of students' wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me play devil's advocate for a second -- what's in it for Shell?" Reich 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, we hope the students and parents (who are involved with the 
program) will become our customers," Russ responded.  
</P>
<P>
 Students who attended the meeting said they felt that Reich listened 
attentively to what business owners, program coordinators and students had to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like he really cared," said Norman Ysaguirre, 17, a student at 
Dorsey High School in Los Angeles who is working as a cashier at a Shell 
service station. "He wanted to know what the problems were and how to fix 
them." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; BATTLE BREWS OVER FARM'S OSTRICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No question about it, Clint and Eva Stroschein say, ostriches are not only the 
biggest birds in the world, they're the dumbest heads in the sand, crushing 
their young under foot, and with brains the same size as their eyeballs. 
</P>
<P>
 What they are not, the couple contends, is smelly, loud or in any way worthy 
of being at the center of the brouhaha swirling around the O. K. Corral Ostrich 
Farm on Santa Maria Road, just off Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the day we moved in, it was like a range war," said Eva, who with Clint 
manages the farm, a war between a couple of neighbors with more traditional 
animals and the new bird folk. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-ostrich people contend that they have several concerns about the herd 
of seven-foot birds in their community. Neighbor Deborah Stern says they scare 
her horses, and another neighbor claims they keep her up at night. They also 
complain that the birds are a big tourist attraction and looky-loos are 
clogging their narrow road. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Clint Stroschein. If anything, it's the horses spooking his 
feathered friends, and when they aren't being their typically silent selves, 
"they coo a little bit, like a pigeon." 
</P>
<P>
 The birds can "kick you into the cheap seats," he admitted, but they are held 
inside a double-fenced compound and are more often than not scared silly of 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue that concerns neighbors most, however, is the increase in traffic on 
the thin ribbon of one-lane Santa Maria Road, as gawkers drive by to see the 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain amount of gawking certainly occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 On this clear-for-Southern California morning, the 12 adolescent ostriches 
bounce around the pen on their two-toed feet, snatching at shirts, hats and 
hands. They uncurl their lithe necks with the grace of Canada geese, and lurch 
with the coordination of a newborn calf when approached too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 These are being raised as breeders (and can fetch $70,000 a pair) for what 
ranchers say will be the meat animal of the future. According to the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, ostrich meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than 
either turkey or chicken. The meat is red, and in the words of Eva, tastes 
"like a filet mignon." 
</P>
<P>
 But as strangely cute, oafishly interesting and fat-free as they might be, the 
area is "not zoned for ostriches," said Stern. Los Angeles County planning 
officials, alerted by neighbors, told owner Doug Osborne that his birds would 
have to fly, so to speak. Osborne said he would try to have them moved to a new 
Topanga farm that permits wild animals by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't move there with the knowledge that he was doing anything wrong," 
said planner Michael Bleecher. "He's been trying to be very compliant." 
</P>
<P>
 While some will be happy to see them go, others say a few sour-grape neighbors 
are costing others the chance to enjoy the largest birds on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone else is intrigued by them," said K. Saltman, who took her Girl Scout 
troop to the ranch for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as a problem," said Jean Derek, who manages the nearby Fair 
Hills Farm Polo Club. "I don't mind the birds at all." ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WORK TO BEGIN ON ROSE PARADE FLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the castle is gone, it's just a question of where to put the waves 
and the sailboats, said organizers of Burbank's entry for the 1995 Tournament 
of Roses Parade in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a challenge," said Ted Winston, chairman of the Burbank Tournament 
of Roses Float Assn. construction committee. "I think it'll be a lot of fun to 
put together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank association chose "Reach for the Wind" as the theme for this 
year's float entry. It features three sailboats in a race, and porpoises and a 
sea turtle will follow. The last remnants of the 1994 entry that featured a 
castle were dismantled last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next couple of weeks, volunteers will start putting up the skeleton 
that will be used to support an arrangement of flowers representing the waves 
of the sea, Winston said. From there, they will decide where to put the 
sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind on the day of the parade is a minor concern, Winston admitted. Real 
sailboats could use the wind, but if strong Santa Ana winds hit during the 
parade, "We'd probably be in trouble -- but most everyone else in the parade 
would be in trouble too," Winston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank is one of only a handful of parade entrants that build their floats 
entirely by volunteers. An artist's rendering of the float was presented 
Tuesday night to the Burbank City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston said the float designers had considered having the sailboats rock back 
and forth like real boats. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we realized that if we had people rocking back and forth for the entire 
course of the parade, it would make them sick," he said, joking that the idea 
was killed despite a suggestion that it would make the float more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are working on making the porpoises and sea turtle rock and 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always amazes me how each year the float is so different," said Pat Gunn, 
treasurer for the Burbank Tournament of Roses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The float will sail down the streets of Pasadena for only one day, but the 
work on it takes all year. The tearing down of last year's float began in 
January after it had been on display in a local park for about a week. The work 
culminates in a frantic effort using hundreds of volunteers between Christmas 
and New Year's Day to cover the float with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston said he has about seven volunteer welders for the steel frame and is 
seeking more. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CSUN STUDENTS BEGIN RELIEF DRIVE FOR PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to raise more than $25,000 to assist their peers left homeless, jobless 
or financially strapped by the Jan. 17 earthquake, Cal State Northridge public 
relations students are launching a grass-roots, fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the campaign are about 1,000 clear, plastic donation 
canisters, which will begin appearing in businesses around the Northridge 
campus this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are targeting people who want to help but are not in a position to write a 
big check," said Cyndy Perry Rodgers, student coordinator for the project. "If 
they want to help, they can drop a couple of dollars in the canister." 
</P>
<P>
 About 16 students designed the project, called "A University is a Terrible 
Thing to Quake," as part of an advanced public relations class to practice 
community and media relations techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the federal funds being used to rebuild the campus, the scholarship 
funds raised through the effort will directly assist students who are 
struggling to stay in school after losing belongings, apartments or jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The public relations students decided to launch the campaign after reviewing 
results of a survey they distributed randomly to about 400 students in the 
aftermath of the quake. According to the survey, 60% of the students questioned 
suffered damage to their homes or belongings because of the quake and about 30% 
lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing really addressing the students," Perry Rodgers said. "Since 
we were students, we could empathize how hard it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The canisters will remain in the restaurants and retail businesses through the 
end of May. Students also hope to enlist corporate sponsors in the project.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; RETIREMENT FACILITY LIGHTENS UTILITY COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And there was light -- lots of it, energy-efficient, easy-on-the-eyes light 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging -- where the average 
age is 90 -- are enjoying light like they haven't seen in years, thanks to a 
program from the Department of Water and Power that offers financial incentives 
to install energy-efficient lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a win-win situation," said home spokesman Michael Turner. "We're 
going to save 1.4-million kilowatts of electricity a year, and they (residents) 
can see better. Things are not as dreary." 
</P>
<P>
 The new system features lights that are tailored for aging eyes. So if the new 
cast at the home is a bit yellow and harsh to the younger set, for residents it 
is a vast improvement over traditional fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will also save the nonprofit retirement home about $153,000 in 
utility costs the first year, said David Factor of Innovative Lighting 
Services, the company that did the installation. And for making the massive 
change, the Department of Water and Power will present the home with an 
incentive check for another $90,304 at a ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
 With many of the supplies for the project offered at a discounted rate or 
donated by lighting suppliers, the entire make-over cost is about $300,000, an 
amount that should be recouped in less than two years, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of cases of lighting retrofitting . . . the pay-back can be really 
good," said Stephan Matsuda, DWP's manager of commercial programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has similar programs for residential utility users. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities celebrating the new lighting system will be held Wednesday at 11 
a.m. at the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging, 18855 Victory Blvd., Reseda.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; TESTS ORDERED FOR BOY WHO KILLED FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 15-year-old boy who shot and killed a 9-year-old friend in a Glendale 
apartment last year has been ordered to undergo 90 days of psychological and 
psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 The order was given in Pasadena Juvenile Court on Tuesday, about a month after 
the teen-ager was found guilty of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, whose identity is being withheld because of his age, is 
expected to return to court for sentencing Aug. 2, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Laura Foland-Priver. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager and the victim, Sang Lee, lived in the same apartment complex in 
the 1200 block of Virginia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager told police that he invited Lee to his apartment to watch 
television Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after they finished, the older boy went to a living room cabinet and 
pulled out his father's .38-caliber revolver from a shoe box. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who was then 14, loaded the gun with one bullet and pulled the 
trigger twice -- hitting Lee in the chest. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

EXTRADITION SOUGHT FOR 2 SUSPECTS IN SHOTGUN SLAYINGS IN LANCASTER ; CRIME: 
THEY ARE IN FLORIDA, WHERE THEY FACE MURDER CHARGES FOR A KILLING LAST WEEK. L. 
A. AUTHORITIES MAY WAIT UNTIL THE MEN ARE TRIED THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Extradition proceedings were initiated Tuesday to bring a pair of drifters -- 
described by police as cold-blooded killers -- from Florida to Los Angeles so 
they can face trial in the shotgun slayings of two people in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an intense dragnet by police, Harry Jackson Boyd and Terry Tyrone 
Evans were arrested in St. Lucie, Fla., where they are accused of beating and 
stomping a popular local handyman to death, authorities said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the extradition proceedings were launched, Los Angeles authorities 
said they will probably wait until the men are tried in the Florida case before 
bringing them back to California. Boyd and Evans were arrested Saturday 
evening, four days after they allegedly killed Robert Lee Williams in a vacant 
lot next to a grocery store, according to Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the 
St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 44, made an insulting remark to a woman who apparently was with Boyd 
and Evans, spurring them into a violent and deadly rampage, Weinberg said. 
Several children found Williams' body lying face down at the scene, and medical 
examiners later determined he had died when internal injuries caused his lungs 
to fill with blood, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started with their fists and then stomped him with their feet. And then 
they left him to die," Weinberg said. "He died actually by drowning in his own 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg said the slayings have punctured the quiet calm in the small 
community on the eastern seaboard of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with some provocation, there was certainly no good reason for these two 
men to kill Mr. Williams," Weinberg said. "It was shocking -- to us and to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, 26, of St. Louis, and Evans, 18, of Chicago, were being held without 
bond at St. Lucie County Correctional Center on second-degree murder charges. 
They were not charged with first-degree murder because authorities believed 
they did not intend to kill Williams when they started beating him, Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police ran a routine computer check, they found the two were also wanted 
in connection with a double homicide committed in Los Angeles, apparently after 
a drug deal went bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men face charges in the March 1 shotgun slayings of Ronald Greene, 22, 
of Upland and Latonya Walker, 23, of Ontario. Greene was shot once in the back 
of the head as the four sat in a car outside the Antelope Valley Apartments in 
the 43400 block of 32nd Street West. He was in the driver's seat, and the two 
suspects were sitting in the back seat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker fled the vehicle, but Boyd caught her about 15 feet from the car, and 
Evans walked up and shot her as she begged for her life, authorities said. 
Evans then dropped the semiautomatic pistol, and walked to a car driven by a 
third man, who is still at large, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe the slayings may have been the result of a "drug-ripoff 
type of situation," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office. Greene was in possession of about $4,500 in 
cash at the time of the killing, but the suspects apparently searched his body 
and found no money because it was hidden in his clothing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extradition law entitles Florida to prosecute the two men before they are sent 
back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara J. Moore, chief in charge of extradition services for the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office, said whichever jurisdiction has the most 
serious charges pending against suspects is entitled to try them first. Since 
both Florida and California authorities want the two suspects on murder 
charges, Florida will try them first because they were arrested there, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, the slaying of Williams so enraged local authorities that they put 
10 detectives -- a third of the entire St. Lucie detective force -- on a 
round-the-clock search for his killers, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd and Evans had lived in Florida more than 10 years ago, and had returned 
several weeks ago, Weinberg said. They were identified as suspects through 
informant tips and other means, placed under surveillance until arrest warrants 
could be obtained and then arrested at relatives' houses as they hid in 
closets, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a popular person, with no known enemies," Weinberg said of Williams. 
"So it was important to us to be able to solve this crime."

SINGER ASKS TO REMAIN IN REHAB CENTER; COURTS: RICK JAMES WANTS TO UNDERGO DRUG 
TREATMENT. INQUIRY ON ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT RELATED TO HIS PROSECUTION IS 
SENT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two committees recommended that he be tossed out, funk singer Rick James 
has asked the warden of the California Rehabilitation Center to let him stay 
and undergo drug treatment instead of serving a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 James, an admitted cocaine addict who was convicted of assaulting two women 
during drug binges, is fighting for admission to a nine-month program, said 
defense attorney Mark J. Werksman. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials in the district attorney's office said an internal 
investigation into allegations of misconduct related to James' prosecution has 
been referred to the California attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain prompted by the misconduct allegations, everyone involved in 
the James case agreed that he could serve time at the rehabilitation center in 
Norco. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff stayed a prison term so the 
self-proclaimed King of Funk could receive treatment for his addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 James was sent to the center in January and has received treatment, Werksman 
said. But two committees that evaluate convicted felons to determine if 
treatment will help have denied his formal admission to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Werksman has appealed the rulings to Warden Jean E. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the warden to do the right thing," he said, adding that he has not 
seen reports documenting the committee's decisions, but he knows that James has 
performed well for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in good spirits," Werksman said. "He's clean and sober." 
</P>
<P>
 If James is ultimately turned down by officials, Judge Hoff would conduct 
another hearing to determine if James will be sent to prison for the full 
five-year, four-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 This prison sentence was stayed primarily because of the investigation into 
wrongdoing by an investigator in the district attorney's office. The 
investigator did not work on the case, but he had possibly inappropriate 
conduct with a woman who testified against James at a trial last fall, sources 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator may have provided contraband to Michelle Allen, a prosecution 
witness intended to show that James had a habit of abusing women, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator left the district attorney's office Feb. 24, said Dist. Atty. 
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The internal investigation done by the district attorney's Bureau of 
Investigations, Internal Affairs Division, has been completed," Gibbons said, 
"and the results of that internal investigation have been turned over to the 
state's attorney general's office." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman with the attorney general's office would not comment on the 
inquiry, declining even to confirm that the office was looking at the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons said that internal investigations are often kept within the office, 
culminating with the disciplining of the offending employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matters involving further review are often sent to the attorney general's 
office because the district attorney's office cannot prosecute their own 
employees," Gibbons said.

VALLEY BRIEFING: CINCO DE MAYO; REMEMBERING MEXICO'S VICTORY OVER THE FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week marks the 132nd anniversary of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates the 
Battle of Puebla, in which a ragtag group of Mexican fighters soundly defeated 
the French army on May 5, 1862. The defeat was a minor setback for the French, 
who had occupied the country a few months before, but the victory served as a 
rallying point for those wanting Mexico's freedom. The holiday caught on with 
many people in the United States-where it is sometimes confused with Mexican 
Independence Day, which falls on Sept. 16-and is celebrated more vigorously 
herethan in many areas in Mexico. Its popularity grew in part because the 
holiday was embraced by Chicano activists during the 1960s as a symbol of their 
civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 An Unlikely Ruling Couple 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Maximilian 
</P>
<P>
 Maximilian headed the country for three years as part of a scheme by France's 
Napoleon III. The younger brother of Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria, 
Maximilian attained the rank of rear admiral at age 22. After the French army 
occupied Mexico, he accepted the offer to become emperor, falsely believing the 
Mexican people had voted him their king. He angered the Catholic Church by 
refusing to restore vast church holdings confiscated by President Benito 
Juarez. He used his own inheritance, however, to cover daily expenses for the 
country since the Mexican treasury was depleted. After the French withdrew, he 
was court-martialed and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Carlota 
</P>
<P>
 Originally known as Princess Charlotte, she was the daughter of King Leopold I 
of the Belgians, and married Maximilian in 1857 when she was 17. She remolded 
the lavish Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City and established won's charitable 
organizations. When the United States began to demand the withdrawal of French 
troops, she sought aid from Napoleon III and the Pope. She was unsuccessful. 
She was in Europe when her husband was executed and suffered a mental 
breakdown. She lived in seclusion near Brussels until her death at age 86 on 
Jan. 19, 1927. In her old age she told her nurses that her husband was "the 
Sovereign of the Universe." 
</P>
<P>
 The French Occupation Key moments during France's brief rule in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1861-Facing great economic troubles, Mexican President Benito Pablo 
Juarez suspends payment on all foreign debts for two years. January, 
1862-England, Spain and France land troops in Veracruz. Britain and Spain 
withdraw their troops three months later after they realize Napoleon III wants 
to conquer Mexico and rule through a puppet government. May 5, 1862-Mexican 
forces defeat French army at Battle of Publa. May, 1864-Napoleon III installs 
Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his wife, Carlota, as emperor and empress of 
Mexico. June, 1863-With a bigger army, troops of Napoleon III capture Mexico 
City. March, 1867- Beaten down by continued resistance, pressure from the 
United States and criticism at home in France, Napoleon III withdraws his 
troops. May, 1867-Emperor Maximilian is captured and later executed. Juarez is 
restored as president of Mexico. Battle of Puebla 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after landing in Mexico, the French army advanced upon Puebla, 
situated about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City. The French Gen. Laurencez 
thought it would be an easy victory so he took no precautions and sent his men 
into the center of the Mexican fortifications. The Mexicans, commanded by Gen. 
Ignacio Zaragoza, were armed mostly with outdated guns. Even so, the 6,000 
French soldiers were soundly defeated by 2,000 Mexicans, who hid behind tall 
cactus plants. The French lost more than 1,000 men. Today, Cinco de Mayo is a 
Mexican national holiday and marked each year with a military parade in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Independence Day 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Sept. 16, 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla called his 
parishioners to Mass in a small Dolores church. But instead of giving a 
religious sermon, he asked them to revolt against nearly three centuries of 
Spanish colonial rule. His Grito de Dolores, or shout to arms, became one of 
the most famous speeches in Mexican history. The shout is repeated during 
Mexican Independence Day celebrations. Although it took 11 years to defeat 
Spain, he date is considered the day that a independent Mexico was created.

CONSERVANCY NAMES EX-BOARD MEMBER TO DIRECT NEW STREISAND CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A candidate seemingly chosen before the job was advertised has been named 
academic director of the new Streisand Center for Conservancy Studies, winning 
out over more than 100 other applicants for the $70,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, has given the 
job of running the environmental research and conference center to Madelyn J. 
Glickfeld, a professional planner and former conservancy board member whom an 
internal memo last fall appeared to say would get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The unsigned memo was written more than a month before the position was 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 However, conservancy officials involved in the selection said Tuesday that 
Glickfeld's appointment was not preordained, and that her professional 
qualifications and knowledge of the Santa Monica Mountains made her the best 
choice for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not too illogical to assume that after 111 or even 11,000 applications, 
she still might come out first," remarked Jerome C. Daniel, chairman of the 
conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting that began Monday night but concluded after midnight, the board 
voted 7 to 1 to put Glickfeld in charge of the Streisand Center, to be based in 
Malibu at the Ramirez Canyon estate that Barbra Streisand donated to the 
conservancy late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickfeld, a staunch environmentalist and member of the state Coastal 
Commission since 1987, must also be approved by the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority, an affiliate of the conservancy. But that approval 
seems assured since three of the authority's four board members have voiced 
support for Glickfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said 111 candidates, a number of them highly qualified, 
responded to advertisements for the academic director post. But a memo obtained 
by the Times from conservancy files under the state Public Records Act appeared 
to concede the job to Glickfeld before it was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-page memo, entitled "Ramirez Canyon To Do List," is dated Nov. 2, 
1993 -- about two weeks before the Streisand donation was announced and more 
than a month before the director's job was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasks outlined in the memo included "consider where to put Program Manager 
Madelyn and asst." On another page, the memo referred to the "Program Manager 
(Madelyn G. posn)." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said they believed the memo was written by a staff 
member of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, a nonprofit group that receives 
grants from the conservancy and is involved in maintaining the Streisand 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A member at the time of the conservancy board, Glickfeld already knew of 
Streisand's gift and had expressed an interest in running the conference 
center, officials said. She resigned from the conservancy board in November, in 
part so she could seek the job. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the memo "probably should have used terminology that was more 
descriptive of the position and not a person," said Belinda Faustinos, deputy 
director of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservancy officials said Tuesday they were unaware of the memo until a 
conservancy critic who also had obtained a copy raised the subject at Monday 
night's board meeting. Citing the memo, Malibu realtor Tom Bates contended the 
job search was a sham. 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Hisserich, a conservancy board member and USC administrator who sat on 
a screening committee for applicants for the job, said he had been unaware of 
the memo and did not believe the selection process was biased. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, it (Glickfeld's appointment) was clearly not preordained," 
Hisserich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't participate in sham interviews. I don't subject people to that. And I 
don't have the feeling that that's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Casting the lone vote against Glickfeld was Richard P. Sybert, a Wilson 
administration appointee to the conservancy board and congressional candidate.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PRIVATE FIRMS FOR QUAKE DEBRIS REMOVAL; RECOVERY: ACTION TO 
ASK FOR BIDS IS PROPOSED BY HAL BERNSON AND RICHARD ALARCON. THEY COMPLAIN THE 
CITY'S PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING FAST ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three months after the city charged its own workers with managing the 
earthquake cleanup program, the Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to 
consider using private firms to help oversee the demolition and debris removal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The action to ask firms to submit bids was proposed by Councilmen Hal Bernson 
and Richard Alarcon who complained that the city's program is not working fast 
enough to clear the city streets of quake debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The bids are also intended to answer a question that several council members 
have been asking since the city's cleanup program began: Can private firms do 
the job more efficiently than the city? 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who represents parts of the northeast San Fernando Valley, said the 
council's vote does not mean the city will hand over the entire cleanup program 
to private firms but he said he still hopes the city will study that option. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least now we can look our constituents in the face and say we tried to 
find the best way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members argued that the city's management of the cleanup 
program has gone well and does not need outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any evidence that this program is failing," said Councilman 
Marvin Braude, who joined Councilwoman Rita Walters in opposing the move to 
seek competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the council voted to support Mayor Richard Riordan's 
recommendation to shift 79 workers from the city's Bureau of Engineering over 
to a new Earthquake Recovery Division. That unit was charged with overseeing 
demolition of up to 1,000 buildings and the removal of about 400,000 tons of 
debris from the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the mayor's plan after city Public Works officials 
estimated that city workers could do the work more cheaply than private firms 
because it had lower overhead costs and would not factor in a 10% profit margin 
as private firms would. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at that time, opponents of the mayor's plan argued that city 
officials had simply estimated what the private contractors would charge, 
instead of allowing the companies to submit their own bids. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has completed about 15% of the demolition work and 20% of the 
cleanup. Beginning last month, the city had 104 crews -- each with two trucks 
and a skip loader -- clearing 10,000 tons of debris per day. All the crews come 
from private companies, but all are managed by the the city's Earthquake 
Recovery Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon and Bernson said the piles of rubble they have seen in streets in 
their districts indicate that the cleanup program is not working fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not doing a good job in my district," Bernson told Public Works 
officials at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Alarcon who first asked that private firms submit competitive bids to 
on the cost of taking over the remainder of the cleanup program. But Bernson 
amended that motion, asking that the firms only submit bids for the cost of 
adding privately managed crews to the city's program. 
</P>
<P>
 The competitive bids are due back to the City Council by May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Dickerson III, president of the Public Works Commission, said the 
city's program had slowed down last month because of a temporary funding 
shortage. But overall, he said, "We think we are doing a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the meeting, Andres Santamaria, manager of the city's 
cleanup program, said piles of debris are still seen throughout the city 
because residents are not calling the city to request cleanup. The city's 
cleanup request line is (800) 498-CITY. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cleanup crews only respond to requests because it would be too 
expensive to pay the crews to patrol neighborhoods in search of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't let them roam the streets at $500 an hour," Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santamaria maintains that adding crews managed by private firms might actually 
increase the cost of the program because city crews could end up sitting idle.

FAMILY LOOKS FOR ANSWERS IN WOMAN'S FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Family members of Josephine Collins, who was killed in a car collision Monday 
in Northridge, were still trying on Tuesday to understand what caused the 
56-year-old woman to drive across the center divider on Lassen Avenue and crash 
head-on into another car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought she may have passed out," said Edward Wheat, who added that his 
mother-in-law was a diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins died at the scene of the accident after her car, traveling westbound 
on Lassen Avenue near Encino Avenue, slammed into a vehicle carrying five 
people, including three children, who had just been picked up from school by 
their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hadn't been feeling well lately and her blood-sugar level had been going 
up and down," said Collins' only daughter, Risa Wheat of Arleta, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But her mother, who lived in Sherman Oaks, was feeling good on Monday, Risa 
Wheat said. Collins had spent the weekend at a family gathering at the Wheats' 
new house in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 Risa Wheat said she spoke to her mother an hour before the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me felt fine and she had eaten breakfast," Wheat said. "I told her 
'Take care of yourself, Mom, and I'll see you later.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, Collins was on her way to pick up her 11-year-old 
grandson and her 9-year-old granddaughter from school, a task she enjoyed since 
she retired from her job as a teaching assistant at a HeadStart Program in 
South-Central Los Angeles, the Wheats said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was full of love and would do anything for her grandkids or anyone else," 
Edward Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Risa Wheat and her family tried to cope with Collins' death as 
they recalled good memories Wheat shared with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love her very much and I'll miss her," said Risa Wheat. "I'll do the best I 
can without her." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office had not scheduled an autopsy to determine the cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car in the collision, Eun Chi Sim, remained in guarded 
condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center after surgery Monday. The 
34-year-old Northridge woman suffered cuts to her forehead and a broken pelvis, 
leg and ankle, said Detective John Miller of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Anthony Sim, 8, whose jaw was broken in the accident, is listed in 
stable condition at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. His sister, Christine 
Sim, 9, was treated for bruises and released from Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other passengers in Sim's car were her sister-in-law, Nicole Jun of 
Granada Hills, and Jun's son, Ike, 5. Ike's collarbone was fractured. He was 
released from Childrens Hospital on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Jun, 27, suffered a broken collarbone, sprained wrist and bruised 
knees. She was treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A driver of a third car, which slammed into Sim's vehicle, was treated at 
Granada Hills Community Hospital and released Monday.

GROUP SUBMITS NEW PLAN FOR ARTS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of ambitious proposals and feuding with 
environmentalists, a San Fernando Valley arts group Tuesday submitted what 
federal officials characterize as a "reasonable" plan for a cultural center in 
the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The envisioned Arts Park L. A. would include a theater, a museum and workshops 
built across 52 acres of greenery on the basin's northern edge, near the 
intersection of Victory and Balboa boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Foundation, the private group promoting this $150-million 
complex, was forced to scale back its plans several times in response to public 
and government concerns that Arts Park would clash with the basin's natural 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and city officials have agreed to consider the proposal in its newest 
version, which was submitted as part of an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor amphitheater that was a mainstay of earlier plans was eliminated 
and the complex's centerpiece, a large theater, was moved west across Balboa 
Boulevard. Tuesday's report also included further analysis of alternative 
sites, including El Cariso Park in Sylmar and the Cal State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report was four years in the making," said Ross Hopkins, the 
foundation's executive director. "It's a major step for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Arts Park would be constructed on public land, it must earn approval 
from both the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the basin, and the city 
of Los Angeles, which leases the area for park use. 
</P>
<P>
 Corps officials have expressed satisfaction with changes in the plan, but 
reserved their final judgment until later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't make a decision on whether or not we should bless the project until 
after the city has made its decision," said Ruth Villalobos, chief of the 
corps' environmental resources branch. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the proposal stands before the city's Recreation and Parks 
Department, which is expected to call a public hearing on the matter in coming 
months. If the department approves Arts Park, the project would go before the 
City Council and then before the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Coalition to Save the 
Basin have argued that the basin, the Valley's largest remaining green space, 
should remain as undeveloped as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier versions of Arts Park proposed a complex that spanned about 60 acres 
of that greenery, extending to the shore of the man-made Lake Balboa.

LAST PLAYER IN ZZZZ BEST CASE SETTLES CIVIL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-associate of imprisoned carpet-cleaning mogul Barry Minkow has settled a 
civil suit brought against him by the federal government, admitting no 
wrongdoing and claiming he is too poor to pay the $720,000 judgment against him 
for his alleged role in defrauding investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement with Maurice Rind of Encino, reached last week in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles, ends nearly six years of litigation by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission against key players in the ZZZZ Best empire begun by a 
teen-age Minkow in his family's Reseda garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Matteson, the SEC lawyer who handled the case, said the judgment signed 
by Judge Harry Hupp allows the commission to seek fines against Rind and even 
prison time if evidence surfaces that he lied about his ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The commission made a decision that it was appropriate to settle 
on these terms because it saves the commission resources and at the same time, 
we're protected." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney who defended Rind, Edward Gartenberg of West Los Angeles, could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rind, described by Matteson as a 55-year-old ex-stock broker with a history of 
SEC violations and prison time, was accused of lying about ZZZZ Best assets in 
financial documents to entice investors during a $15-million stock offering in 
December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as a consultant, Rind helped Minkow's privately held company go public 
in January, 1986, and the stock offering later that year was aimed at raising 
more capital, Matteson said. She said that while preparing the documents for 
the stock offering, Rind exaggerated the value of 22 used power generators -- 
claiming in documents they were worth nearly $2 million when they were 
purchased for less than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64% overstatement of assets was crucial because it was just enough to make 
the company eligible to list stocks publicly, Matteson continued. Publicly 
filed financial statements did not disclose that the generators were bought 
from a wholly owned ZZZZ Best subsidiary that Rind managed, or that he received 
$720,000 in compensation from ZZZZ Best for his role in buying them, Matteson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The generators purportedly helped run the equipment used by Best employees as 
they restored fire and water-damaged buildings but in fact, Matteson said, the 
entire operation turned out to be a scam aimed at defrauding insurance 
companies and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations led to criminal cases against about a dozen people, including 
Minkow, who was hailed as a local "whiz kid" as his business grew and now, in 
his late 20s, is serving 25 years in federal prison for a variety of fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rind, twice convicted of SEC violations in New York in the 1970s, was never 
criminally charged in the ZZZZ Best case, Matteson said. 
</P>
<P>
 His settlement agreement ended five civil cases pursued by the SEC against 18 
people, said Matteson. Meanwhile, she said, a class-action suit brought by 
investors is still pending in federal court.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN KILLED, 2 INJURED IN 3-WAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canyon Country man was killed and two other motorists were injured Tuesday 
morning in a three-vehicle crash on Pearblossom Highway, just east of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen W. Harvey, 34, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which 
occurred at 6:30 a.m., California Highway Patrol Officer Tom Hastain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey and Steven Purana, 20, of Llano were driving east on Pearblossom when 
Purana's pickup abruptly changed lanes and struck the rear of Harvey's Honda 
Civic, causing that car to spin out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic moved onto the wrong side of the road, where it was hit by a car 
driven by Tobey Moat, 33, of Palmdale, Hastain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moat was taken to Palmdale Hospital, where she was treated for cuts and 
scrapes, then released. Purana was treated at the scene for minor injuries. No 
arrests were made, but Hastain said CHP investigators were trying to determine 
whether to seek manslaughter charges against Purana.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FORMER PRIEST ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY MOLESTING 2 
BOYS ENTERS A NO-CONTEST PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Episcopal priest pleaded no contest Tuesday to charges that he 
sexually molested two teen-age boys who attended the Palmdale church where he 
served as vicar. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plea bargain presented in Antelope Municipal Court, Robert L. Ducker, 
63, pleaded no contest -- the equivalent of guilty -- to three counts of lewd 
conduct with a child. He faces up to 12 years in state prison at his sentencing 
on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker, who resigned his post at Christ the King Mission in Palmdale at the 
time of his arrest in March, had been charged with 10 counts of sexual 
misconduct with children. He faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been 
convicted by a jury after a trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo said he was satisfied with the agreement. "It eliminated the 
uncertainty" associated with a trial, he said. "He can't be acquitted. The time 
he's facing is appropriate for a person of his background and the conduct in 
which he engaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Chesley N. McKay Jr. ordered Ducker to return to Los Angeles County 
Jail, in lieu of $100,000 bail, to await sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducker had served as vicar at the Palmdale church since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators alleged that he befriended the two youths, who are now 15, and 
molested them over the last two years. An older brother of one boy learned 
about the incidents and informed his mother, who contacted authorities in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea bargain, Ducker agreed to cooperate with a sheriff's child 
abuse investigator concerning other possible offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Roy Wallen said his client agreed to the plea agreement 
partly to spare the boys the trauma of testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to harm or inconvenience the boys involved," Wallen said. 
"He's expressed remorse concerning the incidents. It was appropriate to resolve 
the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallen said he will argue that Ducker be sentenced to less than 12 years. "I 
think 3 1/2 decades of service to his church and the community will be of 
value," the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys and other family members were in court Tuesday, prepared to 
testify if the plea agreement had not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The family members declined to comment after the hearing. Their attorney, 
Sydney Kulchin of Encino said, "They're still numb about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kulchin said his firm had filed a lawsuit this week in Los Angeles against 
Ducker and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. He said the suit charges the 
church with negligence and misconduct in the hiring and training of Ducker and 
seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Diocese representatives could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But after 
Ducker's arrest, spokesman Robert Williams said the diocese had offered 
counseling and other support to the families involved in the case and to other 
members of the Palmdale church. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said at the time that Ducker, like all other diocese priests, had 
attended a seminar on clerical sexual misconduct.

 The community's first ambulance station opened this week after two years of 
effort by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Wilson Ambulance Service, which operates ambulance services 
in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, said response time to many 
emergencies will be cut by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe with this station we can give service within 10 minutes to any of 
the areas," said Harvey Hall, general manager of Wilson Ambulance, which has 23 
vehicles servicing nine stations in the two valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, it took between 12 and 15 minutes for emergency crews to respond 
to Castaic from the closest ambulance station, which until Sunday was about 
five miles south in the Valencia Industrial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A welcoming ceremony was held Monday at the new station at 31744 Castaic Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Anthony Castiglione said he quickly found out what working at the 
station will be like, waiting for several hours after the station opened at 7 
a.m. Sunday before a call finally came through at the main boat launch ramp of 
Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ended up being a water skier who was hot-dogging too near the shore," 
Castiglione said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Ambulance staff members assigned to the station said they expect future 
shifts to remain quiet compared to surrounding areas, except on weekends when 
large crowds at the lake lead to more emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic officials spent two years trying to get Wilson Ambulance to provide 
the station, as development has led to more residents and a greater need for 
local ambulance service, said Samuel Ara Azhderian, president of the Castaic 
Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Parker, a Wilson Ambulance spokeswoman, said Castaic still has 
relatively few emergencies compared to other areas serviced by the company and 
officials wanted to make sure it was economically feasible to operate the new 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be a little premature, but if a community is that concerned and 
wants it that badly we're certainly there to listen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance company is dispatched by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, 
in response to 911 calls or other circumstances alerting firefighters to 
emergencies. Patients are transported to the closest hospital -- Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita -- unless that facility is too full 
to accept patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Billing for all ambulance service is regulated by the county, which also 
provides a subsidy out of the general fund to patients who can't afford 
ambulance service.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BILL WOULD BAN IMPORTATION OF TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Antelope Valley has been called a lot of things -- a cultural wasteland, a 
developer's paradise, the methamphetamine capital of Los Angeles County -- but 
a dump? 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the San Diego County city of El Cajon views the area -- as a 
perfect place to haul its trash and save money in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rallying to the defense of his district, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich introduced an emergency motion Tuesday that would temporarily ban 
the importation of trash from outside the county to any landfill in the 
Antelope Valley. That would give the County Board of Supervisors 45 days to 
hold public hearings on the matter before considering a permanent ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider that the 10 million citizens of Los Angeles County won't 
have landfill space through the next decade, to further aggravate the situation 
by importing more just doesn't make any sense," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Cajon officials are equally adamant. Beginning July 1, they hope to 
start hauling 12 truckloads of trash a day 160 miles north to the privately 
owned Lancaster Landfill. They'll pay a tipping fee of $40 a ton, or $25 less 
than in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to move forward on this" regardless of the board's action, 
said El Cajon City Manager Bob Acker in a telephone interview Tuesday. "We 
certainly think the law against restraint of trade is on our side." 
</P>
<P>
 County attorneys concurred, saying that a ban might not withstand a legal 
challenge. After Supervisor Ed Edelman pointed out that the county eventually 
plans to ship some of its trash by rail to neighboring San Bernardino County, 
the board decided to study the matter for two weeks before voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Waste Management Inc., which operates the Lancaster Landfill, 
said the 75,000 tons that El Cajon plans to dump annually is infinitesimal 
compared to the county's daily trash haul of 40,000 tons. Under a county 
permit, the landfill can accept trash from anywhere as long as the total does 
not exceed 1,000 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Vowed Noreen Cade, a Lancaster resident who testified before the board: "The 
people of the Antelope Valley will not allow the desert to become a dumping 
ground."

TERRORIZED POST OFFICE WORKER SUES HER UNION; COURTS: KIM SPRINGER CLAIMS 
OFFICERS SUPPRESSED 'DAMAGING INFORMATION' ABOUT THE MAN ACCUSED OF STALKING 
HER AND SHOOTING TWO OF HER CO-WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kim Springer, the postal worker who police say was stalked for more than a 
year by a co-worker before he tried to kidnap her during a deadly 38-hour crime 
spree, will seek $10 million in damages, her attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit to be filed today against her national union and its local branch, 
Springer, 30, says she continues to suffer "severe embarrassment, humiliation 
and prolonged emotional distress" that may require years of additional 
psychotherapy.  
</P>
<P>
 She accuses the National Assn. of Letter Carriers and Local 1100, based in 
Santa Ana, and several officers of suppressing "damaging information" about 
Mark Richard Hilbun, 39, who will be tried early next year on two counts of 
murder and seven counts of attempted murder, among other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the union declined comment Tuesday. U.S. Postal Service official 
Art Martinez, who oversees the Dana Point post office where Springer continues 
to work, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that on May 6 last year, Hilbun fatally stabbed his mother, Frances 
Hilbun, 63, and her cocker spaniel in Corona del Mar before driving to the Dana 
Point post office, where he hoped to kidnap Springer, with whom he had become 
infatuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouting "Kim, Kim!" as he fired a round from a .22-magnum revolver, Hilbun 
killed his best friend, Charles T. Barbagallo, 42, and wounded postal worker 
Peter Gates, 45, according to the 13-count indictment handed down in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, meanwhile, "desperately hid under her mail case in fear of her life, 
causing (her) to suffer serious emotional and psychological injuries," 
according to the document filed in court.  
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun then fled the post office and, as part of a three-day rampage that 
launched a statewide manhunt, allegedly fired six shots at a Newport Beach 
woman, leaving her critically wounded, and shot and robbed numerous other 
victims before being arrested in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, hired by the Postal Service in 1989, was harassed by Hilbun from 
July, 1992, until the day he invaded the post office with his gun, the 
complaint alleged. During that period, it claims, Hilbun repeatedly threatened 
her and "exhibited bizarre, disturbed and erratic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack M. Earley, Springer's attorney, said Tuesday that she may sue the Postal 
Service but had chosen to sue the union first to have the matter tried in 
Orange County Superior Court, where the plaintiff has more control. 
</P>
<P>
 A suit against postal authorities would have to be tried in U.S. District 
Court and could even be shifted to workers' compensation court, should the 
government choose to do so, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transferring Springer to another post office was discussed but never done, and 
guards never were provided at the post office, although "supervisors were 
carrying guns to protect themselves against Hilbun," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer formally complained to her union steward in July, 1992, the complaint 
says. Hilbun was fired in September, 1992, after "blaring his radio and wearing 
his underwear on the outside of his pants" at work, it continues.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Springer obtained a restraining order from the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department, which arrested Hilbun. He was sent to the 
psychiatric ward of South Coast Medical Center, where he was treated and later 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun was discharged by the Postal Service but posted a grievance with the 
union, which began an aggressive reinstatement campaign despite telling 
Springer that her problem would be "taken care of," the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
 By telling her, "Don't worry about it," union officials "effectively took 
charge of and/or assumed control of Mark Hilbun," the complaint adds.  
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun lost his appeal for reinstatement on April 19, 1993, and the defendants 
failed to notify Springer that they "were assisting Hilbun with his grievance 
procedure" and "of the ultimate result of Hilbun's appeal," the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer is also seeking legal costs and other damages.

COUNCILMAN HIRED AS DIRECTOR OF NEW HOTEL / MOTEL ASSN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson has been hired as executive director of a newly 
formed hotel and motel association and may be unable to vote on issues relating 
to the proposed Disneyland Resort because of conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who accepted the $36,000, part-time position last week, said local 
hotel owners and managers asked him to head the Anaheim Area Hotel / Motel 
Assn. to represent the industry's views on important tourism issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "They just wanted a stronger voice," he said of the 40 hostelries that are 
expected to compose the association, including the Disneyland Hotel and some of 
the other bigger hotels in Anaheim. He said that the job eventually could 
become full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to make a decision very shortly about that," said Simpson, who had 
been retired. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White acknowledged that Simpson may have to refrain from 
voting on some items coming before the City Council because of potential 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 White said those may include the $3-billion Disneyland Resort, the Walt Disney 
Co.'s theme park named Westcot and hotel project which would be built next to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on the issue," White said. "We'll have to determine it on a 
case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he realizes there is a potential for conflict in a vote on the 
Disneyland Resort, but added, "Hopefully, that won't occur." He indicated he 
will be guided by the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can rest assured that after 40 years in government, I don't want to end 
my career in jail," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the test of a conflict of interest is whether the City Council's 
vote would materially or financially affect a councilman's employer or would 
further "the expressed policies of his employer." 
</P>
<P>
 While the impact of Simpson's abstention from votes isn't certain, the City 
Council has in the past voted unanimously in favor of items involving the 
Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the issues that surely will concern the association will be any 
proposed tax increase on hotel room stays. City officials confirmed this week 
that such a tax increase is part of the financial framework for the Disneyland 
Resort.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said that the hoteliers recognize "that Disney and the Westcot 
expansion are the economic engines that drive the entire industry" and that 
they are not necessarily opposed to the tax increase as long as it benefits the 
whole industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, the former fire chief and city manager in Anaheim, said he took the 
job to help the hotels establish their new group. "We just came to a meeting of 
the minds," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to work about 20 hours a week on association business and is starting 
by meeting with counterparts at other hotel associations in the Southland.

3 UCI DEANS TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT; COST CUTTING: AMONG THE FACULTY LEAVING, 
UNDER A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO CUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PAYROLL, IS ONE OF 
THE SCHOOL'S MOST DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of UC Irvine's celebrated discoverers of ozone depletion and three of the 
university's deans have decided to take early retirement, UCI officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deans of fine arts, undergraduate studies and physical sciences, as well 
as the founding chairman of the chemistry department, F. Sherwood Rowland, 
turned in requests to retire early under a program that gives retirement 
incentives to staff and faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of founding faculty are of retiring age," UCI spokeswoman Karen 
Newell Young said. "The time is right for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred UCI faculty members were eligible to retire in this year's 
systemwide Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program to cut payroll costs, 
Young said. It is the third such early departure program offered in the UC 
system since 1991, but this is the first year that any UCI deans accepted the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits officials are still tabulating how many faculty members applied for 
the buyout in time for Friday's deadline. Almost 140 staff members retired 
early when they were offered the package last fall, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rowland, the Bren Professor of Chemistry and a highly regarded 
expert on the depletion of the ozone layer, those who are taking early 
retirement this year include: Robert Hickok, dean of the School of Fine Arts; 
Harold Moore, dean of the School of Physical Sciences; and Michael Butler, dean 
of Undergraduate Studies.  
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates, this latest round of UCI retirements means a savings 
of $7.8 million in salaries -- $5.2 million for non-faculty members and about 
$2.6 million for faculty, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 All those who accepted the package must retire by July 1, Young said. 
Officials intend to have acting deans in place in time for the start of the 
next school year, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other requirements, Young said, those taking the package had to be at 
least 50 years old and have at least five years of service credit as of July 1 
to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland said he will leave in late June to become the foreign secretary for 
the National Academy of Sciences, a four-year post. He has been one of the most 
celebrated icons of UCI's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people hear the name UC Irvine, from California and the West and 
elsewhere, his (Rowland's) is one of the first names that comes to mind," said 
Ralph J. Cicerone, professor in the earth system science department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not happy about all these early retirements," Cicerone said. "All the 
campuses are hard-hit. But luckily, in Rowland's case, he's going to remain 
active here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland in 1989 won the Japan Prize for his work in environmental sciences. 
Along with colleague Mario Molina, he discovered in 1974 that substances used 
in common aerosol sprays and solvents were damaging the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old Rowland said he likely will return to UCI late this year on a 
half-time basis. He began at UCI in 1964, he said, and hired the first faculty 
members at the university's nascent chemistry department. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to call my office in January or February of next year, your 
chance of finding me would probably be the same as it would've been last 
January or February," Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickok, 67, who has spearheaded fine arts instruction at UCI since late 1988, 
said he is taking early retirement because it is "very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of my length of time (in this work) and the attractiveness 
of the retirement program, and the fact that this job is going to be a very 
tough one in the next few years -- one which I'd just as well not do," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Hickok said he is leaving despite his approval of the university's current 
leadership. He will continue to conduct orchestras and hopes to write books, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically, the school is not in good shape," Hickok said. "Everybody knows 
that. A lot of people are leaving under the VERIP program, and that's going to 
have an effect on faculty." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, 59, and Moore, 57, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Butler 
founded the Farm School, UCI's experimental elementary school, 20 years ago. 
Moore, a chemist, has won two campus distinguished teaching awards.

AN EVENT FOR THE AGES; HEALTH CARE ISSUES DRAW MANY TO CONVENTION FOR THOSE 50 
AND OLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Some were pushing 100 and proud of it. Others were mere youngsters -- just 
turned 50. They came here Tuesday from as far away as Texas and New York to 
attend the American Assn. of Retired Persons convention -- one of the largest 
gatherings ever of people 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 million members strong, the AARP is the largest and most 
influential advocacy organization for older people. More than 20,000 people 
turned out Tuesday to hear speakers ranging from former NAACP executive 
director Benjamin Hooks to "Firing Line" host William F. Buckley Jr. to sex 
therapist Ruth Westheimer, better known as Dr. Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 6,000 people crowded into a meeting room at the Anaheim Convention 
Center to hear the diminutive lecturer dispense tips for jump-starting one's 
sex life in the golden years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of you with partners, don't go to lunch. Go back to your rooms," 
Westheimer said, eliciting a burst of nervous laughter from the crowd. "Maybe 
at a later stage people cannot swing from chandeliers . . . but don't discard 
me because I'm older."  
</P>
<P>
 While Dr. Ruth was the big draw, many said their main reason for coming to the 
convention was to learn more about how federal health care reforms will affect 
them. The AARP, which has not endorsed any of the competing health care 
proposals proposed by federal lawmakers, is lobbying for a plan that will 
address more of the concerns of older people about medical coverage -- 
especially whether the new plan will pay for prescription drugs and long-term 
care for disabled persons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be here to find out what's going on," said Eva Grant, a retired 
administrator with the L.A. County Unified School District. "They're always 
trying to take things away from older people. Before you know it, you've lost 
everything you've worked hard for." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Clemmons, 71, a retired social worker from Los Angeles whose mother 
recently died at the age of 100, said the experience of serving as care-giver 
makes her all too aware of the need for support services for relatives with 
ailing family members at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been following the health care proposals for a while -- not just how 
they affect older people but children as well," said the mother of two, who 
sported a Billie Holiday T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides workshops on topics like nutrition and grandparenting, conventioneers 
toured more than 100 exhibits featuring everything from Cadillacs to an antique 
RV. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more popular attractions was the Hartford House, a model equipped 
with an array of special features -- such as a shower chair and door handles 
instead of rounded door knobs -- that make older people's homes more 
user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all conventioneers were actual AARP members. At 49, Lucille McKnight, a 
county official from Albany, N.Y.,is four months shy of eligibility for AARP 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said she made the trip from New York at the urging of her sister, one 
of the convention's organizers. She joked that her sister has probably entered 
McKnight's name into the computer already, to automatically activate her 
membership on her next birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely going to join," said McKnight who praised the conventioneers 
for their sense of purpose. "It's such a great feeling here, you don't see any 
regrets . . . no depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of today's sessions include: 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 a.m., a 1.5-mile fitness walk along Convention Way; 10:30 a.m., Dr. C. 
Everett Koop, former U.S. Surgeon General, will discuss future trends in health 
care. At 2:30 p.m., two speakers will discuss health care reform issues: 
Fernando Torres-Gil, an assistant secretary for aging with the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, and Bruce Vladeck , an administrator with the 
U.S. Health Care Financing Administration. Also at 2:30 p.m., author Betty 
Friedan will discuss role changes in later life.

REAL CINCO DE MAYO MEANING STRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During a week when many Orange County restaurants and bars are offering 
margarita specials and mariachi music to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, local Latino 
leaders and Chicano studies classes are trying to stress the cultural and 
historical importance of the Mexican holiday most familiar to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the larger population sees it as a festive day like St. Patrick's Day 
and an occasion to go to happy hour," said UC Irvine Prof. Maria 
Herrera-Sobeck. "The Chicano students here are extremely committed and are 
serious about the significance of the day. They don't trivialize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of the underdog Mexican army over a much 
larger force of well-trained French troops on May 5, 1862, in the Battle of 
Puebla. The date has become institutionalized in the culture of Southern 
California, even though it commemorates a less important event in Mexican 
history than Independence Day, which falls on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Cal State Fullerton, who are presenting a series of events this 
week to emphasize the historical meaning of the occasion, are asking the public 
to "remember the heroes . . . and not prostitute Cinco de Mayo as a time for 
partying without knowing what it is you're celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of events, sponsored by the university's Chicano Studies Student 
Assn. and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or MEChA, focus on history 
and the Latino culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important day for us," said 20-year-old Dulce Medina, MEChA's 
treasurer. "The day symbolizes being an underdog and winning and coming 
together to show our unity. We wanted the week to be very cultural and 
intimate. We didn't want someone playing rock 'n' roll music or doing things 
that have nothing to do with Cinco de Mayo." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said Cinco de Mayo gives the large Latino population in 
Southern California and other parts of the country a chance to showcase their 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicanos here in Southern California have adopted the day as sort of a badge 
of cultural pride," said UC Irvine student Victor Torres. "It's a chance to 
express Chicano traditions openly and in public. It's a time to enjoy our food, 
appreciate our regional dance or listen to a mariachi in the park." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people just see it as an opportunity to have two tacos and a beer," 
Torres added. "But as they are enjoying that beer or food or music, I think 
they will be hard-pressed not to feel some pride in our people, who have rich 
traditions and a rich heritage that can contribute to society at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Prof. Joseph Platt said the ever-increasing number of 
Latino immigrants in Southern California, combined with springtime weather, has 
made Cinco de Mayo one of the most popular events of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a part of the Southern California culture," said Platt, who has 
taught Chicano studies for 22 years. "About 15 years ago, it was strictly a 
Latino holiday, but it is now very mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns about the meaning of the holiday being lost amid the 
commercialization of the day, some view the occasion as an opportunity to focus 
on concerns of the Latino community such as "immigrant bashing, bilingual 
education, political representation and gangs," Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time for fiesta, but it's got to be balanced with the concerns of the 
Latino community. It's a time to raise the consciousness at a time that they 
are celebrating a culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange County, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year especially, our thoughts turn to the strength that the remembrance 
of this cherished day brings," David said. "The immigrant community is being 
battered and bashed in this political climate. While we may be feeling down and 
out, we find strength and illumination in what Cinco de Mayo means to us."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CLAIM FILED IN DEATH OF BOY LEAVING BUS 
</P>

<P>
 Parents of a 7-year-old killed by a pickup truck April 22 after he got off a 
school bus filed a claim with the Capistrano Unified School District Tuesday 
for at least $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of Thomas E. Lanni charged in the claim, which must be filed and 
rejected before any civil lawsuit can be brought, that the bus driver acted 
improperly by neither flashing his lights nor escorting the first-grader across 
Aliso Niguel at El Pilar. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a way I could trade all of this to have my son back, I would do 
it in a heartbeat, but I can't," said Thomas W. Lanni, the boy's father. "It's 
very frustrating that the lights are still not being turned on, and it seems 
like no one cares." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief, prepared statement, the school district said it "disputes many of 
the allegations being made (in the claim) concerning the sequence of events 
surrounding this unfortunate accident." The district has 45 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 School board officials said the reason flashers were not used was that the 
driver believed all six students who got off at the stop lived on the same side 
of Aliso Niguel. Later, school officials said, it was learned that four of the 
six lived on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who had just moved with his family from New York, had been riding the 
bus for the first time. He mistakenly got off one stop before where his mother 
was waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lannis' attorney, Steven R. Young, said the family and neighborhood 
residents plan to attend a scheduled school board meeting Monday night to urge 
it to require bus drivers to turn on their flashing lights when they stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're just trying to get (the board's) attention," Young said. 
"We'd like to see the lights on, plain and simple."MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STATE HELP SOUGHT IN COUGAR SIGHTINGS

<P>
 County park rangers have asked the state Department of Fish and Game to 
investigate recent mountain lion sightings at Aliso and Woods Canyons Regional 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Local rangers could not confirm that animal prints reported last weekend by 
park visitors were from mountain lions, so they are seeking help from state 
experts, said Bruce Buchman, a supervising ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a (clear) print or a biologist or someone who is more attuned 
to what a mountain lion would look like," Buchman said. His staff inspected the 
park Monday, but with vague results -- they found animal prints in sandy 
terrain, Buchman said, but the prints were obscured by a bicycle track. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, state wildlife officials said they had not decided whether to send 
biologists to the Aliso Viejo park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing a mountain lion in the wild is not unique anymore, and the mountain 
lion is not hurting anyone," said Patrick Moore, a Fish and Game spokesman 
based in Long Beach. "That is where mountain lions belong, doing what mountain 
lions do. If they were acting in an aggressive manner, that's a different 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County park rangers posted about a dozen signs Monday throughout the 
3,400-acre park, informing visitors about the sightings. The signs will be left 
up for two to four weeks, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple biking through the park Sunday told park rangers they saw what looked 
like a cougar. A man riding a bicycle also reported a mountain lion near an 
abandoned corral by a bike trail, and another man reported seeing one April 25 
and April 27, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news . . . is that all the sightings have not involved a bold or 
aggressive mountain lion, so I wouldn't be any more worried here than in any 
other park," he said.ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CANDLES LIT TO BRIGHTEN LATINO PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of about 15 community activists and students this morning were to end 
a 24-hour candlelight vigil that they hope will persuade Cypress College to 
implement a program helping Latinos transfer to four-year colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have been asking for years for the Puente Project, a program at 27 
colleges statewide geared to help Latino students prepare for four-year 
institutions with special counseling and writing courses. Cypress is the only 
community college in Orange County without it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of local leaders, professors and others were participating in the 
vigil, which began Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our last resort," said student Cassandra Cortez, 25. "We've written 
letters, joined committees, held open forums, talked to trustees (of the North 
Orange County Community College District) and the chancellor and nothing has 
worked. Hopefully, this will show that we're serious about getting Puente." 
</P>
<P>
 District trustees and administrators have said they will implement the program 
if the English Department approves it. Carol Schneebeck, the department's 
coordinator, said an English instructor will spend six months learning about 
Puente and researching other programs throughout the state that could be 
started at Cypress College to benefit all students, not just Latinos. She said 
a decision on whether to implement Puente is expected to be made in the spring 
of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mercadante, vice president of student services, said, "The English 
department has been doing a study on the value of Puente. That's where (the 
college) stands right now. But the vigil is making an impact. It's creating an 
awareness of what students' needs are and what they want on this campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the college's 15,000 students, 2,488, or 16.5%, are Latinos. They make up 
the largest minority student population on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puente program involves a class of 25 to 35 students in which an English 
instructor teaches a writing course. A counselor attends the class to provide 
individual help, while volunteers from the Latino business community serve as 
mentors to the students. If implemented, Cypress would have one such class. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great program," said Therese Mosqueda-Ponce, a college counselor 
who is willing to sign up for the program. "It will encourage students to 
transfer to higher learning institutions and establish a sense of pride." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, students are required to return to volunteer as 
mentors once they complete their education. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT EXAM CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five Orange County parents, backed by a group that says it defends religious 
liberty, have filed a lawsuit challenging the state's CLAS student achievement 
test, which has come under legal assault across the state as anti-family and 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court, targets the state 
Department of Education and the Tustin and Placentia-Yorba Linda unified school 
districts, where schoolchildren are being given the California Learning 
Assessment System exam. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Mendoza, attorney representing Gary J. and Jaque Anthony, Steven and 
Diane Lounsbury and Kimberly Gibson, has requested a hearing today in which he 
will ask that the testing be halted. Mendoza is working with the Virginia-based 
Rutherford Institute, which describes itself as a nonprofit civil liberties 
organization specializing in the defense of religious liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said he has been inundated by calls from Orange County parents upset 
about the CLAS exam and intends to add more local school districts to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeking that this test just not be given," Mendoza said. "It is an 
illegal and intrusive inquiry into private, personal family matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the suit alleges that the CLAS exam violates section 60650 of 
the state Education Code and the federal Hatch Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The state code requires parental notification and consent before students can 
participate in any test in which they are asked questions about their beliefs, 
or the beliefs of their families, involving sex, family life, morality or 
religion. The Hatch Amendment requires parental consent before children are 
given psychiatric or psychological testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against 
the test, the suit seeks unspecified damages for alleged civil rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar lawsuits have been filed elsewhere in the state by the Rutherford 
Institute and United States Justice Foundation. Like the Orange County parents, 
others are also contending that the test, particularly its reading and writing 
sections, invades parental privacy and measures feelings rather than academic 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 State school officials deny that the test violates state or federal law and 
have said critics are deceiving the public about the exam. Local school 
officials said they are only following state law by administering the 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit comes just days after the state Department of Education notified 
school officials across California that they can allow parents to withdraw 
their children from the test. In addition, state officials said districts 
should make sample exam questions available to parents for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can opt out," Tustin Unified School District Supt. Dave Andrews said. 
"It doesn't make sense. They don't have to take the test." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said that parents involved in the Orange County lawsuit did withdraw 
their children from the test, but that he and others with the Rutherford 
Institute believe state law requires parental notification and permission for 
any child to take the test, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exam, which was first given last year, is mandated by the state 
Legislature as part of education reform and is used to compare student work in 
each school against tough statewide performance standards in reading, writing, 
math and other subjects. School districts throughout the state have started or 
will soon start administering the test to students in grades four, five, eight 
and 10.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; MERGER PLANS COULD SET OFF WATER WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of urging by the Orange County Grand Jury, the reinvention of 
local government begins today in San Clemente and Dana Point as officials 
prepare for what could become a bitter fight over how water should be brought 
into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente City Council and three water-related agencies serving Dana 
Point will move tonight to streamline South County's old guard districts that 
predate the cities themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Several grand juries have long depicted these agencies and other small 
governmental districts in the county as obscure, inaccessible and out of touch 
with their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say it is the current water shortage and the press for cost 
savings that have driven the merger moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like businesses consolidate for more efficiency, I think we all agree 
that it's time for us to consolidate," said Jim Hayton, a director of the 
46-year-old Capistrano Beach County Water District. "Water rates are 
skyrocketing and we are looking at another dry year. People won't see 
tremendous savings immediately, but we have to take this one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 In what is considered a happy union, the directors of the 66-year-old 
Capistrano Beach Sanitary District and Hayton's water district will meet 
jointly tonight and are expected to agree to merge into a new district governed 
by a 10-member board that, over the next four years, will be reduced to five 
members. It is expected to be in operation by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more hostile action is also planned, one that is not going to be readily 
accepted by the San Clemente-based Tri-Cities Municipal Water District. The two 
Capistrano Beach districts are expected to join the San Clemente City Council 
today in calling for the dissolution of Tri-Cities, an agency considered 
"redundant," according to city and district staff reports.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Clemente and the Capistrano Beach County Water District now 
buy imported water from Tri-Cities, which, in turn, buys its water from the 
Coastal Municipal Water District. San Clemente and the Capistrano Beach 
district now hope to buy directly from Coastal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can remove one or two layers of administration, hopefully that will 
allow us to save some money," San Clemente Mayor Scott Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Mecham, president of the Tri-Cities board, dismissed those 
suggestions as "small city politics" and said Tri-Cities has merger proposals 
of its own. Tri-Cities is preparing for the future by working with the U.S. 
Marines to share Camp Pendleton's underground water supply, a move that has 
been praised by regional representatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By law, we are the only district in the area that can cross the county line 
and work with the Marines," Mecham said, adding that the best way for the 
region to be served would be for Tri-Cities to merge with the South Coast Water 
District, a large Laguna Beach-based district. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dunbar, South Coast Water District's general manager, said his board 
of directors is studying consolidation but has yet to take formal action. The 
grand jury and the Local Agency Formation Commission are also preparing merger 
studies due out later this year.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LOW-COST HOUSING PROJECT OKD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's on-again, off-again low-cost housing project for the Florida-Utica 
area is now on-again. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week once more approved financing for an apartment 
renovation in the once-crime-ridden area.The council originally had approved 
the plan on April 4, but in an unusual move rescinded that vote on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's turnabout came after Councilman David Sullivan questioned 
financing for the project. Sullivan again voted against the project on Monday 
night, but the other six council members supported the low-cost housing plan, 
saying the financing supported a much-needed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's plan, the private owners of a apartment complex at 725-733 
Utica Ave. will receive a $446,000 forgivable loan. The loan will not have to 
be paid back if the owners rent the apartments only to low-income families for 
the next 30 years. The city also is providing a $100,000 grant for security 
lighting and landscaping in the apartment-complex area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, Mike Adams, the city's director of special 
projects, said that rehabilitation of the run-down apartment complex is a key 
to continuing neighborhood improvement in the areas of Florida Street and Utica 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the Florida-Utica neighborhood had once been a high-crime 
area, with drug dealing among the problems. A police crackdown, coupled with a 
neighborhood task force, has greatly helped the area, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staffers have said rehabilitation of the run-down, aging apartment 
complex at 725-733 Utica Ave. is a key to continued neighborhood improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer on Monday night said he agreed that improvement of the 
apartments is a worthy goal. "This used to be a drug-infested, 
prostitution-infested area," Bauer said. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN SKATING ACROSS STREET STRUCK BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who was skating across Newhope Street was killed Monday night when he 
was struck by a car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Julian Mar Cervantes, 21, was skating in a crosswalk at the 
intersection of Newhope and McFadden Avenue, a block from his home, when the 
accident occurred just after 8 p.m., said Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, an 18-year-old Fountain Valley man, continued northbound on 
Newhope after the collision and crashed into a telephone pole. He suffered 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver was in the left lane, then changed lanes when the traffic in front 
of him stopped, and that's when he struck the pedestrian who was in the 
crosswalk," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car was not cited at the scene but the accident remains 
under investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; NO PROGRESS MADE IN SCHOOL STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a strike by non-teaching employees in the Orange Unified School District 
entered its second day Tuesday, district and union officials appeared to be no 
closer to resolving their differences over a school board-imposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, officials with the California School Employees Assn., which 
represents 1,160 Orange Unified classified employees, estimated that 400 
workers were participating in the strike, but Tuesday they raised that number 
to 600. District officials, however, said 400 is a more accurate figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 2-day-old strike continued to strain the district's resources, 
resulting in another virtual shutdown of its bus and child-care systems. About 
7,000 of the district's 26,000 students depend on bus transportation to get to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 With only special education students receiving bus service during the strike, 
hundreds of frustrated parents were again left to provide school transportation 
for their children, briefly snarling traffic around school campuses in the 
morning and afternoon. Also, more than half of the district's 24 child-care 
facilities closed down and skeletal cafeteria crews scrambled to serve cold 
lunchtime meals to students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is relying heavily upon teachers, administrators and parent 
volunteers to fill service gaps left by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of pickets rallied at district headquarters Tuesday afternoon, 
renewing pledges to stay out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to stay out as long as it takes," said Sandra Thomas, food 
service worker at El Modena High School in Villa Park. "This is our livelihood. 
We aren't asking for anything more, just what we used to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, who have not had a pay raise since 1988, took a 2.59% pay cut 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a school board-imposed contract that cuts health benefits, imposes 
furloughs and empowers the district to lay off workers or reduce their hours 
without notice. The school board said the contract was necessary to keep the 
district solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract saved the district $485,000, helping the district offset a 
$2.2-million shortfall in this year's $107-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials also dug in Tuesday, reiterating their position that 
further contract negotiations are out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two sides are not officially speaking to each other, union officials 
faxed a proposal to the district Tuesday. Union and district officials, 
however, would not comment on its contents. District officials said they will 
meet with members of the Board of Education regarding the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has established a strike hot line for parents to call for 
information. The number is (714) 532-6987. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: 4 HURT IN PILEUP ON SANTA ANA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people were injured Tuesday in a five-car pileup on the northbound Santa 
Ana Freeway near Jamboree Road, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:15 p.m., traffic slowed suddenly, and a 1977 Chevrolet pickup truck 
driven by a 40-year-old San Fernando woman hit the vehicle in front, causing a 
chain reaction of crashes, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people were taken to hospitals with minor to major injuries. Several had 
to be freed with machinery. None of the drivers was cited by officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision caused a 45-minute SigAlert in the northbound lanes.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM HILLS; MAGLICA CASE LAWYERS CONCLUDE ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for an Anaheim Hills woman seeking the largest palimony verdict 
ever urged jurors Tuesday to award Claire Maglica half of a $400 million 
flashlight empire, while the attorney for her former companion called her a 
liar who should get nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The final statements came after more than six weeks of testimony in a case 
brought by Claire Maglica, 60, who shared a home and name with Anthony Maglica, 
64, for more than 20 years, although they never married. An Orange County 
Superior Court jury in Santa Ana is expected to begin deliberations in the case 
today. . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to do justice. Tony should have done it sooner," said Claire's 
attorney, John W. Keker. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintained that Anthony and Claire Maglica vowed repeatedly over their 23 
years together to share everything, including Mag Instrument Inc., the 
flashlight business they built from a hole-in-the-wall machine shop and where 
Claire is executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you do, Tony's going to be a very rich man,' " Keker said. 
"She's asking for half of what they built together, and there's enough money to 
go around." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney contended that even if Claire Maglica did sign a separate 
property agreement in 1977 vowing never to merge their assets, as Anthony 
claims she did, he acted in bad faith by coaxing her to do so without giving 
her a copy, advising her to see a lawyer, or making it clear to her that it 
meant she had no rights to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Without her knowledge, he also prepared a will that granted her much less than 
she said he had repeatedly promised her, Keker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for Anthony Maglica painted a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The oral agreement Claire claims the couple made to "live out of one pocket" 
never existed, and even if it did, it's not an enforceable contract, said 
attorney Dennis M. Wasser. 
</P>
<P>
 To be legally binding, he said, a contract must be specific, with both parties 
sharing a common understanding of the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I say to you, 'I love you and I'll always take care of you,' that is not 
definite enough," Wasser told jurors, referring to words Claire said Anthony 
uttered during a weekend getaway to Palm Springs shortly after they met in 
1971. "Claire and Mr. Keker are asking you to convert words in a motel room 
into a contract and award her millions of dollars. That is not a contract. 
Those are words of love, words of passion. That is pillow talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica contends that she put her faith in an oral agreement they made 
to share everything and that her trust did not erode until she caught Anthony 
trying to put stock in his children's names in January, 1992. She filed her 
lawsuit within two years of that date, beating the statute of limitations for 
breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony is the sole shareholder in Mag Instruments Inc., which is based in 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasser countered that Anthony has always said he wanted total control of his 
company and property, and that Claire should have realized on many occasions 
before 1992 that he had no intentions of splitting the assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasser also urged jurors not to believe Claire Maglica's testimony. In 1987, 
Wasser said, Claire submitted American Express invoices for reimbursement at 
Mag Instrument Inc. that had been altered to dramatically increase the dollar 
amounts. He prodded Claire about the documents when she took the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did something fraudulent and deceitful and she lied to you about it on 
the witness stand," Wasser said. "In order to rule for her, you have to be able 
to believe her story." LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MORE COSTS OKD FOR CLOSURE OF LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved more than $700,000 in additional 
construction and environmental-related costs for the closure of the Coyote 
Canyon landfill, a massive project that has cost the county and other agencies 
more than $11.6 million cost overruns in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more costly additional expenses have been for repairs to drainage 
systems damaged in last winter's rainstorms and for habitat preservation for 
the California gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-acre South County landfill is located in unincorporated area near 
Newport Coast Drive and Bonita Canyon Drive. Work on closing the landfill 
started in 1989 and is expected to be complete by late this month or early 
June. The landfill has not accepted refuse since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, officials have approved 95 cost changes for construction, 
engineering or environmental-related work required for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 About $5 million in additional costs have been approved for the relocation of 
gnatcatcher habitat planned for 100 acres of the closed landfill. The habitat 
plan was approved well before a federal court ruling on Monday removed the 
gnatcatcher from the Interior Department's list of threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles S. Niederman, engineering manager for the county's Integrated Waste 
Management Department, said Tuesday that it wasn't immediately clear how the 
court decision would affect the landfill closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, it might get back on the list," Niederman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the costs for converting landfill acreage to a sanctuary for the tiny 
song bird were to be reimbursed to the county by the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, a local transportation board. Up to 30 pairs of the birds are 
expected to be displaced by the construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of closing the landfill will be about $32 million, officials 
said. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; TERM-LIMITS LAW MEANT AS GUIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have decided to draft an ordinance that would limit their 
terms to eight years despite admitting that such a law could not be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 General-law cities like Tustin cannot adopt an enforceable term-limits law, 
but Councilman Jim Potts said Monday that it will serve as a guideline that 
would be as effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "No incumbent has successfully run for a third term in any general-law city 
that has passed a term-limit ordinance," Potts said. "The beauty is, it gives 
the people the final say." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts is proposing that council members serve two four-year terms, but could 
run again after sitting out for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli said that a term-limit law could backfire 
because Tustin representatives on county boards and commissions would remain 
junior members while those from cities with no term limits will get the 
leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Term limits is a great idea, " Saltarelli said. "It's politically correct and 
a prudent thing to do. (But) we're legislating something that is bad for Tustin 
because many cities have no term limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Saltarelli joined other council members in a unanimous vote directing city 
staff to prepare the term-limits ordinance that will come before the council 
May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, cities with a charter can pass term limits. A general-law 
city, which usually has a small population, does not have a charter that allows 
it to adopt some laws that conflict with state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday also endorsed a resolution supporting state legislation 
that would allow general-law cities to enact term-limit laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to term limits, the council considered drafting an ordinance that 
would require council members not to accept free lunches and such gifts as 
green fees during golf tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael J. Doyle, who promised local political reform during the 
April 12 Tustin municipal election, asked City Manager William A. Huston to 
prepare a comparison between the county's gift-ban ordinance and current city 
laws about accepting gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's necessary to reinvent the wheel," Doyle said. "The 
(current) gift ban does not include the council, only the staff. What is good 
for the goose is good for the gander." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; DEFENSE ATTORNEYS LEFT OUT OF SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a crime summit gets underway today at Cal State Fullerton, guest speakers 
from every aspect of the criminal justice system will be present -- except for 
those who represent the people accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said he believes defense 
attorneys have a unique insight into the causes behind crime in Orange County 
and was surprised to find no one representing the criminal defense bar was 
invited to speak at the Orange County Crime Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think this office would have something to contribute," Butler 
said. "We come in contact on a very personal level with our clients, and 
obviously we get into the cause and effect of crime as well.'  
</P>
<P>
 Lou Scarpino, the conference's coordinator, said there was no slight intended. 
He said the conference could only include a limited number of speakers and 
hoped members of the defense bar would join the audience attending the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said he many people mistakenly believe that defense attorneys do not 
care about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a very erroneous assumption," he said. "I'm very concerned about 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime summit is sponsored by several organizations, including the Cal 
State Fullerton Political Science Students Assn. and the Orange County 
Management Forum. Organizers said they hope to share creative solutions for 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest speakers include Orange County District Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Chief 
Probation Officer Michael Schumacher and several Orange County judges, police 
chiefs and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference begins at 8 a.m. at the Titan Pavilion at the University Center 
on the Fullerton campus.

FUGITIVES WHO SHOT 3 ARE CONVICTED BY JURY; CRIME: INTERRUPTED WHILE PLANNING A 
ROBBERY, THEY WOUNDED A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY, THEN TERRORIZED A NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
HUNTINGTON BEACH.

 Two young men were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a November, 1992, 
shootout that terrorized a Huntington Beach neighborhood and wounded three 
people, including an Orange County sheriff's deputy.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when four men were interrupted by the deputy as they sat in 
a car in the Bolsa Chica Ecological Preserve planning a home-invasion robbery. 
At least two of them opened fire on the deputy, who suffered injuries to an eye 
when the bullets shot out his car's windows, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Randolph 
J. Pawloski. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the Bonnie and Clyde death car," the prosecutor said. "It's a 
miracle no one was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen fled to Huntington Beach, where two of them took refuge in a 
condominium complex, sparking a massive manhunt. One man who resisted turning 
over his car keys to one of the fugitives was shot twice, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury convicted Aerick Bacon, 19, of Huntington 
Beach of several charges, including attempted second-degree murder and assault 
with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors were seeking attempted first-degree murder 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors convicted Keith Gonzalez, 20, of Garden Grove of conspiracy to commit 
robbery, attempted second-degree murder and assault charges but acquitted him 
of attempted first-degree murder and robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Mones, 17, of Huntington Beach committed suicide at the complex rather 
than face arrest. The fourth man, Travis Claude, 20, of Long Beach, pleaded 
guilty and testified at his accomplices' trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's defense attorney did not return phone calls Tuesday. Defense 
attorney Paul Meyer, who defended Bacon along with attorney Edward P. George, 
said jurors had a difficult job deciding an emotional case involving a law 
enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has been a tragedy for all concerned, including not only the young 
man who took his own life and the deputy who suffered the incident, but also 
the families of the three young men involved," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants will be sentenced July 19. Gonzalez faces just over 12 years in 
prison and Bacon faces 21 years in prison, Pawloski said.

DISMAY FOLLOWS CANCELING OF O.C. MARIACHI FESTIVAL; REACTION: LATINO GROUPS SAY 
DECISION SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BASED ON DISTURBANCES THAT MARRED EVENT IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino groups that had looked forward to this month's Mariachi Festival and 
Fair in Orange County expressed disappointment and even anger Tuesday over the 
abrupt cancellation of the event, saying that problems in Los Angeles should 
not ruin their own celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivals West, the group that organized the annual event, said that last 
weekend's violent disturbances at the Fiesta Broadway in Los Angeles forced the 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Palacio, spokesman for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, called the cancellation "premature." 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot allow an isolated incident to determine, or prevent, the 
continuation of a festival that has historically been well received and free of 
any kind of such incidents," Palacio said. "I cannot recall any incidents like 
that spoiling (the festival) in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Florinda Mintz, head of Festivals West, could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday. On Monday, she said in a prepared statement that the cancellation came 
at the request of several corporate sponsors that were pulling out "due to the 
incidents at . . . Fiesta Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen people, including six police officers, were injured Sunday at Fiesta 
Broadway -- the nation's largest Cinco de Mayo celebration -- after police 
clashed with crowds of party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's fifth annual mariachi festival was set to run from this 
Saturday through May 22, with events scheduled in Santa Ana, Fullerton and San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Nativo Lopez, executive director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, said the idea 
of canceling such an important event because of problems in Los Angeles seems 
ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect that the cancellation had more to do with the lack of organization 
by the promoter . . . and (Sunday's disturbance) becomes a simple pretext to 
cancel the event," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Mintz acknowledged that organizing the festival on 
her own was a more daunting task than expected -- especially after a mariachi 
musician who had helped in the past moved out of the area. She was still 
working last week to finalize financial sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kilpatrick, a music teacher at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, 
said his students, many of whom belong to the school's Mariachi Alanos band 
scheduled to perform at the festival, "were very, very disappointed." The 
cancellation could cost the band $650 in donations that it had expected to 
receive during a Fullerton performance this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They work long and hard to put (the music) together and look what happens," 
Kilpatrick said. "I'm upset that a few gang members and difficulties in 
organization at the Broadway celebration will severely cut back our funding. We 
all have to pay for it."

A CRY FOR JUSTICE; WAS THEIR SON A 'PRECIOUS AND INNOCENT HUMAN BEING'? OR A 
GANG MEMBER KILLED BECAUSE HE THREATENED RAPPER SNOOP DOGGY DOGG? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophia Woldemariam sits within view of rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, one of her 
brother's accused murderers. With pen in hand, she documents the March morning 
hearing, her brown eyes darting from lawyer to rapper to Superior Court Judge 
Paul G. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents listen to the stinging claims about their son: the gang member. 
The stalker. The guy with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lies, nothing but lies," is all she says she thinks about as defense 
attorneys talk about Philip Woldemariam, the 20-year-old brother she will 
remember as a young man who fought diabetes, not other young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam was shot dead in Palms' Woodbine Park on Aug. 25, 1993. The rap 
star and two associates face trial on murder charges this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Woldemariam's family say he was a sickly, innocent victim. They 
have filed a $25-million wrongful death suit against the rapper -- real name 
Calvin Broadus -- and Time Warner, whose affiliated record companies released 
"DOGGYSTYLE" last November. 
</P>
<P>
 The album has generated more than $40 million in sales, and the Woldemariams, 
a tightly knit family of Ethiopian emigres, claim Broadus is cashing in on 
publicity associated with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadus' lawyers say Woldemariam was a gun-toting gang member who threatened 
their client and his friends. They assert that the shooting was in 
self-defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Woldemariam dropped out of high school, temporarily lived in 
two foster homes and served time briefly for two gun incidents -- records the 
family says do not tell the full story.  
</P>
<P>
 All the characters are in place, then, for what is likely to be Los Angeles' 
next sensational murder trial -- the international superstar and his fans, the 
grieving family, the high-profile lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, that is, but the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 So as Snoop Doggy Dogg segues from MTV to Court TV, the question arises: Who 
was Philip Woldemariam? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Woldemariam's mother, 51-year-old Kudsan H. Michael, is 
comforted by Sophia, 22, and her sister, Zeman, 30. They console her with 
whispers in Amharic, their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 They recall happier times. Like when Woldemariam was a skinny 5-year-old and 
he and Sophia would sneak into a resort's swimming pool and race each other. 
Philip, known for his spirited independence, always won. 
</P>
<P>
 They remember his love for basketball, especially a challenge against much 
larger players despite his illness, which gave him violent headaches and 
seizures that often immobilized him for up to three days.  
</P>
<P>
 For her parents, Sophia revives the memory of the son who never left home 
without hugging and kissing his mother, the son who crafted wooden jewelry 
boxes and drew calligraphy cards for the small, quiet woman who now finds 
herself taking sedatives to cope with her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam Ghilamariam and his family immigrated in 1979 to the United States 
from Eritrea -- then a region of Ethiopia on the Red Sea -- fleeing a 30-year 
civil war for better opportunities. They settled in Idaho for a year before 
moving to Palms, where they lived for almost nine years before moving to Long 
Beach. Ghilamariam, a Long Beach building contractor, soon started Asmara 
Construction, named for his hometown capital, where he had a similar business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were middle-class Eritreans who enjoyed the best life in my country," says 
Ghilamariam, 54. "When we came here we actually lost that life."  
</P>
<P>
 But Ghilamariam says he has no regrets because the move to America also made 
it possible for his son, who was found to have diabetes at age 5, to receive 
the best medical treatment. He says that when they fled Ethiopia, insulin was 
becoming scarce and health care inferior. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had other dreams for his children: to get the best education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motto in our house," Sophia says, "is 'If you don't have an education, 
you have nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam attended Palms Elementary and Palms Junior High, where his 
interest in basketball began. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved it," says Zeman, adding that her brother gave up soccer for the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got trophies in the sixth and seventh grade for playing," Sophia adds. "He 
was small and skinny, but he played good. He was passionate about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After junior high, Woldemariam went to Hamilton High School, where David 
Uyeshima, Hamilton's head basketball coach, remembers Woldemariam as an 
"average kid you don't have a problem with." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was there for all the practices except for when he got sick. He always 
called when he was sick. If he was a gang member, he wouldn't have done that. 
Gang kids don't come out for athletics," Uyeshima says. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam's family says he dropped out of high school because of health 
reasons. But he didn't remain idle. He helped his father with the family 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam worked at various construction sites in Long Beach and Los 
Angeles, delivering building materials, helping supervise jobs and driving his 
father's truck.

<P>
 Ghilamariam says his son's health greatly improved in the last year after his 
medication was changed. He wasn't falling. He wasn't having headaches. And he 
had gained weight, reaching 115 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And his family says Woldemariam was enthusiastic about returning to school. 
They say he had a plan: move in with his brother, Daniel, 25, in New Mexico, 
enroll at a technical and vocational school where he would earn his general 
equivalency diploma, and go on to college to pursue a dream he had often 
discussed with his mother -- becoming a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before his death, Woldemariam had visited Daniel to prepare for his 
move. While he was there, he celebrated his 20th birthday, one he wouldn't soon 
forget because his brothers surprised him with a white 1978 Buick Regal. The 
brothers drove the car back to Long Beach only days before Woldemariam was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The car remains parked in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the murderers to get what they deserve: the maximum punishment," 
Ghilamariam says. "They murdered a young man whose life was ahead of him, a 
precious and innocent human being." 
</P>
<P>
 All they want, Ghilamariam says, is justice. And not even alleged threats 
against their lives will keep them from seeing that Woldemariam's accused 
murderers get their just due. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last summer, the Woldemariams have attended numerous court hearings. 
Quietly, they sit in a row and listen to the onslaught of allegations against 
Woldemariam. They cry. They shake their heads in disgust.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the room they see their son's alleged murderers: Broadus 
is charged with driving the vehicle from which his bodyguard, McKinley Lee, has 
admitted shooting Woldemariam. Both men and another companion, Shawn Abrams, 
have pleaded not guilty and claim self-defense. Broadus and his co-defendants 
were not available for an interview because of the upcoming trial, their 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghilamariam says each hearing is filled with painful claims about his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives are on hold," says Sophia, who has temporarily dropped out of UCLA. 
Gradually, her father has returned to work. Her brother Yonas, 29, has moved 
home from Oregon to help with the business. Zeman, a registered nurse, works 
sporadically now because she spends time at home caring for her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our country we were seeing children dying from the civil war," Ghilamariam 
says in an interview at his Long Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 But never, he says, did he imagine that one of his children would be murdered. 
Never did he think that his boy's memory would be tarnished as it is now, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy the lawyers are painting is not a member of our family. They are 
saying something entirely different from the nature of Philip's character. 
That's not the Philip that we know," Ghilamariam says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Sophia: "I feel very violated all the time by trying to justify what 
Philip was and what he was not. . . . We're not saying that Philip was an 
angel. He had problems, but who does not have problems?" 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam's troubles with the law go back to 1989, when he was attacked by a 
police dog, according to county medical records. Later that year, behavioral 
problems landed him briefly in two foster homes. In 1990, he was sent to 
Juvenile Hall after run-ins with the law, county records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't really behaving," Zeman says about her brother's detainment in 
foster homes and Juvenile Hall, adding that he was taken out of the family home 
by authorities because he refused to take his medication. Woldemariam's mother 
was living in Northern California and his father was working in Arizona. "We 
were having hard times," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about this time that Woldemariam -- all of 97 pounds on his 5-foot, 
7-inch frame -- was experiencing severe health problems caused by diabetes and 
dropped out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1992, he was arrested for possession of a loaded weapon after 
being caught trying to avoid paying a fare for public transportation. After 
pleading no contest to the charges, he spent two days in jail and was given one 
year of probation.  
</P>
<P>
 According to medical records, Woldemariam also was taken to County-USC Medical 
Center in April, 1992, after being shot in the leg during an altercation at the 
same park where he was killed. An examination at the time indicated that he had 
been shot twice previously, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam's family acknowledges the April, 1992, shooting incident, but says 
Philip was a hero because he was trying to prevent another man from shooting a 
gun where children were playing. "Philip ran to (the man) and held his hand 
down so that the gun would shoot down," Sophia says. Family members say they 
had no knowledge of Woldemariam's earlier two gunshot wounds until authorities 
told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam had been out of jail only a few months on the day he was gunned 
down, according to police records. Besides jail, he received probation for 
discharging a firearm with gross negligence in October, 1992, at Palms Junior 
High School, the records show. His family says that even though they had moved 
away from Palms, Woldemariam frequently returned there to hang out and play 
basketball with his old friends. Broadus moved there last summer to be closer 
to a recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The family strongly contests county records and police reports about 
Woldemariam's actions. "They twist things around. They've been butchering 
Philip," Zeman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Sophia: "Philip is being blamed for dying." 
</P>
<P>
 If her brother should be faulted for anything, Sophia says it should be for 
being at "the wrong place, wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip," Zeman says, "was not street smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Police records also show that Woldemariam was a member of the By Yerself 
Hustlers, a gang founded in Palms, where he grew up. The gang, police say, is 
now based in Miracle Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Philip has been portrayed as a gang member," says Marc Catto, 31, who 
had known him for almost 10 years. Catto and his younger brother used to play 
basketball with Woldemariam at Woodbine Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Philip's group was a group of guys who were friends, who went to school 
together, who kept in contact with each other," says Catto, disputing its 
characterization as a gang. "He wasn't the type of guy who would go out and 
look for trouble. Trouble would find Phil." 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam's family says he wasn't a gang member and refuses to believe that 
he owned a gun, much less injured anyone with one. They say his friends were 
guys he grew up with and with whom he played basketball on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't live two lives," his father says. "Because of his seizures and 
health condition, we were the ones to take care of his bedroom, his closet, to 
sometimes even change his clothes. Where in the world can Philip hide a gun? I 
never saw anything with my own eyes, not even a knife." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you what this has done to my parents and family," Sophia says, 
sitting across from her father. "Nothing can bring Philip back, which is why we 
have decided to take up the lawsuit and fight back. We haven't had time to 
mourn, that's how caught up we have been in all of this. Philip, the victim, 
doesn't have a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia says she and her brother were best friends: "Philip would tell me 
everything." But Philip never got the chance to tell her what happened on Aug. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony given in the Los Angeles County grand jury's 
investigation, which was obtained by The Times, Woldemariam and two friends 
were on their way to the park about 6:30 that evening to eat dinner and buy 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchaum Lee Joseph and Jason London -- Woldemariam's friends since the late 
'80s when they joined the By Yerself Hustlers -- told the grand jury that 
Woldemariam had stashed a loaded handgun in Joseph's car door earlier that 
afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 As the three headed to the park in Joseph's car, Woldemariam demanded that 
Joseph stop in the street after Abrams, who was standing in front of Broadus' 
apartment, and Woldemariam engaged in a gang-related dispute. The three then 
sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told the grand jury that Broadus' Jeep, with Broadus, Lee and Abrams 
inside it, briefly chased Joseph's car. About 20 minutes later, Broadus' Jeep 
showed up at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 More angry words were exchanged between Woldemariam and the men in the Jeep as 
Woldemariam approached the vehicle and opened his shirt displaying a .380 
automatic handgun tucked in his waistband, witnesses testified. Joseph told the 
grand jury that Woldemariam reached for the gun before Broadus' bodyguard fired 
his weapon. One of the bullets entered Woldemariam's back as he ran; he later 
collapsed in an alley. The Jeep sped off.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph and London told the grand jury that they hid Woldemariam's gun before 
police arrived. In August, they originally told detectives that Woldemariam had 
been unarmed. Three months later, the men changed their story during the grand 
jury's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldemariam's family says Joseph and London altered their accounts because 
they were intimidated by gang members associated with Broadus. Police say there 
is no evidence the two were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of what has been said about Philip is high-paid defense attorney talk," 
Sophia says. "Now they are saying that Philip knew (Snoop) and he went and 
threatened him before. We've heard everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The rapper's attorney has told The Times that a month before the fatal 
shooting, Woldemariam had pointed a gun at Broadus when the two crossed paths 
at a gas station a block from the park. The prosecutor says there is no 
evidence to verify the alleged threat, adding that Broadus' lawyer has not 
responded to his requests to provide such verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadus -- who served a brief jail sentence in 1990 for cocaine dealing -- and 
Abrams are listed in police files as members of the Long Beach Insane Crips, 
according to Long Beach police. Broadus -- who last year was arrested for 
possession of marijuana and a concealed weapon -- has said in interviews that 
he stopped associating with the gang in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources have said that Woldemariam and several Palms residents 
resented Broadus and his Long Beach friends for moving into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The family says the accusations simply don't ring true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip is not the villain," Sophia says. "He is the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 While her family is trying to "pick up the pieces" of their lives, Sophia says 
they are angry that "Snoop Doggy Dogg is out there making millions of dollars 
off his gangsta music, cashing in on the notoriety of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her brother was not "some dangerous criminal. Nothing could be 
further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, she says, is that he was "a gentle soul who was ruthlessly shot in 
the back." 
</P>
<P>
 She reaches for photos of him: the little boy in a family portrait that 
couldn't be taken until he had his jockey hat on; a youngster showing off 
cowboy boots, and a kid tumbling in leaves he had just raked at a stable where 
he helped for the chance to ride, groom and feed the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him 'knucklehead,' " Sophia recalls fondly, pointing to the last 
photograph she took of her brother, a month before his death. "He was laying 
there talking to me. I told him to look up," she says holding the picture, 
tears streaming down her cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped for my brother to have everything he ever wanted. Now, one day I'll 
have to tell my children about their uncle in pictures," she says. "That's what 
it means with Philip gone. I lost my history."

FIRST PERSON: '90S FAMILY; DEAR OLD DAD; EVEN WELL PAST AGE 40, A MAN HAS WHAT 
IT TAKES TO FATHER CHILDREN. BUT KEEPING UP WITH THEM? THAT'S A DIFFERENT 
STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The men in my family generally marry late in life. One scurrilous charge is 
that this is because the men in my family generally are afraid of women. But 
let's not get into that. The point is, I was 42 when my first child was born. 
Sarah's 5 now and she has a brother, James, who is 1. I am blessed, no question 
about it. But...Every so often, I receive an unsettling reminder of how late in 
life I got into the fatherhood business. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, in a neighborhood doughnut shop, a woman asked me Sarah's age. When I 
responded, the woman said, "Oh, mine is 6." I remember thinking her response 
odd because she was in her 60s. Then, several weeks later, I picked up some 
pictures of Sarah and James at a photo shop and the clerk said: "Your 
grandchildren are beautiful." It was then I realized that the 60ish woman in 
the doughnut shop also thought I was Grandpappy Steve. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the gradual realization that I'm less active than, say, a 
27-year-old dad. Not that I've been as neglectful as some Hollywood types 
mentioned in one magazine article -- the ones who describe their children as 
"angels" because they see their tots asleep in the morning when they leave for 
work and asleep at night when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 But, unfortunately, I did identify with an older breed of parent criticized by 
child-rearing experts in another article. That's the dad who, upon arriving 
home from work, is asked to play by his frisky kids but tells them, "Not now. 
Daddy's tired. He had a long day at work and wants to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 I worry that if I'd played more ballgames with Sarah, she would have given a 
different answer the other day when I idly asked her to name her favorite 
sport. She said: "I like cheerleaders." And she resumed playing with her 
collection of Barbie dolls, which could fill the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if I were closer in age to my children, I doubt if I'd be mistaken for 
their father by the average stranger. My wife, Tia, is a Chinese-American, 
while I'm a Welsh-English-Scottish-German-French-Dutch-American. Sarah, in 
particular, looks nothing like me, which is a good thing inasmuch as I'm 
red-bearded and bald. 
</P>
<P>
 She and I probably make a bit of an unlikely couple in public, although I 
never realized how unlikely until one visit to our local playground. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fenced, and I let Sarah go in by herself after realizing that I'd left my 
book in the car. I returned a few moments later and plopped down on the park 
bench. I was inconspicuous except perhaps for the fact that I seemed to be 
alone, I was the only adult male present, and I was reading " 'C' is for 
Corpse."  
</P>
<P>
 Sarah, of course, took no notice of my arrival. She has her own idea of 
quality time with Dad: I'm allowed to bring her to the park as long as I don't 
try to talk with her too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, after half an hour on this particular visit, I approached Sarah to 
tell her it was time for kindergarten. She resisted and began shouting her vow 
to stay. Finally, I took her hand and told her that we were leaving. That's 
when a young woman stepped between us and the playground exit, blocking our 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding my eyes, the woman looked at Sarah and asked: "Do you know this man?" 
At this point, I would have accepted the designation of granddad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sarah, after a slight hesitation, answered correctly: "He's my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman accepted Sarah's testimony and, without a word to me, returned to 
her seat on the park bench. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't take murder novels to the playground anymore.

TEEN GUILTY IN TAY MURDER CASE; COURTS: JURY QUICKLY CONVICTS ROBERT CHAN IN 
TRIAL THAT SHOCKED O.C. ANOTHER YOUTH ENTERS A SURPRISE GUILTY PLEA. JURY 
SELECTION STARTS FOR TWO REMAINING DEFENDANTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury took less than three hours Tuesday to find a teen-ager guilty of 
first-degree murder for orchestrating the 1992 New Year's Eve ambush slaying of 
high school honors student Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton, a onetime candidate for valedictorian, now 
faces life in prison without parole for his role in Tay's death. The 
17-year-old Orange resident was beaten with baseball bats, forced to swallow 
rubbing alcohol and then left to die in a shallow grave in a Buena Park back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder and subsequent arrests of Chan and four other high school students 
-- most of them ambitious, college-bound seniors -- shocked Orange County. Two 
of them are awaiting trial, another admitted his guilt earlier and, in a 
surprise move, a fourth teen-ager pleaded guilty Tuesday, just hours before 
Chan's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how fast the verdict took, but there was really nothing to 
decide," said juror Ulla Laing of Huntington Beach. "He got on the witness 
stand and said he did it and he knew what he was doing. It's like the 
prosecutor said -- he convicted himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the Chan case said they agreed with the district attorney's 
contention that Chan sealed his conviction when he testified that he knew the 
killing was wrong, but still joined four other teen-agers in killing Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that Chan masterminded the murder because he believed 
Tay was about to double-cross him in a plan to rob an Anaheim computer parts 
dealer. The plan unraveled when Chan discovered that Tay was lying to him about 
his name, age and background and feared that Tay was a police informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who was described during the trial as a paranoid schizophrenic, denied 
plotting the killing. But he told jurors he assisted in the murder because he 
believed Tay had rigged Chan's home with explosives and was about to kill him 
unless stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But one juror, who spoke only the condition of anonymity, said the jury 
readily rejected Chan's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt that he was the mastermind," the juror said. "He tried to 
lie and blame others for it, but if there was no Robert Chan, Stuart Tay would 
still be alive today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we wanted to give him a break, our conscience wouldn't let us," the 
juror said. "He was not (mentally unstable). He knew what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror said the tragedy of the case was "that two lives of two bright kids 
have been wasted. Tay is dead and Chan is probably going to spend the rest of 
his life in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has gained widespread attention, both as a symbol of juvenile crime 
out of control and because both teen-agers came from seemingly model homes. 
Chan was a top student at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton and his IQ 
hovered near the genius level. Tay, who attended Foothill High School in Santa 
Ana, aspired to become a physician like his father. Tay's mother, Linda, said 
she was grateful that the jury saw through Chan's defense. "I did expect a very 
early verdict because the facts were clear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the best carpenter cannot build a house without wood," she added in 
reference to the prominent Orange County attorney who represented Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's parents were devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say this is a tragedy for everyone," said Tony Chan, a 
Fullerton engineer who said his son bears responsibility in the killing but 
questioned whether he received a fair trial. "I didn't say he's innocent, but a 
lot of things Mr. D.A. says are not correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for Chan is June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 As jurors began deliberating Chan's fate Tuesday, Mun Bong Kang, now 19, 
pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for assisting in the ambush attack. His 
parents had urged the plea, said defense attorney Ronald G. Brower, who 
represents Kang. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to do the honorable thing," Brower said. "They and their son hope 
this act will in some small way convey their true feelings and the shame they 
feel. They pray daily for God to ease the suffering of the Tay family." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary will decided at a later 
date whether Kang, who was a juvenile at the time of the killing, will be 
sentenced to state prison or the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection from a pool of 400 people began Tuesday for the remaining two 
co-defendants: Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Young Kim, 18, of 
Fullerton. Judge O'Leary dismissed the majority of the prospective jurors, 
saying she was concerned that information about the verdict would taint their 
objectivity. The key prosecution witness in Chan's trial was Charles Choe, 18, 
of Fullerton, who admitted participating in the murder but said he did not 
strike Tay. He is cooperating with prosecutors and is expected to be released 
from the California Youth Authority when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told jurors in his closing arguments 
Monday that they could disregard the prosecution's evidence that Chan was the 
ringleader and still find enough evidence from the defendant's own mouth to 
convict him as an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman said outside court that he believes 
Rosenblum's argument was improper, and that it lays the foundation for an 
appeal. Schulman said he also believes the lack of Asians on the grand jury 
that indicted his client will play a role in an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman had asked jurors to convict his client of the lesser charge of 
voluntary manslaughter. He employed a theory of "imperfect self-defense," 
meaning that his client had believed -- wrongly but honestly -- that his life 
was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite juror comments that Chan was his own worst witness, Schulman said he 
had no doubts about putting his client on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only way to present a defense . . . he had to testify to what he 
believed at the time," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also told jurors that some of the blame rested with the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contended that Tay tried to impress his new friends by claiming to 
be a 19-year-old crime figure with dozens of followers and involvement in 
illegal activities, including counterfeiting and weapon sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bragging fed Chan's mental impairment and convinced him he had to kill or 
be killed, Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court Tuesday afternoon, Linda Tay quietly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how Stuart could be responsible for what happened to him," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is bracing for the second trial, which may get underway next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's painful, but it's something I have to do," she said.

WILSON NAMES APPEALS JUDGE TO SUPREME COURT; LAW: KATHRYN WERDEGAR WAS AN AIDE 
TO RETIRED JUSTICE PANELLI. SHE IS A CONSERVATIVE AND A FRIEND OF THE GOVERNOR.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday nominated Kathryn M. Werdegar, an old friend and a 
conservative state appellate judge, to fill a vacancy on the California Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar, 58, has only three years of judicial experience, serving as a Wilson 
appointee on the California Court of Appeal in San Francisco. But she worked 
for six years as a senior attorney for retired Justice Edward Panelli, whose 
seat she will take, and knows the workings of the high court well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I've been exposed perhaps to more appellate opinions and been 
more deeply involved with appellate opinions than perhaps many other justices," 
she said at a news conference with Wilson on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, who is up for reelection, had been under pressure to name a 
minority or a woman. His only other high court appointee, Ronald George, a 
white man, replaced Justice Allen Broussard, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
 If Werdegar is confirmed, the court will have two female justices for the 
first time. The other is Justice Joyce Kennard, who is part Indonesian and the 
only minority now on the court. The first woman appointed to the state high 
court was Rose Bird, who was ousted by voters in 1986 amid controversy over her 
liberal rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates describe Werdegar as extremely bright and hard working, an 
independent conservative who often agonizes over her rulings and whose 
decisions cannot be easily predicted. She also is considered both a good 
researcher and a skilled writer, a combination that many judges lament is too 
often lacking on the appellate bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows how to say no, even in the close quarters of a small appellate 
court where there is quite a bit of built-in pressure to go along," said state 
Court of Appeal Justice Marc Poche, who also serves in San Francisco. "She is 
not the sort of person who is going to be pushed around by lawyers or judges or 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court is dominated by conservatives who tend to vote 
alike. They affirm more death penalty cases than any other state supreme court 
in the country and tend to favor insurance companies and other businesses in 
their civil rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Judicial Appointments is expected to confirm Werdegar within 
the next several weeks. She must ultimately be approved by voters on the 
statewide ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he thought Werdegar's appointment would help him against 
Democratic front-runner Kathleen Brown, Wilson said: "I hope so. That's not why 
I did it, but that certainly is a fringe benefit I would desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Werdegar have been friends since they were law students at UC 
Berkeley, and she has contributed a total of $3,500 to his campaigns over the 
years. Knowing her personally was comforting in making the nomination, Wilson 
said, but their friendship was not the determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important is the nominee's qualifications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar does not espouse judicial activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to characterize my judicial philosophy," she said, "I would say that 
I firmly believe in the concept of restraint. I believe it is the role of the 
courts to interpret the laws as written and to leave the Legislature the 
responsibility to create the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar, a third-generation San Franciscan, formerly served as associate dean 
and professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and as a senior 
staff attorney in the Court of Appeal for about five years before her work for 
Panelli. Panelli liked her so much that he singled her out as a possible 
replacement when he announced his retirement in September. 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated first in her class from law school, became the first woman to be 
named editor of the law review at UC Berkeley and has written a book about 
criminal law procedure. On criminal matters, Werdegar has ruled for both 
prosecutors and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am cautiously optimistic she will be a good justice for the prosecution," 
said Edward W. Hunt, president of the California District Attorneys Assn. "I 
don't have any reason to believe she will not be." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, an association of criminal 
defense attorneys, has not yet decided whether to take a position on her 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 But James Thomson, who is president of the group, said he fears Werdegar may 
follow in the footsteps of Panelli, who Thomson said cared too little about 
individuals' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Werdegar has ruled for the defense in some criminal cases, Thomson 
said those decisions were compelled by the law and would not even seem striking 
if it were not for the strongly conservative bent of California's current crop 
of appellate judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we may be in a period of time where standing up for reasonable doubt 
instruction seems to be courageous, the history of California jurisprudence has 
always demanded that instruction," the Sacramento defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defense attorney Dennis Riordan noted that Werdegar was the lead 
judge in a decision involving a murder case that infuriated the defense bar and 
prompted law school professors to write the court demanding reconsideration. 
Werdegar and her fellow panelists upheld a murder conviction even though the 
judge had failed to instruct the jury properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the uproar, Werdegar and the other judges reconsidered the case and 
reversed themselves. They held that the defendant should have a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that suggests to me is she is actually somebody who is affected by legal 
reasoning and is concerned about the state of the law," Riordan said. "She does 
at some level try to work from the law to the result -- as opposed to from the 
result backwards to the law. That is a refreshing change from the person she 
will succeed on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts said her lack of lengthy judicial experience will be overcome by 
her many years as a staff attorney on appellate courts. But one appellate 
judge, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said her lack of trial 
experience could be a drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial judges are down there looking at cases and making decisions very, very 
quickly," said the source. "They don't have time to back and research 
everything. I think missing that (experience) may be a detriment. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said Werdegar often asks questions to try to understand the 
experiences of trial judges. "So I think she has the right instincts," the 
judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar is soft-spoken, intense and at times shy, associates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were sitting at a table with her and her husband and another couple," 
said Court of Appeal Justice Poche, "and you didn't know what her education was 
or what she did for a living . . . it would take some time to dig that out. She 
would not be like some lawyers or judges who have to right away establish their 
educational expertise and place in the hierarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said Werdegar may follow the path of Justice Kennard, who was 
considered a conservative when former Gov. George Deukmejian appointed her but 
now often votes against the conservative majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the kind of judge who will grow," Poche said of Werdegar. "Maybe that 
means she goes to the left, maybe to the right. I don't know. But I don't have 
any doubt that she will be very independent." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Stanley Mosk, the only liberal on the high court, praised Werdegar as 
a "mature person who appears to be very thoughtful." He said he has admired 
some of her opinions on the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Justice Panelli praised his protege. "She is an intelligent, 
hard-working, independent and fair-minded jurist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerald Uelmen, dean of the University of Santa Clara law school, lamented 
Wilson's failure to appoint a minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly shows he is not as concerned as he should be about the issue of 
ethnic diversity," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen called Werdegar the most conservative of the finalists for the job, who 
included a Latino, an African American and a Chinese American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she will just fit in right where Panelli was, with a very low dissent 
rate," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also interviewed California Court of Appeal Justice Ming Chin, who was 
widely regarded as a favorite for the job. Chin, who serves on the same panel 
as Werdegar, praised her as "a real joy to work with -- bright and 
industrious." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson predicted that Werdegar will become a leader on the court "because I 
think she has the collegial personality to develop consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a brilliant legal scholar," he said. "She enjoys an extraordinary 
ability -- a very rare one -- to make complex subjects clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had been criticized for taking so long to name a new justice. Panelli 
told Wilson in early September that he was going to retire and stepped down 
Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen called Werdegar's confirmation by the Commission on Judicial 
Appointments a "foregone conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope they would conduct (a hearing) just as quickly as possible," he 
said. "I think she is badly needed in terms of the court keeping up with its 
caseload."

SINGAPORE REDUCES CANING SENTENCE OF U.S. TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government said today that there is no reason to grant clemency to an 
American teen-ager sentenced to a flogging for spray-painting cars, but it 
announced that the punishment of six strokes of the rattan cane has been 
reduced to four as a "gesture" to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 A government statement said the Cabinet had reviewed the clemency appeal filed 
by lawyers for Michael P. Fay, 18, and "found no special circumstances which 
justify commuting the sentence of caning." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, who is living in Singapore with his mother 
and stepfather, pleaded guilty in March to two counts of vandalism, two counts 
of mischief and possessing stolen property. He was sentenced to the caning, as 
well as four months in jail and a $2,230 fine. He is serving his sentence in 
Singapore's Queenway Remand prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's father, George Fay, said in a telephone interview from Ohio that while 
four strokes of the rattan cane is obviously better than six, he doubted that 
the decision will help mitigate the damage to Singapore's image caused by the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lame attempt to somehow pacify the United States and enforce what I 
believe to be unacceptable punishment for a crime not committed," Fay said. 
"I'm more furious than I was before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore statement said the government could not exempt Fay from the 
caning "without undermining its ability to enforce future caning ordered by the 
Courts." 
</P>
<P>
 But the statement said Singapore values good relations with the United States 
and especially America's economic and security role in the region. It praised 
Clinton, who has appealed for clemency, for saying that Americans overseas must 
respect the laws of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To reject his appeal totally would show an unhelpful disregard for the 
President and the domestic pressures on him on this issue," the unusual 
government statement said. "Therefore, even though the Cabinet found no merit 
in Fay's petition, it sought a way to accommodate President Clinton's appeal 
without compromising the principle that persons convicted of vandalism must be 
caned." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement means that the caning can now take place at any time. The 
government issued a statement Tuesday night saying that prisoners are given no 
advance notice when the punishment will be carried out and are informed only on 
the morning of the caning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's family, supported by the U.S. government, sought clemency on the grounds 
that he is young and a first-time offender. The family also argued that he 
suffers from a neurological disorder called attention deficit disorder, which 
could lead to severe problems, possibly suicide, if the caning is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 It also maintained that Fay was singled out because he is an American, since 
the punishment has never been applied in a case of damage to private property. 
Fay's family also maintains that he and a number of other youths arrested in 
the case were coerced into confessing their involvement by being slapped, 
punched and mistreated by police. The government has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to play down the effects of the flogging, the government released 
a statement Sunday saying that caning "does not cause 'skin and flesh to fly' 
as alleged by critics." It conceded, however, that it causes "bruises and 
marks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fay case has become an international sensation, dominating talk shows and 
editorial pages. Many Americans frustrated by crime in the United States have 
written in support of the sentence, while some commentators have likened the 
punishment to torture. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement today is clearly an effort to back away from a confrontation 
with the United States over the Fay case, although it is unclear if it will 
succeed in appeasing many critics of the system here. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech today, Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar said the issue is not 
the caning but a broader one, "whether a country should not respect the right 
of another country to enact and enforce its laws within its jurisdiction, even 
though one may disagree with that law, so long as such law is applied without 
discrimination and after due process of law."

MAY USE FORCE, CLINTON TELLS HAITI; CARIBBEAN: THE PRESIDENT WILL CONSIDER 
MILITARY ACTION IF STEPPED-UP SANCTIONS FAIL TO TOPPLE THE JUNTA, OFFICIALS 
SAY. SEN. MITCHELL EXPRESSES DOUBTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton warned Haiti's military leaders Tuesday that his patience 
"has run out" and he no longer will rule out the use of U.S. military force to 
drive them from power. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of saber-rattling apparently intended to increase pressure on the 
Haitian regime, White House officials told reporters that Clinton is willing to 
consider a U.S. attack to topple the junta if stepped-up economic sanctions 
fail to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 No military action has been approved or planned, aides added. But even their 
guarded talk of military action as a possible option caused alarm among some in 
Congress and in the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing our best to avoid dealing with the military option," Clinton 
said in an appearance at a televised conference here sponsored by Cable News 
Network. "We have not decided to use force -- all I am saying is, we cannot 
afford to rule it out any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether his patience with the stalemate in Haiti had run out, the 
President replied, "It has run out -- and maybe we have let it run on a little 
too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a White House official underscored the shift in the U.S. posture, 
saying, "What has changed is . . . our willingness to put it (military action) 
in the option category where we weren't talking about it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in Congress and the Pentagon was sharp. Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), usually a stalwart presidential ally, quickly said 
military action in Haiti would be "neither wise nor prudent." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pentagon, where Defense Secretary William J. Perry publicly has 
dismissed the idea of military intervention in Haiti, a senior officer called 
it "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials spent much of the day scrambling to squelch reports that 
Clinton was planning an immediate military move -- while still seeking to 
convey the more subtle message that the President might consider such action 
later. "The President hasn't made a decision. It doesn't mean planning has been 
stepped up. He has not threatened military action," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a closed briefing for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Deputy National Security Adviser Samuel 
R. Berger said the Administration hopes that new sanctions against Haiti will 
compel the military regime to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They outlined a series of options to us," said Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), 
the committee's chairman. "Nothing has been ruled out, but no plans have been 
made for the use of force as of now." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's military seized power in 1991, overthrowing the island republic's 
first elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who now lives in exile in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 After abortive attempts to negotiate a compromise between Aristide and the 
military, a wave of gruesome murders of Aristide supporters in Haiti and 
increasing complaints from liberal Democrats in Congress, Clinton has returned 
to a policy of increasing pressure on the regime in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the policy focuses on a proposal for a total trade embargo 
presented to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people now in charge of Haiti have thwarted democracy," Clinton said in 
his appearance on CNN, "and it is wrong and we've go to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration aides acknowledged that the trade embargo may not force the 
military regime from power and that they are looking for other means to 
increase the pressure. "Diplomacy clearly is not working," one aide complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the prospect of military action in Haiti, Clinton said, "We have 
intervened in the past; it hasn't worked out very well." He added, "But this is 
an unusual and in some ways unprecedented circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said contingency plans have been prepared for several 
possible military actions in Haiti. But they described them as normal planning 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan envisions deploying a brigade of light infantry troops to Haiti to 
take over the island, much as U.S. forces invaded Grenada and Panama in the 
1980s. Such an operation could involve Army paratroopers and Marines -- either 
taking off by helicopter from Navy aircraft carriers or making an amphibious 
landing of their own -- backed by tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Military analysts said there is little doubt that even a modest-size U.S. 
force could easily defeat the tiny, poorly equipped Haitian army, which numbers 
about 7,000 troops, has no tanks and commands only a handful of Bradley 
fighting vehicles and guns. But they said the United States could risk serious 
casualties if a substantial part of Haiti's civilian population opposed U.S. 
troops by waging guerrilla warfare or house-to-house fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has long opposed any new military action in Haiti. Perry told The 
Times earlier this week that he feared that U.S. military action in Haiti could 
leave the United States embroiled there for months. "After we've done that, 
what is Act II?" he asked. "Could we . . . stabilize the situation there and . 
. . reinstall democratic government?" 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Clinton and aides have considered reviving an 
earlier plan to send U.S. military trainers to Haiti. But they called that a 
separate issue from the military intervention option. The trainers would go to 
Haiti only if the military regime quit or opted for a compromise that would 
invite Americans in peacefully, officials said. "You wouldn't send them 
(trainers) to fight their way in," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy amphibious landing ship, the Harlan County, tried to land U.S. military 
engineers in Haiti last year but turned back after pro-regime thugs gathered on 
the dock and threatened to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, Ambassador Madeleine Albright introduced a Security 
Council resolution that she said would put "a sanctions noose around the 
Haitian military." It would clamp a total trade embargo on Haiti -- except for 
food and medicine -- and would authorize any U.N. member to set up a naval 
blockade to inspect ships coming into and out of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution would ban all travel out of the country by Haitian military and 
police officers and their families. Governments would be asked to freeze all 
international financial holdings of these Haitians. All planes would be 
prohibited from landing and taking off from Haiti unless they were regularly 
scheduled commercial airliners.

RAMS TAKE FORMAL STEP TOWARD LEAVING ANAHEIM; FOOTBALL: THE TEAM GIVES NOTICE 
OF INTENT TO MOVE BUT HAS 15 MONTHS TO DECIDE. SEVERAL CITIES ARE INTERESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that may strip Orange County of its professional football team and 
diminish its growing reputation as a thriving sports market, the Los Angeles 
Rams on Tuesday took the first formal step toward moving from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams hand-delivered a letter of intent and a $2-million non-refundable 
check to City Hall in the morning, exercising a 15-month escape clause in their 
30-year stadium lease. The Rams have until Aug. 3, 1995, to let the city know 
whether they are staying, although the team is supposed to inform the National 
Football League of its intentions by next February. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, they are free to shop the team to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials both expected and dreaded the notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day," Councilman Bob D. Simpson said. "I had hoped against hope 
that this would not happen, but it did. . . . It almost has an air of finality 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The team may stay in Anaheim if it cannot find a more profitable location. But 
many Anaheim officials say they are unable to compete financially with offers 
from other areas in the country and fully expect this to be the team's last 
season here. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities are courting the Rams, and Tuesday's action is expected to 
ignite a flurry of competition. Baltimore, St. Louis, San Antonio, Hartford, 
Conn., and Memphis, Tenn., are the most frequently mentioned suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore reportedly is willing to use lottery money to build a 
state-of-the-art stadium and rent it to a team for $1 a game. The Rams would 
receive all revenue from parking, concessions and luxury seats. In Anaheim, the 
team splits such revenues with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer said Tuesday's official notice opens the 
way for Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos to lure the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter has been pursuing this very persistently. He knew the Rams were going 
to make a move today. He could do nothing until after that was formalized," 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos was unavailable for comment Tuesday, but Monday he said he would 
"aggressively move forward" to procure a team. Sources familiar with his plans 
say he has offered to buy a significant minority share, allowing Rams owner 
Georgia Frontiere to retain control and receive an immediate infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who is spearheading Hartford's attempt 
to attract an NFL team, is planning to visit Los Angeles next week to meet with 
officials from both the Rams and the Los Angeles Raiders, according to a report 
in Tuesday's Hartford Courant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials, who announced in February that the team would become a free 
agent by activating the escape clause, issued a brief statement Tuesday, saying 
they have not started talks with other cities and have made no decision to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will play all of its 1994 home games at Anaheim Stadium and can 
revoke its notice at any time, team officials added. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, the Rams' executive vice president who is heading the relocation 
efforts, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This notice has been anticipated for some time and therefore comes as no 
surprise to us," said Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth in a prepared release. 
"The city remains open and responsive to exploring options that would keep the 
Rams in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were lured here from Los Angeles in 1980 with promises of a better 
facility than the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, better financial opportunities 
and more fans. Although the team prospered in Anaheim through most of the 
1980s, it has struggled in the 1990s. Over the past four years, the team has 
suffered consecutive losing seasons and sagging attendance. The team reported 
that season ticket sales were off 40% over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last football season, the Rams said openly that opportunities to 
earn more money are limited by their lease in Anaheim and the lack of passion 
in Southern California sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials believe the market is ripe and that football interest in other 
cities, including some that failed to land expansion franchises last year, 
gives them a window of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Rams and Anaheim officials acknowledge that their 14-year 
partnership has been deeply troubled at times. As recently as two weeks ago, 
the team faced eviction from its practice facility over a dispute with the city 
and the school district that owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' escape clause, in fact, arose out of a dispute between the team and 
the city. Anaheim created the clause in the lease in 1990 in exchange for the 
team's dropping a lawsuit it had filed to block or delay construction of the 
city-owned arena, the Pond of Anaheim. The Rams agreed, should they move, to 
pay off all the debt on stadium improvements made by the city since 1980 to 
accommodate the team. 
</P>
<P>
 That payment would be $28.1 million. The $2-million check the franchise gave 
the city Tuesday goes toward that debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Rams would have to pay off the stadium debt, city officials 
contend that the financial impact, if the team leaves, would be minimal. But 
local restaurants and hotels have said they will suffer from the loss of eight 
Ram home games, plus exhibitions, each season. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics aside, city officials say the Rams' departure would affect the 
reputation of Anaheim and Orange County in the sports world, which has boomed 
this past year with response to Anaheim's Mighty Ducks hockey franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't keep the Rams, who's going to want to come here?" Councilman 
Simpson said. Anaheim also is home to the California Angels baseball team, and 
the city is trying to lure a professional basketball team to the Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, have not given up on the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly has been meeting with county and business officials to 
enlist their financial support. He also has proposed building a massive retail 
complex near the stadium that would link it with the city's other tourist 
attractions, especially Disneyland, and possibly building a new football 
stadium. But the plans have received little support. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams do leave next year, city officials said they will seek another NFL 
franchise. The city will also attempt to fill the stadium dates left vacant 
with other sports, such as motocross, and concerts.

BUSINESS GROUP BACKS CLINTON'S HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new coalition of small businesses, claiming membership of 340,000 employers, 
announced support for President Clinton's health reform plan Tuesday, stressing 
that private entrepreneurs are not united in opposition to a requirement that 
all businesses provide insurance to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's support is significant because it exposes the first major 
split in small business opposition to the reform package and suggests that 
employers are responding to efforts in Congress to revise the President's plan 
to make it less onerous to small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton and his congressional allies can effectively tap into this 
wellspring of support, the chances of comprehensive health care reform this 
year may be significantly enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is expected to get another boost today when the 
Congressional Budget Office releases its long-awaited analysis of a rival 
health reform plan introduced by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Small Business Committee, 
said of the new small business coalition: "A very sizable segment of the small 
business community has seen the light." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Peck, a coalition spokesman, told a Capitol Hill press conference: "The 
coalition came together not because we are 100% behind every clause of 
President Clinton's proposal but because we recognize that the train is leaving 
the station." Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), House Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and several committee chairmen attended the 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The small business community has hardly been monolithic in its opposition to 
Clinton's plan -- it is divided, as is big business. But the highly organized 
National Federation of Independent Business has effectively dominated the 
debate with its high-decibel opposition to the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here today to state clearly and strongly that the impression created 
by the NFIB is wrong," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 That many small businesses back Clinton's initiative is "one of Washington's 
best kept secrets," he added. The coalition represents more than 3.2 million 
workers, and includes such organizations as the National Assn. of Chain Drug 
Stores, the National Farmers' Union and the National Council of Non-Profit 
Assns., according to Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFIB, however, said that the coalition's members favor the reforms because 
they are ill-informed. "There's a lot of small businesses out there who support 
the Clinton plan. But those are small businesses that don't know much about 
it," said Terry Hill, a spokesman for the NFIB, whose 600,000 members employ 
between 7 million and 9 million workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they look at the details and see what it's going to cost them, we 
believe they will not support it," Hill added. 
</P>
<P>
 But many coalition members claimed just the opposite, saying that their health 
spending would drop if Clinton's plan were enacted because of its limits on how 
much any employer must pay in employee premiums and because of subsidies for 
small firms with low-wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would require firms to pay at least 80% of the insurance premiums for 
full-time workers, with the employee paying the rest. But no firm would have to 
pay more than 7.9% of its payroll, while some small businesses would pay as 
little as 3.5% of payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caps are a boon to small businesses," said Peck, group vice president for 
government affairs of the American Institute of Architects. He said that 70% of 
small businesses already provide some insurance for workers, with many spending 
13.5% or more of payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck also pointed out that small businesses, as individuals and small-group 
insurance buyers, pay as much as 40% more than large businesses for the same 
coverage. Clinton's plan would group all but the largest employers into 
purchasing cooperatives that can command lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small businesses know that the current system is stacked against them. While 
many provide coverage, they often do so at higher rates," said Lorrie McHugh, a 
spokeswoman for the White House, which arranged a Tuesday meeting for coalition 
members with Vice President Al Gore and other senior Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO has concluded that Cooper's plan -- similar to Clinton's but with far 
less direct government involvement -- would cost $189 billion more over five 
years than Cooper has calculated, congressional sources said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The only ways to make up for that shortfall, the agency said, would be to cut 
other government programs, raise taxes or increase the federal deficit, 
according to sources who were given summaries of the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the added cost, Cooper's plan would leave as many as 25 million 
Americans still uninsured -- out of an estimated 38 million persons now lacking 
medical coverage, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Clinton's plan, Cooper's proposal would require employers only to offer 
employees a health plan but not to pay for it. Cooper also supports the notion 
of a basic benefits package but he does not spell out what would be in it.

PLAN OUTLINED TO SHIFT AIR TRAFFIC TO CORPORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration officially presented its proposal Tuesday to 
improve the long-troubled federal air traffic control system by turning it over 
to a new government corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration argues that shifting the system from the Federal Aviation 
Administration to a corporation would speed modernization of a network that 
uses decades-old equipment to oversee the takeoffs, landings and flight 
patterns of 22,000 commercial aircraft each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to serve notice that we mean business on this," Vice President Al Gore 
said after viewing the 1960s-era refrigerator-sized computers in the control 
tower at Washington National Airport. "We shouldn't wait until the system 
collapses." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore and other officials said that creating a government corporation would 
free the air traffic system from Byzantine procurement regulations, cumbersome 
personnel procedures and restrictions on long-term financing that hamper the 
FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics, however, pointed to other quasi-government agencies -- including the 
U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak -- as proof that merely appointing a chief 
executive officer and a board of directors will not be a magic bullet. They 
argued that the current system is the world's safest and worry that removing 
congressional oversight could endanger that record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid the Administration has developed a solution in search of a 
problem," said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Public 
Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee. Oberstar said that he fears 
"the White House is moving full speed toward a major reorganization of a 
federal agency that has served its primary mission -- aviation safety -- 
extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed similar misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Super technology cannot fix everything," said Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.), 
chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation aviation 
subcommittee. "And a good example is the state-of-the-art (Denver) airport, 
which has delayed openings because a computer baggage system doesn't function. 
It's one thing to lose bags under a new computerized system but a far different 
thing to risk the flying public's safety with the uncertainty of a new and 
untested corporation," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberstar voiced many questions about the proposal. "How can we be sure that 
the FAA's outstanding safety record will continue under the new corporation? 
How will it be funded and how much influence will the airlines exercise in its 
operation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said he believes that he has answers 
for all Oberstar's questions and hopes to smooth over any misgivings that 
members of Congress may have before he proposes legislation later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials stressed that concern for the safety of air travelers 
is not the prime motivation for creating the government corporation, 
considering that the nation's air traffic control system is indisputably the 
world's safest. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons most frequently cited for the overhaul include saving the airlines 
some of the estimated $2 billion they lose each year from delays caused by the 
current system, cutting the high costs of running outdated machinery and 
preventing potential safety hazards as airways become more crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of how difficult it is for the FAA to equip control towers with the 
latest technology is the multibillion-dollar computer system known as the 
Advanced Automation System. Because of countless snafus and government 
requirements, the project already has cost overruns of $2 billion and 
installation has been delayed at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to turn the air traffic system over to a government corporation 
is part of the Administration's "reinventing government" campaign, the purpose 
of which is to cut red tape and improve efficiency of federal agencies. As with 
much of that campaign, revisions of the air traffic system would not be felt 
until long after President Clinton's current term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, two dozen attempts to reform the FAA have failed, 
proving that propelling the nation's air traffic control services into the 21st 
Century "cannot be done by simple internal reform of the FAA," Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan establishes the nonprofit Air Traffic Services 
Corp., which would be funded by the fees that travelers pay to the airlines. 
Some 38,000 of the FAA's 52,000 employees would be transferred to the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation would operate under an 11-person board, including the 
secretaries of transportation and defense, and would have representatives from 
airlines, non-commercial aircraft users and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena stressed that the corporation would run like a business, able to buy 
equipment off the shelf instead of submitting to the layers of acquisition 
procedures set up by Congress. Staffing problems would be relieved because 
incentives could be offered to employees who agree to move to hard-to-fill 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is not a new one. Various studies over the last 10 years have 
suggested such steps for improving air traffic control. Such an approach 
already has been tried by other countries, including Britain and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA would continue to exercise safety oversight of the corporation. The 
federal government also would have the power to take over the system if the 
corporation were to fail in its mission, Pena stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines and the air traffic controllers' union have expressed support. But 
the National Transportation Assn., which represents small and medium-sized 
aviation businesses and private pilots, has voiced opposition, saying that the 
Administration's goals could not be accomplished without increasing costs that 
would be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, Gore and Pena cited the use of vacuum tubes from the 
1950s-era radar system in use at Los Angeles International Airport as an 
example of antiquated technology. Holding up such a tube, Gore said that its 
continued use -- it is "only made in former Communist countries that are way 
behind the curve" -- speaks to "the strength of the resistance to change in 
this particular area." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stressed that the Administration is not about to abandon its commitment 
to overhaul the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict for you that (the proposal) is going to pass in spite of the 
opposition," Gore said.

RABIN, ARAFAT OK ACCORD FOR SIGNING TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat locked themselves in a marathon negotiating session in 
an Egyptian presidential palace, emerging early today with a final accord on 
Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled signing of that agreement, at a ceremony today to be attended by 
nearly 2,500 dignitaries and senior officials from 54 nations, marks the 
Palestinian people's first step toward autonomy after almost 27 years of 
occupation. It is, analysts say, the greatest gesture Israel has made toward 
peace with its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rabin and Arafat flew to the Egyptian capital for a last-minute 
summit as negotiating teams worked furiously at a hotel to draft the final 
accord, a 200-plus-page document under which a Palestinian Authority will 
become the new government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho. 
Israeli troops, meantime, will launch their first withdrawal from Palestinian 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher sat down with the two leaders under the 
stewardship of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a last attempt to reach 
compromises on fundamental issues that have held up an agreement: the size of 
the Palestinian enclave at Jericho and whether a Palestinian border guard will 
be present on the bridge that marks the international boundary between Jordan 
and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel quite confident, although there are some issues that remain to be 
decided, that there will be a signing ceremony tomorrow," Christopher told 
reporters before joining the two Middle East leaders at Cairo's Itthadiya 
Palace. "I'll be there to help keep the parties on track, to help them identify 
the open issues. Of course, this is for the parties to resolve on their own. . 
. . The parties have spent a lot of time with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official, recalling the breakthrough the two sides made in 
secret talks in Norway last summer, added: "The Israelis and Palestinians want 
to do it themselves, as they did in Oslo. But they may at the end need a push." 
</P>
<P>
 The prodding produced results shortly after 2 this morning, when, after 
separate and joint meetings with Mubarak and Christopher, the two sides sat 
down for a long session that resulted in a final agreement. Its details were 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, who looked exhausted but 
elated as he left the palace, announced: "The negotiations are over, and we are 
going to write down what we agreed upon. . . . We've reached agreement on all 
the points." 
</P>
<P>
 Final drafting was expected to continue through the night, but Shaath said the 
accord between Arafat and Rabin represented a historic step. "It is the first 
time in history that the Palestinian people will have their chance to rule 
themselves on their own land," he said. "This is not all that we want, but it 
is a beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Discord between the two leaders on several points dragged the discussions out 
over nearly eight hours. Arafat had been visibly irritated as he left his 
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, accusing the Israelis of backtracking on 
previous items of accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources said he was angry at Rabin's reluctance to approve the 
issuance of Palestinian postage stamps. He was also upset that the Israelis 
balked at allowing him the Arabic title rais -- meaning either president or 
chairman -- as head of the new Palestinian Authority. "The Israelis are 
backtracking. They are procrastinating in order not to implement many 
agreements we reached," Arafat told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources said Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the chief Israeli negotiator, 
returned from consultations in Israel over the weekend with two dozen proposed 
changes to the accord, including the issue of the stamps, prompting rumors that 
Arafat was refusing to board the plane for Cairo. "The Israelis are retracting 
on what has been agreed upon. That is why the atmosphere is uncomfortable," 
Palestinian negotiator Jamil Tarifi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the issue of the size of Jericho and the presence of a Palestinian 
border guard, Rabin and Arafat were seeking to agree finally on the release of 
thousands more Palestinian prisoners; Israel has agreed to free 5,000 within 
the first two weeks of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, in general, has agreed to free those prisoners who say they will 
support the peace process. But Palestinians have pushed, as much as possible, 
to include prisoners from the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas and other 
opposition groups in a bid to elicit their support once the Palestinian 
Authority takes power. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft of the final agreement, obtained earlier Tuesday by The Times, sets up 
a schedule of Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho over the next 
three weeks. A new, 9,000-member Palestinian police force will assume 
responsibility for "public order and internal security" while Israel maintains 
its responsibility for protecting international borders and defending against 
external threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement says the Palestinian Authority, headed by Arafat, should take 
"all measures necessary" to prevent crime and terrorism and to prevent hostile 
acts directed at Israeli settlements and military installations remaining in 
Palestinian enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel retains the right to return its troops to the Palestinian enclaves in 
the event of "an outbreak of general hostilities" or in cases where the 
Palestinian Authority is unable to prevent attacks against Israeli settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft also establishes terms of a new international presence in Gaza and 
Jericho, in addition to the 160-member international observer force already 
agreed on in Hebron in the wake of the Feb. 25 killing there of about 30 
Palestinians by a Jewish settler. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the framework of the accord over the weekend, Shaath said the 
agreement will open a vista of possibilities and freedom for Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all must see that the road to peace is being opened, and the Palestinian 
people will see the fruits immediately. I can say now without any reservation 
that we have a good agreement, a good agreement for the Palestinians, a good 
agreement for the Israelis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment we sign this agreement, the next day and for a week, 6,000 
Palestinian police will go in, 5,000 prisoners will be released in two groups, 
people will start seeing Palestinian ports, airports, television stations, 
radio stations, economic institutions, their own electricity, their own 
telephones, their own government, their own passports. . . . People will start 
seeing for the first time a real opportunity to develop their own future," 
Shaath said.

HUFFINGTON DRAWS FIRE, BUT HE'S PROUD OF SLIM RECORD; POLITICS: SELF-STYLED 
RENEGADE SAYS HE'D HAVE MORE INFLUENCE AS A SENATOR. FOES LABEL HIM A 
DO-NOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Michael Huffington vowed that he would become a different kind of congressman 
when he spent a record $5.2 million of his own money in 1992 to capture a 
California House seat. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 months in office, there is little doubt that he has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-styled political renegade, Huffington points with pride to an unusual 
record of accomplishment: He has offered only one original bill and no 
amendments to legislation, refused to pursue all but a few federal projects for 
his Santa Barbara-area district, called for eliminating one of the two 
committees of which he is a member and frequently criticized his colleagues for 
excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come here to be an activist in terms of promoting and passing 
legislation," Huffington said during a series of interviews. "People want to 
get rid of some of those old bills. They want spending to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 The same record is used by critics to portray Huffington as a do-nothing 
legislator who has been ineffective at representing the interests of his 
constituents. They say Huffington revealed his true ambitions last fall when he 
announced plans to run for the Senate only nine months and nine days into his 
first term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so fed up with him and the way he has treated this district," said Bill 
Snelling, a retired Republican who serves as chairman of a private consortium 
that is building a commercial space center in Huffington's district. "He's 
another Kennedy as far as I'm concerned. He's got everything money can buy. 
He's out to buy power." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 46, prefers to compare himself to the mythical public servant 
played by Jimmy Stewart in the 1939 Academy Award-winning film "Mr. Smith Goes 
to Washington." He acknowledges that he may be every bit as naive as the 
Stewart character as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arriving on Capitol Hill last year, Huffington admits, he had little 
notion of how the House operated. He presumed that he could walk onto the House 
floor, raise his hand and offer amendments to pending legislation. Little did 
he understand that restrictive rules in the 435-member House afford no such 
flexibility to most legislators, let alone a freshman member of the minority 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize how bad it was," Huffington said. "I want to stand up there 
and passionately say I've got something I want to get done. And I can't do that 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says this is one reason he is seeking a seat in the Senate, where 
rules give each of the 100 members more influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's current congressional performance offers a stark contrast to the 
record established by his opponent in the primary, former Orange County 
congressman William E. Dannemeyer, during seven terms in the House. The winner 
of the June 7 Republican primary will face the Democratic incumbent, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's unyielding conservatism rarely left any doubt where he stood on 
issues ranging from gay rights to instituting prayer in schools. Perhaps his 
most significant achievement came in 1989 when he forced a last-minute roll 
call vote that killed a 51% congressional pay raise he opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, Dannemeyer offered legislation that had no realistic chance of 
passage. As he ascended to ranking minority member of the House Energy and 
Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, Dannemeyer earned a 
national reputation as an outspoken critic of homosexuals. He liked to remind 
audiences that God created "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve." (Huffington, by 
comparison, was one of only 11 House Republicans to support lifting the ban on 
gays in the military.) 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Dannemeyer, 64, challenged Huffington to re-register as a 
Democrat due to his "liberal" votes. "When anyone seeks the Republican 
nomination and his voting record is on the fringe of where most Republicans 
are, it is appropriate to ask, 'Is he really in the right party?' " Dannemeyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing his record, Huffington described himself as an independent 
Republican and he often staked out territory on his own or with a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among the 54-member California congressional delegation, Huffington 
refused to sign a February, 1993, letter asking President Clinton for $1.4 
billion in immigrant and refugee funds. He later explained that the request 
wasn't large enough and signed a follow-up letter. Huffington also was the only 
California Republican who declined to support naming the Channel Islands 
National Park Visitor Center in honor of Robert J. Lagomarsino, the popular 
longtime congressman he knocked off in a bitter primary battle. Huffington 
changed his mind after The Times wrote a story noting his lone opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of only three members to oppose naming post offices in Beaver, 
Utah, and Pulaski, Tenn., after former U.S. Sens. Abe Murdock and Ross Bass, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just ridiculous," Huffington said. "Just because we got to Congress, why 
are we spending taxpayers' money chiseling our names in limestone?" 
</P>
<P>
 On more substantive issues, Huffington was the only California Republican to 
vote against a GOP alternative to the Clinton tax plan that would have reduced 
the deficit by $352 billion over five years. Huffington said the cuts didn't go 
far enough. He favors a woman's right to abortion and voted for the Brady Bill, 
which extends the waiting period in many states to purchase a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 While favoring environmental measures such as banning oil drilling off the 
California coast, Huffington opposes legislation introduced by Feinstein to 
protect the California desert because he says it will cost the state jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very independent in terms of the way he approaches issues," said Rep. 
Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands). "He doesn't automatically knee-jerk with the party 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington argues that what makes him an outsider is his ability to keep 
lobbyists at arm's length, in part because he has no need to accept campaign 
contributions from special interests. He says lobbyists should be barred from 
practicing on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to donating his $133,644 annual salary to children's charities in 
his district, Huffington does not accept congressional pension benefits and 
pays his own travel costs between Washington and California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to be a servant," said Huffington, who acquired an estimated 
$70-million fortune after working in his father's oil company for 13 years. 
"That may sound ironic. I came here to serve. I don't want it to cost people 
money. In my own way, I've made a difference. I've saved taxpayers money. I've 
served in essence for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is promoting congressional reform, Huffington has developed few 
allies among his peers. He had to consult a congressional pictorial directory 
when a reporter asked for names of colleagues who were familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
 He regards his time spent with children as an integral part of his job. He 
spends much of his day handwriting personal letters to constituents and 
greeting visitors on the Capitol grounds, particularly young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this wonderful interchange," Huffington, a father of two, says of his 
relationship with children. "To me, I'm touching kids. And if I touch them, 
that's great. They'll touch other people as they're growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 As measured by traditional standards, Huffington's House record is razor thin. 
His only original legislative proposal would disallow tax deductions for 
tobacco companies, part of a crusade to destroy the smoking industry. He is 
rarely heard from in his Banking and Small Business committees, although he 
attends meetings faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's nonexistent," said a fellow California Republican congressman, who asked 
not to be identified. "I'm still waiting for him to prove himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he has no desire to create a phony record by introducing 
legislation that has little chance of passing or holding hearings that 
accomplish nothing. "I don't want to join in the charade that is played in 
Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his tenure in the House, Huffington has had trouble retaining 
congressional staffers, losing all but three of the 19 employees he initially 
hired. In interviews, some of those former staffers recalled a frustrating 
office environment with a distant and distrustful boss and little possibility 
of accomplishment. They described Huffington as an extremely private man who 
sometimes kept his whereabouts a closely guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
 These former staffers said they grew disillusioned when Huffington appeared 
uninterested in pursuing a legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "His whole attitude is totally different," said one former top aide, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. "Being a congressman is just one little aspect of 
his life. It's not a total consuming vocation as it is with most other members 
of Congress. So consequently he tends to stop and smell the flowers a lot 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said his attitude is different and that he does believe in 
"smelling the flowers. Occasionally, I will take my staff out to the lawn out 
there and sit there and say, 'Look at this Capitol, look at these trees. Smell 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other former staffers interviewed by The Times referred to the events of Sept. 
14 as evidence of Huffington's peculiar approach. The congressman had five key 
votes on the House floor that day and several confirmed appointments in his 
Capitol Hill office, including a meeting with federal regulators and local 
officials to resolve a thorny environmental problem in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington never showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he took an 8 a.m. cross-country flight without notifying staffers 
about his departure. That evening, surrounded by prominent Republican Party 
donors at a Century City fund-raiser, Huffington declared himself the GOP 
candidate in this year's California Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides in Washington said Huffington did not share his plans to run for the 
Senate, then accused them of leaking the announcement to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he is different from run-of-the-mill politicians in Washington 
who use their government-paid employees to get elected. By keeping the 
announcement secret, Huffington said, he was erecting a "Chinese wall" between 
legislative and campaign activities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, former staffers said Huffington has an unusual penchant for privacy. 
They recalled that he ordered shredders for his Washington and Santa Barbara 
offices, refused to tell top aides how he would vote and discouraged the use of 
cellular phones because conversations could be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Huffington said he regards shredders as standard office 
equipment from his days in the business world, keeps his votes to himself 
because he is his own man and is no longer uneasy with cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the campaign, I never used to use them," he said. "Today, as a 
congressman, I am comfortable with cellular phones. You see, I can grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Huffington talked about rumors he had heard that Capitol Hill police 
were monitoring phone calls of House members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, if I'm ever in a position to find out . . . I'll shut that 
thing down so quick it will make your head spin," he told a reporter. "We need 
privacy in life. I had that from being a private citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's concern about security was among several quirky traits described 
by former staffers. These included an inclination to hug aides. In one case, 
Huffington insisted on hugging a male legislative staffer who made it clear he 
did not want to be embraced, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington confirmed the encounter, saying it "was not a big hug" and the 
staffer never got one after that. "I like to hug people. I'm a hugger. So is 
Bill Clinton. But I don't hug everybody. I hug people who I think want to be 
hugged. . . . I just think hugging is something that all children love and 
probably we adults would too." 
</P>
<P>
 For many members of Congress, their most important role is helping to bring 
jobs and federal money home to their constituents. Even here, Huffington has 
blazed a separate path. He considers it inappropriate for a legislator to lobby 
on behalf of a special interest or a local business, even if potential jobs are 
at stake in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Huffington refused a request by Raytheon Corp., one of Santa 
Barbara County's largest employers, for help in getting State Department 
waivers to sell $100 million in shipboard missile defense systems to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, whose family business was sold to Taiwan's national oil company 
for an estimated $600 million, said he left the influence peddling for 
Raytheon's battalion of consultants and lawyers. "I'm not going to be a paid or 
unpaid lobbyist for any company," he said. "That's not my job. I represent 
everyone equally." 
</P>
<P>
 But the California senator whom Huffington hopes to defeat this fall had no 
such qualms. Feinstein recently wrote letters to Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and White House chief economic adviser Robert E. Rubin urging that 
the way be cleared for U.S. companies to compete for the Taiwanese contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says Feinstein's efforts on behalf of Raytheon "smacks of a 
conflict" because she accepted two $1,000 campaign contributions from the 
firm's political action committee during the same period she was writing 
letters for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the first time Feinstein had gone to bat for constituents in 
Huffington's district. Earlier, she persuaded colleagues on the Senate 
Appropriations Committee to set aside $6 million to build a state-of-the-art 
electric bus facility in Santa Barbara after the House dropped the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington initially made the funding request in the House, saying the 
electric bus facility deserved special treatment because it contributed to 
clean air and would set the pace for the rest of the nation. But House leaders 
yanked the bus project from the $37.6-billion transportation bill soon after 
Huffington voted against the measure on the House floor. After Feinstein's 
efforts to reinsert the money, a House-Senate conference committee ultimately 
compromised and awarded the project $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein frequently touts her ability to bring the bacon home to California 
as a member of the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole philosophy of government is you provide practical solutions to real 
problems," Feinstein said in an interview. "It's personal service. This is what 
I think matters to people. They can have an advocate, and I'm happy to be that 
advocate. This is my state." 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, Huffington says, he must vote against huge appropriations 
bills as a true fiscal conservative in order to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be voting for all these appropriations bills, because if you add them 
up, they don't balance the budget. So I voted against a lot of them knowing 
full well I had a project in there for my district." He added: "You find me any 
other people who will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Huffington contends, is that he is part of a freshman class 
that is changing the way business is done on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," he told a reporter, "you should be thrilled there are people like 
myself willing to come in and try and shake this place up." 
</P>

 Times staff writers Kenneth R. Weiss, Dave Lesher and Alan C. Miller also

COLUMN ONE; TAMING THE MEAN STREETS; CITIES ARE RECLAIMING BESIEGED AREAS BY 
ERECTING TRAFFIC BARRIERS AND CRACKING DOWN ON PANHANDLERS AND LOITERING. SOME 
FEAR LOSS OF FREEDOMS. 
</P>

<P>
 It was the prostitute loitering in his driveway that tipped the balance for 
Patrick Donnelly. For Karen DeMasi-Risk, it was the drive-by shooting just a 
few houses down from her own. 
</P>
<P>
 All the residents of the Five Oaks neighborhood can identify the moment when 
they felt the streets around their homes slipping from their control. In the 
summer of 1991, this integrated, middle-class area just north of downtown 
seemed on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Suburban commuters dodging a nearby interstate clogged the residential streets 
at rush hour. Chipped paint and rotting porches testified to sinking home 
values and absentee landlords. Open-air drug deals, random gunfire and 
prostitution were snaking from the neighborhood's scruffy periphery into its 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 After conventional police crackdowns failed, the city and neighborhood 
association, almost in desperation, brought in architect Oscar Newman, known 
for his innovative design responses to urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman surveyed Five Oaks and devised a solution at once simple and radical: 
With brick and iron gates, he closed off 35 streets and 26 alleys across the 
neighborhood to all but pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 His aims: to eliminate commuter traffic, to make the area harder to navigate 
for people cruising off the interstate for drugs and prostitutes, and to give 
residents a greater sense of control over the public spaces around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, the results have been dramatic. Traffic has plummeted, 
neighborhood watch activities have increased, housing prices are up 15%, 
violent crime has dropped in half and arrests for burglary, auto theft and 
vandalism have fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 With this aggressive initiative to arrest a cycle of disorder in Five Oaks, 
Dayton joined a new urban policy movement that has raised complex questions of 
rights, responsibilities and fairness from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 A loose network of law enforcement officials, architects and urban theorists 
is advancing an agenda to combat threatening behavior in public spaces, 
particularly city streets and parks. By cracking down on rowdy teen-agers, 
aggressive panhandlers, low-level drug dealers and prostitutes, they are trying 
to nip disorder and incivility before they lead to more serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In its quest to dispel some of the menace clouding urban life, Dayton has not 
gone as far as some cities, whose emphasis on law enforcement has raised stiff 
objections from civil libertarians. Even such traditionally liberal bastions as 
San Francisco and Seattle are pushing ordinances to restrict aggressive 
panhandling. New efforts to combat truancy are sprouting in Milwaukee and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his police commissioner, 
William J. Bratton, have built their law enforcement strategy around a 
coordinated attack on all of these "quality of life" violations, from graffiti 
and street prostitution to small-time drug dealing and truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of Newman's work in Dayton, others are redesigning urban parks, 
including Bryant Park in Manhattan and Pershing Square in Los Angeles, to 
attract nearby workers and discourage drug-dealing and panhandling. And dozens 
of cities, including Los Angeles, are moving toward community-based policing -- 
more officers walking a beat and combatting disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts to reclaim public spaces are based on the theory that disorderly 
conduct, by signaling a breakdown in social and law enforcement controls, leads 
to more serious law-breaking. In a classic 1982 article in The Atlantic, 
criminal justice experts George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson concluded that 
disorder invites more serious crime in the way that broken windows on a car 
invite vandals to strip the tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start with the premise of the broken windows theory -- it is important to 
maintain a sense of order, and for people to feel the public spaces are 
available to them," says Jeremy Travis, deputy commissioner of police for legal 
matters in New York City. "Our belief is that if you take care of the little 
things, the big things will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil libertarians and homeless advocates denounce these attempts to restrict 
panhandling as authoritarian efforts to shelter the middle class from the 
problems of destitution. They charge that "defensible space" plans such as Five 
Oaks' are really intended to exclude minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Without greater efforts to shelter the homeless and treat those addicted to 
drugs, they argue, attempts to impose order through law enforcement will only 
overload police departments and courts that are already groaning under the 
weight of more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with all of these proposals is they just focus on reclaiming 
public spaces through more punitive measures . . . rather than focusing on the 
underlying problems and trying to deal with them in a more humane way," says 
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the public spaces agenda counter that disorder is not only a 
symptom but a cause of urban distress. As much as muggings or burglary, they 
maintain, threatening street behavior drives the middle class from cities. With 
arguments that parallel calls for greater personal responsibility from the 
recipients of government aid, they say that while society is obliged to help 
the needy, it must also demand minimum standards of personal conduct from 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "These initiatives are coming from the cities regarded as the most 
progressive, the most enlightened and tolerant," says Robert Teir, general 
counsel for the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a group 
supporting these new laws. "These cities seem to have concluded that a 
tolerance for diversity doesn't have to mean an end to standards of public 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 This nascent movement has caught the attention of senior White House 
officials. William A. Galston, deputy director of domestic policy for President 
Clinton, recently hosted a private daylong seminar at the White House with 
Kelling, Travis, George Washington University sociologist Amitai Etzioni and 
other advocates of the order agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the rhetorical volleys, the debate is actually about balancing the 
enduring American values of order and liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Americans would want to live in cities that enforce order as 
enthusiastically as Singapore, where chewing gum is illegal and graffiti can be 
cause for caning. And only the purest civil libertarians argue that the First 
Amendment protects all street behavior short of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to strike a balance between individual civil liberties like 
freedom of speech and freedom of movement against the rights of the community 
to expect certain minimum standards of behavior that are necessary to preserve 
a well-ordered community," says Seattle City Atty. Mark Sidran, who drafted 
that city's law against aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 For law enforcement officials, this renewed focus on order carries a distant 
echo. Maintaining urban order was the principal mission of police departments 
when they were formed in the mid-19th Century: "They preserved the public 
peace; they monitored public spaces," wrote one historian. 
</P>
<P>
 But over time police shifted their focus from maintaining order to responding 
to crime. In large part the change came because of growing concern that 
maintaining order was a euphemism for suppressing minorities and others viewed 
as undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court accelerated the transformation by invalidating 
vagrancy laws -- the principal legal tool used by law enforcement to regulate 
street behavior -- for being unconstitutionally vague and granting police too 
much discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities then advanced broad anti-loitering laws that, unlike vagrancy statutes, 
banned particular forms of behavior such as panhandling and soliciting 
prostitution. But the courts generally also have rejected this approach as too 
broad. A federal appeals court in 1993 voided a New York state law that 
amounted to a complete ban on begging, saying that it violated the First 
Amendment rights of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities have responded by still more precisely identifying prohibited street 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle is typical. It is considered relatively generous in its policies 
toward the homeless. But as the number of street people has increased, 
particularly in shopping areas, merchants grew increasingly fearful of lost 
business and pushed the city to restrict disruptive begging. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall the City Council passed ordinances that bar sitting or lying on the 
streets during business hours and outlaw aggressive panhandling that could 
"intimidate" pedestrians. Sidran says the measures were necessary to prevent a 
"dangerous downward spiral" that would invite more crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But to John Fox, coordinator for the Seattle Displacement Coalition, the 
measures sought only to "drive homeless people out of public places" where they 
might offend shoppers and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates quickly filed suit to overturn the new laws. In early March 
a federal district court upheld the city's ban on sitting or lying in the 
streets and trimmed -- but did not overturn -- the restrictions on panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the Seattle decision, another federal district court judge 
denied a motion from homeless advocates for an injunction against aspects of 
San Francisco's coordinated crackdown on public drinking, obstruction of 
sidewalks and aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Teir says those decisions show that courts now appear willing to give cities 
more freedom to regulate street behavior if they narrowly tailor their 
restrictions and have a history of providing services to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beth Andrus, attorney for the Seattle coalition appealing the district 
court decision, says these initiatives remain vulnerable if they criminalize 
innocent conduct, such as sitting in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The final boundaries on cities' ability to regulate panhandling will not be 
set until the Supreme Court tackles one of these cases, which probably won't be 
for at least two years, Teir predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Truancy crackdowns, propelled by the same concerns, have raised a different 
set of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities, truancy initiatives have been almost entirely 
non-controversial. Since last November, Milwaukee police have been rounding up 
30 to 40 truants daily and taking them -- typically in handcuffs -- to centers 
run by the the city's Boys and Girls Clubs. At the centers, counselors advise 
the students on programs the clubs offer, and sheriff's deputies notify their 
parents, who are obliged to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has drawn almost no complaints from parents and community leaders 
-- and high marks from law enforcement. Police have confiscated weapons and 
drugs from truants, and officials at the centers say that few students swept up 
a first time have been found on the streets again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all been talking about crime prevention," says Milwaukee County Sheriff 
Richard Artison, an enthusiastic supporter. "This is one of the best ways." 
</P>
<P>
 But in other cities, critics hear echoes of the discredited vagrancy laws. In 
New York, the American Civil Liberties Union fears that truancy sweeps will 
come down hardest on black and Latino students. In Philadelphia, the Board of 
Education was forced to shelve a Milwaukee-like plan this year when several 
City Council members recoiled from the prospect that police would demand 
identification and even handcuff youths because they were not in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had City Council members who described the proposal as turning 
Philadelphia into South Africa in terms of stopping people and asking them for 
ID," says Jane Malone, who studied truancy for the organization Philadelphia 
Citizens For Children and Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet in some cities, heavily minority neighborhoods are among those 
clamoring loudest for greater efforts to suppress disorder. Some community 
organizers argue that the loss of parks and other public spaces to disruptive 
behavior most harms lower-income residents, who cannot retreat to country clubs 
or private pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing 
down litter, the cops will stop you," says Ace Backus, a community organizer 
for the Sherman Park Community Assn. in Milwaukee. "In the middle of the black 
ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Racial politics also shadowed the redesign plan in Five Oaks. Some residents, 
both black and white, complained that the plan was designed to wall off the 
community from an almost all-black neighborhood to its southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Those criticisms did not derail the plan, primarily because Five Oaks itself 
is integrated. But the allegation of discrimination and exclusion remains a 
sore point in Dayton and virtually everywhere cities have taken steps aimed at 
deterring disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the political and legal fireworks that the order agenda is generating, 
its impact remains uncertain. "Why do they think if you pass another law, 
police will be able to enforce it?" Ripston wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the order advocates can claim some successes. As chief of New York's 
transit police in the 1980s, Bratton implemented an anti-crime strategy that 
emphasized regulating disorderly behavior. From 1990 to 1993, subway robberies 
and assaults dropped by about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Five Oaks, Newman's plan -- supplemented by targeted police and housing 
code violation enforcement and an assistance program to encourage homeowners 
and landlords to spruce up properties -- has lifted the cloud of demoralization 
over the neighborhood, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm night earlier this spring, children and families had almost entirely 
supplanted cars on the tree-lined streets. Two summers earlier, said Patrick 
Donnelly, families avoided the streets for fear that cars would screech away at 
high speeds from drug deals. 
</P>
<P>
 As families have moved back onto their front porches, the area has experienced 
what some here term the reverse of the "broken windows" cycle. With more 
families in the streets, residents feel more confident censuring disorderly 
behavior, and the heightened vigilance has made the area less hospitable to 
criminals, says Major Jaruth Durham-Jefferson of the Dayton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minds of some residents, this was about setting up a zone that we 
could defend," she says. "It's not that at all. It's setting up a zone where 
they can have more control." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a strong sense that all of these gains are fragile. Drug dealing 
remains a problem in some areas, and the daily conflicts of a racially and 
economically diverse population persist. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson here may be that in urban areas, disorder is like the tide: It can 
be held back only with constant exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sitting back saying we've got the streets closed, we're done," says 
Karen DeMasi-Risk, who has lived in Five Oaks for 14 years. "We're not done. 
Now we are saying, 'We can breathe, what's the next step?' It never stops."

SIMI COACH IS REMOVED AMID INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Mike Scyphers, among the most successful high school baseball coaches in 
Southern California, has been removed from coaching at Simi Valley High School 
because of a police probe into possible financial and disciplinary 
improprieties, Simi Valley police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has brought the Simi Valley program to national prominence in 
his 16 years as coach, denied any wrongdoing. The 41-year-old coach will keep 
his position as a physical education teacher and has not been arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials declined to elaborate on the charges, but police confirmed 
that the Simi Valley school district is auditing the baseball program's 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the investigation was prompted by school district 
officials, who contacted authorities last month to request assistance 
investigating "possible financial improprieties, improper discipline practices 
and other conduct which may have criminal application related to the boys' 
baseball program at Simi Valley High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Police Lt. Mark Layhew said, "(The school district) contacted us April 
19. I'm reluctant to identify their source of information. Disclosure of any of 
those specifics may compromise the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he was unaware he was under investigation until he arrived at 
school Tuesday morning and found a substitute teacher in his class. He said he 
was told to report to Principal Kathryn Scroggin's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin, Scyphers said, then informed him that he was removed as baseball 
coach pending the completion of the police investigation. He was told to remain 
on campus until he met with the team early in the afternoon, then go home, 
Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin refused to comment, referring all inquiries to the school district. 
Mary Beth Wolford, the school district superintendent, would not give specifics 
on the nature of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bitter about it," Scyphers said. "I've built a real good name for 
this program and someone out there is trying to tear it down. I don't think 
someone realizes what they're doing. . . . I think it's a disgruntled parent 
who has not taken everything into consideration before making that phone call." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers stood quietly outside a school building with his head down and 
continued to defend his practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't even begin to say I've taken more money out of this program than 
I've put into it," Scyphers said. "I paid $600 for vans one year (on a team 
trip to) Florida. I didn't get reimbursed for that because money was tight. The 
'SVs' on our helmets, I paid for those and never got reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were at Simi Valley High on Tuesday interviewing baseball players. 
Members of the team declined comment, saying police ordered them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Scyphers, police asked players about a team disciplinary practice 
called "the block." When a baseball player violates team rules, his teammates 
bid for the opportunity to administer a single swat with a wooden paddle to the 
offending player. 
</P>
<P>
 Players pay cash to Scyphers, who said he used the money for incidental team 
expenses such as a party at the end of the season or gasoline for the field 
lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is about 'the block,' that's ridiculous," Scyphers said. "It ranged 
from $2 to $4 and we've only done it, maybe five times, this year. . . . It's 
been a tradition at this school since 1980, but I've really slacked off lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it. They'd rather take a quick swat on the butt than miss a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hankins, whose sons Ryan and Mike have both played for Scyphers, was 
surprised by the charges, saying he has never written a check to Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 15-plus seasons, Scyphers has led Simi Valley to a 314-109 record and eight 
Marmonte League titles. During the 1986 and 1993 seasons, Simi Valley was 
ranked No. 1 in the country by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Coach Russ Stephans and Scott Radinsky will take over the team, 
Scyphers said. Both are Simi Valley graduates. Radinsky is a member of the 
Chicago White Sox, away from the team because he has been undergoing treatments 
for a form of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the latest developments, this had been a tumultuous season for 
Simi Valley. The team had lost four of its past five games and was in danger of 
missing the playoffs. Senior Bill Scheffels, the team's best player, dropped 
out of school Monday rather than face an expulsion hearing for making a phony 
bomb threat at school. Mike Scyphers' Career Highlights

CONSERVATIONISTS WORRIED BY DECISION ON GNATCATCHER; ENVIRONMENT: AFTER COURT'S 
RULING, THEY FEAR THAT BUILDERS WILL DESTROY THE BIRD'S HABITAT. IT IS UNCLEAR 
WHEN IT TAKES, OR TOOK, EFFECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Conservation officials scrambled Tuesday to sort out the effects of a court 
ruling that removes the California gnatcatcher from the list of threatened 
species and appears to expose its fragile habitat to the developer's bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear when Monday's ruling takes effect, and the greatest fear was 
that landowners eager to build might seize on the confusion and grade or 
bulldoze the tiny songbird's habitat -- mostly coastal sage scrub in Orange and 
San Diego counties -- before conservationists can regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that area is wide open if the judge's ruling is effective immediately," 
said Connie Babb of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Carlsbad. "But we 
don't know if it is effective now, or at noon tomorrow, or in 30 days. We're 
trying to get an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Andy McLeod, assistant secretary for resources of the state Resources 
Agency, held that the habitat will be protected by a separate preservation 
program to take effect at the end of the year and warned there was no 
percentage in developers "stepping out of line" and taking immediate action to 
alter the gnatcatcher's native environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from the Department of the Interior were conferring to formulate a 
strategy in light U. S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin's ruling that the 
government had erred in listing the gnatcatcher as threatened without providing 
its raw scientific data to builders who challenged that classification. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt had no comment Tuesday as government 
officials at virtually every level awaited some signal on how to combat a 
decision that environmentalists described as a crushing blow to the protection 
of endangered and threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Secretary Babbitt is committed to taking the necessary steps to 
guarantee the protection of the gnatcatcher," Babb said, although what those 
steps might be remained unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several possible courses of action for the Interior Department, 
officials said. One is to appeal the decision to a higher court, and another is 
to seek an injunction to stay the ruling. The period for public comment 
regarding listing the gnatcatcher as an endangered species could be reopened, 
or the disputed data could be made available to the builders. Finally, an 
attempt could be made to classify as endangered one of the nearly 100 other 
plants or animals in that habitat that are already considered imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Such major Orange County landowners as the Irvine Co. and the Santa Margarita 
Co. have indicated they will take no drastic steps to alter the land until the 
contested issue is settled. And some officials speculated that Southern 
California's economic slump might work in the conservationists' favor because 
developers are less eager to build in a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state officials looked to a separate conservation plan that seeks 
to protect not only the gnatcatcher but also its sage scrub habitat as a whole 
-- a scattering of land concentrated primarily in Orange, San Diego and 
Riverside counties, but some of which dots parts of San Bernardino and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Communities Conservation Planning rogram, created by Gov. Pete 
Wilson in 1991 and adopted in December by the federal government, encourages 
landowners to voluntarily set aside habitat for the gnatcatcher and other rare 
plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incentive, cooperating property owners will be able to get speedier 
approval to develop portions of their land, avoiding the lengthy, often 
litigious endangered-species process. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is set to take effect at the end of this year, "would 
preserve the habitat in perpetuity" regardless of the gnatcatcher's status, 
said McLeod of the state Resources Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's of no benefit for anyone to step out of line" and immediately start to 
develop the land, McLeod said, because the state's long-term goal is to see 
that the habitat is preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials worried that the gnatcatcher's change of status has 
weakened the state plan as well, or at least temporarily removed the incentive 
for landowners to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The state plan will not be legally enforceable until the end of 1994, leaving 
a dangerous window of opportunity for developers, environmentalists warned. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the Orange County property at issue is held by landowners 
already enrolled in the program, the majority of the developers in Riverside 
County have made no such promise, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned because we have never felt that these programs would be 
successful in the absence of a threatened-species listing," said Dan Silver, 
coordinator for the Endangered Habitats League, a Los Angeles-based coalition 
of environmental groups. "We always believed you needed the listing in order to 
get the developers and the local governments to do the right thing in this 
regard." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Silver said he expected most property owners, particularly the 
large developers, to take no immediate action in the wake of the ruling. But he 
expressed concern that some smaller landholders might seek to take advantage of 
the current confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to realize that if they do start destroying habitat, they might 
create an emergency situation that could lead to an emergency 
endangered-species listing for the gnatcatcher," he said. "I think they would 
want to avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Sporkin's ruling stems from a suit filed in 1992 by the Southern 
California Building Industry Assn. and Orange County's tollway agencies, which 
argued that environmentalists were using the Endangered Species Act to block 
development in general and to halt construction of the San Joaquin Hills 
tollway in the coastal hills of Orange County.

PENTAGON PICKS 4 CALIFORNIA SITES FOR FINANCE CENTERS; MILITARY: ACCOUNTING 
POSTS WILL ADD 1,800 FEDERAL JOBS. THEY WILL BE AT NORTON AFB, FT. ORD, OAKLAND 
NAVAL CENTER AND SAN DIEGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon announced Tuesday that four sites in California have been 
selected as regional finance centers, a group of Defense Department accounting 
outposts that should bring about 1,800 new jobs to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of intense national competition from communities around 
the country, the Pentagon picked Norton Air Force Base, Ft. Ord, the Oakland 
Naval Supply Center and a yet-to-be named location in San Diego as the winning 
California communities. Twenty new satellite sites were selected nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Each regional accounting center will employ 750 workers and bring in about $48 
million annually to their host communities, the Pentagon said. About 1,200 
accounting jobs already exist at the four California sites, bringing the 
statewide total to 3,000 federal accounting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very, very important jobs to our region," said Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands) whose district includes Norton Air Force Base, which has been 
deactivated. "We've been devastated by base closings, military downsizing and 
aerospace cutbacks. This is an opportunity to fill a vacuum and an important 
building block to begin planning for a long-term economic renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), chairman of a House 
Armed Services subcommittee overseeing base closings, said Tuesday that 
Pentagon officials have privately discussed a Clinton Administration plan to 
delay next spring's scheduled round of base closings until after the 1996 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Pentagon official, according to wire reports, said a 1997 base 
closure round could be added, softening the impact of next year's scheduled 
round in which California is expected to suffer even more cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no other state won four satellite sites, the 3,000 accounting jobs 
were not as many as state officials had once hoped for. Under a different 
selection process, the Norton Air Force Base site near San Bernardino became 
the sole California finalist for a larger accounting facility that promised 
4,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Steinhaus, administrator of the San Bernardino Economic Development 
Agency, which made the original application for the accounting center at the 
Air Force base, said even a small piece of the action was better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to get anything," he said. "They (the Department of Defense) 
spread the wealth around a little bit more than was originally thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier selection process, which forced competing communities to offer 
financial incentives to win the sites, was scrapped last year by former Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revised Pentagon plan, five large existing Defense Finance and 
Accounting Service centers in Ohio, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri were 
retained, and 20 new satellite centers were established in 14 states 
nationwide. Overall, the Pentagon is reducing its finance centers from 300 to 
25 and cutting 46,000 personnel to 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last week, congressional sources indicated that only two California 
sites were being seriously considered -- Norton and Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 
both ordered closed by the base closing commission. The Oakland and San Diego 
selections seemed to take some members by surprise.

NO. 2 BAJA CALIFORNIA LAW OFFICER ARRESTED IN PROBE OF SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican federal police arrested Baja California's second-highest-ranking law 
enforcement official Tuesday in connection with a drug-related shootout between 
state and federal police two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After Deputy Atty. Gen. Sergio Ortiz Lara was hustled from his office at 
gunpoint to federal police headquarters a few blocks away, about 100 
black-jacketed federal police officers armed with automatic rifles were 
deployed onto surrounding streets and rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal officers then engaged in a brief standoff with state judicial 
police officers who converged on the federal headquarters seeking information 
on Ortiz's whereabouts, but the state officers withdrew without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the March 3 shootout, investigators suspect that Ortiz may have 
been involved in the assassination last week of municipal Police Chief Federico 
Benitez Lopez, authorities said. Ortiz was previously arrested and released in 
connection with the shootout between federal and state police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is continuing into possible connections of Sergio Ortiz 
Lara with other crimes," said Diego Valades, Mexico's attorney general, in a 
news release. "Until now there are only uncorroborated versions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "For example, it will have to be established whether Federico Benitez Lopez 
had information that implicated Ortiz, and other public servants, in diverse 
criminal acts, such as their possible participation in the granting of police 
credentials to drug traffickers," his statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The reference to credentials dates back to a 1992 case in which gunmen of the 
Arellano cartel of Tijuana were found carrying Baja California police 
credentials. Shortly before stepping down last month amid suspicions of drug 
corruption in his agency, state Atty. Gen. Juan Francisco Franco Rios said a 
federal probe found that his signature was forged on those credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ortiz's arrest raised new speculation that federal authorities are 
targeting high-level corruption and Franco himself. It also introduced the 
possibility that state law enforcement officials were involved in the 
assassination of the police chief, which the state agency is itself 
investigating. Authorities have said the police chief's murder may be linked to 
his efforts against drug trafficking and police corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, the Baja California governor told reporters that 
investigators had not ruled out the possibility that Benitez's death was 
related to his role in the probe of the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
the ruling party presidential candidate, last month. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 p.m. Tuesday, two federal officers intercepted the deputy attorney 
general as he walked toward the door of his downtown office in the state 
justice complex. The officers twisted Ortiz's arm behind his back, stuck a gun 
in his ribs and walked him to a waiting pickup truck in front of stunned 
government workers, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities said that Ortiz was arrested because an appellate court 
reversed a judge's decision in March that dropped charges against him and five 
police commanders in the March 3 shootoutbetween federal agents and state 
officers, who were allegedly guarding a drug lord in the Arellano cartel. A 
federal police commander and four other men died in the gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellano cartel has been the target of an intense investigation by federal 
police since the murder last year of the Roman Catholic cardinal of 
Guadalajara. The fugitive leaders of the cartel remain at large, allegedly 
under the protection of corrupt law enforcement allies, including the state 
officers involved in the March shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 State authorities had protested the federal charges that Ortiz aided drug 
traffickers, saying he and the others simply did their duty by responding to 
the chaotic shootout. The state blamed a now-fugitive homicide chief of the 
state police for helping two captured cartel gunmen flee. At the time, Gov. 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel said he had known Ortiz for years and regarded him as 
extremely honest. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge later dropped charges against all but one official. The relationship 
between state and federal agencies has been strained since. Until they were 
cleared, the state commanders armed themselves and slept in their station for 
several days to avoid arrest by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's events increased tension in an already tense city. Standing on a 
street corner with his AK-47 at the ready, a lanky federal officer in 
sunglasses, a bulletproof vest and jeans was asked if he feared an attack by 
state police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only tell you we have been told to stand guard," he responded.

STATE DELEGATION DEEPLY SPLIT AS VOTE NEARS ON ASSAULT GUNS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton and gun control advocates continued to lobby Tuesday for 
about a dozen votes needed to pass an assault weapons ban, the California House 
delegation remained deeply split over the issue along partisan lines. 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of 30 California Democrats support restricting the availability of 
semiautomatic, military-style rifles, while 19 of the state's 22 Republicans 
are against the measure, according to the latest White House and congressional 
tallies. The vote is expected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Gary A. Condit of Ceres and first-term Republicans Steve Horn of Long 
Beach and Howard P. (Buck) McKeon of Santa Clarita are still undecided. Condit 
and McKeon are leaning against the ban on future possession, sale or 
manufacture of 19 semiautomatic weapons and their look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official said late Tuesday that the vote was breaking in 
favor of the ban and that some California members were moving in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, San Diego-area Republicans Duncan Hunter and Randy Cunningham 
teamed up with actor Charlton Heston and the National Rifle Assn. against the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who said the average murderer is released after serving less than 5 
1/2 years in prison, said: "The real assault weapons are the deadly criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), author of a nearly identical bill that 
passed the Senate last year, expressed surprise that 20 California House 
members would oppose cutting off the supply of military-style weapons that have 
produced carnage across the state, from Stockton to San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to understand," Feinstein said in an interview. "Maybe 
conservatives feel they have to be for assault weapons. I think they really 
don't understand" the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she has attempted to contact many of the California Republicans 
in opposition. "I've tried," she said with a shrug. "They're not taking my 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The ban's supporters, Feinstein said, had hoped some of the conservative 
California Republicans opposed to the ban would follow the lead of Rep. Henry 
Hyde (R-Ill.), a Judiciary subcommittee ranking member who changed his mind 
after being lobbied by Feinstein and others. But none of the 19 appeared 
willing to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 One California Republican, however, is prepared to break party ranks and 
support the ban -- Rep. Michael Huffington of Santa Barbara, who is running for 
Feinstein's Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small step," Huffington said of the ban. "But it will not make a huge 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Democrat who strongly opposes the ban is Rep. Matthew G. Martinez of 
Monterey Park. He said the legislation would ship gun manufacturing jobs 
overseas while not stopping criminals from obtaining the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us have a responsibility to educate the public and make bills 
extensive enough and conclusive enough to do the job, not just window dressing 
to make people feel like we did something," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez left open the possibility of changing sides at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said undecided legislators now hold the 
balance of power in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the undecided members within the California delegation, proponents are 
hoping that Condit will join his two fellow Central Valley Democrats -- Reps. 
Calvin Dooley of Visalia and Rick Lehman of North Fork -- in supporting the 
ban. But McKeon appears likely to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably going to vote against it," said McKeon, a longtime gun owner. 
"It just stops future production. There's so many weapons out there right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said they were confident of getting Horn's vote, partly because he 
has backed a wide range of Clinton policies during his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who has made the ban a top priority, is expected to contact as many 
undecided legislators as possible to get the necessary votes, Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the President is trying to do is alert these people to what their 
constituents want," said Rahm Emmanuel, who is heading the White House lobbying 
effort. "Hopefully, the Congress will bend to the will of public opinion on 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times national poll in December found that Feinstein's weapons ban was 
favored 71% to 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a number of incidents in California in recent years that have 
called attention to the carnage that military-style semiautomatic weapons can 
cause. Last year, eight people were killed and six wounded in a San Francisco 
high-rise. Five children were killed and 29 injured in 1989 in a Stockton 
schoolyard. In 1984, 21 were killed and 19 wounded in a San Ysidro McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members of the slain victims have been lobbying Congress for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 10 months after the worst mass murder in San Francisco history, 
Stephen Sposato carried his grief to Washington with the hope of persuading 
Congress to halt the legal sale of rapid-fire weapons such as the IntraTEC DC-9 
that was used to murder his wife, Jody. 
</P>
<P>
 Sposato, his 20-month-old daughter and his father-in-law sat down in the Oval 
Office to share their tragic story with Clinton. He also met with Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and plotted legislative strategy with Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno and Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sposato, a registered Republican from the Northern California town of 
Lafayette, could not get an audience with his local congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sposato and Marilyn Merrill, a mother of two whose husband, Michael, was slain 
in the July 1 massacre at a San Francisco law firm, said their representative, 
Bill Baker (R-Danville), has refused repeated requests to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker declined to be interviewed by The Times. He issued a press release 
Tuesday that said he will vote against the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banning guns will affect law-abiding citizens, not criminals," Baker said in 
the statement. "This gun ban is about making headlines, not criminal control." 
</P>
<P>

contributed to this story. How State's House Members Line Up 
</P>
<P>
 The House is expected to vote Thursday on legislation to ban the sale or 
manufacture of 19 semi-automatic weapons and their look-alikes. It does not 
affect assault weapons currently in circulation. A similiar bill passed in the 
Senate last November. Here is a look at how California's House members are 
expected to vote:

UC RESEARCHERS BEGIN TESTING OF RU 486 PILL; MEDICINE: STUDY ON FRENCH 
'MORNING-AFTER' PILL IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE 
MINIMUM DOSE FOR PREVENTING PREGNANCY. ANTI-ABORTIONISTS DENOUNCE THE DECISION.

 Researchers at UC San Francisco announced Tuesday that for the first time in 
the United States they will begin testing RU 486 -- the controversial French 
abortion pill -- as an emergency contraceptive for women who have had 
unprotected sex and do not want to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which is generating protests from anti-abortion activists, is part 
of an international effort designed to determine the best dose for the 
so-called "morning-after pill," which works by blocking progesterone, a key 
hormone to maintaining pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is successful, the study -- which is being conducted with the approval 
of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- could help persuade government 
officials to legalize RU 486 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This marks a new era of contraceptive research for American women," said Dr. 
David Grimes, the UC San Francisco professor of obstetrics and gynecology who 
is heading the study. "We think it is also very important that we are working 
in this exciting area of anti-progestines. We have just begun to explore this 
compound." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only France, Sweden, China and the United Kingdom permit public 
distribution of RU 486. However, the pill has been tested in the United States 
for a variety of uses. In November, doctors at Long Beach Memorial Hospital 
began a study of RU 486 as an alternative to chemotherapy for women with 
advanced breast cancer. Researchers at UC San Diego have also tested the pill 
as a treatment for women with fibroid tumors, benign tumors of the uterus, and 
endometriosis, in which fragments of the uterine lining are found in the pelvic 
cavity, commonly causing infertility. 
</P>
<P>
 RU 486 will also be tested in Oregon as an abortion pill. But Grimes drew a 
distinction between that study and his, in which women will be given the drug 
as an emergency contraceptive within five days after having unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
 He said previous studies in the United Kingdom have shown that a 600-milligram 
dose of RU 486 -- taken in three pills -- can prevent pregnancy, but that 
researchers suspect a much lower dose would be as effective. The aim of the San 
Francisco study is to establish the minimum dose; study participants who get 
pregnant in spite of the drug will be offered abortions at no cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Grimes, the pill works by preventing a fertilized embryo from 
implanting into the uterus. He said most medical experts agree that pregnancy 
begins not at fertilization, but about two weeks later, after the embryo has 
traveled from the Fallopian tubes and attached to the uterine lining. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the National Right-to-Life Committee in Washington, spokesman Richard 
Glascow told the Associated Press that calling RU 486 a contraceptive is a 
misnomer. "The proposed testing of RU 486 as a contraceptive is fundamentally 
misleading because it works not to prevent conception but to cause abortion," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes countered: "Abortion is interruption of an established pregnancy. In 
this case we're preventing a pregnancy from occurring." He said the views of 
anti-abortionists are "just rhetoric. It suggests that they don't understand 
the biology involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which is sponsored by the World Health Organization, will include a 
total of 2,100 women at 14 sites worldwide. UC San Francisco is the only U.S. 
testing center in the program. Grimes said he hopes to enroll 150 Bay Area 
women. He is urging women who want emergency contraception to call San 
Francisco General Hospital, where the study is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 The research got under way as soon as the study was announced Tuesday. Within 
five hours, Grimes said, he had received several dozen telephone calls from 
women wanting to participate. Those women will be screened and, if they are 
eligible, given the drug as soon as possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said there already is a method of emergency contraception available to 
women -- although most have never heard of it. The so-called Yuzpe regimen, 
named after a Canadian researcher, calls for women to take two birth control 
pills immediately after having unprotected sex, followed by another two pills 
12 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes said there are drawbacks to that method: Taking that many birth 
control pills in one day can cause nausea and vomiting, and it is not as 
effective as the 600-milligram dose of RU 486. However, the women who 
participated in the earlier RU 486 research sometimes experienced up to a 
two-week delay in their next menstrual period, he said.

JURY QUICKLY DECIDES GUILT IN MURDER OF HONORS STUDENT; COURTS: TEEN-AGER IS 
CONVICTED FOR ORCHESTRATING THE DEATH OF AN ORANGE COUNTY 17-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD 
BEEN TORTURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A jury took less than three hours Tuesday to find a teen-ager guilty of 
first-degree murder for orchestrating the 1992 New Year's Eve ambush murder of 
an Orange County honors student. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, a onetime candidate for class valedictorian, faces life in 
prison without parole for his role in the killing of Stuart A. Tay of Orange. 
The 17-year-old was beaten, forced to drink rubbing alcohol and buried in a 
shallow grave in a Buena Park back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was one of five teen-agers charged in the slaying. Two are awaiting 
trial, a third has pleaded guilty and, in a surprise move, a fourth pleaded 
guilty Tuesday. Mun Bong Kang, now 19, admitted guilt because he wanted to 
spare Tay's parents the ordeal of another trial, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors agreed with the prosecution's contention that Chan sealed his 
conviction when he testified that he knew the killing was wrong, but still 
joined four other teen-agers in killing Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how fast the verdict took, but there was really nothing to 
decide," said juror Ulla Laing of Huntington Beach. "He got on the witness 
stand and said he did it and he knew what he was doing. It's like the 
prosecutor said -- he convicted himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that Chan masterminded the murder because he believed 
Tay was about to double-cross him in a plan to rob an Anaheim computer parts 
dealer. Tay was lured to a Buena Park garage, where he was beaten unconscious 
with baseball bats and forced to drink rubbing alcohol before his nose and 
mouth were sealed with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, told jurors he 
assisted in murdering Tay because he believed the teen-ager had rigged Chan's 
Fullerton home with explosives and was about to kill him unless stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But one juror, who asked that his name not be used, said the jury easily 
rejected Chan's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we wanted to give him a break, our conscience wouldn't let us," the 
juror said. "He was not (mentally unstable). He knew what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The case gained widespread attention as a symbol of juvenile crime out of 
control, and because both teen-agers came from seemingly model homes. Chan was 
a top student at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton and his IQ hovered near 
genius level. Tay, who attended Foothill High School in Santa Ana, aspired to 
become a physician like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay's mother, Linda, said she was grateful that the jury saw through Chan's 
defense. "I did expect a very early verdict because the facts were clear," she 
said. "Even the best carpenter cannot build a house without wood," she added, 
referring to the fact that Chan had a prominent Orange County attorney 
representing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's parents were devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say this is a tragedy for everyone," said Tony Chan, a 
Fullerton engineer who said his son bears responsibility in the killing but 
questioned whether he received a fair trial. "I didn't say he's innocent, but a 
lot of things Mr. D.A. says is not correct." 
</P>
<P>
 As jurors began deliberating Chan's fate Tuesday, Kang pleaded guilty to 
first-degree murder for assisting in the ambush attack. His parents had urged 
the plea, said defense attorney Ronald G. Brower, who represents Kang. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to do the honorable thing," Brower said. "They and their son hope 
this act will in some small way convey their true feelings and the shame they 
feel. They pray daily for God to ease the suffering of the Tay family." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary has not set a date for 
sentencing, at which time she will decide whether Kang, who was a juvenile at 
the time of the killing, will be sent to state prison or the California Youth 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection began Tuesday for the remaining two co-defendants: Abraham 
Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Young Kim, 18, of Fullerton. Judge O'Leary 
dismissed the majority of the prospective jurors, saying she was concerned that 
information about the verdict would taint their objectivity.

TEACHER IS OUSTED OVER MOVIE PLAN; EDUCATION: TEMPORARY INSTRUCTOR WANTED TO 
SHOW 'ZOOT SUIT' TO HER 11TH-GRADERS. SCHOOL OFFICIALS CALLED THE R-RATED FILM 
INAPPROPRIATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A high school teacher in this San Diego suburb has been told she will not be 
allowed to teach any more this semester after a confrontation with school 
officials over her request to show the movie "Zoot Suit" to her 11th-grade 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiko Obata said she wanted to show "Zoot Suit," a story of prejudice against 
Chicanos in Los Angeles during World War II, as a way to counteract animosity 
toward Mexican Americans at predominantly white Santana High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one student write in his journal that he wants to live in the back 
country because there aren't any Mexicans or gangs," she said. "That's the kind 
of ignorance I'm up against." 
</P>
<P>
 The principal at Santana High informed Obata a week ago in a memo that the 
R-rated "Zoot Suit" was not suitable for her five American literature classes 
because it contained excessive violence and some off-color language. As a 
depiction of "gang life and barrio living," the principal suggested "West Side 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, school administrators took the unusual step of sending Obata 
home with pay for the rest of the semester, according to district documents. A 
substitute has been hired to take Obata's place. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was not shown at Santana. The 1981 film stars Edward James Olmos as 
the narrator, El Pachuco, and is built around two incendiary incidents in Los 
Angeles history: the Sleepy Lagoon case in which a dozen Chicano youths were 
wrongfully convicted of murder, and the street clashes between servicemen and 
zoot suit-wearing Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
 Obata, a temporary employee filling in for a teacher on leave, said she has 
been told that she will not be offered a job next school year because she was 
insubordinate in going over the head of the English department chairwoman in 
seeking approval to show "Zoot Suit." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is discrimination," said Obata, who is Japanese American. "I 
don't think they would do this to a white teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Wong, the Grossmont Union High School District's assistant superintendent 
for educational services, declined to say why Obata has been sent home but did 
say that the school district has to be careful in allowing R-rated movies into 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He said R-rated movies such as "Das Boot" and Roman Polanski's "Macbeth" have 
been shown, but only after being reviewed by administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely cautious, given the tenor of the community," Wong said. The 
Grossmont district serves the eastern and southern portions of San Diego 
County, where conservative and religious groups are politically powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said the chairwoman of the English department, whose rejection of "Zoot 
Suit" was upheld by the principal, did not feel the movie fit the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 But Obata said she thought "Zoot Suit" would fit perfectly into a course that 
includes Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," Richard Wright's "Black Boy," poetry by 
Langston Hughes and a collection of short stories by Sandra Cisneros titled 
"The House on Mango Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Obata had required students to bring signed permission from their parents to 
be included in the "Zoot Suit" showing. After she was blocked from showing the 
movie, 200 students signed petitions asking the school administration to 
relent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's terrible what has happened to Miss Obata," said student 
Christine Lucas, 17. "She was such a good teacher. She was the kind of teacher 
you could talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting "Zoot Suit," Santana High Principal Terrie Pennock and English 
department Chairwoman Beverly Jellison noted the film's "excessive" violence 
and use of obscene language. 
</P>
<P>
 Obata has received support from Olmos; the film's writer-director, Luis 
Valdez, and Gordon Davidson, artistic director at the Mark Taper Forum, where 
"Zoot Suit" made its debut as a play in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said he was angry that Grossmont officials are giving a distorted 
impression of his movie by referring to its violence and strong language. In 
truth, Valdez said, the violence in the movie is symbolic and off-screen and 
one objectionable word is only used once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously somebody at Grossmont does not like my movie," Valdez said. "Maybe 
it's because they don't like the interpretation of this piece of history. . . . 
I applaud the teacher for standing up to this kind of bigotry and censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said that although "West Side Story," released in 1961, is an artistic 
triumph, it has become somewhat outdated because it deals with East Coast gangs 
rather than West Coast gangs, which have a different social and cultural 
dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 An edited version of "Zoot Suit" has been shown on network television. The 
movie has been used in numerous high schools, including Garfield High School in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Obata, 38, has a bachelor's degree in Asian American studies from UC Berkeley 
and a master's in music from San Diego State University. She came to Santana 
High during the fall semester as part of a teaching intern program run by 
United States International University, where she received her teaching 
credential. 
</P>
<P>
 For the spring semester she joined the faculty on a temporary assignment, 
filling in for a teacher on leave, and had been given no assurance of being 
offered a job for next year. She received a good evaluation by a master teacher 
in January but a poor one from the principal in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, before the "Zoot Suit" flap, Obata thought her chances of being offered 
at least another temporary job at Santana or another Grossmont district school 
were good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grossmont district, with 10 schools and 21,000 students, has been hiring 
new teachers to meet increased enrollment in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is my career in danger," Obata said, "but the whole right of 
students to see other cultures, to experience Mexican American literature, has 
been hurt."

$3.5 MILLION FUNDS NBC HEALTH REPORT

<P>
 A leading philanthropic foundation is paying $3.5 million for a two-hour time 
slot that NBC's news division will fill with a program examining health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture is unprecedented in network television, NBC News President 
Andrew Lack said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit organization that makes grants 
in support of health care, will spend $2.5 million to underwrite the broadcast 
time for the program, which is to air without commercials from 9 to 11 p.m. EDT 
on June 21. It will spend another $1 million to advertise the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The special, to be anchored by Tom Brokaw, will include reports from NBC News 
correspondents on the health care debate. It will also include discussion by 
experts from medical and legal circles and by ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm both thrilled and very proud that NBC is able to take part in this kind 
of unprecedented broadcast," Lack said. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News will maintain control of editorial content, he said.

CLINTON ALTERS COUNTERSPY NET IN WAKE OF AMES CASE; ESPIONAGE: THE NSC IS 
STRENGTHENED AND FBI OFFICIAL HEADS KEY GROUP AT THE CIA. BUT INTELLIGENCE 
PANEL LEADERS IN SENATE CALL THE CHANGES INADEQUATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Moving to close holes in the U.S. counterspy network revealed by the Aldrich 
H. Ames case, President Clinton on Tuesday ordered revisions in the nation's 
counterintelligence structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's revisions, contained in a presidential directive, strengthen the 
power of the National Security Council over counterintelligence, designate a 
senior FBI official to head a key counterespionage group at the CIA as well as 
CIA officials to work at the FBI, and create new policy and operations boards 
to coordinate and oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's changes, announced at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, 
were received with skepticism from panel leaders, who argued that the revisions 
stop short of the needed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) angrily accused CIA Director R. James 
Woolsey of posturing in opposing a Senate bill that would deal with the problem 
by giving the FBI overall counterintelligence responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves came against a backdrop of differences in the cultures and missions 
of the CIA and the FBI, worsened by rivalries and a failure to share 
information. Those divisions have persisted, despite attempts to resolve them 
over the years, and they seemed to culminate in the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran with access to some of the agency's most sensitive 
secrets, drew a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole 
last week after admitting that he had served as a mole for the Soviet Union and 
later the Russians since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "The root cause of the Ames case -- the things that enabled him to gravely 
damage our national security for so long -- were counterintelligence procedures 
and programs that did not work," FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA failed to advise the FBI for two years that Ames' 1991 polygraph 
results were suspicious, even though the FBI had joined in the hunt for a mole 
at the agency, DeConcini has noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh joined Woolsey in contending at the hearing that giving the FBI director 
overall counterintelligence responsibility, as provided for in a bill 
introduced by DeConcini and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), would ignore the 
"critical roles played by the CIA in counterintelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie S. Gorelick contended that the legislation is "too 
blunt an instrument" for the delicate job of assigning counterintelligence 
responsibilities, arguing that the task should be left to the presidential 
directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) expressed skepticism about the presidential 
directive, calling it "a rather complicated procedure that may soothe some 
egos" and saying that he favors what he regards as the legislation's clearer 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey said he does not find giving the FBI overall responsibility "such a 
problem, given what's at stake -- the nation's security, not whether the FBI 
and CIA get along." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick, noting that Clinton had signed the directive only Tuesday morning, 
suggested that executive branch officials might not have had an opportunity to 
fully brief the senators on details of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini, citing closed-door testimony by an FBI official assigned to the CIA 
who told of numerous occasions when he could not obtain information from the 
agency, argued that the problem is in getting counterintelligence information 
from the CIA's operations directorate to whatever interagency units are 
established by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woolsey countered: "I can't conceive of a substantive issue being raised 
-- whether a polygraph (result), a foreign intelligence agent's report . . . 
that does not come to the (National Counterintelligence) Center" that Clinton's 
order establishes. The order provides that a senior FBI executive will serve as 
chief of the center's counterespionage group. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest exchange occurred when Woolsey maintained that giving the FBI 
overall counterintelligence responsibility would bring back the overseas 
rivalries that existed between the FBI and CIA in the late 1940s and early 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of statements are just the exact posturing that does nothing 
constructive here," DeConcini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing 10 efforts to achieve FBI-CIA cooperation since the intelligence agency 
was created, DeConcini said: "Time and time again, it has not worked out. What 
makes you think you can make this work is beyond me."

REBEL SERBS AGREE TO CONCESSIONS TO HEAD OFF SPREAD OF WAR IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs agreed Tuesday to a cease-fire and the posting of U.N. observers 
around the town of Brcko, where negotiators are trying to head off a new 
flare-up in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to let U.N. peacekeepers enter the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, 
another flash point in the Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting top U.N. official 
Yasushi Akashi that his troops will observe a truce in the strategic Brcko area 
in northern Bosnia even if Muslim-led Bosnian government forces do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United Nations will be deploying more military liaison officers in the 
area of Brcko, and we will be establishing more observation posts," Akashi told 
reporters after the meeting in Pale. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims and Serbs have accused each other of a buildup of forces around the 
Bosnian Serb-held river valley town. Brcko lies in a narrow strip that links 
Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70% of Bosnian territory Serbs now control resembles a horseshoe, and at 
one point near Brcko it is only three miles wide. Muslim forces are to the 
south, and Croatia lies to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 France has urged the United Nations to give Brcko the same protective shield 
as six embattled Muslim-held parts of Bosnia that the world body has declared 
safe areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi and Karadzic also discussed the enclave of Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, 
and deteriorating relations between the Serbs and U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi said the Serbs agreed to let a convoy of 168 British troops heading for 
Gorazde proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs protested an incident last Friday when U.N. tanks lobbed 72 shells 
at Serbian positions near the northern town of Tuzla, which the Serbs say 
killed nine civilians. The United Nations says the peacekeeping troops were 
responding to Serbian attacks.

FLORIDA GOVERNOR LAUNCHES PLAN TO SAVE POLLUTED EVERGLADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by America's greatest marshlands, Gov. Lawton Chiles signed into 
law Tuesday a $685-million plan to save the dying Everglades from decades of 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists called the plan a sellout to Florida's sugar industry 
and predicted that it would not stop the phosphorus-rich farm runoff that is 
choking the Everglades' plant and animal life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill ends a lawsuit that U.S. officials filed against Florida in 1987, 
accusing the state of failing to protect the Everglades from runoff polluted 
with fertilizer from 550,000 acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the cleanup plan, officials will create giant filtering marshes to 
prevent pollution from reaching the heart of the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles estimated that farmers and sugar growers will pay one-third to one-half 
of the cleanup cost over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest will come from a property tax of up to 10 cents per $1,000 of taxable 
value on homes, businesses and other South Florida property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Everglades provides fresh water to residents and is home to thousands of 
wildlife species.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; A FALSE SENSE OF SINCERITY: SOME CASES BELIE POLYGRAPH 
RESULTS; CIA SPY ALDRICH AMES IS THE LATEST TO WEAVE AN UNTANGLED WEB ON THE 
LIE DETECTOR'S GRAPH. COURTS RECOGNIZE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DEVICE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wired to a polygraph, South Korean lobbyist Tongsun Park was undaunted by 
charges that he had sought to bribe dozens of congressmen during the so-called 
Koreagate scandal in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer William G. Hundley, sitting alongside Park at his questioning 
by an FBI polygrapher, marveled at his client's ability to shield lawmakers he 
considered friends. "The needle never moved," said Hundley, recalling how Park 
denied payment after payment without the polygraph registering any deception. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, however, later admitted many of his cash gifts, testified before a grand 
jury and even became a star witness at House Ethics Committee hearings into the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident left an indelible mark on Hundley, a man long skeptical about 
polygraphs who has practiced criminal law for 30 years after serving as a 
Justice Department official under Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any medical or scientific evidence which ever tends to 
establish that your blood pressure elevates, that you perspire more freely or 
that your pulse quickens when you tell a lie," Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a growing disenchantment with the value of polygraphs, others are 
adopting Hundley's views. Congress banished most of their uses in private 
industry six years ago. And, although the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency 
still use them routinely to screen employees, the recent Aldrich H. Ames 
espionage case is leading CIA officials to rely on polygraphs a little less. It 
also has spurred another round of controversy over their accuracy and the 
dangers of relying on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of detecting liars by observing their behavior has roots in ancient 
history. In Asia, an interrogation method involved scientific principles based 
on the lessening of salivation under nervous tension. When the mouths of 
several suspects were filled with dry rice, the suspect exhibiting the greatest 
difficulty spitting out the rice was judged guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Another precursor of the polygraph was said to have been used in India. 
Suspects were sent into a dark room and told to pull the tail of a sacred 
donkey. They were warned that if the animal brayed, this signaled their guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to the suspects, the donkey's tail had been dusted with black powder. 
Those with a clear conscience pulled the tail, while the guilty individuals did 
not. An examination of the suspects' hands revealed those with a guilty 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 The polygraph came along in 1921, invented by John A. Larson, a University of 
California medical student working with help from a police official. The device 
ostensibly detects when a person is lying by monitoring and recording certain 
body changes affected by a person's emotional condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's more refined versions continuously record blood pressure, pulse and 
respiration. It records these conditions simultaneously, tracing them with 
squiggly lines on graph paper -- thus the name polygraph . 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long considered the device an 
invaluable aid, although they do not rely upon it exclusively. Most 
investigators view it as a useful tool when applied in conjunction with other 
investigative techniques. Sometimes they use the mere threat of a polygraph 
test to achieve leverage with suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with a limited use, the reliability of "the box" has long been 
disputed by psychologists and criminal justice authorities. Very few federal or 
state judges permit the use of polygraph results in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states specifically have barred their introduction in court -- including 
California, where the state Supreme Court has outlawed them even when opposing 
lawyers agree to such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste, a former associate prosecutor from the 
Watergate scandal of two decades ago, said the polygraph "is a useful tool for 
ordinary people but not for those in counterintelligence who know how to beat 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Plato Cacheris called it "a great psychological tool" in most 
cases. "You take the average guy and tell him you're going to give him a poly, 
and he's concerned enough to believe that it will disclose any deception on his 
part," Cacheris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cacheris' latest client, CIA spy Ames, apparently understood the machine's 
limitations. He passed a CIA polygraph in 1991 after his answers were judged 
"questionable" on an initial test when asked about his signs of newfound 
wealth. Ames was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to receiving 
about $2.5 million from his Russian handlers for selling U.S. secrets over a 
period of more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), a self-described "country lawyer" who 
was chairman of the 1973 Senate Watergate Committee, often ridiculed polygraphs 
as "modern witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the machines can be fooled by inveterate liars who no longer react 
emotionally to lying, by people who take certain drugs beforehand or by those 
who have wholly convinced themselves that their lies are the truth. In all 
those instances, the person being questioned would show little, if any, of the 
measurable reactions normally associated with lying. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics assert that a person can raise his own blood pressure to confuse 
the test by pressing his toes hard against the floor on questions where he is 
known to be telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Minor, who retired in 1987 as chief polygrapher for the FBI, scoffed 
at some of these suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can the machine be defeated? Yes, but not easily," Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the poly is beaten, it's usually by training or by fluke. And it depends 
on how serious a question is at stake. As to the toes and similar tactics, a 
person's strange reactions at miscellaneous points during the test only alert 
the examiner that he's trying countermeasures in an effort to cover his lies." 
In Search of the Truth 
</P>
<P>
 Test-takers can use various techniques to cloud polygraph results. Such tricks 
would not necessarily clear them, however, only make their answers 
"questionable," which could lead to further investigation. Aldrich H. Ames took 
two polygraphs at the CIA. In at least one, responses were such that the 
answers should have been referred to the FBI for follow-up. Industry experts 
cite studies showing polygraph validity rates as high as 95%. 
</P>
<P>
 How the machines work 
</P>
<P>
 The machine measures changes in pulse, blood pressure, fingertip perspiration, 
respiration and body movements during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactics to alter readings 
</P>
<P>
 * Psychological training can help test-taker manipulate answers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Curling toes and pressing feet down inside shoes on innocent questions can 
elevate readings, making entire test inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some people have been known to put tacks in their shoes to elevate readings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drugs -- 400 milligrams of meprobamate for example -- can help test takers 
manipulate results. 
</P>
<P>
 Factors that affect accuracy 
</P>
<P>
 * Competence of examiner 
</P>
<P>
 * Psychological makeup of the examinee 
</P>
<P>
 * Context in which exam is given 
</P>
<P>
 The readout 
</P>
<P>
 Physical changes recorded on polygraph indicate when an individual might be 
lying. If the person tells the truth, little or no change is recorded.

ORPHANS REPORTED SLAIN IN RWANDA 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heavy shelling battered Rwanda's capital in a surge of fighting between Tutsi 
rebels and Hutu-led government troops Tuesday, and new reports of ethnic 
butchery in the countryside said militiamen killed 34 orphans and Red Cross 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A British-based aid group, Oxfam, pleaded with the United Nations to send 
troops back into Rwanda to protect civilians from the slaughter that has raged 
unchecked for nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 100,000 Rwandans have been killed since Rwanda's president, a member 
of the majority Hutu ethnic group, died in a mysterious plane crash April 6 in 
the capital, Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxfam's director, David Bryer, said reports from his colleagues working 
with Rwandan refugees suggest that up to 500,000 people may have been slain, 
most of them minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new example of Rwanda's savagery, the International Red Cross reported 
Tuesday that 21 orphans were slain by militiamen in Butare on Sunday, along 
with 13 Rwandan Red Cross workers who tried to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. spokesman in Kigali reported heavy shelling in the capital. He said 
by telephone that three U.N. peacekeepers were wounded, but he had no details 
about other casualties.

CLINTON BIDS FOR FRIENDLY N. KOREAN TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton delivered an impassioned appeal Tuesday night to North Korea 
and its people to turn back from the increasingly ominous confrontation over 
international inspection of nuclear sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as senior Administration officials have stepped up warnings that the 
issue could lead to crisis and even conflict, Clinton used a worldwide 
television broadcast to assure the Korean people that the United States 
continues to hope for a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have North Koreans watching us tonight," Clinton said, and "I 
say to you: The United States wishes to have friendly and open relationships 
with you. We wish to have a constructive relationship. We want you to have a 
constructive relationship with South Korea. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The options are, I think, clear, but they are not easy," Clinton said. "No 
one wishes this confrontation. But neither does one wish to have a state not 
only with nuclear power but with a capacity to proliferate nuclear weapons to 
other nations. It is a very serious potential situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appeal to the North Koreans was part of a larger effort to use an 
unusual worldwide television broadcast on the Cable News Network to restore 
luster to his image as a foreign policy leader. Faced with widespread criticism 
that he has been hesitant and inconsistent, the President insisted he is 
prepared to maintain the American leadership role -- even in messy post-Cold 
War conflicts such as North Korea, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's statements on North Korea paralleled those made earlier on Tuesday 
by Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who told Pyongyang the United States is 
ready to provide substantial economic aid if it agrees to drop its nuclear 
weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry also sought to warn Americans that U.S. insistence on Pyongyang's 
compliance with international nuclear weapons inspections also contained the 
risk of "consequences" that might provoke North Korea into military action 
against the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing his "road map" for national security and foreign affairs, Clinton 
acknowledged that American involvement in overseas conflicts "costs money and 
it costs lives." And, he said, "we cannot solve every problem, nor should we." 
Yet the United States "must be willing to assume the perils and the risk of 
leadership," he declared. "And I am willing to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding questions from correspondents representing news organizations from 
about 100 countries, Clinton made these points: 
</P>
<P>
 * China: Taking a middle course, he said Beijing had met some American demands 
on human rights but had fallen short on enough others that ending 
most-favored-nation trade status for China is "clearly on the table" and still 
"a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not seek, nor would it be proper, for the United States or for any other 
nation to tell a great nation like China how to conduct all its internal 
affairs or to treat all its citizens or what laws it should have. That would be 
wrong," he said. "The criteria in the executive order I issued are those things 
recognized in all universal declarations by all countries as essential to human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bosnia: He angrily defended his policies against charges that he had 
"flip-flopped," asserting he had done everything he could in the face of 
European opposition to more aggressive action. Asked by CNN's Christian 
Amanpour, from Sarajevo, whether his cautious stance in Bosnia had prompted 
North Korea to take Washington less seriously, a nettled Clinton shot back: 
"No, but speeches like that make them take me less seriously than I'd like to 
be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no constant flip-flops, madam," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 * Middle East: Asked what signs of progress he saw in negotiations between 
Israel and Syria, he said Syrian President Hafez Assad has shown new 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rwanda: He said the world "has grieved for the slaughter in Rwanda" but 
stopped well short of pledging direct American military intervention. He said 
the United States will join other nations in helping Rwandan refugees.

SURVIVORS TAKE COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT THE WAR IS FINALLY OVER.

<P>
 First there was the anger, white-hot and debilitating. Who could do such a 
thing? Then reason returned, and with it the quiet, dull pain of acceptance 
that has now lasted a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Younghusband's son, Michael, was a 27-year-old civil engineer, doting 
father of an infant boy, and a white South African utterly indifferent to 
politics. Then he walked into an office elevator here, the doors closed, and he 
was blown apart by a bomb intended for government officials meeting nearly a 
dozen floors above. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Petersen's son, Hector, was a bright 13-year-old in a middle-class 
neighborhood of Soweto. One sunny morning, Hector kissed his mother goodby and 
headed for school. Minutes later, the black boy was shot dead by a white 
policeman trying to stop a peaceful student march. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Petersen and Michael Younghusband, separated by 1,000 miles of South 
African soil, were just two of the tens of thousands of young men and women of 
promise who died in the cross-fire of the 30-year, tit-for-tat war between the 
African National Congress and the minority white rulers in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, with the surprisingly peaceful transfer of power from white to 
black, families of those innocent victims were reminded of their losses -- but 
also found comfort in the knowledge that the war between black and white has 
officially ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me a feeling of relief. You know it's over, that this sort of thing 
is not likely to go on anymore," said Peter Younghusband, a Cape Town writer 
and wine estate owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my son, and I've never held it against the ANC," whose guerrillas 
planted the bomb in 1985, he added. "One of the things I came to accept was 
that I'm not the only one who has lost a son in this conflict. It happened on 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 On that other side is Hector Petersen's family. Hector's sister, Antoinette 
Sithole, now 34, says it helps her to think that Hector's death in 1976 was the 
beginning of the end of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days I go to his grave and I tell him that things are changing in 
Africa, so he must rest peacefully now," Sithole said. "I tell him that blacks 
can vote and we are looking at a really great future. I tell him that we are 
really grateful, although we miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, on the anniversary of Hector's death, his family will again visit 
the grave in Soweto's Avalon Cemetery. In the early years, hundreds of 
anti-apartheid activists gathered at dawn at Hector's grave site to commemorate 
the bloody student march in which he and several dozen others died. But over 
the years, the number has dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time I'm going to tell Hector that we have voted and we are so thrilled 
that we have a new government that is ours," Sithole said. "We knew that one 
day we would get our freedom. But we really didn't know how it was going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no winners in the long war between the black oppressed and the 
white oppressors in South Africa. But there were many victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were innocent and unlucky bystanders who had been running an errand, 
going to school, taking a stroll, eating a hamburger, watching a rugby match or 
reading a newspaper when South Africa's political turmoil detonated in front of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC's guerrilla war, born in the brutal police crackdown of the late 
1950s, never came close to overthrowing the government or making the country 
ungovernable. But several hundred blacks and whites were killed by ANC car 
bombs, mines and hand grenades detonated at shopping malls, restaurants and 
military facilities during the 30-year war. And thousands of innocent blacks 
and whites were killed by police hit squads, riot police and government 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the white minority government, although superior militarily, never 
came close to crushing the dream of black liberation. No matter how many blacks 
died at the hands of government security forces, more took to the streets. And 
the violence frightened away foreign investors, increasing pressure on Pretoria 
to talk to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign of armed resistance also gave the ANC substantial support in the 
seething black townships, where many angry residents embraced the ANC as their 
best hope for freedom from government repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it had very little effect militarily, it had quite substantial 
propaganda value for the ANC," said Andre du Toit, a professor of political 
studies at the University of Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the country looks ahead to the promise of racial peace and black 
empowerment, many thousands of black and white South Africans are trying to 
bury its painful memories and, as ANC leader Nelson Mandela and President 
Frederik W. de Klerk have done, shake hands with their former enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people who killed, on both sides of the political divide, 
survived. Some in the ANC will be sitting in Parliament later this week. 
Others, who worked for the white government, have kept their jobs and their 
pensions. As De Klerk said in declaring a general amnesty for political crimes 
a few years ago, the country must learn to "forgive and forget." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it's too late for those who lost legs and arms, fathers and 
mothers," said Ronel Greyling, a criminologist who worked with an organization, 
now disbanded, called Victims Against Terrorism. "In South Africa, it was 
always easier to kill someone than negotiate with them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Petersens, the memories are kept by one of the most famous photographs 
of the anti-apartheid struggle. It shows a limp Hector, still dressed in his 
school uniform of shorts and jacket, being carried through the streets of 
Soweto by another sobbing teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day in 1976, Hector and Antoinette had gone to school only to find the 
streets filled with pupils protesting the use of Afrikaans, the language of the 
first white settlers of South Africa, as a medium of instruction in the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 When police fired tear gas and let dogs loose on the crowd, the sister and 
brother hid together behind a house. But when Antoinette turned around, her 
brother was gone. She saw him later, unconscious and mortally injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often wonder what would have become of Hector," said his sister, who named 
her oldest son after him. "He was a shy person, very shy and quiet. I wonder if 
he would have gotten married by now." 
</P>
<P>
 But it helps her to think of Hector as a hero in the liberation struggle. 
"Maybe if we hadn't demonstrated in 1976, things would still be the same here," 
she said. "And I think his blood has helped cleanse us of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp pain of loss has faded for Peter Younghusband as well. It's 
something he doesn't like to talk about. But every step South Africa takes 
toward democracy reminds him of the son he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those unfortunate things that each time I read about somebody 
else's son being killed, I think about it," he said. "It strikes a nerve every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Younghusband has always considered the ANC's protest to be justified, 
"although I haven't always felt good about what they did." The irony, though, 
was that his son was "totally nonpolitical," the father said. "I used to say to 
him, 'You should take more interest in what's going on, because it affects you 
so much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The day he was killed, Michael Younghusband took a national civil engineering 
exam and then stopped by his office to pick up some papers. The elevator bomb 
had been intended for a government meeting in the downtown building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragic thing about it . . . in a building where literally thousands of 
people work, (was) why him out of all these people?" Peter Younghusband said. 
"I've always felt he was a victim of a very tragic situation and a vicious 
system, which thankfully is coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of Michael Younghusband's exam arrived after the funeral. His 
score was the highest in the country.

MANDELA BEGINS SHAPING NEW GOVERNMENT; SOUTH AFRICA: SLOW VOTE COUNT DELAYS NEW 
PRESIDENT'S FORMAL ELECTION. GORE WILL LEAD U.S. DELEGATION AT INAUGURATION 
TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President-elect Nelson Mandela began shaping South Africa's first 
post-apartheid government Tuesday, but his formal election in Parliament will 
be delayed three days because of the glacially slow counting, by hand, of 
millions of paper ballots from last week's all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, who claimed victory Monday night and led the nation in a night of 
rejoicing, met privately early Tuesday with the lame-duck white president, 
Frederik W. de Klerk. Aides said they discussed who will be in the 27-member 
Cabinet that their parties will dominate in the so-called government of 
national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheering crowds that shot guns and fireworks in the air, lit bonfires and 
danced in the streets of major cities and black townships were largely gone by 
dawn, and most people returned to work. Police said little violence or 
vandalism had occurred as the jubilant black majority celebrated the end of 
white domination. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate concern was finishing the vote counting in time for Mandela's 
inauguration next Tuesday in Pretoria. Vice President Al Gore will lead the 
American delegation, the White House announced, and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton may attend as well. Other expected guests include U.N. Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Britain's Prince Philip, Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and leaders of more than 20 countries from 
Israel to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days of counting, just over half the expected 23 million ballots 
were tallied by Tuesday night. Overwhelmed election officials blamed logistic 
and communication problems, as well as scattered cases of fraud, as the ballots 
were slowly counted and recounted at 1,200 stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, counting has yet to begin. In others, many of the teachers and 
bank tellers hired as official counters had to return to their jobs Monday, 
leaving tallying posts unfilled. And at other stations, disputes arose over the 
use of party supporters to handle ballots. Pay strikes were reported at several 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 As returns trickled in, the Independent Electoral Commission decided to bend 
its own rules to quicken the pace. The commission scrapped its required 
safeguard that officials verify that the number of ballots returned to counting 
stations matched the number of ballots handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome was not in doubt, because Mandela's ANC appeared headed for a 
landslide victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With 53% of the vote counted, the ANC led with 62.5%, followed by De Klerk's 
National Party with 22.1%. Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha 
Freedom Party was a distant third with a better-than-expected 8.3%, and the 
right-wing white Freedom Front had 2.7%. The white liberal Democratic Party had 
1.7%; the radical black Pan-Africanist Congress had 1.3%. A total of 27 parties 
ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, the electoral commission must finish the counting and decide 
whether the election was "substantially free and fair" by Monday, 10 days after 
polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval is considered a formality -- even though election abuses, 
including stolen ballots and ballot boxes, now appear to have been widespread. 
The commission received thousands of complaints and has referred more than 150 
cases to police for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But with time running out, the multi-party Transitional Executive Council, 
which has overseen the government since December, delayed the opening of the 
new 400-member National Assembly, the main chamber of Parliament, from Friday 
until Monday. The assembly's first official act will be to elect Mandela as the 
country's first black president. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive council also delayed seating of nine new provincial 
legislatures. They will convene Saturday, rather than Thursday, and will elect 
a 90-member national Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only date that seems cast in stone is the inauguration on Tuesday, 
because of the invited guests," said Dries van Heerden, executive council 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, any party that wins more than 5% of the popular vote may claim 
a seat in the new Cabinet. So far, only the ANC, National Party and Inkatha 
have broken that threshold. But Mandela has said he may invite leaders of 
other, smaller parties to join, especially from the Pan-Africanist Congress and 
the Freedom Front. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite problems during the election, former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael 
Manley, head of the Commonwealth election observer group, said Tuesday that the 
abuses did not undermine the result. "People had a chance to vote, they did 
vote and were able to make a choice," he told a news conference before leaving 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria had a similar 
assessment, saying, "We are satisfied that the people of South Africa were able 
to participate freely in the voting."

DEWINE WINS GOP SENATE PRIMARY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Gov. Michael DeWine handily won the GOP nomination Tuesday for retiring 
three-term Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's seat, defeating former National Institutes 
of Health director Bernadine P. Healy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Joel Hyatt, a millionaire lawyer who is Metzenbaum's 
son-in-law and handpicked choice for successor, held a lead over a woman 
commissioner who said the Senate needs "more moms." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohio Senate race was being closely watched as one of a handful that could 
imperil the Democrats' majority in Washington this fall. Democrats hold a 56-44 
edge in the Senate but are defending 22 of the 35 seats up for election. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Ohio, state Sen. Rob Burch won the Democratic nomination to challenge 
popular first-term Republican Gov. George V. Voinovich. 
</P>
<P>
 With 79% of precincts reporting in the Ohio Senate race, Hyatt had 341,301 
votes, or 47%, to Cuyahoga County Commissioner Mary Boyle's 314,654 votes, or 
43%. Columbus businessman Ralph Applegate was trailing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four-way race on the Republican side, DeWine had 351,705 votes, or 53%, 
to 211,229 votes, or 32%, for Healy. State Sen. Gene Watts and aviation 
consultant George Rhodes were splitting the balance of the vote.

STATE TO REOPEN BATTERED MORTGAGE GUARANTEE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal-Mortgage, the state loan guarantee program that was shut down by a 
$167-million default last year, will reopen under stringent new guidelines 
aimed at blocking risky financial ventures, state officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other rules, members of the program's advisory loan committee are barred 
from taking on loan guarantee applicants as clients. In addition, people 
employed by companies receiving loan guarantees may not personally profit from 
the loan proceeds, and the applicants must contribute part of the cost of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other guidelines were outlined Tuesday in a letter from 
Cal-Mortgage's parent agency, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development, to Standard & Poor's, the financial rating firm. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said the guidelines were crafted to address problems with two 
Cal-Mortgage loan guarantees approved in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One, involving the Encino-based Triad Healthcare Inc., is responsible for the 
$167-million default. Triad has since sought federal bankruptcy protection. The 
second deal involved a Beverly Hills company, Community Adult Care Centers of 
America Inc. (CACCOA). It resulted in a loss of nearly $5 million by 
Cal-Mortgage and has spawned a civil suit by the attorney general's office 
alleging fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, a member of the program's advisory loan committee, Vincent F. 
Forte, represented the applicants as broker on their loans, The Times has 
reported. His firm, Goldman Sachs & Co., netted $2.75 million in commissions 
from the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicants also had no equity in the deals. In the CACCOA case, the 
state's lawsuit alleges that officers and business associates of the company 
pocketed loan proceeds that were supposed to be used for construction of new 
health care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas McCaffery, assistant secretary of health and welfare, said the Triad 
and CACCOA problems were the consequence of "poor judgment calls" by previous 
Cal-Mortgage administrators and inadequate program safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 The former director, Larry G. Meeks, has alleged that he was offered -- and 
rejected -- bribes by CACCOA's chairman while the loan guarantee application 
was under review. The CACCOA official has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks also approved the deal even though CACCOA did not meet conditions 
recommended by the loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that there were problems," McCaffery said. "We are trying to 
make the changes now to put it on the right track because we do think that it 
is a good program." 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, Cal-Mortgage has helped nonprofit health care companies obtain 
low-interest loans by backing the debt with the state treasury. Triad and 
CACCOA marred an otherwise successful record. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffery said the program will give priority to health facility construction 
projects in underserved areas of the state, and will avoid deals of the size of 
Triad.

COURT DENIES GACY'S MOTION TO BLOCK EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Illinois Supreme Court on Tuesday denied a motion to block the execution 
of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy, 52, has two other lawsuits pending that could delay or block the 
execution set for Tuesday for the sex killings of 33 young men and boys. 
</P>
<P>
 He originally was scheduled to die on June 2, 1980, but appeals have kept him 
alive on Death Row at Menard Correctional Center in Chester. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy, a former building contractor who worked as a clown at children's 
parties, was convicted in 1980 of more murders than anyone else in U.S. history 
at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was accused of luring his victims to his home for sex, then strangling 
them. Twenty-seven bodies were found in the crawl space under his house. Others 
were found under the concrete floor of his garage and in rivers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's ruling, the state Supreme Court issued a three-sentence order 
denying Gacy's motions to either postpone or overturn the execution order.

ASSISTED SUICIDE BAN IN WASHINGTON STRUCK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Washington state law that bars physician-assisted suicide was ruled 
unconstitutional Tuesday on grounds that it deprives terminally ill patients of 
personal liberty guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding a suit brought by a group of doctors and others who help 
terminally ill patients commit suicide, U.S. District Judge Barbara J. 
Rothstein said that "a competent, terminally ill adult has a constitutionally 
guaranteed right . . . to commit physician-assisted suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothstein also wrote that she could not see the difference "between refusing 
life-sustaining medical treatment," which is constitutionally protected, and 
"physician-assisted suicide by an uncoerced, mentally competent, terminally ill 
adult." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the group, Compassion in Dying, called the decision voiding 
the law "a tremendous victory" and said that it should offer "a measure of 
confidence to physicians who might want to provide physician-assisted suicide." 
The group offers counseling and instruction to patients who are considering 
suicide but does not provide the means for ending life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Seaman, president of the Washington State Medical Assn., said that 
the decision "brings us very close to the slippery slope. Ethically, the 
doctor's role is taking care of the living patient." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 30 states have laws banning doctor-assisted suicide similar to the 
Washington law. Voters here turned down an initiative in 1991 that would have 
made doctor-assisted suicide legal for terminally ill patients, as did 
Californians in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the state attorney general's office said that it would decide 
in the next few days whether to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling came one day after a Detroit Recorder's Court jury 
acquitted Dr. Jack Kevorkian on a charge of violating Michigan's ban on 
assisted suicide in the death of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Kevorkian, who has been present at 20 deaths in Michigan since 1990, no 
one in Washington state has gone public with their efforts to assist in 
suicides.

NAVY TO SEEK WOMEN RECRUITS AND WIDEN THEIR COMBAT ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy must recruit more women and give them more chances to serve on combat 
ships, even on submarines, the new chief of the service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's image, scarred by the Tailhook sex scandal, will improve "once 
everybody is recognized to be equal in the workplace," Adm. Jeremy Boorda said 
in an interview with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Women serve on 57 of the Navy's 406 ships, but Boorda said his goal is nothing 
less than all ships. "The goal is everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief of naval operations announced his plans just 10 days after 
taking command of a service afflicted by recent reports of sexual harassment, 
lackluster leadership and cheating at the U.S. Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda said he will give the men and women of the Navy the chance to prove 
that the service is committed to equal opportunity in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do it as quickly as we can do it correctly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The admiral added that the goal may take some time to achieve because women 
must be integrated into crews at a proper pace in order to maintain a balance 
of trained sailors, new recruits and fighting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a profession that needs a lot of readiness, and it doesn't make sense 
to exclude half the population, does it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-star admiral said that current plans call for putting women on three 
aircraft carriers and 27 to 30 ships over the next three years, but that he has 
asked his staff to look into ways to integrate women into the service more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 55,600 women among the Navy's 482,800 total force. About 8,000 women 
are on ships at present, and women are scheduled to be assigned to 10 combat 
vessels this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the issue of putting women on submarines has been under study, Boorda 
said he has asked his personnel chief to "look at it hard, again." Complex 
issues of privacy and cost must be studied, since ships have to be reconfigured 
to accommodate private quarters for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for taking more women into the service, he said, is because his 
"bank" of recruits -- those who have signed up to be drawn into the service 
several months later -- has dropped.

U.S. COURT REWRITES ITS CHAPTER ON HARSH BOOK REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual move, a U.S. appeals court here reversed itself Tuesday 
and ruled that the New York Times cannot be forced to pay damages for 
publishing a harshly critical book review. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling nullifies a controversial opinion issued by the court in February 
that appeared to open the door to libel suits against critics who pan movies, 
plays, restaurants, books or anything else offered to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Harry Edwards, reversing his earlier opinion, declared that he now 
believes "spirited critiques of literary works" must be shielded from libel 
suits, except when they launch a false "personal attack" on the author. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a $10-million lawsuit filed against the newspaper by Dan E. 
Moldea, author of a book linking organized crime to the National Football 
League. A book reviewer had written last September that Moldea was guilty of 
"sloppy journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Moldea's lawsuit had been revived by the appeals court in a 2-1 ruling. "For 
an author, a harsh review in the New York Times Book Review is at least as 
damaging as accusations of incompetence made against an attorney or surgeon in 
a legal or medical journal," Judge Edwards wrote in the original ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, critics and columnists dealt Edwards plenty of harsh criticism 
and at least a few accusations of incompetence. For example, columnist James J. 
Kilpatrick slammed the decision but conceded that he was thinking twice about 
"what I myself write about fat-headed federal judges." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, Edwards had switched sides and joined the critics of his original 
opinion. In a 20-page ruling, Edwards confessed to an "error of judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a long and rich history in our cultural and legal traditions of 
affording reviewers latitude to comment on literary and other works," Edwards 
wrote. "While a bad review necessarily has the effect of injuring an author's 
reputation to some extent . . . , criticism's long and impressive pedigree 
persuades us that -- while a critic's latitude is not unlimited -- he or she 
must be given the constitutional 'breathing space' appropriate to the genre." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Patricia Wald switched sides with Edwards for a 3-0 ruling. The new 
decision, at least for now, kills Moldea's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the New York Times praised the judge's reversal as "courageous." 
Moldea denounced it as "very bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am amazed," said Prof. Rodney Smolla, a libel expert at the College of 
William and Mary. "I've never heard of one like that in my life. I have heard 
of circuit conflicts (within an appeals court) but not an interpersonality 
split in one judge," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawyers said that, while it is quite unusual, it is not unprecedented 
for judges to change their mind and retract an earlier opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer who represented Moldea said that he will ask the full 11-member 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to reconsider the 
decision. Failing that, he will ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited four years for a trial. Now they've jerked it away, and that 
hurts," said Roger Simmons, Moldea's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his legal fight, Moldea has said that he sued the newspaper over 
what he considered false and misleading statements in its book review, not over 
the sharp criticism itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran investigative reporter, Moldea drew links between the mob and the 
NFL in his 1989 book, "Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Pro 
Football." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 3, New York Times sports writer Gerald Eskenazi panned the book 
and said that it was full of "errors and unfounded insinuations." For example, 
the reviewer wrote, Moldea "revives the discredited notion that (former Los 
Angeles Rams owner) Carroll Rosenbloom met foul play" when he drowned off a 
Florida beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldea's suit notes, however, that his book concludes by saying: "In short, 
the evidence appears to be clear that Rosenbloom died in a tragic accident and 
was not murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing this and five other examples, Moldea maintains that he was damaged by 
the reviewer's false statements about his book. 
</P>
<P>
 His claim was boosted by a 1990 Supreme Court ruling which said that opinion 
columnists are no longer immune from libel suits. If they make factually false 
and hurtful statements -- "Smith lied in his testimony," for example -- they 
too can be subjected to a libel suit, just like a news reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the February opinion, Judge Edwards and his colleagues had said that jurors 
should review the evidence and decide who is telling the truth: the author or 
the reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new opinion, however, they say that the reviewers should be protected 
in their right to evaluate books, without facing second-guessing by a jury.

GRAPHIC J.F.K. ASSASSINATION CAR PHOTOS, RECORDS RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gruesome photographs of the interior of President John F. Kennedy's limousine 
were released Tuesday by the National Archives, but nearly 50,000 documents 
also made public shed little additional light on the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The black and white photos, taken after the vehicle was returned to Washington 
from Dallas after Kennedy's death, bear mute testimony to the horrors witnessed 
by those riding close to the President's car in the Nov. 22, 1963, motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodstains are smeared on the Lincoln's leather seats, and blood has soaked 
the carpeted footwells and the upholstery underneath the seat. A crushed, 
bloodstained bouquet of chrysanthemums, given to Jacqueline Kennedy at Love 
Field, sit on the seat near where Kennedy slumped; rose petals from another 
bouquet are scattered on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying diagrams show that bullet fragments were retrieved from the 
vehicle's floor; autopsy X-rays of a portion of Kennedy's skull also are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also feature numerous photos of a crack on the inside of the 
limousine's windshield, a piece of evidence investigators used to help conclude 
that Kennedy had been killed by bullets fired from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight spent cartridges, test-fired from the Manlicher-Carcano rifle with which 
Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly killed Kennedy, were also released. Accompanying 
documents make clear that the ballistics tests show that the bullets match 
those used in J.F.K.'s assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The photos were among files from FBI headquarters in Washington and FBI field 
offices in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The records were among 224 boxes of material, containing at least 50,000 new 
documents. They were released under a 1992 law that requires federal agencies 
to release all records related to their investigations of Kennedy's murder and 
Oswald's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is here today will not cause significant change in what people think -- 
either for people who think there was a conspiracy or people who think there 
wasn't," said Steve Tilley, the J.F.K. liaison at the National Archives. "What 
we have here today is a lot of detail."

STATE COMPUTER SERVICES IN DISARRAY, REPORT SAYS; GOVERNMENT: LEGISLATIVE 
ANALYST SAYS A $44-MILLION DMV SNAFU SHOWS DUPLICATION AND WASTE. TECHNOLOGY 
OFFICE IS BLAMED FOR PROBLEMS IN SEVERAL OTHER AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the heels of a $44-million computer snafu at the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles, the legislative analyst warned Tuesday that a lack of adequate 
management controls over state computer systems is producing duplication and 
waste that undermines the state's $1-billion-a-year computer investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says that the $44 million for a Department of Motor Vehicles 
computer operation that has no hope of working is only one example of a system 
operating without proper controls. 
</P>
<P>
 It warned of problem projects in the Department of Social Services, Department 
of Corrections, State Board of Equalization and Stephen P. Teale Data Center, a 
hub of high-tech information processing for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The report charged that the Office of Information Technology "bears 
significant responsibility for these problems" and urged the Legislature to 
shift its responsibilities to a new entity that would report directly to the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The state lacks a statewide plan for information technology and has no 
centralized, effective leadership to guide the state's growing reliance on 
computers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 California has spent billions of dollars on an array of separate state 
government computer operations, many of which cannot communicate with each 
other. Also, some agencies independently collect duplicative data, while others 
cannot convert the data into useful information, said the legislative analyst, 
the Legislature's chief budget adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect is an expenditure of $1 billion a year for information 
technology that is not producing an optimum return on the investment and in 
many cases is "not even producing a reasonably good return," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst singled out for criticism the little-known state Office of 
Information Technology, part of the Department of Finance. For 11 years, the 
office has been charged with overseeing design, development and implementation 
of computer operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's office declined to comment on the report, referring 
reporters to the Finance Department. Department spokesman H.D. Palmer defended 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state's computer operations had received favorable recognition 
nationally and accused the legislative analyst of failing to recognize that 
computer needs of state agencies vary widely and defy a "cookie cutter-type" 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Information Technology, Palmer said, seeks to provide guidance 
to state agencies so they can establish their own strategies without 
dictatorial interference. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislative analyst said the office often gets bogged down in narrow 
procedural issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said she intends to propose a 
moratorium on all major computer purchases until a statewide plan is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DMV failure is (the) $44-million tip of a multibillion iceberg," Bowen 
said.

RAMS MAKE FIRST MOVE; VOICES / ON THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE RAMS MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Here's a cross-section of opinion from fans and readers who called TimesLink 
or faxed The Times Orange County with their response to the questions: How much 
of a loss would it be if the Rams leave Anaheim, and how far should local 
officials go to keep them? 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a Ram fan for some 42 years. In the last few years it has become 
evident that the ownership does not understand the fans. It doesn't matter if 
you have the best stadium in the world, a consistent losing and mismanaged team 
will not be financially successful in Orange County. As a taxpayer in Anaheim, 
I would be extremely upset if the city officials decided to subsidize the Rams 
in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 ART SATTLER, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be no loss if the Rams left Anaheim. We shouldn't subsidize teams 
like this. We have given them enough incentive to remain. It is time we draw 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 BARBARA MONTGOMERY, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We're missing a great opportunity! Let's build a state-of-the-art football 
stadium that would house both the Rams and Raiders (the Giants and Jets share 
the Meadowlands.) A site near the L.A./Orange County border could be supported 
by the people and leaders of both counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A quality football stadium would solidify the Southland's pro football future 
for another 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB LOWE, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim should not do anything to keep the Rams. Let them go in peace. I am 
tired of reading of the tightwad, childish, arrogant, obnoxious attitude of 
owner Georgia Frontiere and the Rams organization, which expects undying 
devotion from everybody. They try to wring every dollar out of everyone but 
don't spend the money on what they need, which is a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 BRITT NICHOLS, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know about the economic loss, but as far as officials going out of 
their way to keep the team, it would be a great mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB CARGINIAN, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I used to plan my entire year around going to Ram games; then the NFL strike. 
In the last few, not only have I not been to a game, but I don't bother to 
watch them on TV either. Let them leave. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK HART, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We all know the Rams' executive vice president, John Shaw, is a real pain in 
the butt! Anaheim and people like (Councilman Irv) Pickler helped create this 
problem when they broke their neck to install The Pond and Mighty Ducks hockey 
nearby but didn't raise a finger to help the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB WOLFF, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a Ram season-ticket holder since the first season at Anaheim. They 
sure don't show any compassion or loyalty to the fans. When I say "Go Rams," I 
mean get out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL MOERSCHBAECHER, San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the city can spend a portion of the money they are making 
on The Pond on keeping the Rams in Anaheim. The Rams don't want to move, but 
they do want a sweeter deal. City officials should give them one. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUG HELLER, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We should just let the Rams move. I was a season-ticket holder for 20 years, 
and shortly after Georgia took over, I got disgusted. She wouldn't spend any 
money on the team, the team went to hell, so I gave up my season tickets and 
wouldn't go to another game. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES MARSHALL, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I know that a lot of the fans are disgusted with the Rams and are saying "let 
them move." But I don't believe that this makes sense for the fans as well as 
Anaheim. I feel that the Anaheim officials have to find a way to keep them 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that the Rams are having track back to the owner. She is not a 
football person. The reality of her problems are that if she does move the 
team, she will end up in the same mess that she has today. 
</P>
<P>
 JIM SULLIVAN, Balboa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a Rams season-ticket holder since 1969, it is a sad day that the Rams 
exercised their option to leave. But I support Anaheim in their hard-line 
negotiations with the ingrates known as "Ram management." Frankly, I wish 
somehow the Rams would stay, with Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw riding off 
into the sunset. Unfortunately, this is not a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN DOBSON, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are very good reasons why Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, San Antonio and 
Hartford want to bring the Rams to their communities. Besides the pride and 
enjoyment that the community gets, the main reason is money. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time that Anaheim recognized it needs to get on par with the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT S. BEVACQUA, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams were a public corporation, the shareholders would have ousted them 
a long time ago. Georgia Frontiere is not a leader in the sports franchise 
business, where leadership is paramount. John Shaw is a weak, introverted and 
spineless individual who will never be a leader. There is no commitment to 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
 GREG ARNOLD, Corona 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like I'm watching the movie "Major League," where the owner is trying 
to run the organization into the ground so she can move it into greener 
pastures. It would be a terrible loss for the Rams and Anaheim to let them 
leave. Anaheim has to do whatever it can to keep the Rams in town. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE GAMBOA, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a tremendous loss for this community if they were to leave. The 
team is an icon of the community. You can't just pick up a team and transport 
it like it is some player in the free-agency situation. All these teams are 
supported by the Orange County area, not just Anaheim, so why can't Anaheim 
pool from surrounding tax bases to help keep the Rams here? 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE ROY, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams ought to stay. The city ought to do something -- it ought to look to 
the future. They are a big bonus for Anaheim. Anaheim ought to go to bat, get 
the state and possibly Orange County to get behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIAN TYRRELL, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county should be building a stadium for the Rams. How about the Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station as a new stadium site? 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT BLITZ, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They can leave any time they wish to. Right now they are attempting to hold 
the Orange County people hostage, and at this point, Frontiere and Shaw can 
pack up and as long as we can get positive proof that they are going to leave 
town, I'll be a happy camper. I'll take any expansion team over the deadbeat 
Rams at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK RITOLI, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim shouldn't do a single thing to keep the Rams. They have been 
crybabies, losers, and they should go, and good luck to them. I hope we do no 
spending of public money whatever to retain them. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. TOM ENGLAND, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a big loss if we were to lose the Rams, economically as well as 
socially. We should do everything possible to keep them even if that means 
giving them more money for the parking and things of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL WRIGHT, Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim ought to let John Shaw and Georgia Frontiere take the Rams and move to 
St. Louis, Baltimore or even down to San Antonio. If they think the grass is 
greener on the other side, let them go. Anaheim, Orange County or L.A. 
shouldn't push any further than they have. 
</P>
<P>
 RUSS McCARTHY, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Rams might be leaving L.A. and Orange County stinks. The 
Rams should be retained at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE PATRIDGE, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They can leave any day and, if necessary, I'm sure a lot of people in Anaheim 
would be willing to help them pack. If it costs the taxpayers any money, I say 
let them go, we don't need them. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMIE WILLIAMS, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim should make every effort to keep the Rams in town by going 
ahead and making it more lucrative for the Rams to stay. In addition, the Rams 
fans should work to keep the Rams in Anaheim by attending the 1994 season 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
 TIMOTHY X. LANE, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I'm concerned, the Rams can go. We've given all that we should give. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK WINNING, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I feel no loss at all if the Rams leave. I would like to see Anaheim spend the 
money on a new stadium to get the Raiders to play in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 DANIEL STENGE, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that the Rams leaving Anaheim would not be that great a loss. But if 
we're going to continue to have pro football here, Anaheim should be building a 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN NOOTBAAR, South Laguna 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am not concerned at all about the Rams leaving Orange County. They've shown 
no loyalty whatsoever to either Orange County or Anaheim. They don't even carry 
our name, for heaven's sake. I say good riddance, don't let the door hit them 
in the butt. 
</P>
<P>
 JIM CARNETT, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would love to see the Rams leave. Anaheim shouldn't do anything to keep them 
here. We need to get them out of town. They are terrible. That would create 
more games on TV for us. With the money the families save, they can go out and 
invest in a second TV and watch more games on TV and have a family outing in 
their own living room. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVE FULLER, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a terrific loss if the Rams left Anaheim. Anaheim should be a 
little bit smarter in keeping the team considering that most cities don't have 
the luck of having a team, let alone the Rams. They've got a tremendous history 
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL KALLAY, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We should let them go. The Rams, owner, general manager and the team, have 
been a continual embarrassment to all of Southern California.

 The windshield on a New York-bound passenger jet cracked half an hour after 
takeoff Tuesday, but the plane returned to the airport without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Flight 96 took off from San Francisco International Airport at 11 a.m. 
and was flying at 30,000 feet when cracks suddenly appeared on the outer 
lamination of the pilot-side windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was rapid spider-web cracking," said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. "The 
crew said you could hear it -- it was somewhat frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing had hit the plane, the crew reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot dropped the Boeing 767 to 10,000 feet and turned around to San 
Francisco, where the plane landed about noon, he said.

DIABLOS HAVING DEVIL OF A TIME; PREP WEDNESDAY: MISSION VIEJO'S ATHLETIC 
PROGRAM, ONCE THE ENVY OF ORANGE COUNTY, HAS BEEN DECIMATED BY INFIGHTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stoic expressions born of disbelief and shame crossed the faces of Mission 
Viejo High coaches and players as the game clock wound down on an October night 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of their torment was a 42-7 loss to Mater Dei in a nonleague 
football game at Santa Ana Stadium -- an experience with which the proud 
Diablos were unfamiliar. Mission Viejo entered the game undefeated and ranked 
No. 1 in Orange County, but it left with the cheering of Mater Dei's coaches, 
fans and players ringing in its ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key performers were unavailable because of injuries, but many of the 
team's supporters believe there was more at work in the drubbing. The effects 
of years of turmoil on the Mission Viejo campus -- and in the community -- were 
catching up with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a real beating," said Ken Sjobom, a Mission Viejo teacher and 
former longtime assistant football coach. "In all my years, we were never 
beaten like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Including the rout by Mater Dei, Mission Viejo was 3-4 in its final seven 
games after winning its first four. What's more, the Diablos lost in the first 
round of the Southern Section playoffs for the first time in more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not had a winning season since. But what occurred last year was 
especially galling to ardent supporters; the Diablos failed to qualify for the 
playoffs for the first time since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 For the football team, 1991 proved to be a watershed. By the end of the next 
season, the corps of coaches who helped create and sustain football excellence 
at Mission Viejo would be gutted. And the problems were not exclusive to the 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost three years later, those demons have yet to be exorcised. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mission Viejo is attempting to piece together a football program -- and 
an athletic department -- that once was second to none in the county. Both 
became casualties in a war of ideology over a school logo and repeated losers 
in political battles with a principal whose style of leadership has been 
strongly criticized by coaches, parents and teachers, although he is commended 
for the school's academic prowess. And while some believe Mission Viejo is well 
on the road to recovery, others doubt the Diablos will ever walk as successful 
a path again. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, Mission Viejo was the yardstick by which other public school 
athletic departments in the county were measured. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the late 1970s, the Diablos dominated Southern Section play. Few 
schools in the state have sustained as high a level of play in as many sports 
over an equal period of time. Cal-Hi Sports selected Mission Viejo its state 
school of the year three times (1981, '86 and '87) for overall athletic 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1977-90, the football team won eight South Coast League championships, 
two section titles and played in another section title game. The Diablos 
advanced to at least the semifinal round from 1984-90, and totaled 10 or more 
victories four consecutive seasons (1987-90). Mission Viejo was ranked first in 
the final county football poll in 1988 and '90. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Crow remembers those glory days well. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow led Mission Viejo to a section title in 1981 and was 73-22-6 in seven 
seasons as head coach. He stepped down in 1987 and is now an assistant at 
Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real fortunate," Crow said. "We did operate at a pretty successful 
level for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 And several other sports also provided their share of league titles and 
section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' swimming and diving team won the section's major-division title from 
1975-88. The girls did the same from 1976-86. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where it was a shock if we didn't win the (swimming) 
titles," said Assistant Principal Wil Chong, who has spent 17 years at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, Mission Viejo played in a section title game in 1985. The team 
won league championships in 1978 and '89, and qualified for the playoffs 12 
times from 1976-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball also produced its share of trophies. The boys' team won four league 
titles and played in two section title games from 1976-85. The girls won 
section championships in 1982 and '87. There was also continued success in 
boys' and girls' soccer, track and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mission Viejo has fallen hard. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fall and winter sports seasons, Mission Viejo was 36th out of 38 
large-division schools (at least 1,200 students) in competition for The Times' 
All-Sports Awards. The Diablos had 41.025 points. Edison was first with 237.67. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times uses a formula based on teams' winning percentages, finish in league 
and playoff results to determine points. Out of all public schools in Orange 
County, Mission Viejo had the third-lowest score. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo posted winning records in only two of 11 varsity sports it 
fielded in the fall and winter sessions. Judging by Mission Viejo's current 
spring records, it probably will not improve much. 
</P>
<P>
 Even factoring in changes in enrollment and the cyclical nature of sports in 
public schools, such a sweeping decline is troubling to many. Some say 
situations that could have been avoided have irreparably damaged the program. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hattrup is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1976 graduate of the school, Hattrup led Mission Viejo to its two girls' 
basketball section titles and seven league titles in 10 years. This season he 
took over the Brea-Olinda girls' program, where he had been an assistant since 
1987. The Ladycats were undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfortunate," Hattrup said. "I felt that we had one of the best 
coaching staffs, if not the best, in Orange County at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the coaches got along, and we all did things together. I'm glad I made 
the move not just because of the national championship but also for other 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem loomed larger than the battle of wills over the logo. 
</P>
<P>
 A fierce-looking devil was formerly used to represent the school's nickname. 
Diablo is Spanish for devil. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1986, the Saddleback Valley Unified School District banned the logo 
amid complaints by fundamentalist Christians in the community. The group 
pushing for change said the image represented evil and wanted the Diablo name 
to go as well. A compromise was reached to ban only the logo. 
</P>
<P>
 A drawing of a bulldog was adopted, and students were told they could no 
longer display the old logo on campus. But the bulldog never caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board's decision divided the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students defied the action, displaying the banned emblem on hats, 
jackets and T-shirts during school and in the stands at games. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry words were exchanged at school meetings, and two lawsuits were filed by 
parents who claimed their children's free-speech rights were being infringed 
upon. One suit was settled, and the other is still pending, according to a 
district spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Ohman was president of the school's All-Sports Booster Club when the 
controversy hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole thing created the Hatfields and the McCoys," Ohman said. "We had 
always been a very close-knit (school), but that created factions." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to again unite the community, school officials held an election in 1993 
to decide on a new logo. A depiction of a smiling baby devil, the only option 
remotely resembling the previous logo, was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 But that move has been stalled because of a copyright problem. Even if the new 
logo does mollify some, sources said, several fences cannot be mended. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said the logo issue cost Mike Rush, the former head football coach, his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush had sided with players and students who rebelled against the ban, which 
sources said enraged Principal Robert Metz. Metz is described by some coaches, 
teachers and boosters as a domineering administrator who does not permit 
opposition from the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Metz admits he runs a tight ship, he rebuts charges of Draconian rule. 
And even Metz's harshest critics praise him for academic strides made under 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metz went crazy over the whole devil thing," said one former booster club 
member who asked to remain anonymous. "Metz wanted (Rush) to prevent the kids 
from wearing any stuff with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metz wanted him to watch the kids 24 hours a day. Rush said you can't watch 
kids 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Memos obtained by The Times show that Metz pressured Rush, and other members 
of the athletic department, to enforce the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In one memo to Rush dated Nov. 4, 1992, Metz wrote: "Apparently, the devil on 
the hat has expanded to include the varsity (football) team. I expect you to 
take care of the situation with your (team)." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush did not fulfill Metz's mandate and was given an ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metz gave him a (form) to sign, which said that Rush would stop everyone from 
wearing the devil," the former booster club member said. "When Rush refused to 
sign, Metz forced him to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush was fired by Metz in March, 1993, after five seasons as head coach and 15 
total on the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush died of a heart attack eight months later at age 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Metz declined to discuss the situation, saying he could not because it is a 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 99% of things might be different if that logo stuff never came up," 
Ohman said. "Personalities got involved, and it created one problem after 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 A group calling itself the Committee For Concerned Parents spearheaded a 
movement to have the stadium at Mission Viejo named in honor of Rush, but the 
district torpedoed the plan because Mission Viejo shares the stadium with 
Laguna Hills. The board has asked for other memorial recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel an injustice was committed against Mike Rush," said Arleen Brown, 
co-founder of the committee. "Mike Rush was forced to resign because he refused 
to uphold the illegal ban on the Diablo mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should have to go through the stress he went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Metz said he never deals with his staff in an unprofessional manner. But Rush 
was not the only coach with whom he battled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave (Wally) Clark said Metz drove him from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was an assistant coach on the football and baseball teams from 1981-90. 
He said he had a good relationship with Metz -- until his son won the varsity 
catching job over Metz's son during the 1989 baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the football coach at Murrieta Valley, Clark is speaking about the 
situation for the first time publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the season, we had no clue he was so upset," Clark said. "He was 
angry, and he never said anything to us, but when the season was over he blew 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings with Clark and Coach Ron Drake after the season, Clark said Metz 
lambasted them for not starting his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us we were horrible coaches," Clark said. "He wasn't talking to us as 
a parent, he was talking to us as a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in that type of position, you have to sometimes divorce yourself 
from being a parent. He had a hard time doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark remained at Mission Viejo for one more year and left for Murrieta Valley 
before the start of the 1991 school year. He said his final year on campus was 
the most difficult of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't talk for the whole year before I left . . . not a word was spoken 
between us," Clark said. "The stress and the strain really got to me. Knowing 
your boss hated you was real tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake spent 17 years at Mission Viejo as the head baseball coach and a 
football assistant. He left the football team after the 1991 season and 
resigned as the baseball coach last season despite great success -- a 249-134 
record and 12 playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his resignation, Drake said he was stepping down for personal 
reasons. Drake will not comment on the situation, but friends have said he was 
badly hurt by Metz's anger toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I want to say is that I have a lot of fond memories and a lot 
of passion for (Mission Viejo)," said Drake, who transferred to Laguna Hills 
before the start of the school year. Drake spent the previous year assisting in 
baseball and football at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened bothers me a lot. It was very difficult, but I don't want to 
talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark blames Metz for much of what has happened to the school's athletic 
program -- especially in football. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, Metz is a great principal," Clark said. "Academically, he took 
that school to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the demise of the program began when the administration got rid off all 
the coaches, and it was all for personal reasons. All of a sudden, everything 
we built just went away because of personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark applied for the football coaching position after Rush resigned but was 
turned down. Marty Spalding was selected, which angered many parents. Spalding 
was formerly an assistant at archrival El Toro, and he further angered some 
parents by hiring former El Toro Coach Bob Johnson as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spalding and Johnson came in with three strikes on them," said Ohman, former 
president of the booster club. "The community would have responded to any other 
coaches but them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo went 4-6 and missed the playoffs last season. Spalding resigned 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being an assistant coach on the football team, Sjobom was the 
head coach on the junior varsity baseball team from 1979-84 and 1987-92. He 
assisted Drake in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When Drake resigned, Sjobom applied for the varsity job. But he was turned 
down despite having won eight league titles and 69% of his games (162-72). 
</P>
<P>
 The job was given to Pat Wren, who arrived at Mission Viejo in 1992 and had a 
record of 4-16 on the junior varsity in 1993. This season, the baseball team is 
last in the South Coast League at 3-17, 0-11 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjobom declined to discuss the baseball-coaching situation or to elaborate on 
his reasons for leaving the football team. Wren did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Metz denies Clark's claim about the outbursts and said coaches who left 
Mission Viejo did so on their own volition. Metz said he does not use his 
position as principal to influence selection committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the coaches leaving had anything to do with my leadership ability," 
Metz said. "There was nothing personal with respect to the way I've dealt with 
my staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that there is nothing in my regime that allows for 
anything personal. I don't deal in that format. I have never dealt like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Metz, who has been principal since 1981, agrees the coaching turnover in 
baseball and football has been high and that the instability has weakened the 
programs. But Metz blames the turnover on what he said was conflict within the 
previous football staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Chong is in charge of the athletic department. He, too, 
places the responsibility for the turnover on the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Metz) had trouble dealing with anyone," Chong said. "If there 
comes a time when coaches don't feel they can go along with the philosophy of 
the administration, then they have a choice to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Metz and Chong said the problems with the coaching situation cannot 
solely account for the decline in won-loss records. They pinpoint declining 
enrollment as the main culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the difficulties we have to face in playing Division I athletics is 
that our competition has as many as 700 to 800 students more than us," Metz 
said. "When you compare the number of blue-chip athletes per hundred, obviously 
the greater number of students you have the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo has suffered a continual decline in the student body since its 
peak enrollment of 2,699 in 1977, according to the district. Mission Viejo is 
the oldest school in the district, and some of its enrollment has been pulled 
away with the opening of El Toro, Laguna Hills and Trabuco Hills high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As of April 1, Mission Viejo was the third-largest school in the district with 
an enrollment of 1,678. El Toro (2,092) is first and Trabuco Hills (1,714) 
second. Throughout the late 1970s and '80s, Mission Viejo's enrollment remained 
about 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo has the lowest enrollment in the South Coast League, although it 
is not the smallest school competing in Division I. But Metz and Chong argue 
that shrinking enrollment, coupled with the emergence of nearby, private Santa 
Margarita as an athletic force, have combined to dilute the talent pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, they said it is impossible for Mission Viejo to maintain its 
former level of dominance. That theory, however, does not hold water. Despite a 
significant enrollment drop, Edison still runs one of the best athletic 
programs in the county, as shown by The Times' All-Sports rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mission Viejo's enrollment drop didn't immediately signal doom for the 
football program. In 1990, the Diablos were 11-2 and advanced to a section 
semifinal. Enrollment then was 1,700, only slightly higher than today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to win every year, but that's not realistic," Metz said. "We're 
not going to win (section titles) again and again and again and again like we 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 So in what direction does Mission Viejo head now? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, more change is taking place. And many believe the current moves will 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially the biggest boost to the program, several Diablo supporters said, 
will come in July when Metz leaves to become director of secondary education 
for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Principal Duffy Clark will replace Metz. The Tillers maintained and 
cultivated a strong athletic program during Clark's six-year tenure as 
principal, a fact that pleases current All-Sports Booster Club President John 
Dellos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted someone who recognized that athletics are an integral part of a 
school program," said Dellos, a member of the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clark: "Athletics play a part in a total school program. It's one of the 
three major components, along with academics and other activities, that help to 
create a successful environment." 
</P>
<P>
 New football Coach Bill Denny also wants to help the Mission Viejo 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly an assistant under Rush and Spalding, Denny is popular with many 
parents. They believe he can put the program back on solid ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have rallied around Denny," said Ohman, who also announces 
Diablo football games. "The real feeling is that he can bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Denny has moved swiftly. He is bringing in former players to coach and teach 
current players about the program's tradition. Boys' Athletic Director Steve 
Carnes, who coached Lawndale Leuzinger to a section title in 1985, will also 
lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny has talked with the players about putting troubles behind and banding 
together to get back on top. He also plans to speak with the booster club soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take the positive from the past, and combine that with some energetic 
new people and build on that," he said. "I want the kids here to feel like they 
are special because they're playing at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the feeling I want to build on because this is a special place." 
</P>
<P>
 As many can attest, that's a feeling few have had at Mission Viejo in quite 
awhile. 20 Years of Mission Viejo Football 05,06,08,16,23,16 Year Record League

NFL WOULD BE FOND OF A FAREWELL BY RAMS; ANALYSIS: BECAUSE OF TV REVENUE 
POSSIBILITIES, LEAGUE WOULD BE HAPPY IF THIS WERE A ONE-TEAM TOWN AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is Sunday in early October. We are on our way to watch the Rams play the 
first-place New Orleans Saints, and we are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't going to arrive until 90 minutes before the game. This being the 
NFL, we know what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived an hour before a game in Kansas City and were stuck in traffic that 
stretched across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived an hour before a game at Cleveland Stadium, then spent the next 30 
minutes in the parking lot, navigating through flaming hibachis and bellowing 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL no longer does games, but rather events. As we approach Anaheim 
Stadium at 11:30 a.m., we know we are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But then we hear the strangest sound one can hear while attending the most 
popular spectator sport in America. We hear nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no traffic. There are a few hundred cars in the lot, there are people 
standing outside those cars, but there is no sound. 
</P>
<P>
 No music, no cheering, no laughter, no arguing. A New Orleans fan yodels an 
insult. It goes unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 We stop our car within 50 yards of the gate. We walk inside, thinking the 
excitement must be in there. We are wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
 Checkered with empty seats, the stadium whispers. Fans watch this game as if 
they are watching it on TV. By the fourth quarter, those still here have 
changed channels. 
</P>
<P>
 And you wonder what the NFL thinks about the announcement Tuesday that the 
Rams are officially thinking of leaving Anaheim in 15 months? 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL thinks the NFL has already left Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL thinks the NFL never should have had two teams in the Los Angeles area 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Although league officials will not make substantive comments on the issue, the 
feeling at 410 Park Ave. in New York is clear: 
</P>
<P>
 They will not attempt to block any Ram attempts to move. 
</P>
<P>
 They have scant legal precedent for holding up a move -- see Al Davis vs. Pete 
Rozelle, 1982. But legal precedent has never stopped their lawyers -- see the 
owners vs. the union, almost any year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the league will not attempt to grab Georgia Frontiere's jersey has 
more to do with common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the teachings of former Commissioner Pete Rozelle, an area native, 
officials have believed that two pro football teams would never enjoy long-term 
success in this town. 
</P>
<P>
 One team, certainly. Two, never. 
</P>
<P>
 They wonder if fans here, many of them transplanted from other areas, are 
loyal enough for the game. More than any other sport, football survives best 
where it is considered not a sport, but a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The league knows the fans here want to see stars, and football players wear 
helmets. They know the fans here are impatient with anything other than good 
times, whereas football is about sticking together through hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo . . . because the fans there see 
themselves as part of the team," said Marc Shatz, a Beverly Hills clinical 
psychologist who formerly worked with UCLA sports teams. "It's a group 
mentality that is missing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans go to the Lakers and Dodgers because they consider that 
entertainment. Pro football, unless you are winning, is not viewed like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that two teams here will never succeed at the gate, officials 
believe two teams are not worth the damage that a two-team town can cause to a 
TV contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The television issue revolves around that lucrative advertising vehicle, the 
network Sunday doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 What, you are unfamiliar with that? That's because Southern California viewers 
rarely see that doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the NFL's billion-dollar broadcasting contract, doubleheaders can 
only be shown in two-team towns when both teams are on the road, or one of them 
plays sometime other than Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 17 weeks of the next regular season, Los Angeles-area TV sets will 
receive three doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same span in Minneapolis, an average NFL one-team community, fans 
will be offered 12 doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 5.7 million television homes in Los Angeles will miss at least 27 hours 
of games simply because we have two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more money would advertisers pay a network for 27 extra hours of 
telecasts to the nation's second-largest TV market? How much more money would 
the networks pay the league for that prime time? 
</P>
<P>
 To further understand the league officials' feelings about this area, look no 
further than its handling of the marquee Monday night games. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't trust us with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the 1986 season, a span of eight years, the Raiders 
have not played a Monday night game at home. The Rams have played only five. 
</P>
<P>
 In that same span, the San Francisco 49ers have been the host team in 12 
Monday night games. 
</P>
<P>
 The league is not afraid of gangs outside our stadiums. It is afraid of the 
empty seats inside. 
</P>
<P>
 For NFL officials, having their most-watched game of the week blacked out in a 
market this large because the game was not a sellout would be unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this skepticism is anything new. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rams moved from the Coliseum to Anaheim in 1980, Los Angeles City 
Council members approached then-Commissioner Rozelle about getting an expansion 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozelle told them he would think about it. But being a native, he had already 
thought about it. He never gave expansion here a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Rozelle was doing much more than protecting the integrity of 
the league when he tried to stop Davis' move here from Oakland. He was trying 
to keep one of his teams from making what he thought was a huge marketing 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders must know this now. That is why any talk of Al Davis moving 
anywhere before knowing what the Rams are doing is naive. 
</P>
<P>
 On the verge of finally owning this town -- and the Raiders would own this 
town -- why would Davis want to leave? 
</P>
<P>
 He won't. The Rams will. The NFL will turn its head, the better to hide its 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * ESCAPE CLAUSE: Rams pay $2 million to Anaheim, making them free to leave 
Anaheim Stadium in 1995 and able to entertain other offers. A1

MIKE DOWNEY: MARQUETTE CHOPS DOWN THE WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hip, hip hooray and yahoo for Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wis., P.C.U.* 
</P>
<P>
 (* Politically Correct University.) 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Marquette Warriors officially became the Marquette Golden Eagles 
by a vote of students. Marquetters, with a firm push from Father Albert J. 
DiUlio, the university president, agreed that to call oneself a Warrior could 
be offensive not only to people of Native American persuasion, but to women of 
all persuasions. 
</P>
<P>
 In my ignorance, I had never known warrior to be sexually specific. Sure 
enough, though, in my dictionary one is identified as "a man experienced in war 
or battle; a fighting man." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman, for example, is a warrior. He even wears war paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette women do not desire to be called warriors. Nor do they care to be 
called some stupid name such as Lady Warriors, the way other schools call their 
women stupid names such as Lady Orangemen, Lady Cowboys or, in one particularly 
comical case, Lady Gamecocks. 
</P>
<P>
 I can hear it now: 
</P>
<P>
 "Next batter, Number 22, the Lady Cowboy lady first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more heartening is Marquette's brave move on behalf of Native Americans. 
Seeing as how Wisconsin is a state with villages named Waukesha, Wautoma, 
Kenosha, Kewaunee, Menomonie, Manitowoc, Tomahawk and Chippewa Falls, I figure 
this was the least everybody up there could do. All of my old friends there 
salute you, including the Milwaukee Bucks and their wives, the Lady Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days ago, President Clinton invited the leaders of 547 federally 
recognized tribes to the White House to review their concerns. His entire 
Cabinet attended. Three hundred twenty-two tribal leaders were there. Indian 
honor guards presented the U.S. flag as well as their own eagle staff. Many 
came in native dress. Clinton said, "Welcome to the White House -- welcome 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those at the ceremony was a man named gaiashkobos. He is chairman of 
the Lac Courte Oreilles Chippewa nation of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Said gaiashkobos, "It has taken the United States and the Indian nations 200 
years to come to the point where we can begin to deal with one another as 
sovereign nations. A new day has begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it has at Marquette, at least, which made a respectful and civilized 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Cleveland Indians would do the same, changing their name as well 
as their address, blotting that laughing Indian face off their scoreboard and 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Atlanta Braves would do the same, rather than encourage supposedly 
enlightened individuals including former president Jimmy Carter, who should 
know better, to sit there doing mock Indian chants and "tomahawk chops." 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Washington Redskins would do the same, instead of clinging to a 
name so vile and scurrilous. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't do much myself, but I'll tell you what I can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Henceforth, I can stop referring to this team as the Redskins, which I hereby 
vow to do. I will no longer make any reference to Jack Kent Cooke's National 
Football League franchise except to identify it as Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so I'm politically correct. Sue me. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of you can do as you like. You don't have to do as I do. That's why 
this is supposed to be a fair country. Everybody is supposed to have rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fighting Irish?" "Celtics?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, call me about that when the Irish become an oppressed people in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 But you go ask the leaders of those 547 American tribes how they feel about 
seeing some Caucasian kid inside a costume-shop buckskin outfit with a 
feathered headdress, dancing around on a gymnasium floor. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a minstrel show. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters from tribes in Oklahoma were expected to be present last March when 
the basketball team from the University of Illinois qualified for an NCAA 
basketball regional tournament at Oklahoma City. On game day, they did not. 
Fighting Illini administrators have received many complaints about permitting 
their mascot, Chief Illiniwek, to do his stirring dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, I understand that this is supposed to be "harmless." Just as I 
understand that not all Native Americans are offended by schools and teams that 
model themselves after specific tribes, Seminoles and Blackhawks and such. Hey, 
what a concept. Not all Indians think alike. No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think if it affected you. Let's say you're of Chinese heritage and you 
lived in the Midwest all those years when the high school in Pekin, Ill., 
called its teams the Chinks. That actually happened for most of the 20th 
Century. Imagine if you were of German ancestry and that the NFL franchise in 
the nation's capital called itself the Washington Krauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe then Jimmy Carter, Ted Turner and others would go to the games and do 
funny German goose-steps and salutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of people who learn as they go, I never put it together that 
"Warriors" could be offensive to anybody. But that's because I never asked 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 When a newspaper in Portland elected to quit using Indian nicknames, someone 
observed that even Trail Blazers could be construed as offensive, by those 
whose peoples were run off their lands by those who blazed the trails. It's 
incredible how far we can take this. We can't change every single thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet like the man said, "A new day has begun." 
</P>
<P>
 At least at Marquette, it has. Is this a pretty good country or what?

SHARP DRILLS PUT BROCCO NEAR THE TOP; KENTUCKY DERBY: SANTA ANITA DERBY WINNER 
HAS HAD THREE SOLID WORKOUTS OVER CHURCHILL DOWNS STRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kentucky Derby horses frequently run in the race the same way they have worked 
out for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember Ferdinand?" asked trainer Rodney Rash, who was an assistant to 
Charlie Whittingham when Ferdinand won the Derby at 17-1 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie kept telling everybody how great Ferdinand was doing after he arrived 
here, but nobody would listen to him. Charlie walked out of here with enough 
money to fill a wheelbarrow." 
</P>
<P>
 If workouts translate to victories, then Brocco has at least closed the gap on 
Holy Bull for the 120th running of the race Saturday at Churchill Downs. The 
Santa Anita Derby winner has been in Kentucky since April 16, seven days after 
his California victory, and his three workouts have been consistently good, 
culminated by a fast 1:00 3/5 for five furlongs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Brocco's race to lose," said Steve Young, another trainer. "I've been 
close to him here, and I can see up close how well he's doing. If he runs his 
race, he'll win." 
</P>
<P>
 Young trains Irgun, the Wood Memorial winner who was forced out of the Derby 
because of an abscessed hoof. His opinion might not be entirely without 
prejudice; his twin brother, Gary, works as an assistant for Randy Winick, 
Brocco's trainer. Gary Young helped Winick pick out Brocco for Albert and Dana 
Broccoli, who bought the Kris S.-Anytime Ms. colt for $210,000 at an auction of 
unraced 2-year-olds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Another horseman with a biased analysis of the Derby is jockey Gary Stevens, 
who has ridden Brocco to four victories and two seconds in six races, including 
last fall's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita. Stevens, seeking his second 
Derby victory, won for the first time in 1988 with Winning Colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning Colors, who had also won the Santa Anita Derby, was the close second 
betting choice to Private Terms, who started the Derby undefeated in seven 
starts. Winning Colors broke quickly, sprinted to a 3 1/2-length lead after a 
half-mile of the 1 1/4-mile race, had the same advantage with an eighth of a 
mile left and outlasted Forty Niner, who missed by a neck at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Park-based Stevens, who worked Brocco on Monday, traveled to 
nearby Lexington on Tuesday to see Winning Colors for the first time since they 
finished next to last in the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream Park in 1989. 
The 9-year-old mare recently foaled a filly by Danzig and is soon to be bred to 
Storm Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was a lot of respect for Winning Colors the year she 
won," Stevens said. "She was a filly, and everybody was saying that she 
couldn't win at a mile and a quarter. We stole the race. She kicked away from 
the gate, and then I got her to gallop from the five-eighths to the 
three-eighths pole. That's when (trainer Wayne Lukas) said to let her rip. 
That's what I did, and even though she got the wobbles in the last sixteenth of 
a mile, she had enough left." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens doesn't anticipate that Holy Bull will have that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting a lot more respect than Winning Colors did," he said. "I think 
that if Winning Colors had been 1-5 (odds), Forty Niner would have been at my 
throat at the three-eighths pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bull's run some awesome races, but I'm not going to ride my race around 
him. We're not going to let him take us out of our game plan. I've got a lot of 
confidence in my horse. I want to be in contention when we hit the quarter 
pole, and I think my horse will be the best horse in the last quarter-mile of 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Winick, 44, is the son of retired trainer Arnold Winick. Randy was at 
the 1970 Derby, when his father finished seventh with Corn Off The Cob, and he 
was also here in 1972 for his father's third-place finish with Hold Your Peace. 
Riva Ridge, the Derby winner in '72, was a front-runner such as Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I remember about '72 was the intensity of the crowd," Randy Winick 
said. "My dad's horse came to Riva Ridge several times, and every time he did 
(jockey) Ron Turcotte would just let out another notch. Riva Ridge was an 
awfully good colt." 
</P>
<P>
 Winick hopes that at least one other horse -- Ulises seems to be the best 
prospect -- will go after Holy Bull early. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Holy Bull gets away with a 47 first quarter and is three (lengths) in 
front, he'll be tough to catch," Winick said. "We want to be in contention at 
the three-eighths pole, because that's the way most horses win this race. I 
want Gary to have Holy Bull in his sights all the way Saturday. I don't think 
Holy Bull will win, but if he does, I'll take my hat off to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle, second in both starts this year, in the San Rafael at Santa 
Anita and the Jim Beam at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., worked five furlongs 
Tuesday in 1:00 2/5. . . . In other workouts by Derby horses, Kandaly posted a 
five-furlong time of 1:01 and Smilin Singin Sam had a 1:00 4/5. . . . Prospects 
for a fast track on Derby day are good.

MLAKAR LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS NEW JOB; HOCKEY: FORMER KING EXECUTIVE WILL BE IN 
CHARGE OF SPORTS GROUP THAT INCLUDES THE PENGUINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As he sat in his Pittsburgh hotel room late Tuesday night, surveying the 
skyline of his new hometown, Roy Mlakar was in an upbeat mood. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar, who is leaving his position as president of the Kings, had escaped the 
disarray, doubt and depression gripping his old organization to the brightness 
and optimism of a new life with a new organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar expressed sympathy for the Kings, but he wasn't about to dwell on the 
frustration and bitterness he left behind. His team plunged from the Stanley 
Cup finals a year ago to missing the playoffs this season and the owner, Bruce 
McNall, went from being one of the NHL's leading figures to being investigated 
by a federal grand jury and under further pressure from a huge debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Mlakar, King president for the last two years and an 
official with the club since 1988, had been introduced to his new employees as 
the president and CEO of Pittsburgh Sports Associates. As such, he will oversee 
the operation of the organization's four teams -- the Pittsburgh Penguins of 
the NHL, the Pittsburgh Phantoms, a roller hockey team, the Pittsburgh Stingers 
of the Major Indoor Soccer League and the Russian Penguins. The latter is a 
Moscow-based hockey club, formerly the Central Red Army team, which plays an 
interlocking schedule with the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mlakar, a fifth entity will also be added to the organization in 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar, who had an option year remaining on his King contract, has signed a 
five-year deal with the Pittsburgh group. 
</P>
<P>
 With majority control of the Kings about to pass from Bruce McNall to Jeffrey 
Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen, there has been much speculation that Mlakar would be 
forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, insists Mlakar, who said his resignation from the Kings, made two 
weeks ago, was his choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the toughest decision I ever had to make," Mlakar said. "But being 
given the opportunity to run five entities like this was a tremendous 
challenge. It was like the old Godfather offer, too good to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm going home. I grew up in Cleveland, not far away from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar's decision won't be mourned by some. He was an administrator with a 
reputation for being tough and demanding, but effective. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Kings were struggling a few years ago, McNall told reporters he was 
going to step down as club president and install an SOB who would whip the team 
into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "When does Roy start?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that big an SOB," McNall replied, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was indeed Mlakar, who, despite his new title, continued to successfully 
run the business end of the Kings' organization, having a hand in everything 
from arena advertising to the Kings' hockey stores that are spread around 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helped that another figure also joined the Kings the same year 
as Mlakar, a player by the name of Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 As McNall's fortunes tumbled this season, the vacuum of leadership at the top 
created an apparent struggle for power. Mlakar was aligned with General Manager 
Nick Beverley on one side, with Coach Barry Melrose on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 What is to be Beverley's fate now? 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar no longer has a say in that matter, but he had plenty of nice things to 
say about Beverley on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick's done a great job," Mlakar said. "It's a credit to his work ethic. The 
fruits of Nick's effort are the kids the Kings have coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 As for McNall, Mlakar said, "I pray that Bruce comes out of this all right. 
Bruce is not only a survivor, but a catalyst for many industries. The Kings 
will only benefit from his continued participation." 
</P>
<P>
 And one does Mlakar see as his contribution to the club? 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave the Kings a lot stronger than I found them," he said. "Bruce McNall's 
problems have nothing to do with the Kings."

SENNA'S DEATH MIGHT BE TREATED AS A HOMICIDE; AUTO RACING: SAFETY OF IMOLA 
TRACK IN ITALY CALLED INTO QUESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Ayrton Senna's technical crew studied the information in the "black box" 
data-logging system from the Formula One car in which the former world champion 
was killed Sunday at Imola, Italy, Italian authorities said Tuesday that the 
death might be treated as a possible homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Bendinelli, managing director of the company that owns the Imola 
track, was told by police that he was being investigated, based on the 
possibility that the notoriously fast Imola track played a role in the crashes 
during the weekend of the Grand Prix of San Marino. Austrian rookie Roland 
Ratzenberger also died in a crash during Saturday's qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Race organizers said they could not comment while the investigation continued, 
and officials of the FIA, the sport's international governing body, said the 
track passed a safety check last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The English Williams-Renault team for which Senna drove was trying to find an 
answer in the black box, hoping the computerized data it contained would 
provide a clue as to why Senna failed to turn left at the Tamburello curve and 
instead went head-on into a concrete barrier at about 180 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team wishes to point out that any theories from any source as to the 
cause of Ayrton Senna's accident are pure speculation," Williams said in a 
statement. "A thorough investigation is being undertaken utilizing the 
available data." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, however, was still unable to examine the wreckage from the car, 
which has been impounded by Italian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simtek Ford team also was examining data in the black box from 
Ratzenberger's car, although television replays indicated a mechanical problem 
had caused his crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Simtek will present their findings to FIA, which has scheduled a 
meeting in Paris today to review the events. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bologna airport, Italian police lined the pathway and presented arms as 
Senna's coffin was loaded onto a plane for the trip to his hometown of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, about 500 mourners had stood silently outside the city morgue as an 
autopsy was performed. Traffic was blocked, and some people fainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical officials made no statement after the autopsy, although the Italian 
news agency, ANSA, reported that doctors had ruled out sudden illness before 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the tributes continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in a telegram to Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco, mourned the driver's death, expressing disapproval that the race 
was not stopped after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Luca di Montezemolo, president of Ferrari, wrote in an Italian newspaper, 
"Senna was the greatest for all of us, one of the greatest of all time." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sao Paulo, Franco decreed three days of national mourning and ordered flags 
flown at half staff. He also decreed that Senna posthumously receive the Grand 
Cross of Merit, one of Brazil's highest awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's body is expected to arrive in Sao Paulo today. A fire truck will carry 
his coffin from the airport to the state legislature building, where the body 
will lie in state until burial Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police hope huge crowds of fans will not jam the airport and the 25-mile route 
to the legislature.

<P>
 Chris Webber, who helped make the Golden State Warriors the NBA's most 
improved team, Tuesday was chosen as the league's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of Michigan's Fab Five to play in the NBA and the youngest player in 
the league, Webber edged Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway, the player Golden State 
drafted third and sent to the Magic for the rights to Webber, the No. 1 
selection last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber received 53 votes to 47 for Hardaway in balloting by a panel of sports 
writers and broadcasters. Webber averaged 17.5 points, 9.1 rebounds, 3.6 
assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.2 steals.

BUCKNER FIRED AS MAVERICK COACH; PRO BASKETBALL: DALLAS OWNER PULLS PLUG AFTER 
A 13-69 SEASON DESPITE A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Quinn Buckner, accused by the club owner of fostering widespread discontent on 
the team, was fired Tuesday after coaching the Dallas Mavericks to the worst 
record in the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner had four years left on his contract.His team went 13-69 in a season 
marked by a chorus of complaints from his best players -- rookie Jamal 
Mashburn, Jim Jackson and Derek Harper, later traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just the young players," Maverick owner Donald Carter said. "Let's 
face it, it was young and old. The bridges that were burned weren't just over 
young players." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said Buckner tried to change but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I saw changes in his personality, but there weren't enough timbers 
there that we could get the bridges built," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Buckner: "We had a great run. It was fun and I'm sorry it didn't work 
out. It was a great experience. I learned a lot about myself and I learned a 
lot about people. I wish the Mavericks the best of luck in their quest for a 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Motta, who coached the Mavericks from 1980-87, is considered the top 
candidate to replace Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner, 39, brought a history of winning to the Mavericks. He played on an 
NCAA championship team at Indiana and spent 10 years in the NBA, winning a 
championship with the 1983-84 Boston Celtics. He also earned a gold medal on 
the 1976 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner had left NBC-TV as an NBA analyst to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said the remainder of Buckner's contract will be honored. Asked if 
Buckner would take another job on the club, Carter said, "He has not applied 
for any."

POLICE INVESTIGATE SIMI VALLEY COACH; PREP BASEBALL: MIKE SCYPHERS IS REMOVED 
FROM HIS DUTIES BECAUSE OF PROBE INTO POSSIBLE FINANCIAL AND DISCIPLINARY 
TROUBLE.

<P>
 Mike Scyphers, among the most successful high school baseball coaches in 
Southern California, has been removed from coaching at Simi Valley High because 
of a police probe into possible financial and disciplinary improprieties, Simi 
Valley police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has brought the Simi Valley program to national prominence in 
his 16 years as coach, denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach, 41, will keep his position as a physical education teacher and has 
not been arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials declined to elaborate on the charges, but the police 
confirmed the Simi Valley school district is auditing the baseball program's 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the investigation was prompted by school district 
officials, who contacted authorities last month to request assistance 
investigating "possible financial improprieties, improper discipline practices 
and other conduct, which may have criminal application related to the boys' 
baseball program at Simi Valley High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he was unaware he was under investigation until he arrived at 
school Tuesday morning and found a substitute teacher in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he was told to report to Principal Kathryn Scroggin's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really bitter about it," Scyphers said. "I've built a real good name for 
this program and someone out there is trying to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers stood quietly outside a school building with his head down and 
continued to defend his practices. Scyphers also works as a college basketball 
referee and is part-owner of a batting cage business in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't even begin to say I've taken more money out of this program than 
I've put into it," Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were at Simi Valley High on Tuesday interviewing baseball players. 
Members of the team declined comment, saying police ordered them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Scyphers, police asked players about a traditional team 
disciplinary practice called "the block." When a baseball player violates team 
rules, his teammates bid for the opportunity to administer a single swat with a 
wooden paddle to the offending player. 
</P>
<P>
 Players pay cash to Scyphers, who said he used the money for incidental team 
expenses such as a team party at the end of the season or gasoline for the 
baseball field lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is about 'the block,' that's ridiculous," Scyphers said. "It ranged 
from $2 to $4 and we've only done it maybe five times this year. . . . It's 
been a tradition at this school since 1980, but I've really slacked off 
lately."

KEY CONSERVATION QUESTIONS RAISED BY COUGAR ATTACK; WILDLIFE: THE MOUNTAIN LION 
POPULATION HAS INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA. IS A RESUMPTION OF HUNTING THE ANSWER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been more than a week since Barbara Schoener was ambushed and killed by 
a mountain lion while jogging on a trail in the Northern California wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 But the focus, because of the nature of the incident April 23 in the hills 
northeast of Sacramento, remains on cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 A fairly large lion attacked Schoener from behind while she jogged down the 
remote trail, killing her with bites to the neck and head. The lion then 
dragged her body 300 feet before covering it with leaves and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, responding to concerns of citizens, finally located the animal on 
Sunday. Dogs treed the female lion and a marksman shot and killed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue won't die. Parents are keeping a close watch on their children. 
Sightings, or alleged sightings, of mountain lions are rising sharply in rural 
Northern California. The attack and subsequent lion hunt has been front-page 
news nearly every day throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunting community is using the highly publicized attack, only the latest 
of many recent encounters between mountain lions and humans in California, as 
ammunition in its drive to put lions back on the list of animals it can hunt. 
There has been no sport hunting for mountain lions since temporary moratoriums 
went into effect in 1972. A permanent ban on hunting lions, with the exception 
of depredation hunts for animals that harm humans, livestock or pets, went into 
effect in 1990 with the passage of Prop. 117. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animals are overrunning their ranges," said Dan Heal, chairman of the 
Chico-based Sportsmen's Task Force of California, an organization that 
represents 38 state hunting clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunting would make the animals more wary of man. Now the lion population has 
lost its fear of man. Up here in Chico, we have encounters daily. Things are so 
bad that people are taking things into their own hands, killing the lions and 
letting them lay." 
</P>
<P>
 A concerned public again is expressing concerns that mountain lions are 
finding deer and smaller animals -- their natural prey -- so hard to come by 
that they have no choice but to attack and eat humans. Some are worried that 
the animals are so numerous now that encounters between man and mountain lion 
will become common. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Schoener was by a healthy adult lion, and against an adult who 
was seemingly in excellent physical condition. Schoener, 40, was an avid jogger 
who liked to run marathons.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first such incident. On Jan. 14, 1991, an 18-year-old jogger 
near Idaho Springs, Colo., was running alone on a remote trail near his high 
school. Scott Lancaster was jumped, killed and partially consumed by a 
100-pound male lion. The lion was later tracked and killed and an examination 
showed no signs of ill health. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mountain lions) are predators and they are opportunistic," said Terry 
Mansfield, chief of the wildlife division for the California Department of Fish 
and Game. "The way lions eat livestock, they get into a flock of sheep -- they 
may kill 30-60 sheep in one night. Not because he thinks he's going to eat it 
all, but because he's a predator." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Beier, of the Department of Forestry and Resource Management at UC 
Berkeley, has documented records of 53 unprovoked attacks by cougars on humans 
in the United States and Canada from 1890 to 1990. In an appendix to the report 
in 1992, Beier said, "There is no substantial evidence that habituation (to 
humans) has played a role in any particular attack nor in the general recent 
increase in attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansfield, who has done extensive research on mountain lions, discounted the 
theory that they are responding to a decrease in the numbers of deer in 
California. Deer herds are at an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their primary food item is deer, but they can eat anything from ground 
squirrels to an ostrich in a back yard," Mansfield said. "They'll eat dogs and 
cats. They love porcupines, skunks, opossums and bobcats. A mature lion will 
even eat another lion. In coastal areas from Humboldt to Santa Barbara, wild 
pigs have expanded. Wild pigs are now part of their diet." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Schoener, it was discovered that the 80-pound female lion had 
been lactating, and state wildlife experts as of Tuesday afternoon were still 
searching the hills northeast of Sacramento for the lion's den. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the cougar merely protecting her cubs? Possibly, but not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, our knowledge of female lions when they're giving birth to 
kittens is that they usually go to a remote, rugged spot away from any 
disturbance to give birth," Mansfield said. "And if they are disturbed, or if 
you come into the area, they will often remove kittens the first night after 
that, so there really is no basis to the theory that this lion was defending 
her kittens." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansfield refused to speculate on what prompted the lion to attack Schoener, 
but he wasn't surprised that the attack took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've got is an increasing lion population over the last 25 years," he 
said. "On top of that, there are 31 million people in California. People are 
living, working and recreating more and more in lion habitat. This shouldn't be 
a surprise to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, mountain lions and humans have been on a collision course since "the 
bounty days" from 1907 to 1963, when cash incentives to kill cougars were 
offered, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 12,500, or about 220 a year. 
Since then, both species have experienced population explosions. There were an 
estimated 2,400 mountain lions in California in 1971. There are 4,000 to 6,000 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Depredation permits are up from five in 1971 to about 190 a year in the last 
three years. The number of lions killed each year in depredation hunts is up to 
about 70 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's a very minimal estimate because some people take things into their 
own hands (and kill a lion) and never report it," Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the resumption of hunting the answer? 
</P>
<P>
 California is the only state in the western United States that does not hold 
regulated hunts for mountain lions. Prop. 117, besides prohibiting the hunting 
of mountain lions, mandated the state to spend $30 million annually on land 
acquisition for wildlife, a portion to go toward lion and deer habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some good things about it, but the unfortunate thing is that it 
isn't good for the state," said Heal, of the Sportsman's Task Force. "There is 
no management. The DFG's hands are tied and kids are being mauled in state 
parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Heal's allusion was to two incidents in 1986, when children were mauled in 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, lion sightings and encounters have been increasing steadily in 
Northern and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mansfield: "There's no biological need to prohibit hunting. But on the 
other hand, we can't guarantee public safety. You can't say this (attack on 
Schoener) would not have happened if we would have had hunting taking place. 
You just simply can't say that.  
</P>
<P>
 "But there is a message: We can and should be more flexible in the way we 
manage lions, both to reach our goal of maintaining a lion population, but also 
of minimizing conflicts. We could turn around and try to manage the lion 
population by allowing hunting by the public with quotas and zones in specific 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting or no, Mansfield said, the problem isn't going to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can expect more conflicts to occur in the future," he said. "I hate to 
predict that, but quite frankly, it's not if it's going to happen again, but 
when. "

HE HAS PATIENCE TO WAIT OUT STORM AT MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Duffy Clark is cautious. Make that very cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin High principal not only looks before he leaps, he spends a good 
chunk of time thinking about the jump. There is always another opinion to 
solicit, another fact to ascertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is more than a virtue, it's a way of life for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trait that should serve him well July 1 when he becomes principal at 
Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark will find athletic ashes when he gets there. A once-proud and successful 
athletic program has been torn apart by controversy, right down to what logo is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dicy stuff, but you won't get Clark to join in the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel it would be appropriate to comment on the situation," Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clark style -- safe, steady and sure. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find any critics of this management technique among Tustin coaches, 
past or present. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has been principal at Tustin the last six years. He was a vice principal 
the three previous years. During that time, he watched the Tiller athletic 
department prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's background has an athletic base. He began as a lower-level football 
coach at Foothill and even coached the badminton team to the Century League 
championship in 1984. He also was Foothill's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 With that experience, Clark said he understands how important an athletic 
program can be to a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics, as with all activities, is part of that tapestry you call the 
school community," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 That community has thrived at Tustin: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The football team won four Sea View League championships and reached the 
Southern Section Division VI title game twice in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The boys' basketball team won two league championships in five seasons. The 
Tillers won the II-AA title and State Division II championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The baseball team has won six league titles in eight seasons and reached at 
least the semifinals of the section the last five seasons. The Tillers won the 
3-A title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest challenge was to stay out of the way and not mess anything up," 
Clark said. "We were blessed with outstanding coaches and an outstanding 
athletic director. When you have the talent, you want to let that talent be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 That talent included Marijon Ancich (football), Tom McCluskey (basketball) and 
Vince Brown (baseball) -- three intense coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all head-strong guys, but there were never any problems," said 
McCluskey, now the coach at Golden West. "A lot of that was because of Duffy. 
He was supportive and gave us everything we needed. He was always there. But he 
never interfered. He was unique as an administrator." 
</P>
<P>
 Unique and cautious.

A DOSAGE OF REALITY; HOLY BULL HAS LOOKED GREAT, BUT THE DERBY WILL TEST HIS 
GENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS PEDDICORD, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who have conceded the 120th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday to 
Holy Bull, might want to take a second look. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse's Dosage Index, or ratio of inherited sprinting ability to endurance 
based on four generations of his pedigree, shows the 3-year-old colt is long on 
speed, but short on stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull might get the early lead in the Derby, but he could trip on his 
parentage and fade. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the modern-day Dosage formula, devised in 1981 by Houston chemist 
Steve Roman, Holy Bull has a Dosage Index of 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1929, only one horse, Strike The Gold in 1991, has won the Derby with a 
Dosage Index exceeding 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher the number, the greater concentration of sprinting ability in a 
horse's pedigree. Lower numbers indicate more stamina, a trait especially 
important for 3-year-olds traveling 1 1/4 miles for the first time on the first 
Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not prejudiced against sprinters," Roman said last week. "And I 
certainly have nothing against Holy Bull. He is a great-looking horse and 
obviously a really, really good one. But his pedigree says he can't go 1 1/4 
miles." 
</P>
<P>
 To back up his formula, Roman notes that the average distance for 
stakes-winning offspring of Holy Bull's sire, Great Above, is 7.08 furlongs, 
roughly three furlongs short of the Derby distance. Their average Dosage Index 
is 7.0. 
</P>
<P>
 But, because Holy Bull has already won two major races -- the Florida Derby 
and Blue Grass Stakes at nine furlongs -- he is already an exception to the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman is prepared for the Dosage Index to go down to defeat for a second time 
in the Derby, particularly because there doesn't seem to be another 
front-runner of Holy Bull's caliber to press him early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Irgun out, everyone seems intimidated by Holy Bull. Nobody is willing to 
challenge him unless Smilin Singin Sam is sent out there early," Roman said. 
"If Holy Bull gets the lead with no pressure and is allowed to go in 48 and 
1:12 (the first half-mile in 48 seconds, six furlongs in 1:12), then he'll 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Roman's picks for the race are Brocco, Valiant Nature and Blumin Affair. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes Brocco as "a truly classically bred horse" and Valiant Nature as 
"the most classically bred" in the race. Although Go For Gin has the lowest 
Dosage Index, indicating the most stamina, Roman believes that races have to 
set up in a certain way for that horse to be most effective. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a horse's Dosage Index is not the only factor he uses in making his 
selections. "It must be used hand-in-hand in handicapping the Derby with 
high-class early maturity as a 2-year-old," Roman added. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Derby has shown it is a consistent type of race year after year," 
he said. "The conditions are usually the same. There is a large field. The 
quality's pretty high. The distance is always 1 1/4 miles. There is usually a 
fast pace and it's a huge spectacle. That's why these two things count year 
after year -- clear-cut ability to go the distance and early maturity because 
of the demands of the race both physically and mentally on the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 All three of Roman's selections combine those ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," Roman added, "I might break my own rule and throw Holy Bull in my 
triple box, too, because of the way the race might set up and because he could 
just be a very, very good horse."

SCYPHERS' PROTEGES STUNNED BY ALLEGATIONS; PROBE: SIMI VALLEY BASEBALL COACH 
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR FINANCIAL, DISCIPLINARY IMPROPRIETIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Simi Valley High baseball players expressed disbelief Tuesday that 
longtime Coach Mike Scyphers could be guilty of the alleged financial 
improprieties that have prompted a probe by the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was removed as coach but will keep his position as a physical 
education and driver's education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any talk of him taking money," said Jeff Sommer, a former 
outfielder who graduated from Simi Valley in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to teaching, Scyphers, 41, is part owner of a batting cage in 
Camarillo and is an NCAA basketball official. He has been Simi Valley baseball 
coach for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Coach Jack Willard, who with Scyphers has conducted a summer 
baseball clinic for three years, said Scyphers is comfortable financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so out of character for him," Willard said. "He's pretty well off 
anyway. I can't see him needing any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who lives in Camarillo with his wife and three children, held a 
postseason party for the team every year at his family's beach house near 
Ventura. The party was paid for in part by money collected from players during 
a disciplinary practice called "the block." 
</P>
<P>
 When a player violates team rules, teammates bid for the opportunity to 
administer a single swat with a wooden paddle. Police said they also are 
investigating whether the coach acted improperly in disciplining players. 
Scyphers said Tuesday that police asked players about "the block." 
</P>
<P>
 "The block has always been part of the team," Sommer said. "It was how the 
kids enforced doing things the right way. It was kind of fun and no big deal. 
Everyone agreed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Hodgins, a former shortstop and academic All-American at Cal State 
Northridge who graduated from Simi Valley in 1989, wondered why "the block" is 
being questioned now. Scyphers said he began the practice in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems funny to me when it's been going on for so long that people are 
making a fuss about it now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Maye, the Royal baseball coach, believes an investigation must have been 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear it at first, you are shocked," he said, "but you know this 
didn't just pop up in one day. Someone has been putting something together for 
a few weeks."

SNUB OF STANFORD CONFOUNDS PRICE; NCAA VOLLEYBALL: CSUN COACH ADOPTS PROVINCIAL 
STANCE AFTER MIDWESTERN SCHOOL GETS AT-LARGE BERTH OVER NO. 3 CARDINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The controversial selection of Indiana/Purdue-Fort Wayne for the at-large 
berth in the NCAA men's volleyball Final Four has Cal State Northridge Coach 
John Price contemplating scheduling changes and playoff alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented move announced Sunday, the three-person NCAA selection 
committee snubbed third-ranked Stanford (20-9), the West region's at-large 
candidate, for 11th-ranked IPFW (19-6), the Midwest region's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, whose Northridge team lost to UCLA in the national championship match 
last season, called the choice "ridiculous" and "embarrassing to the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the move might preclude Northridge from scheduling early-season 
trips to the Midwest and East Coast as well as force Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation coaches to consider altering the conference's postseason tournament. 
The past three years, the winner of the MPSF tournament has received the only 
at-large berth in the Final Four. MPSF teams have won every NCAA championship 
since 1970.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason for the tournament was to make it so West Coast teams 
wouldn't fight with each other," Price said. "We wanted to take the team that 
was playing best at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford lost a match against UCLA for the conference's automatic bid to the 
Final Four, but then rebounded to defeat sixth-ranked Pepperdine and 
second-ranked Brigham Young to capture the tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, IPFW lost to Ball State, 15-4, 15-10, 15-10, in the Midwest 
regional on its home court in Fort Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get beat like that in a situation where everything is on the line, if that 
was my team I'd say we didn't deserve to go," Price said. "I wouldn't be 
twisting the numbers and politicking to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic director, is the chairman of 
the selection committee. Hiegert said NCAA guidelines recommend the choice be 
based overall record, head-to-head competition when appropriate, strength of 
schedule and record against common opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford had a far stronger schedule and a better mark against common 
opponents, but IPFW had a better overall record plus a four-game victory over 
the Cardinal in a February nonconference match in Fort Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said West Coast teams annually make winter trips to "promote the sport." 
He said top teams use the trips to give young players experience playing before 
partisan crowds. "I'd be real surprised if anyone goes back there now," Price 
said. "It cost Stanford. It wiped out what they did the rest of the season."

COMMENTARY; NBA CHOKING DOWN STRETCH WITH BRAWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Thorn, NBA vice president for operations, did his job Monday and suspended 
players. He suspended a star from one team and a starter from another, did this 
in the middle of the short first round of the playoffs. Thorn did this after 
the NBA turned into a circus last weekend and made ice hockey seem more 
civilized. This is no longer merely about image, a religion in the NBA. This is 
about the league's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman was a punk all Saturday afternoon in San Antonio. Saturday 
night, Grant Long of the Miami Heat put his hands around another player's 
throat right before everybody tried to turn Atlanta's Omni into a soccer riot. 
If you watched the NBA playoffs last weekend, you started to wonder if they had 
decided to replace Michael Jordan with Wrestlemania. 
</P>
<P>
 You also wondered why Patrick Ewing had to take a fall in Madison Square 
Garden for crimes committed in San Antonio and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 As dirty a player as Rodman was Saturday afternoon, as dangerous as the 
Hawk-Heat brawl was Saturday night, it was equally dangerous for players to 
start thinking there is some sliding system of justice in the NBA now, a system 
in which Saturday's events determine how the law will be enforced Sunday. When 
that happens, there is no real law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was ejected Sunday and because he didn't do very much to deserve that, 
it seemed a jittery, knee-jerk response to everything else that had happened in 
the playoffs. Thorn was asked if Ewing was really doing time for Rodman and 
Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a certain logic in that but it's a bit of a reach," Thorn said. "I 
didn't say anything to the refs before Sunday's game. But refs are human. They 
see the highlights. I think it's human nature for them to react." 
</P>
<P>
 This was after Thorn announced that Rodman and Long had been suspended for one 
game, Douglas Edwards of the Hawks for two games, Keith Askins of the Heat for 
three. There also were fines handed out all around. The suspensions of Rodman 
and Long are what matter here. Both will sit out Game 3 of the first round of 
the playoffs. Both the Spurs and Heat could lose because of all this. 
</P>
<P>
 Then all players can decide if being tough is worth blowing a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time things are out of order and you do something about them, it's an 
important day for the league," Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 This all started with Rodman, who gets more rebounds than anyone else in 
basketball and acts more and more like a punk. First Rodman committed a 
flagrant foul against Karl Malone in Saturday's Spurs-Jazz game. Later, Tom 
Chambers was in the air, on his way to the basket, and Rodman cut the legs out 
from under him. It was a cheap, vicious play. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, because there were some other falling bodies on the play, the 
referees missed the call. There was no foul called on Rodman, flagrant or 
otherwise. In fact, Chambers got ejected for charging Rodman. At this point, 
Rodman, who had gone after two players, Malone and Chambers, had only one 
flagrant foul, one technical. And was still playing Game 2 of the Spur-Jazz 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Rodman put out a leg and tried to trip Jazz guard John 
Stockton. A minute later, there was one final scene, Rodman got his second 
technical, and finally was ejected. It was a beautiful advertisement for the 
sport. Maybe Nike could make it into a television commercial, celebrating all 
the colorful attitude and free expression in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Next was Hawks vs. Heat, Atlanta. Even before all the fights broke out, Danny 
Manning was called for two flagrant fouls. In the NBA these days, there are two 
kinds of flagrant fouls, misdemeanors and felonies. Manning was only called for 
a couple of misdemeanors. And kept playing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next afternoon at Madison Square Garden, referee Mike Mathis kicked 
Patrick Ewing out of a playoff game for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A brief flare-up, mostly talk, with Benoit Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Getting hit by Derrick Coleman's forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning got to keep playing with two flagrant fouls. In San Antonio, you 
started to wonder if Rodman had to fire an assault weapon to get kicked out of 
the game. Ewing was sent to the locker room with 5:21 left in the first half of 
the Knick-Net game. If his team loses the game because of his ejection, if the 
Knicks only get a split at home before going to New Jersey for two games, then 
what? Whom does Ewing talk to about getting those 29 minutes back? 
</P>
<P>
 "If the outcome had been different today, we would be having a much different 
conversation," Knick president David Checketts said after the Knicks had won 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorn, attorney general for pro basketball, is a good and fair man. He cannot 
officiate all the games. He cannot change the mistakes Mathis made with Ewing. 
He cannot eliminate taunting, or cheap shots, or punches thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 There sometimes seems to be an epidemic of all this, a virus, not just in 
basketball, but all sports. You saw it the next-to-last weekend of the regular 
season, when Alonzo Mourning threw a punch at Luc Longley, even when Mourning's 
team needed to win every game it could to still have a chance to make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning got tossed from the Hornet-Bull game. He got suspended for the 
Hornet-Knick game a day later. Why? Because he had to make sure everyone knew 
how tough he is. Even if it cost his team a chance to make the playoffs. Now 
Rodman might cost his team a chance at the NBA title. I hope he does. He has 
stepped over the line, as Bill Laimbeer finally did, and now tries to hurt 
opponents for sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman was the face of the NBA last weekend. Rodman and a chokehold by Long. 
Commissioner David Stern must have been very proud.

 Three more World Cup soccer games sold out Monday, increasing the total of 
sellouts during the first three rounds to 19.The most recent sellouts were 
Colombia-United States on June 22 at the Rose Bowl, Nigeria-Greece on June 30 
at Foxboro, Mass., and the second-round game July 2 at Washington. 
</P>

KEMPER SETS PRICE OF ITS SHARES AT $65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kemper Corp. named its price Tuesday: $65 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance and investment company described the figure as a target to 
determine whether it should be sold a year from now.But some analysts called it 
a counteroffer to General Electric Co.'s $55-a-share takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're setting a floor on what they think they're worth in value, 
and it's up to GE to respond to that," said Michael Lewis of Dean Witter, 
Discover & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper shareholders will vote on GE's proposed takeover at Kemper's annual 
meeting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Chairman David Mathis urged shareholders in a letter to reject GE's bid 
and be patient with the company's plan to boost its stock price. He said that 
if Kemper's stock fails to reach $65 on at least 10 of 20 consecutive trading 
days by May 26, 1995, the board will propose that Kemper be sold to the highest 
bidder.

KCBS PAYS TOP DOLLAR FOR ANCHOR MARTIN; TELEVISION: SHE WILL JOIN CHANNEL 2 ON 
MAY 16 FOR A REPORTED $1.7 MILLION A YEAR, ANCHORING AT 5 P.M. AND 11 P.M. 
SHE'S BEEN AT KABC FOR 18 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ann Martin, who has been a mainstay reporter and news anchor at KABC-TV 
Channel 7 for 18 years, has jumped stations and will land at KCBS-TV Channel 2 
in what insiders are calling the most lucrative deal ever for a local 
television news anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin will join KCBS' "Action News" on May 16, anchoring the 5 p.m. and 11 
p.m. newscasts along with current anchor Michael Tuck, the CBS-owned station 
said Tuesday. She will replace Bree Walker, who is leaving on the same date to 
form her own TV production company. Walker has been at KCBS for 5 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of Martin's contract were not disclosed, but the new job reportedly 
will pay her at least $1.7 million per year and may be closer to $2 million 
annually, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin had been making about $750,000 anchoring the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. news at 
KABC. Walker was said to be earning about $800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's closest competitor in the anchor salary race would be her former KABC 
colleague Paul Moyer, who signed a six-year contract with KNBC-TV Channel 4 in 
1992 paying $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors have been circulating for months about Martin's possible defection to 
KCBS, and they escalated last month when KABC withdrew a $1.3-million offer to 
Martin during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy to be at KCBS-TV," Martin said in a statement. "After many 
years at KABC-TV as a reporter, co-host and anchor, I have outstanding 
memories. Many of the executives and newspeople with whom I have worked for the 
most part are no longer with the station. I am looking forward to my new 
affiliation, as I have always admired and respected CBS News. I'm happy to be a 
new addition and look forward to a long future at KCBS-TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's move closely follows the exit of KABC News Director Roger Bell, who 
was fired last month. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC officials did not return phone calls Tuesday. But General Manager Alan 
Nesbitt, who took over at Channel 7 last November, had said earlier that he 
felt the station would maintain its dominance in the local news race even 
without Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS General Manager William Applegate said Martin's hiring was part of an 
ongoing process of building the station's ratings and stature. Channel 2 has 
trailed rivals KABC and KNBC in the news ratings for most of the last two 
decades and has been in various states of turmoil for the last several years 
because of changing management and news styles. Community groups and employees 
also have complained recently of alleged racism and sexism in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The fat salary for Martin is a reflection of how important anchors are deemed 
to be in the battle to attract and hold viewers, but as KNBC has learned with 
Moyer, one anchor is not necessarily the key to ratings supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acquisition of Ann Martin's services and talent is just one piece of the 
puzzle," Applegate said. "In order to have a successful newscast, it will take 
a lot of things. Having an anchor with her stature is a nice, positive step, 
and we need to make more positive steps." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the station was close to hiring a new weekend anchor to replace Hosea 
Sanders, whose contract is not being renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the revamping, KCBS last week unveiled an elaborate, graphics-heavy 
set that was said to have cost about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need great anchors, good product, a good set and graphics and a newscast 
that is pleasing to the eye," Applegate said.

CONFRONTING THE REALITY AND 'MORALITY' OF A BRUTAL CRIME; ART: ARTIST ED MASSEY 
AND ACTIVIST PEG YORKIN PRESENT AN INSTALLATION DEPICTING THE GRISLY AFTERMATH 
OF A SEXUAL ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Artist Ed Massey and feminist activist Peg Yorkin have joined forces to 
provoke a coast-to-coast discussion of rape. In a five-city, monthlong 
exhibition of "Morality/Mortality" -- an installation of life-size 
painted-polyurethane foam figures that graphically depicts the grisly aftermath 
of a sexual assault -- the Los Angeles-based team hopes to shock their audience 
into confronting societal attitudes toward a brutal crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the artwork, which was created by Massey and funded by Yorkin, a female 
victim rises up on her elbows and attempts to crawl along the ground while her 
male assailants hang from a beam above her -- strung up by their genitals. 
Nearly identical versions of the piece were unveiled simultaneously on Monday 
in storefront windows in Santa Monica, Chicago, Miami, Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica installation, in the new Wilshire Medical Building at the 
corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 15th Street, opened uneventfully as Massey's 
assistants removed bright blue tarps from a window and revealed the sculpture 
to a gaggle of admirers and members of the press. But Massey and Yorkin hope 
that "Morality/Mortality" will generate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll hear some screeching brakes," said Yorkin, who (with Eleanor 
Smeal) co-founded the Fund for the Feminist Majority, a women's rights advocacy 
group. Yorkin has produced plays in Los Angeles but "Morality/Mortality" is the 
first visual art project to win her backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing motorists can see the horrific pair of ghostly white men dangling in 
the window, but they must get out of their cars to view the anguished woman 
whose clothing, briefcase and purse are strewn around her. The scene is most 
dramatic at night, when illuminated by theatrical lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone in Miami, where he was overseeing the Florida unveiling, 
Massey said the artwork was inspired by his female friends' constant fear of 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think it's odd that a male would be concerned with this subject 
matter," the 30-year-old sculptor said, "but I consider rape to be the most 
despicable, deplorable of all crimes -- no less than murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Art's effectiveness as a tool of social change is a topic of ongoing debate in 
art circles. But Yorkin believes art can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a subject that needs a great deal more discussion," she said, 
"and what better way to do it than through this work of art?" 
</P>
<P>
 Massey has spent more than two years on the project, casting the figures in 
plaster from live models, reproducing the casts in polyurethane foam and 
searching for financial support, as well as a suitable forum. He had hoped to 
persuade owners of prominently placed buildings to donate space for his 
artwork, he said, but his efforts were completely unproductive. Both he and 
Yorkin declined to disclose the cost of the project, but the artist said he 
created the work with "a bare-bones budget" and the help of many friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a lot easier to show the piece in a third-floor gallery in 
Manhattan," he said, "but this has to be in a public area. The work is intended 
to attract attention and discussion. If it doesn't do that, I've failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Massey is a veteran of socially critical art. His past projects include 
"Corporate Ladder," a satirical interpretation of office politics that set off 
a storm of protest in 1990, when it was installed in a financial center in 
Columbia, Md. "Checkmate," another Massey creation, pits robotic Japanese 
businessmen against dissolute Americans on a giant chess board. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my work functions on a social level," he said. "I am a student of my 
environment." 
</P>

DEGENERES' 'FRIENDS' IS HOT DESPITE BEHIND-SCENES STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting a driver's license photo taken, learning how to use call-waiting, 
placing a 5-gallon jug of water atop a cooler -- these are some of life's small 
indignities presented in "These Friends of Mine," which has finished in 
television's Top 10 every week since its debut five weeks ago on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The hook of the half-hour comedy series, starring stand-up comedian Ellen 
DeGeneres as a single working woman in her 30s, is that life rarely moves along 
in an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither do TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends" looks as if it emerged from ABC's boiler room as the perfect 
recipe for an instant hit -- a female "Seinfeld," set in Los Angeles, starring 
a thoroughly modern "Mary Tyler Moore." She thinks she can fit in, and she's 
sure everybody will understand and relate to her, and they never really seem 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends" has been airing behind the top-rated program on television, 
"Home Improvement," and it has done a superior job of holding on to "Home 
Improvement's" huge audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But "These Friends" has endured its own personal struggles, which it has 
managed to keep relatively quiet. In his friendly review of the show two weeks 
ago, TV Guide critic Jeff Jarvis wrote that he hoped the creators and executive 
producers, Carol Black and Neal Marlens, stick with the show. Black and 
Marlens, who are married, created the enormously successful "The Wonder Years" 
and then left it for others to run after the first season. 
</P>
<P>
 What Jarvis apparently didn't know was that Black and Marlens had relinquished 
the creative reigns to "These Friends" before it even premiered -- with Marlens 
and DeGeneres in something of a creative standoff, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and Marlens, who declined to be interviewed for this story, envisioned 
an edgy, ensemble show centered around the sometimes dark comic interplay of a 
smart single woman and her pals, while ABC, Walt Disney Television and 
DeGeneres herself preferred a star-driven show with a softer tone.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, DeGeneres, a hard-working club comedian known for her low-key 
observational humor, was receiving various TV offers. She chose Black and 
Marlens because she thought they had the same comic sensibility. DeGeneres had 
a small role in their last sitcom for ABC, "Laurie Hill," which was canceled 
early in the 1992-93 season because it failed to hold onto "Home Improvement's" 
lead-in audience. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC ordered 12 episodes of "These Friends" after seeing the pilot, which was 
shot in April, 1993, and then bumped it from last season's fall schedule to 
make room for "Grace Under Fire." "These Friends" finally began production in 
October, for a midseason debut, but ground to a halt midway through shooting. 
Among the creative differences that cropped up was a disagreement over how much 
risque humor was appropriate. The premiere episode featured a guy who 
repeatedly barked like a dog during sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that way," said DeGeneres, 36. "That's one thing I'm really 
known for in my stand-up: I do an hour-and-a-half or two of clean comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres knows that many fans believe that TV stars are like the characters 
they play, and she doesn't want people to see her in a false light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm playing myself, and the show was created around me, I'm really 
sensitive to things like that," DeGeneres said. "It's not that I'm offended by 
the guy in the pilot barking, but it certainly isn't something I would have 
written. It's just not me. Then the press started questioning it: 'Why were you 
clean for so long and now you're doing this?' I don't want people thinking I'm 
all of a sudden doing something else because I'm on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 There also seemed to be a question at ABC and Disney whether "These Friends," 
as seen by Black and Marlens, were nice friends. In one episode, Adam, played 
by Arye Gross, pretends to have a neck injury from an accident to take 
advantage of free massages and collect insurance money. In another, Adam 
witnesses -- but doesn't help out -- a woman getting mugged, and then he is 
reluctant to come forward as a witness because he doesn't want the woman, who 
he winds up dating, to think he's a wimp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that there was massive conflict," said Dean Valentine, president of 
Walt Disney Television. "What happened, basically, is that the network was 
pressuring the show to go in a certain direction by putting Ellen in front and 
making it clear that these people were really friends. I don't think Neal (or 
Carol) completely disagreed, it just wasn't their vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Black and Marlens, meanwhile, had enough to deal with. Black was pregnant and 
the couple's home had just been burned in the Malibu fires. To avoid 
complications in their lives, sources said, they voluntarily chose to reduce 
their roles to creative consultants, turning the show over to their 
co-executive producers, David Rosenthal and Warren Bell. Next season, Black and 
Marlens are not expected to take executive producer credits on the show at all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of ABC and Disney, Rosenthal and Bell set out to make the last 
six episodes "Ellen-centric," as Rosenthal said. They also began collaborating 
more with DeGeneres. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally out of the loop," DeGeneres said. "I wish I were as powerful as 
Roseanne, and knew everything that was going on, and had a part of everything, 
but I certainly am not that powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Black and Marlens backed off, the co-executive producers added a 
bookstore and cafe called Buy the Book, where DeGeneres works, and they added a 
character in the bookstore, Joe the coffee guy (David Higgins), and they played 
up the role of her boss (Cristine Rose). 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen is such a strong personality, such a strong talent, that when you're 
watching the show, you really want to know what's going on with her at every 
moment," explained Rosenthal, 26. "For a new show coming out of the blocks, she 
carries a lot of the weight emotionally and comically. It's all on her 
shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, ABC was considering not broadcasting the first seven episodes at 
all, but then decided to air them all in mixed order. Ironically, three of the 
first four high-rated episodes were from the original batch overseen by Black 
and Marlens. After tonight's show, another episode has been slotted for May 24 
following "Roseanne," and the other five will be scheduled this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends" is all but assured to come back in the fall with a full-season 
order. "I personally would be very disappointed if viewers don't see the show 
on our fall schedule," said Alan Sternfeld, ABC's senior vice president of 
program planning and scheduling.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: SOME INSPIRATIONAL ANCHOR REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local news anchors don't have to be reporters. For the most part, they're 
recruited for their ability to be likable, to communicate and read stories 
smoothly, to project authority and credibility and to announce with conviction, 
"Exclusive team coverage!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet KCAL-TV Channel 9 anchor Pat Harvey recently returned from an active week 
of covering the historic South Africa election. On Monday night, she chided 
"the networks" for giving the erroneous impression at times last week that all 
of Johannesburg was "under siege." Harvey, who is black, also shared her 
personal feelings about rubbing shoulders with long-disenfranchised black South 
Africans as they waited in line to cast their first vote ever. "They could have 
been my grandfather . . . ," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey's anchor colleague, Jane Velez-Mitchell, meanwhile, was the reporter 
and also helped produce and write Sunday's dandy Cinco de Mayo special on 
Channel 9. It was one of those rare television hours that conveyed, without 
puffery, the strength and diversity of a Latino population that is so often the 
subject of negative coverage. Who were these inspiring people? No one seen with 
regularity in newscasts, that's for sure. Instead, it's jerks like those behind 
the melee at Sunday's "L.A. Fiesta Broadway" who inevitably capture TV's center 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 On another channel, there also has been terrific work by KABC-TV Channel 7 
anchor Christine Lund, whose recent stories disclosing the cruelty of horse 
tripping in Mexican rodeos, or charreadas , have lit a bonfire under the 
movement to ban this savagely destructive sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse tripping by charros , or Mexican cowboys, has a long tradition as a 
popular roping event at these rodeos, which have moved north into California 
and the Southwest. Following the death in committee of an earlier California 
bill to ban horse tripping for entertainment, a similar bill has gathered 
momentum and appears nearing a vote by the full state assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some charro leaders have protested Lund's coverage, and they claim that the 
anti-horse tripping movement led by animal-welfare activists is a racist-style 
attack on Mexican culture. They also claim that the event is not cruel or 
inhumane and that, because of the skill of the participants, only rarely are 
horses harmed or seriously injured by having their front legs lassoed. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was contradicted by Lund's horrendously graphic hidden-camera footage 
of terrified horses at charreadas taking terrible falls -- some even landing on 
their heads -- after having being roped at a full gallop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can sit and discuss tripping and read about it, but it is a visual 
event," said Cathleen Doyle, a member of the California Equine Legislative 
Council. "Only when you can see it does it turn around people who normally 
would call animal-rights activists a dirty word." 
</P>
<P>
 Lund's latest story prompted Friday's extremely tough "20/20" segment on horse 
tripping, during which charros and the Channel 7 anchorwoman herself were 
interviewed about the controversy. Other magazine shows have gotten into the 
act after Lund's initial report, and she says that National Public Radio also 
has interviewed her in connection with a story it's preparing on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't being interviewed like this transform journalist Lund -- a longtime 
avid horsewoman -- into activist Lund? After all, though her reporting has been 
fair within the context of an expose -- giving both sides their say -- Lund is 
hardly objective about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 She did feel uncomfortable watching a tape of herself being critical of horse 
tripping when being interviewed on "20/20," she said later. "I felt like I'd 
been towed across a very important line a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that unease is tempered by the knowledge that -- unlike most reporters, 
whose work rarely has a tangible impact -- she's making a difference. "This is 
unprecedented in my work," she said. "In my wildest expectations I never 
believed people would watch this on the air, and that they would form some 
opinions and care. My guess was that a lot of people would have problems with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some did. Lund said her horse-tripping coverage has prompted death 
threats, including a call from a woman mentioning plans to make her 
"disappear." About charges that her reporting is a slur on Mexican Americans? 
"This is not true," she said. "The problem is they ( charros ) are the only 
ones doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 And the problem is also that the scarcity of positive stories about Latinos 
casts a shadow over even the negative stories that are legitimate, making them 
appear, unfairly, to represent a conspiracy to smear a single ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 ANCHORS CONT. . . . What a week. Rarely have Los Angeles news anchors 
displayed more versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing they were no patsies when it came to interviewing, for example, 
KCBS-TV Channel 2 anchors Michael Tuck and Tritia Toyota brutally grilled 
Geraldo Rivera in a live encounter during Monday's 5 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based Rivera is in town to broadcast a week of "Geraldo" episodes 
keyed to the May ratings sweeps. Responding to a withering barrage of questions 
from Tuck and Toyota, he had no choice but to recount his "girl gangbangers" 
hour that had aired on Channel 2 immediately prior to the 5 p.m. newscast. And 
just when Rivera thought he was off the hook, Toyota struck with a frightening 
menace, demanding that he disclose the topics of his other Los Angeles 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a busy week, and I think it's a fair picture of what's going on," 
Rivera said. "At least on the dark side." 
</P>
<P>
 The dark side of Channel 2 is that it has gotten rid of its old news set but, 
judging by this cynically self-serving cross-promotion, still retains its old 
set of news ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at the precise moment Tuck began introducing Rivera, Los Angeles 
suffered an earthquake, as if the Almighty was registering a personal protest. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC-TV Channel 4 jumped on the story. Chuck Henry: "This earthquake, 
according to some amateurs, measured about 3.2." Some amateurs ? "Now we 
understand the measurement is about 3.0," Henry added immediately. Had the 
amateurs re-evaluated? Later that evening, Channel 4 reported that the quake 
registered a 3.2 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
 But first there was this bold news analysis by Paul Moyer after a story on 
comedian Bobcat Goldthwait's furniture-smashing tantrum on Friday night's 
episode of "The Arsenio Hall Show." Moyer, very perplexed: "The trouble is, you 
don't know if the Bobcat is serious or it's just shtick." 
</P>
<P>
 What better lead-in to the in-depth series that Monday's 5 p.m. newscast had 
been continually touting. As part of its monthlong emphasis on "40ish, female 
and fabulous" -- as if viewers are supposed to be stunned that middle-aged 
women aren't gnarled trolls -- here was anchor Colleen Williams' special report 
on "the agony of shopping for a bathing suit." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a couple of years ago that Williams was in Saudi Arabia for 
Channel 4, interviewing U.S. troops shipped to the Persian Gulf. Now the level 
of peril had risen dramatically. "No way to get around it," she reported. 
"Swimsuit shopping is traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
 As the female flesh paraded in front of the camera, Williams was utterly 
ruthless: "On the left a good suit, on the right a bad suit." 
</P>
<P>
 That was only a taste, for coming Tuesday was more about bathing suits, 
Williams' shocking expose of "hot new color cuts." But remember, kids, don't 
try this at home.

PLATINUM SOFTWARE FILLS TWO EXECUTIVE POSITIONS; MANAGEMENT: O.C. COMPANY SEEKS 
TO STEADY ITS OPERATIONS IN WAKE OF BOOKKEEPING SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rocked by a bookkeeping scandal that forced out its top executives 15 days 
ago, Platinum Software Corp. tried to stabilize its operations Tuesday by 
naming a permanent chief executive and hiring a new chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum director doubling as acting chief executive, 
decided to take the permanent chief executive's job in part because he now 
plans to recruit a chief operating officer to run day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company named Michael Simmons, 47, as chief financial 
officer. Simmons, who has 20 years of financial planning experience, was a 
colleague of Santoro for six years at Silicon Systems Inc., a Tustin computer 
chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum has been in turmoil since April 18 when it reported that flawed 
bookkeeping had resulted in errors that overstated revenue by as much as $10 
million for the past 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro, 52, replaces founder Gerald R. Blackie and Simmons replaces Jon 
Erickson. Two others, Timothy McMullen and Kevin P. Riegelsberger, resigned 
their positions as executive vice presidents. But, Santoro, said, they continue 
to work as employees on Platinum's operations committee, which runs daily 
company affairs while the search for a chief operating officer continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good they have a new management team," said Frank Michnoff, 
analyst for Prudential Securities Research in New York. "I would say they still 
have a big task in front of them to turn this company around." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the person who becomes chief operating officer, a new 
post at the company, will be key to Platinum's future.  
</P>
<P>
 The new executives will proceed with previously announced plans to restructure 
Platinum and to reduce its worldwide staff of 820 employees to an affordable 
level in light of its revised revenue expectations. They must also deal with 
potential customer defections, pending shareholder lawsuits alleging deceit and 
an expected investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said that Platinum has good opportunities to develop new accounting 
software technologies for computer networks and that he believes he can help 
turn the company around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can contribute things to the company to determine its strategic direction," 
said Santoro, who has served as chief executive at local high-tech companies 
such as AST Research Inc., Ashton-Tate and Silicon Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Michnoff said Santoro probably realized it would be easier to run the company 
himself than to persuade skilled candidates to take the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all likelihood, the restructuring will be done before the chief operating 
officer gets here," Santoro said. "The restructuring could happen in the next 
few weeks. I think it was a great accomplishment to get the chief financial 
officer on board quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 He praised Simmons as a good long-term strategist and a good crisis manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons had worked with Santoro at Silicon Systems but left in 1986 to join 
CPG International, an Irvine holding company that owned graphics supplies and 
office furniture businesses. It was created in 1986 as a result of a 
$55-million leveraged buyout of several businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving CPG in 1989, Simmons became executive vice president, chief 
financial and administrative officer of Dynasty Classics Corp. in Carson, a 
maker of commercial lighting products. He left that position in November. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine who served in Vietnam for three years, Simmons grew up on the 
East Coast and earned a master's degree in business administration from Rutgers 
University in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said he will try to report Platinum's financial situation to the SEC 
before a May 16 deadline for the company's next 10-Q, or quarterly financial 
statement. But he said the company would only do so if it is ready to report 
all of its expected revenue revisions and restructuring costs at that time.

JAMES FLANIGAN: SOUTH AFRICA HAS FOUNDATION FOR THE CHALLENGING TASK AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that South Africa, in its first multiracial election, has given the world 
an example of political courage and maturity, the hard work of fixing the 
economy will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 New President Nelson Mandela's government starts with some advantages -- but 
formidable obstacles too. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela inherits an economy that, however richly ornamented with gleaming 
cities and comfortable suburbs for some, remains a Third World economy for most 
of South Africa's 39 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 In total output of goods and services, South Africa is comparable to an 
industrial nation like Denmark. But in gross domestic product per person, it 
ranks behind Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela inherits a bloated, government-heavy economy in which more than 60% of 
the white working population is employed by state agencies or corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 But unemployment runs to 45% among the 29 million black people, more than 50% 
of whom are under the age of 18. South Africa's need for jobs and housing and 
education is acute. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Mandela's government comes to office with a Reconstruction and 
Development Program that recalls the New Deal of the 1930s in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The RDP plan of Mandela's African National Congress, which won almost 
two-thirds of the vote, is to spend $11 billion in the next five years to build 
houses and bring electrification and water, training and education to millions 
of South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa can afford such a program, it's a big economy," says Michael 
Brown, chief economist of Frankel Pollak, a brokerage firm in Johannesburg. He 
reckons 300,000 houses a year can be built without straining available 
resources and that the RDP will be a powerful engine for creating jobs and 
teaching skills. 
</P>
<P>
 For financing, South Africa's new government counts partly on foreign 
investment. It will soon come to world markets to float about $1 billion in 
bonds, with the help of a financial agent to be named shortly -- either J.P. 
Morgan, Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa will get a pretty good credit rating because it doesn't have 
much foreign debt," says Jonathan Auerbach of Auerbach Grayson, a New York 
financial firm. He reckons South Africa's new bonds will pay interest of about 
11% -- compared to more than 12% on old bonds currently outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit advantage for Mandela's government is ironic: The reason South 
Africa has low foreign debt is that it has been cut off from global markets for 
more than a decade because of world condemnation of its apartheid policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now such sanctions have been lifted and the new emphasis is on investment. 
South Africa will get $858 million from the International Monetary Fund. And it 
may receive up to $200 million a year in aid from the United States, where the 
Congressional Black Caucus has written President Clinton to urge support for 
the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 That money could pose a danger for bond investors if it inflames expectations 
for jobs and higher wages and leads to spiraling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But economists in Johannesburg point out that Mandela's first budget won't be 
presented until next March. And other forces, such as the current recovery from 
recession, are likely to ease the transition. "I think the next two years could 
be a honeymoon period," says economist Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term, the challenge remains to bring the benefits of industrial society 
to all. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, South Africa has an advantage over most developing countries. 
It has a vast mining industry -- the world leader in gold, diamonds and 
platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mining gives South Africa exports to the world, big companies capable of 
investing vast sums of capital, and a complex industry in which workers can 
learn every kind of skill, from the mine shaft to the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Afrikaaner people, descendants of Dutch and French settlers who have 
governed the country since 1948, built their National Party around mine labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, rural black labor has come into many mine jobs, at wages 
one-fourth those of white laborers. But now efforts will be made to close that 
wage gap, perhaps in new mines that will be opened over the next five years, 
say experts at Martin & Co., a Johannesburg investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's big companies, notably Anglo American Corp., which owns De 
Beers diamonds, Barlow Rand and Gencor Beherend Beperk, are all cash-rich these 
days, having built up capital during the four-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 New investments by those companies, whose top officers are conferring with 
chief economist Trevor Manuel and other ANC planners, could make a big 
difference in South Africa's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The country already has manufacturing industry, producing automobiles, steel, 
chemicals and all manner of consumer goods. It was never world-class industry, 
but it was competitive enough for Southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because apartheid -- introduced in 1948 -- held back development of 
most of South Africa's people, those consumer industries became uneconomical. 
Apartheid was an economic disaster as well as a moral one. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that apartheid is over, those industries could be revived and South 
Africa's consumer market could surge on pent-up demand. The houses to be built 
under the RDP, for example, will cost about $2,800 apiece -- "and that's well 
within the pocketbook of millions of people," says an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the risk as this complex country tries to move on? The greatest risk 
is disorder between people of different races, different backgrounds, as 
occurred in the year before this election. 
</P>
<P>
 But risk is always there. It's more intelligent to ask what's the promise. And 
that is that South Africa's people will develop and become more productive, 
becoming an engine for all of Africa -- and a light for the world. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand what such words mean, think of an unplowed field. It might be 
fertile, but nobody knows until the earth is turned and seeds are planted and 
allowed to grow. Then the possibilities are endless. 
</P>
<P>
 And that could be the way it is with South Africa today. The Unbalanced 
Country 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's total output of goods and services, or gross domestic product, 
ranks it with industrialized or advanced developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 GDP, In billions of dollars Denmark: $118.0 Turkey: $117.3 South Africa: 
$114.0 Norway: $112.2 Malaysia: $50.4 Figures are for 1993

<P>
 But its highly unbalanced economy-high living standards for 13% of the 
population, poverty for more than 70%-leave its GDP per person trailing many 
countries with poorer, less developed economies: 
</P>

DRUG MAKERS CAN'T BEAT 'EM SO THEY JOIN MANAGED CARE; PHARMACEUTICALS: IN 
SEPARATE DEALS, PFIZER AND SMITHKLINE BEECHAM LINK UP WITH COST-CUTTING GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two major drug companies announced separate deals Tuesday to join forces with 
managed health care companies, acknowledging those firms' growing influence 
over how drugs are priced and distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, health maintenance organizations and companies that manage drug 
benefits for employers and other groups are overseeing decisions about which 
medications are prescribed and how much they cost, often demanding steep 
discounts. Ten years ago, doctors had a virtual free hand in deciding which 
drugs their patients should receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend contributed last year to the lowest overall price increase for new 
and existing drugs in years -- 3.1%, down from 6.4% in 1992 and 7.8% in 1991 -- 
presumably saving consumers money on their health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than resist the managed care trend, officials of drug makers Pfizer 
Inc. and SmithKline Beecham said they were striking deals with managed care 
firms to gain more control over the price and distribution of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking its first step into managed care, London-based SmithKline Beecham said 
it would pay $2.3 billion in cash to buy Minneapolis-based Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services, a fast-growing prescription benefit management company 
that controlled drug expenditures of nearly $2 billion for 11 million Americans 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know the environment in which we work is changing rapidly," said Jan 
Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive. "The winners will position themselves to 
capitalize on change. Those who fail to adapt will lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pfizer and SmithKline announcements came a day after Switzerland's Roche 
Holdings offered to buy struggling Silicon Valley drug maker Syntex Corp. for a 
whopping $5.3 billion. In yet another drug-industry deal, Eastman Kodak Co. 
said Tuesday that it is putting its pharmaceutical subsidiary, Sterling 
Winthrop Inc., up for sale to focus on its core photography and imaging 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deals signal that the pace of consolidation in the 
$65-billion-a-year drug industry is quickening. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements set off a flurry of activity in U.S. and European drug 
stocks as investors placed bets on the drug makers most likely to attract 
suitors. Most of the takeover speculation focused on medium-size drug makers, 
such as Upjohn Co. and Schering-Plough Corp., which analysts view as most 
vulnerable to the changes swamping health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the merger activity got jump-started last year when New 
Jersey-based drug maker Merck & Co. paid $6 billion for Medco Containment 
Services, a drug benefit management and mail-order drug firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the industry is basically trying to figure out how to respond to 
a new competitor (Merck-Medco) that controls 35 million lives and is growing 
rapidly," said Eran Broshy, a partner in charge of health care research at the 
Boston Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline said the acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services allows 
it to move beyond its traditional business of developing and manufacturing 
drugs into the area of managing health care delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline, the world's third-largest drug maker, also reached a six-year 
agreement for exclusive rights to disease management data from HMOs owned by 
DPS's parent firm, United HealthCare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pfizer said it had struck a series of agreements with 
Connecticut-based managed health provider Value Health Inc. aimed at boosting 
sales of Pfizer drugs through managed care networks. They include a 
$100-million joint venture to develop health care businesses focusing on such 
illnesses as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Pfizer will gain assurances that its drugs will be listed on Value 
Health's "formularies," or its approved list of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug makers' efforts to align themselves with firms like Medco, DPS and Value 
Health are being driven by remarkable growth in the drug management business. 
According to figures supplied by SmithKline, about 50 million Americans have 
their prescription drug benefits managed by such firms. The drug maker expects 
that figure to double to 100 million by 1997, with even faster growth if 
Congress passes health reform legislation that encourages managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 To help employers control drug costs, HMOs and managed care firms negotiate 
deep price discounts with drug makers. In exchange, the drug makers get more 
sales. The negotiating clout of managed care firms is boosted by the increasing 
availability of generic drugs, which are identical to brand-name drugs but 
often cost far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest HMO with 4.5 million members in 
California and 6.6 million nationwide, is a case in point. Kaiser spent roughly 
$750 million on drugs last year, and thus wields significant influence over the 
drug industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser designates a physician group to determine which medications for heart, 
ulcer or other illnesses are the safest and most effective. When several drugs 
are judged of equal medical benefit, Kaiser takes bids from drug makers to 
include their products on its approved list. It usually picks the two or three 
least expensive drugs out of that group, said Albert L. Carver, director of 
pharmacy operations for Kaiser Permanente of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser is also highly effective at getting its 9,000 full-time doctors to 
prescribe drugs from the approved list. In Southern California, about 99% of 
Kaiser prescriptions are from the list, while more than 60% of the total are 
generics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very successful at influencing the market share of drugs in our 
program," Carver said.

KODAK TO UNLOAD DRUG UNIT, TWO SUBSIDIARIES; RESTRUCTURING: FIRST MAJOR MOVE BY 
NEW CHAIRMAN IS INTENDED TO FOCUS GROWTH ON FIRM'S 'IMAGING' BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Closing the books on a failed diversification strategy, Eastman Kodak Co. said 
Tuesday that it will sell its Sterling Winthrop drug unit and two other 
subsidiaries in order to pay down debt and focus resources on photography and 
other "imaging" businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff is the first big initiative undertaken by Kodak Chairman George 
M.C. Fisher, who took the helm of the staid photography giant last fall with a 
vow to transform it into a major player in a variety of Information Age 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally applauded the divestitures, which come at a time of frantic 
consolidation in the worldwide drug business. Kodak shares jumped $1.375 to 
$46.125 on the New York Stock Exchange after surging $3.25 on Monday in 
anticipation of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher's broader strategy for restoring growth at Kodak, outlined at 
meetings here with reporters and analysts, was peppered with platitudes and 
drew a more skeptical reaction from Wall Street and at least some employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good that they are focusing back on the core business, but there's no 
real change in the near-term outlook," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at 
NatWest Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Fisher -- who as chief executive of Motorola Inc. was credited 
with turning that company into a world-beating electronics powerhouse -- said 
Kodak will improve earnings in the short run by running the company more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Three to five years down the line, he said, growth will start to come from new 
product and marketing initiatives and expansion of overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher expressed confidence that Kodak's traditional film and photographic 
chemical business will remain strong. He downplayed concerns about intensifying 
price competition in the consumer film business and rejected the widely held 
notion that chemical film will quickly be undermined by electronic cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand electronics, and I understand what it can do at a reasonable 
cost," Fisher said in an interview. "It's going to be a long, long time before 
electronics supplants high-resolution, 35-millimeter imaging." Still, Fisher 
said, Kodak has major opportunities to expand in the electronic-imaging arena. 
The prospects include everything from low-resolution electronic cameras to 
photocopiers, computer printers, digital picture transmission systems and photo 
editing software. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was the previous management's pessimism about traditional 
photography that led Kodak to diversify in the first place. Sterling Drug, 
acquired for a premium price of $5.1 billion in 1988, was the centerpiece of 
that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sterling -- later split into Sterling Winthrop, a drug company, and L&F 
Products, a personal care and household products company -- proved to need more 
investment than Kodak could afford. Debt from the acquisition has also been a 
big burden. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, Fisher's strategy is a continuation of plans put in place by 
Kay Whitmore, who was forced to step down as CEO last year by angry 
shareholders and an impatient board. Whitmore split off Kodak's other big 
non-imaging business -- a specialty chemical company -- and oversaw a series of 
job cuts, culminating in a 10,000-employee downsizing announced last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said no new layoffs are on the immediate horizon, but he did not rule 
out the possibility of additional job reductions down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale of Sterling Winthrop, L&F, and Kodak's clinical 
diagnostics division will be used to pay off debt, which currently totals about 
$7 billion, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry L. Kavetas, a former IBM executive who was hired as chief financial 
officer three months ago, all but conceded that Kodak -- facing a market shaken 
by health care reform -- would not get what it paid for Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst estimates of proceeds from the sales ranged from $3 billion to $5 
billion. Sterling will probably be sold in chunks; a French joint venture 
partner and Bayer, the big German drug maker, are among the likely bidders.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher stressed that Kodak had no intention of "throwing money at the great 
information superhighway in the sky." But he indicated a willingness to take on 
some risky challenges, notably making Kodak a much bigger player in the 
manufacture of cameras and electronic products -- businesses currently 
dominated by Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely do not accept the tenet that U.S. companies cannot manufacture," 
he said. "I've been in that battle all my life and never lost once." Indeed, 
Motorola's successes lay in its ability to build cellular phones, pagers and 
other sophisticated, high-volume electronics products better than its Japanese 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak is also counting on growth in developing countries -- notably in Asia 
and Eastern Europe -- to compensate for relatively stagnant film sales and the 
rise of electronic imaging in the industrialized world.

U.S. ECONOMY STILL GROWING, INDICATORS SHOW; FORECAST: MARCH INDEX, AT RECORD 
HIGH, POINTS TO MODEST GAINS. RECOVERY IS EVIDENT IN ALL REGIONS, INCLUDING THE 
PACIFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The nation's key indicator of future economic expansion reached a record high 
in March, a sign of continued modest growth after a lull due to bad weather in 
February, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely watched index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7%, showing a 
seventh month of growth out of the last eight, the Commerce Department said. 
The index reached 101.2, its highest level since record-keeping began in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the private Conference Board reported Tuesday that for the first 
time since 1988, all parts of the United States were growing economically, 
including the Pacific region, which was hit particularly hard by the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic state of the union is quite satisfactory at the present, with 
the expansion firmly in place across a broad front," said Robert Dederick, 
chief economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and Clinton Administration officials downplayed fears that 
continuing economic growth would lead to inflation -- a concern that has 
prompted the Federal Reserve Board to bump up short-term interest rates by 
three-quarters of a percentage point since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington on Tuesday, Laura 
D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, 
said the indicators confirm the Administration's expectation that the economy 
will expand at a modest 3% rate this year and that the inflation rate will also 
be about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the index's 11 components showed improvement in March, the Commerce 
Department said. The index is designed to foreshadow economic activity six to 
nine months ahead. It was flat in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in March was due mainly to a longer average workweek compared to the 
month before, when severe winter weather kept many people at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The average workweek increased to 42.2 hours, the longest since World War II, 
said Barry Beckman, chief of the business cycle indicators branch of the 
department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the strength in the indicators . . . is tied to (non-defense) 
manufacturing activity," said Joseph Carson, chief economist with Dean Witter 
Reynolds in New York. "It's what we call trading places (with foreign 
competitors): U.S. manufacturing is a low-cost producer on a global basis 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 The only indicators that fell were stock prices, which have been spooked by 
rising interest rates, and the time it took companies to deliver goods. 
Delivery waits were shorter, which indicates fewer orders, the Commerce 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the New York-based Conference Board, a private business research 
group, said its regional performance index, which measures local economic 
activity, rose to 122.5 in February from 121.6 the month before, with all 
regions of the country showing year-over-year growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic growth late last year got to the point where it really carried all 
regions into the plus column," said Jason Bram, an economist with the 
Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midwest economy, stoked by resurgent manufacturing, and the Mountain and 
South Atlantic regions grew the fastest. They were trailed by the Northeast, 
New England and Pacific regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reports echoed that upbeat outlook Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchasing executives at industrial companies estimate that revenues will 
rise 7% in 1994, according to a survey conducted by the National Organization 
of Purchasing Management. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 80% of corporate financial executives expect their companies to take 
in more revenue in the next six months, and many are predicting higher profits, 
according to a survey released Tuesday by the Financial Executives Institute.

THE CUTTING EDGE; LAND OF DISENCHANTMENT; IN NEW MEXICO, SOME RESIDENTS ARE 
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT INTEL'S LATEST CHIP PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, this scrubby suburb of Albuquerque crowed when it beat out rivals 
in California and elsewhere as the site of Intel Corp.'s latest billion-dollar 
computer chip plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Enticed by the promise of high-wage jobs, the town's economic development team 
ponied up big tax breaks and other incentives. Intel loudly praised New 
Mexico's business climate, so much friendlier than its home state's high costs 
and onerous regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days -- as Intel clashes with environmental groups and the 
neighboring village of Corrales over air quality, water use and population 
growth -- New Mexico seems decidedly chillier. You'd almost think Intel was 
building in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as construction of the new plant proceeds, teams of Intel lawyers and 
managers have been slogging through hours of hearings that will decide whether 
the company gets access to the hefty volumes of water required to make computer 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 June will mean more meetings with state officials and nearby residents, who 
last year blamed foul odors emanating from two existing Intel plants at the 
site for skin rashes, nausea and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected opposition is giving Intel its own headaches and serves as a 
cautionary reminder for other companies that the grass isn't always greener 
somewhere else -- especially in western locales where the environment is 
fragile and water scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people live in these places because companies like Intel are not there," 
said Philip M. Burgess, president and senior fellow of the Center for the New 
West, a think tank in Denver. "They move for the pristine valleys. The last 
thing they want is another cloverleaf. This kind of resistance will be popping 
up more and more around the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sheppard, Intel's manager of the Rio Rancho site, acknowledged that the 
opposition caught the company by surprise. Even though no one expects the 
wrangling to derail the plant, it has caused consternation at Intel and added 
to the already huge cost of keeping pace in the fiercely competitive 
semiconductor industry. And echoes of the complaints are already being heard in 
Chandler, Ariz., just announced as the site for Intel's next plant. All this 
suggests that the intensified anti-growth sentiment cropping up in New Mexico 
and Arizona might eventually make California look like a better bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Albuquerque area, community activists contend that jobs will mean 
little if industry destroys the quality of life that drew people to the Rio 
Grande basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Kraft, who served as former President Jimmy Carter's appointment secretary 
and now lives below the mesa where giant cranes are helping to sculpt the new 
Intel plant, put it this way at a Corrales town meeting: "We've rolled out the 
red carpet, and now we're finding out our guest has bad breath and an 
unquenchable thirst." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a number of smaller California companies, Intel was drawn to Rio Rancho, 
about 10 miles north of Albuquerque, by the clean air, the nearby Sandia 
Mountains, the pleasant lifestyle -- and the cheap labor. The Silicon Valley 
pioneer, based in Santa Clara, Calif., opened its first Rio Rancho plant in 
1980 and had 2,700 workers when the expansion was announced in 1993. Their 
production accounted for 70% of Intel's $8.8 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the phenomenal demand for its microprocessors, which compose the 
"brains" of most of the world's desktop computers, Intel last year zoomed ahead 
of Japanese rivals to become the world's leading chip maker. The company has 
expanded rapidly in Rio Rancho and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Securing the new Intel fabrication plant, designed to produce Intel's 
state-of-the-art Pentium processors and the next-generation P6 chip, was a coup 
for Rio Rancho, a town of 40,000 with a checkered past but a hunger for 
progress. Its founders served time in jail in the 1970s for violating federal 
law by peddling barren lots through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recruited Intel's "Fab 11," as the expansion is called, with an 
incentive package valued at $114 million. The big project -- for which Intel 
says construction costs could climb as high as $1.8 billion -- has already 
provided jobs for 3,000 construction workers. Once completed in 1995, the new 
plant is expected to employ 2,400 people -- up from initial projections of 
1,000 -- bringing the total site payroll to $185 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For New Mexico officials, aching to break free of the state's dependence on 
natural resource and government jobs, such manufacturing holds great allure. 
The average Intel wage in Rio Rancho is $35,000 a year, more than twice the 
state's average per-capita income. 
</P>
<P>
 Young New Mexicans say the plant offers the sort of career opportunity that 
has been rare. "It's a place to work if you want to stay in the state," said 
Sarah Chavez, an environmental engineer hired by Intel straight out of the New 
Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said local economic development directors often get caught up in the 
enthusiasm of snaring a company but that the tax subsidies provided as a lure 
can end up costing current residents in higher property taxes to pay for more 
schools, roads and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Corrales, where many residents live just yards from Intel's 
chain-link fences, the costs of the new plant can seem large. This historic 
village was founded nearly three centuries ago by descendants of Spanish 
conquistadors, who carved out long, skinny farms along the Rio Grande and dug 
irrigation canals that enabled them to grow crops despite the arid, sandy 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 7,500 residents are an eclectic mix of alfalfa farmers, physicists, 
doctors, lawyers and artists, many of whom keep horses and burros in their 
yards. The dirt roads and sagebrush are giving way to pavement in a glaring 
sign of the profound changes coming to this desert community. Yet most 
Corralenos, as the residents call themselves, still pump their water from 
shallow wells that tap the extensive aquifer that also serves Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and David Rockwell moved from Tucson in 1978, drawn by Corrales' rural 
charms and rose-hued adobes. Every weekend, they saddle up the horses they keep 
in their yard at the end of a rutted dirt road and ride through the bosque 
(pronounced boskay), the cottonwood forest that lines the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, David Rockwell spent $1,000 on medical bills because of persistent 
headaches and a rash. After comparing notes, he and other neighbors surmised 
that a sour smell emanating from Intel might be the cause, and they began a 
campaign of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While maintaining that its chemicals meet federal guidelines and are not 
responsible, Intel nonetheless decided to experiment with new chemicals and 
installed $10 million of thermal oxidizers and other pollution-abatement 
equipment. At the June hearings, the company hopes to win the state's 
permission to activate the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the health complaints have wound down. Of far greater 
concern now to Corralenos is Intel's gigantic thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 When Intel picked Rio Rancho, conventional wisdom held that the area was 
blessed with a boundless aquifer. The company applied for permits to drill 
three wells, each 2,000 feet deep, to draw as much as 4 million gallons a day. 
But soon after, a U.S. Geological Survey report noted that the water table had 
fallen and that the underground supply might prove inadequate in a few short 
decades, given the region's industrial and population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have a situation where everybody's well runs dry," Barbara Rockwell 
said. "You have this hanging over your heads. The quality of our life is really 
seriously compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 She and other activists suspect that State Engineer Eluid Martinez will grant 
Intel's well permits by mid-June but will require the company to honor promises 
to cut water use by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although skeptical, Rockwell takes some satisfaction that both Intel and 
economic development officials have learned some lessons. Once quite insular, 
Intel has formed a community advisory group and become more involved in local 
affairs. It also agreed -- with New Mexico's two national laboratories, Sandia 
and Los Alamos -- to explore ways to reduce water use. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel also maintains that it has no regrets about picking Rio Rancho. "We're 
not about to walk away from ($2 billion) in investments," spokesman Richard 
Draper said. "We plan to be here a long time."

 Tri-State Financial Charged With Defrauding Investors: The Los Angeles County 
district attorney charged six Southern California business people with 
defrauding more than 400 investors of $25 million in a deal involving 
commercial real estate investments. The district attorney and the California 
Department of Corporations began investigating Tri-State Financial Group in 
1991 after investors complained that they had not received interest payments 
from Tri-State limited real estate partnerships and promissory notes. 
Investigators claim Tri-State officials violated state securities laws by, 
among other things, misrepresenting the value of securities and failing to 
submit them to state officials for review.

WILSON NARROWS SCOPE OF HIS POST-QUAKE OVERTIME WAIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday narrowed a post-earthquake order intended to ease 
traffic congestion by encouraging flexibility on work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's order had exempted employers in five Southern California 
counties from a state requirement that they pay most employees -- including 
part-timers -- overtime wages if they work more than eight hours in a single 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim was to take some cars off the freeways during rush hours by having 
employees work four 10-hour days a week and other flexible schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilson narrowed the scope of the order to Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. He cited improved traffic conditions and speedy repairs to 
earthquake-damaged roads. As a result, he said, effective May 15, the waiver of 
daily overtime no longer will apply to Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under both the old and the new orders, employees who work more than 40 hours 
in a week still are entitled to overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's original order split business and labor groups. Labor officials 
worried that it was a back-door assault on the eight-hour work day. Business 
leaders regarded it as a challenge to old workplace rules that have damaged the 
state's economy by making it a tough place in which to run a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rankin, research director for the California Labor Federation, called 
Wilson's revision of the order an improvement, because, he said, it "never made 
much sense in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley R. Kyker, executive vice president of the California Restaurant Assn., 
said he supports efforts aimed at encouraging flexible scheduling in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, the temporary nature of the daily overtime waiver has deterred 
most restaurants from taking advantage of it.

 20th Century Seeks to Raise Quake Coverage Rate: Swamped by an estimated $475 
million in claims costs from the Northridge earthquake, 20th Century Insurance 
Co. applied for earthquake insurance rate increases averaging 172% for houses 
and 400% for condominiums.Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi scheduled a May 
11 hearing in Los Angeles on the application and the company's earlier request 
for a 21.8% hike in homeowners insurance rates. Woodland Hills-based 20th 
Century's current rates -- a statewide average -- are $2 per $1,000 of coverage 
for frame houses and $9 per $1,000 on masonry homes. Rates are higher in

FOUNDER OF HYUNDAI GROUP STEPPING DOWN; ASIA: CHUNG JU YUNG SAYS HE'LL TEND HIS 
RICE FARM FROM NOW ON. HE HOPES TO END POLITICAL RETALIATION AGAINST THE 
CONGLOMERATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Chung Ju Yung, the Hyundai Group's flamboyant founder who staged a quixotic 
bid for the South Korean presidency in 1992, abruptly announced Tuesday that he 
will retire, in a move aimed at ending two years of political retaliation 
against his multibillion-dollar conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics should be handled by politicians," Chung, 79, said before heading to 
Tokyo in what is viewed as a temporary exile abroad to placate his political 
archrival, South Korean President Kim Young Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung, who built Hyundai into South Korea's second-largest business group, 
claiming $47 billion in annual sales in such fields as cars, computers and 
construction, said he will spend the rest of his life tending his rice farm in 
Sosan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung's exile and retirement as Hyundai's honorary chairman was viewed as the 
ruling party's precondition for ending a protracted war against the business 
group that has squeezed its ability to raise cheap capital, expand capacity and 
develop new business fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Chung first began tangling with Kim's predecessor, Roh Tae Woo, the 
government has hit him and his group with an $180-million fine for evading 
inheritance taxes, a $35-million penalty over a tax evasion case involving 
Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., a freeze on low-interest Korea Development Bank 
loans, delayed approval of overseas security issues and a refusal to allow 
three Hyundai Group companies to go public on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the government had approved similar requests by Hyundai's 
archrival, Samsung, for KDB loans and permission to go public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been blatant favoritism toward Samsung," said Don Lee, analyst with 
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. But Chung's resignation "should pave the 
way for better relations between Hyundai and the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said Hyundai's ambitious expansion plan would have been jeopardized 
without a truce enabling it to acquire low-cost financing. Hyundai Motor Co., 
for instance, is planning to invest $3.8 billion by 2000 to increase its 
production capacity to 2.3 million units a year from the current 1.1 million, 
Lee said. Its aim: to become one of the Top 10 auto makers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung invited the enmity of Korea's political establishment when he formed a 
party and waged a wild-card presidential campaign often compared to Ross 
Perot's in the United States. His decision to jump into politics stemmed from 
unhappiness with the ruling party's policies, among them Roh's kibosh on one of 
Chung's cherished projects: to develop Mt. Diamond with North Korean 
authorities in his native Kanwan province.

FDA WILL DEFINE 'HEALTHY' FOR FOOD LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top Food and Drug Administration official said Tuesday that the agency this 
week plans to issue rules on when manufacturers may call a food "healthy," 
closing what consumer advocates have viewed as a loophole in federal food label 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 F. Edward Scarbrough, the FDA's labeling chief, would not provide details 
about how the agency will define healthful, or "healthy," foods. He did say, 
however, that certain products in the Healthy Choice food line will be 
affected. A representative of ConAgra, maker of Healthy Choice, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy Choice is perhaps the best known of food lines that use "healthy" on 
their labels, either as part of the brand name or as a description. Consumer 
advocates have complained that, while many of these foods have reduced amounts 
of salt or fat, they are not necessarily rich in vitamins or other nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates were also concerned that food manufacturers, unable to meet 
new definitions of "light" or other descriptive terms, would substitute 
"healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarbrough made his comments after a press briefing on the agency's food label 
reforms that take effect Sunday. On that date, manufacturers of processed food 
will be required to use uniform nutritional labels containing information on 
fat, sodium, protein and other nutrients and to meet strict definitions for 11 
descriptive terms, such as "fat-free" or "low-sodium." 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey two years ago, the National Consumers League counted more than 300 
products with "healthy" on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the FDA is likely to restrict the sodium and fat contents of a 
"healthy" food, and require that it contain at least 10% of the daily value for 
at least one of the following: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium, iron or fiber. 
Sodium may be the most difficult ingredient to limit, since it enhances flavor.

EL SEGUNDO FIRM WINS $1-BILLION NASA CONTRACT 
</P>

<P>
 Computer Sciences Corp. in El Segundo said Tuesday that it has won a contract 
to provide services to NASA that could be worth $1 billion over eight years -- 
the biggest government award in the company's 35-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The award calls for Computer Sciences to provide a variety of computer and 
telecommunications support services to the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA develops space transportation systems and performs scientific and 
engineering research at the center. About 1,000 workers from Computer Sciences' 
Applied Technology Division in Falls Church, Va., will provide the services at 
the Huntsville site. 
</P>
<P>
 The services will include computer systems and software, telephone and 
audio-video services, as well as communications networking among NASA 
installations and the agency's contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The company provides computer and engineering services to NASA locations such 
as the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, as well as to the Navy Air 
Warfare Center at Point Mugu, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer Sciences provides its services not only to the federal government -- 
which accounted for 51% of the company's $2.48 billion in revenue last year -- 
but also to financial, industrial and service companies and local U.S. and 
foreign governments. The company employs about 29,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer Sciences shares closed at $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 
12.5 cents, before the announcement was made. JAMES F. PELTZ

ELECTRONIC ARTS-BRODERBUND MERGER IS OFF; COMPUTERS: COLLAPSE IS INDICATIVE OF 
CONFUSION OVER HOW INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE COMPANIES SHOULD BE VALUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the eeny-meeny-miny-mo game of collapsing media mergers, the Electronic 
Arts-Broderbund Software deal is today's "it." 
</P>
<P>
 The two interactive software developers, based in San Mateo and Novato, 
respectively, had agreed in November to merge in a stock swap then valued at 
$400 million. But, as if playing copycat with their bigger media siblings, they 
called off the deal Tuesday, citing recent stock price declines and a 
disagreement over their relative worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The disintegration of what would have been the largest merger so far in the 
home multimedia software industry comes in the wake of several canceled 
alliances between cable and phone companies, most notably Bell Atlantic Corp. 
and Tele-Communications Inc. And this week Viacom Inc.'s planned merger with 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. appears to have unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Those deals went sour in part because investors once hyped on the vision of 
the futuristic so-called information superhighway sent stock prices of many 
cable, software and media firms tumbling after realizing that it was more 
futuristic than they had at first thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Arts, the leading producer of interactive games such as "John 
Madden Football," was to acquire Broderbund in exchange for shares of 
Electronic Arts stock, which was trading as high as $38 last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Electronic Arts shares have since slumped, falling $1.69 on Tuesday to 
close at $20.06 in Nasdaq trading. The decline, due largely to concerns over 
how the company will handle the transition from cartridge-based games to 
next-generation CD-ROM software, meant that the stock being offered for 
Broderbund was worth perhaps $50 million less than when the deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderbund, which dominates the educational software market with such titles 
as "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" recently won the electronic rights 
to the "Dr. Seuss" books. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shareholder's meeting set for next week, Broderbund's board told 
Electronic Arts on Friday that it wanted out of the deal. A revised offer put 
together by Electronics Arts executives over the weekend was also rejected. 
Broderbund agreed to pay Electronic Arts $10 million to terminate the 
arrangement. Its shares jumped $6.50 to $41.25 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal's demise reflects several factors, including a generally lower stock 
market. But most of all, the collapse reflects confusion over how to value 
interactive software companies, the prices of which were bid wildly higher by 
bigger media companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives knowledgeable about the Broderbund-Electronic Arts deal said a key 
reason for Broderbund's withdrawal was the $462-million price tag British media 
giant Pearson agreed to pay last month for Broderbund's smaller and less 
esteemed competitor Software Toolworks -- nearly four times the company's 
annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the consolidation of the industry will continue as companies 
realize the value of size in getting coveted shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a sign of any inherent problems in the industry," said Keith 
Benjamin, who follows interactive software for Robertson Stephens & Co., a San 
Francisco investment bank. "It's a classic example of two companies disagreeing 
on price."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; HEALTH STOCKS MAY BE IN RECOVERY -- BUT 
TAKE IT SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two days' worth of big merger deals in the health care industry may be 
whetting some investors' appetites for stocks in this long-unloved market 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidation alone won't spur a new bull market in this group, of course. 
There have been several waves of health care mergers in recent years, but the 
stocks have mostly just continued to drop. With federal health care reform 
still uncertain in timing and scope, many investors can't find a good reason to 
dive into these stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, for bargain-hunting investors health care may not be a bad place to 
shop. Many of the stocks are now in their third year of decline, and quite a 
few are selling for nominally cheap prices relative to earnings. Not all of 
these companies are headed for Chapter 11 after all -- reform or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Owens, manager of the Vanguard Specialized Health Care fund in Valley 
Forge, Pa., says Monday's $5.3-billion takeover bid for drug giant Syntex, by 
Switzerland's Roche Holdings, is a vindication of sorts for his fund's 28% 
weighting in major drug company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 While conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that the drug companies will be 
among the biggest victims of health care reform, Owens sees it differently. The 
companies' pricing power isn't what it used to be, he concedes, but in the long 
run, he argues, the truly innovative firms should still be able to realize 
significant payoffs -- worldwide -- for their research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has always been a business where the real wealth is created by the 
discovery of important new drugs," Owens says. Syntex has lagged in new 
discoveries recently, but Roche evidently saw enough potential in Syntex's 
pipeline to warrant a rich takeover price, Owens says. "The message is that the 
value in pharmaceutical companies is in the pipeline," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the market takes a brighter view of drug firms for that reason, Pfizer and 
Johnson & Johnson should benefit, Owens says. Pfizer's research-stage drug for 
rheumatoid arthritis "could be a blockbuster," he says, while J&J, best known 
as a maker of over-the-counter medical supplies, "is becoming more and more a 
drug company." Both are major holdings in Owens' fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, biotech stocks, many of which have plunged again this year, may 
begin to attract more interest if the market's focus turns to the long-term 
value in research-stage drugs. About 10% of the Vanguard fund's $582 million in 
assets are in biotech shares, including Biogen, Genetics Institute and Alliance 
Pharmaceutical. "I think biotech is more attractive than it has been in a long 
time," Owens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a set of deals announced Tuesday may have highlighted hidden value 
in another major health sector. SmithKline Beecham agreed to buy United 
HealthCare's drug management division, while Pfizer launched a joint venture 
with another managed care firm, Value Health. 
</P>
<P>
 The managed care companies are the controllers at the delivery end of the 
health care system, advising businesses on how to structure health plans and 
how to get the right prescriptions into plan beneficiaries' hands at the best 
price. The drug companies have increasingly felt the need to either move right 
into distribution themselves (note Merck's decision last year to buy Medco 
Containment, a mail-order drug firm) or to strike deals with managed care 
providers, who direct an increasingly large share of health care spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same lines, Barry Kurokawa, manager of the $460-million Invesco 
Health Sciences fund in Denver, says some of the best stock values in health 
care remain the service providers such as HMOs and the largest of the hospital 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The major hospital stocks, such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare and Healthtrust, 
were rediscovered by Wall Street last year, but Kurokawa argues that "they're 
still selling for reasonable valuations" of 13 to 15 times estimated 1995 
earnings per share. He believes the companies are capable of 20% annual 
earnings growth, as their increasing size and power provide them with greater 
leeway to demand price concessions from makers of medical equipment and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that specialize in home health care, such as infusion services for 
the elderly and others, also deserve more respect on Wall Street, Kurokawa 
contends. He sees a place for them under health care reform and believes that 
"a lot of them are attractively priced now." Two that he owns are Caremark 
International and T2 Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kurokawa concedes, the next true bull market in health stocks may have 
to wait until investors lose their fascination with industrial, technology and 
other issues that benefit most from the burgeoning economy. That means patience 
is still a requirement in health care investing. Waiting for a Turn 
</P>
<P>

third bad year--unless investor sentiment toward the industry is turning. How

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, KEMPER WANTS $65 A SHARE; MERGERS: THE INSURANCE AND 
INVESTMENT COMPANY URGES SHAREHOLDERS TO REJECT A BID FROM GE, WHICH HAS 
OFFERED $55. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kemper Corp. named its price Tuesday: $65 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance and investment company described the figure as a target to 
determine whether it should be sold a year from now. But some analysts called 
it a counteroffer to General Electric Co.'s $55-a-share takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're setting a floor on what they think they're worth in value, 
and it's up to GE to respond to that," said Michael Lewis of Dean Witter, 
Discover & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper shareholders will vote on GE's proposed takeover at Kemper's annual 
meeting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Chairman David Mathis urged shareholders in a letter to reject GE's bid 
and be patient with the company's plan to boost its stock price. He said that 
if Kemper's stock fails to reach $65 on at least 10 of 20 consecutive trading 
days by May 26, 1995, the board will propose that Kemper be sold to the highest 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's stock ended Tuesday at $57.125, off $1.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on concern that management's latest pitch to shareholders will be 
successful and ultimately stave off GE. 
</P>
<P>
 The shares are down from a 52-week high of $62.125, reached in March when GE 
first launched its $55 bid. 
</P>
<P>
 GE's finance unit, GE Capital Corp., responded that Kemper shareholders now 
have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Shareholders of Kemper have the opportunity to choose for themselves now 
between the immediate delivery of value through the sale of the company, versus 
waiting to see what might or might not transpire at some indefinite time in the 
future," GE Capital said. Kemper spokeswoman Janice Kalmar said $65 a share "is 
not intended to be a valuation of Kemper in any respect." But analysts who have 
been following the company's jousting with GE saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're telling GE to either put up or go away," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper, based in the Chicago suburb of Long Grove, has called GE's bid a "low 
ball" proposal. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., has indicated that it might bid 
higher after analyzing Kemper's property holdings, but Kemper has refused to 
turn over its real estate portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Some large Kemper investors indicated after reading the letter that they were 
inclined to back Kemper management. Institutional investors generally agree 
that Kemper is worth more than $55 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the two choices currently presented to shareholders, it is clear that 
voting for Kemper management is the superior alternative," said Southeastern 
Asset Management Inc., holder of an 8% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Kelton, president of Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc., an institutional brokerage 
firm that has placed about 10% of Kemper's stock with European investors, said, 
"On balance, the feeling is to give the Kemper people a chance to show what 
they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kemper meeting next week, shareholders will either reelect a slate of 
four Kemper directors, including Mathis, or elect four GE nominees, who would 
push for a sale at $55 a share.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; AN EARTHQUAKE ALERT 
SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people can tell when an earthquake hits, but some need to know the 
epicenter and the magnitude a lot more precisely than others. More than 100 
Southern Californians -- mainly utility and emergency services workers -- carry 
special pagers that are activated by the Caltech-U.S. Geological Survey 
Broadcast of Earthquakes system two minutes after a magnitude 3.0 or greater 
earthquake. From Quake to Belt 1. Earth movements are detected by a network of 
seismometers and transmitted by microwave or phone line to Caltech computers. 
2. The computers quickly determine the location and magnitude of the earthquake

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTIES; ON-LINE SERVICES PUSH THE ENVELOPE ON COPYRIGHT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Paramount Communications Inc. recently discovered that computer files 
containing images and sounds from its "Star Trek" television series were free 
for the taking on America Online, the studio complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the on-line service remove the files, it also announced a review 
of all its computerized libraries to avoid other copyright violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken by itself, the case is just a footnote in the history of cyberspace law. 
But it was far from the last problem that will arise over copyright issues as 
the on-line world matures. 
</P>
<P>
 Law or no law, cyberspace denizens have always freely distributed copyrighted 
information on computer networks. In the early days of computing, the on-line 
clubhouse was tiny; copyright owners either didn't know what was going on or 
didn't care enough to complain. But those days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies with copyrights are starting to realize that they have to do 
something about the on-line world, either to capture revenue they may be 
missing or keep from diluting value of their product," said Nora Cannon, a 
partner in King & Ballow, a Nashville, Tenn., law firm that specializes in 
information transfer issues. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, for example, is fighting a lawsuit over MIDI files -- computer 
readable and reproducible music files -- that it makes available to 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue is not just a matter of controlling information junkies who want 
a picture of Capt. Kirk on their computer screen. If commercial development of 
on-line services is to proceed unhindered, there is general agreement that 
copyright law will have to be clarified and modernized. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are asking me how they can go to market without falling afoul 
of other copyrights," said David Nimmer, a copyright lawyer at Irell & Manella 
in Los Angeles. "It's a largely uncharted area." PAUL KARON

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; POSTCARDS FROM 
CYBERSPACE; HOLDING INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CALLS ON THE NET

<P>
 If you're trying to solve a tough problem, you might call some colleagues for 
advice. Better still, you might even arrange an expensive international 
conference call between several parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can turn to the Internet. A special service known as Internet Relay 
Chat allows you to hold live electronic conferences with any number of global 
participants who have access to the Net. IRC is sort of an electronic CB system 
spanning at least 20 countries, without long-distance charges. 
</P>
<P>
 To use IRC, assuming you have Internet access, type "irc" at the prompt (but 
don't type the quotation marks). Once you're inside IRC, commands must be 
preceded by a / mark. Two useful commands are "/help newuser" and "/help 
intro." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular IRC servers is at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. To connect, type "irc" and then, once inside, type "/server 
irc.mit.edu." You'll get a list of channels in use; each is for an ongoing 
discussion of some special interest. 
</P>
<P>
 You can create your own channel; just make an appointment with your friends 
and agree on a name for a channel. For example, you might agree to meet at 8 
p.m. on a channel you'll call confer. (On the IRC, all channel names are 
preceded by .) Each of your friends would connect to the IRC server for MIT at 
the appointed time and type "/channel confer" to connect. You may notice 
lengthy pauses at some points during your conference as the load on the host 
fluctuates. 
</P>
<P>
 Change channels by typing "/channel name." To list active channels, type 
"/list." To disconnect, type "/quit." 
</P>

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; USING SOUND TO CREATE TOUGH GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The image of Ella Fitzgerald shattering glasses with her voice in the old 
Memorex commercials may need some revision. Researchers at Alfred University's 
Glass Science Institute, in Alfred, N.Y., have discovered that certain 
high-frequency sound waves can actually strengthen glass. 
</P>
<P>
 When glass is coated with a chemical containing potassium and then bathed in 
sound waves, a chemical reaction occurs in which small atoms such as sodium are 
removed from the glass and replaced by larger potassium atoms. The space taken 
up by the potassium atoms forces any cracks in the surface of the glass to 
close, resulting in glass that is up to five times stronger than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Albany scientists now use high-energy waves to strengthen glass, 
they began by bombarding glass with stereo recordings of Madonna, opera and 
Chinese classical music. Operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti's voice was not as 
effective, it turned out, as the higher frequencies of female singers such as 
Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing hounds with high-tech: A big problem for rescue workers after an 
earthquake is locating survivors trapped beneath tons of rubble. Dogs can't 
sniff out those too deeply buried, and lowering a microphone to detect noise 
only works if the victim is conscious enough to make a sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a grant from the National Science Foundation, Prof. Kun-Mu Chen at 
Michigan State University has developed a way of detecting a victim by finding 
his heartbeat. Somewhat like an EKG, Chen's device uses an electromagnetic 
radio wave that penetrates the rubble and bounces back when it locates the 
low-frequency heartbeat. The device will undergo field tests this summer. Other 
applications could include locating victims of mine disasters and those buried 
in an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
 Tending the home turf: Like any homeowner fretting over his or her lawn, World 
Cup USA, organizer of the World Cup soccer championships to be played in the 
United States this summer, has grass on the brain. To assure that playing 
fields across the country -- from New Jersey to Pasadena -- are as uniform as 
possible, World Cup has appointed two turf experts to oversee all the venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a 10-foot ramp, Stephen Cockerham, superintendent of agricultural 
operations at UC Riverside, and James Watson, vice president emeritus for lawn 
mower maker Toro Co., will measure the bounce, roll distance and deflection of 
a soccer ball on the various fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl, where the final game will be played, will serve as the 
standard. The Brinkman Traffic Simulator -- a six-foot steel cylinder with 
projectiles to simulate cleated shoes -- will be dragged across the grass to 
test for resilience. Then the turf technicians will use rollers, fertilizer, 
mowers and water to bring the World Cup fields up to world-class perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney does e-mail: Have you ever wanted to exchange electronic mail with 
columnist Dave Barry, actor Ed Asner or David Gerrold, the voice of Barney the 
dinosaur? 
</P>
<P>
 Then E-Mail Addresses of the Rich and Famous is the book for you. Published by 
Addison Wesley, the 150-page paperback includes the e-mail addresses of nearly 
1,000 politicians, authors, academics, reporters and high-tech types such as 
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the book, which will go on sale May 20 for $7.95 at bookstores 
nationwide, tried to weed out obvious network impostors, including several 
individuals claiming to be shock jock Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming like dolphins: Chaos theory has been used to describe everything from 
weather patterns to the stock market. Now a researcher at UC San Diego says it 
can also describe how dolphins lessen water resistance when they swim. The 
results could offer insights for the design of both submarines and airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists believe that dolphins lessen surface drag on their bodies by 
vibrating their skin, which is etched in parallel ridges. These tiny changes to 
the boundary layer -- the quarter-inch layer of fluid closest to the dolphin -- 
can have an enormous effect on surface resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the tools of chaos theory, Henry Abarbanel, professor of physics and 
director of the Institute for Nonlinear Science, has come up with a 
mathematical model to describe how turbulent structures are formed in the 
boundary layer.

FLUOR MERGES 3 DIVISIONS IN RESTRUCTURING; STREAMLINE: THE IRVINE FIRM ALSO 
CREATED NEW GROUPS. THE CHANGES ARE MEANT TO MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fluor Corp., continuing to roll out details of its reorganization plan, said 
Tuesday that it has consolidated three divisions and created several new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 No jobs will be lost through the restructuring, said Leslie McCraw, Fluor's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes will enable us to react faster to the global market and to 
bring a broader range of services to our clients," McCraw said. The company 
announced last month plans to strengthen its presence abroad and reduce middle 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's effort is a reaction to the rapidly changing world market, said 
Richard Henderson, an analyst with investment banker Pershing & Co. in Jersey 
City, N.J. "You can't just walk in with a better yo-yo and say, 'Here I am,' " 
he said. "You have to respect each country's infrastructure and political 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 A low rate of inflation, Henderson said, has forced international companies to 
operate more efficiently. "You can't pass along mistakes with price increases 
like you could in the 1980s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel, the Irvine company's core engineering and construction 
subsidiary, combined its strategic planning, project finance and sales and 
marketing groups into one group: Sales, Marketing and Strategic Planning. The 
group is headed by Charlie Oliver, 51, a senior executive with Fluor Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor also established the Diversified Services Group, which is led by senior 
executive Jim Stein, 51. The group will market some of Fluor's traditionally 
in-house services -- like its tool and equipment company that services Fluor 
Daniel projects -- to outside clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor also established three regional groups: Asia Pacific; The Americas; and 
Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "This restructuring will provide a stronger balance between technical 
expertise and a knowledge of the region -- how to do business in a particular 
country, how to get permits, who the key people are," McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's stock price closed Tuesday at $50.75 a share, down 75 cents a share 
from Monday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: CUE NETWORK OKS JOINT VENTURE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CUE Network Corp. said it has agreed to form a joint venture company to 
provide international paging and global positioning services in Singapore and 
throughout Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries to be served by the new company, CUE Southeast Asia 
Partnership Ltd., include Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 CUE's partner, a unit of a the Singapore trade union group National Trades 
Union Congress, operates that nation's first private radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based CUE provides nationwide and regional messaging services 
throughout North America through the facilities of over 360 FM radio stations. 
The Singapore group, NTUC Voice Cooperative, broadcasts over two FM frequencies 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its paging network, CUE markets equipment that increases the 
accuracy of commercially available global positioning services. 
</P>
<P>
 Global positioning is a navigation tool using Department of Defense Global 
Positioning Satellites to establish the user's location: CUE says commercial 
position finding systems are accurate to within about 100 yards and that its 
system increases accuracy to within five yards. So-called GPS systems have many 
users including trucking and shipping fleet operators, ambulance companies, 
police and fire departments, surveyors, and map makers.

3RD FORMER EXECUTIVE FILES SUIT AGAINST DEVELOPER; COURTS: BALDWIN BUILDERS OF 
NEWPORT BEACH DENY ANY WRONGDOING OR KNOWLEDGE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS ALLEGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James and Alfred Baldwin, whose Orange County company has constructed more 
than 15,000 homes in Southern California since the 1950s, have been accused by 
a third former executive of wrongful termination, fraud and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks up to $5 million in actual and punitive damages, was 
filed Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court by Carole J. Greenwald of San 
Diego. Greenwald, who last summer joined Westbay Capital in San Diego, which is 
owned by the Baldwin brothers, in the suit also has accused her former 
immediate supervisor with sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Baldwin Builders denied that the company committed any 
wrongdoing and denied knowledge of any sexual harassment against Greenwald, who 
was terminated April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenwald suit charges that, after six months with Westbay Capital, she 
was promised a 50% partnership interest in Westbay and any mortgage bank that 
might be acquired by Baldwin. Greenwald said she was told she would receive 
annual profit distributions of at least 7% and was personally assured by James 
Baldwin, chairman of Baldwin Builders, that she was a "partner" and a "vice 
president," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald was a mortgage banker hired away from a Westbay competitor to bring 
in new business, and was promised a $120,000 annual salary along with an auto 
allowance, according to the suit. She agreed to waive commissions on the 
mortgages she arranged in exchange for her promised partnership interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald's suit states that in February she received a new supervisor, Benton 
White, who required her to attend a conference in Chicago with him early last 
month, where he allegedly had too much to drink and tried to pressure Greenwald 
to have "a personal sexual relationship with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After the trip, White began "to harass, defame and libel" Greenwald, according 
to the suit, because she refused his advances and because he feared that she 
would tell others about his drunken claims to have "trafficked in cocaine 
during years past to support himself." 
</P>
<P>
 White terminated Greenwald's partnership agreement and offered her a job 
demotion on April 2, telling her that if she did not accept the demotion she 
would be terminated, the suit states. Greenwald did not accept the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Therrien, chief financial officer for Baldwin Builders, said the company 
would never condone sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has a strict written policy regarding sexual harassment," said 
Therrien. "At no time did the plaintiff file a complaint under those 
procedures. . . . When the company indirectly heard about a potential problem, 
the company hired an outside attorney to investigate. The plaintiff refused to 
cooperate or discuss the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted in San Diego Tuesday, White refused to comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the Baldwin brothers knew what was going on. This 
man reports directly to them," said Jeffrey Benice, an attorney representing 
Greenwald. "Here is a successful woman who has made a lot of money, who has 
suffered. She has seen a reputation she built up for a number of years in the 
mortgage banking industry nearly destroyed."  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dalyea, who headed Westbay's operations in Orange County until last 
January, said Greenwald was very highly recommended by her former employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Greenwald) worked for me, her performance was excellent and she did a 
terrific job of increasing the number of loans," said Dalyea, who now lives in 
Seattle. "When I was there, I never had any complaints about her performance. I 
have nothing but good things to say about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Another breach of contract suit, seeking $35 million in damages against 
Baldwin Builders, was filed by Robert B. Burns, formerly a corporate vice 
president and head of Baldwin's Los Angeles-Ventura division. 
</P>
<P>
 That lawsuit, filed Jan. 25 in Los Angeles Superior Court, charges fraud and 
breach of contract by the company and its owners, James and Alfred Baldwin. The 
suit states that the Baldwins made verbal assurances that he was a 10% partner 
in all company projects within his division but that they unilaterally voided 
the agreements in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns and former Orange County division President Geoff Fearns are two of 
three division presidents who have left the company since November. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, San Diego division President Greg Smith, was terminated, according 
to Burns' suit. The suit alleges that the Baldwins attempted to engage Fearns 
and Smith in a scheme to avoid federal income tax payments in 1993, and 
intentionally failed to disclose Burns' partnership agreement to investors when 
the company sold $155 million in bonds last year.  
</P>
<P>
 If Burns' case in Los Angeles Superior Court is successful, Baldwin's failure 
to disclose that Burns had the rights to 10% of divisional profits could be 
grounds for additional suits against the company by bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearns, who resigned from the company in November, filed an arbitration action 
against Baldwin in February. 
</P>
<P>
 That action accuses the company's owners of breach of contract, forced 
resignation and fraud. Fearns is seeking mediation through Judicial Arbitration 
and Mediation Services, a statewide organization based in Orange, because of a 
provision in his former contract requiring that certain disputes be arbitrated.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: PACIFICARE REPORTS 29% REVENUE BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., the health management company, said Tuesday 
that its revenue for its second quarter ending March 31 increased 29% from the 
same time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Company revenues were $714 million compared to $555 million for the same 
period a year earlier, according to PacifiCare. Quarterly earnings were $20.8 
million, or 75 cents a share, as compared to $15.2 million, or 54 cents a 
share, in the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Total membership in the HMO increased 18% to 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall I'd say it was a strong quarter. The revenues and earnings were both 
higher than expected. A lot of excitement about PacifiCare is the expansion 
into the Pacific Northwest and Texas and Florida," said Thomas Hodapp, an 
analyst with Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco, which recommends 
purchase of the stock. "What they are finding in California is that it 
continues to be a very competitive pricing environment." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months, net income was $41.2 million, or $1.48 per share, on 
revenue of $1.36 billion. This compared to profit of $25.9 million, or 93 cents 
per share, on revenue of $1.03 billion, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare stock prices were initially boosted by the news, but then closed at 
$53.50 a share on the Nasdaq market, down 75 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quarter, PacifiCare finalized the purchase of Preferred Health 
Resources in Seattle, giving the company a greater presence in the Pacific 
Northwest. PacifiCare Earnings

 In the second quarter ended March 31, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. reported 
that revenue increased 29% to $714.4 million compared to $555.1 million for the 
same period a year earlier. Figures in thousands of dollars, except per-share

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; HOUSING PERMITS RISE SHARPLY; COMMERCIAL BUILDING 
REMAINS FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Building permits for new home construction in Orange County during the first 
three months of 1994 increased 37% from the first quarter of last year, 
according to the Construction Industry Research Board, a research group in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,082 building permits for new single and multifamily homes were 
issued in the county compared to 1,522 issued in the first three months of 
1993.Nearly half, or 977 of the permits, were issued in the month of March, 
mostly for unincorporated areas of the county and in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of that increase in March is seasonal, but it's still a big jump," said 
Ben Bartolotto, research director for the board. "This signals that Orange 
County at least is starting to come out of this housing recession, although the 
numbers are still two-thirds of what they were in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial building in the county stayed virtually flat during the quarter as 
compared to the previous year. Since 1990, there has been no significant new 
industrial building permits issued in Orange County, Bartolotto said.

 FDA Leases Offices: The federal Food and Drug Administration is moving its 
district office and more than 110 employees from Los Angeles to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracted by the proximity to the John Wayne Airport and the chance to present 
a "polished image," the FDA has signed a lease for 40,000 square feet at 
Newport Gateway's Tower II, one of twin black granite office towers.Terms of 
the lease were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a government agency and need to present a professional, polished image 
to our clients and visitors," said Lloyd Lehrer, compliance officer for the 
FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will house its investigation staff, a compliance department and 
administrative support team in the new office in Newport Beach. The former Los 
Angeles office on 1521 W. Pico, near the Los Angeles Convention Center, will be 
converted into an FDA laboratory site. The new tenant will mean Newport Gateway 
is now 89% leased.

 High-Tech Message: Lots of real estate soirees coming up this month, but one 
of the most interesting promises to be "Microsoft Meets the Building Industry 
-- The Information Superhighway Comes Home." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Riker, director of future home technology for Microsoft Corp., will speak 
to local home builders about how increasing advancements in high tech for homes 
will impact their industry. Already working with home builders in the Pacific 
Northwest on a so-called "Home of the Future," Riker hopes to pique interest 
among Orange County's home builders at this event sponsored by the Orange 
County Building Industry Assn. Evidently Riker is so interested that Microsoft 
is even footing the bill for his air fare.

ODETICS WILL MARKET NEW TECHNOLOGY; VIDEO: IMAGES CAN BE SENT OVER CELLULAR 
TELEPHONES. THE PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BE VALUABLE FOR REMOTE MONITORING AND 
SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Odetics Inc. announced new technology Tuesday that can send video images over 
cellular telephones, opening the way for new uses of the long-distance video 
technology in markets such as remote monitoring and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim company said the video communications technology can transmit 
black-and-white or color images of a scene from a security camera to a monitor 
elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "Odetics will not live or die on the success of this technology," said David 
Lewis, an Odetics vice president. "But we are always looking for products that 
can improve our future sales, and this is a very lively candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 The image quality isn't as good that of broadcast television, which transmits 
images to a screen at a rate of 30 frames per second. At Odetics' speed of 20 
frames per second, the video images resemble a slightly out-of-sync movie or 
cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the technology doesn't require a computer or much training, and it allows 
anyone to use a portable camera equipped with a transmitter to send images to a 
distant point without sophisticated satellite links or cumbersome wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said commercial products based on the technology may be available as 
early as December. He said one possible application would be to equip police 
officers with the devices so they can immediately send to a police station 
video images of a crime scene in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a system could transmit an event as it is happening and allow for an 
immediate response, in contrast to video cameras that merely record an event 
for later analysis. Odetics launched the product at a communications industry 
trade show in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology compacts the video data so it can be transmitted quickly via 
cellular telephone. Satellite television cameras, such as those used by live-TV 
news crews, can transmit better-quality images more quickly, but they cost far 
more, Lewis said. He said pricing for the new technology would depend on what 
it is used for.

FIDELITY INITIATES PROXY BATTLE FOR US FACILITIES; TAKEOVER: TITLE INSURANCE 
FIRM OFFERS THE PERSONAL LAWYER OF CARL KARCHER AS A NEW DIRECTOR TO WIN 
SHAREHOLDER VOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The personal lawyer for Carl's Jr. founder Carl N. Karcher would become one of 
two new directors of US Facilities Corp. under a shareholder fight launched 
Tuesday by Fidelity National Financial Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity said it would put Andrew F. Puzder, a Newport Beach lawyer, on the 
board of the Costa Mesa property and casualty insurer along with former Wall 
Street money manager Seymour Preston Jr. if enough shareholders at US 
Facilities agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurance company, was cleared by 
federal regulators Tuesday to seek shareholders' proxies, which are rights to 
vote their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Chairman William P. Foley II failed last week to get directors of US 
Facilities to approve a $79-million offer or to agree to put the issue before 
shareholders at its May 25 annual meeting. His company now seeks pledges from 
holders of half the US Facilities stock outstanding -- including its own 9.25% 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 In a so-called fight letter, a message included with proxy solicitations being 
mailed, Foley urges US Facilities shareholders to seek a sale or merger "to the 
highest bidder, regardless of whether the highest bidder is Fidelity or some 
other acquirer." 
</P>
<P>
 If shareholders don't put US Facilities on the block, Foley said, they will be 
stuck with "an under-performing company and an under-performing stock" that 
reflect "chronically lackluster performance." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for US Facilities said Tuesday that the company has sent its own 
letters to shareholders urging them not to respond to any solicitation until 
the board considers Fidelity's offer at an as-yet unscheduled meeting and makes 
a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's proxy solicitation seeks the approval of Puzder and Preston as 
directors at US Facilities and a shareholder resolution putting the company up 
for sale and approving measures for independent reviews of bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Puzder was instrumental last fall in persuading Foley to head a group of 
investors that helped Karcher out of serious financial problems and helped to 
bring him back to Carl Karcher Enterprises after he had been ousted as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher now is CKE's chairman emeritus. Foley, who now controls the largest 
single block of CKE stock, recently became its chairman.

O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; THE DOMINATING FORCE IS EQUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Solo music is simple: One person, one responsibility. But when composers write 
for two or more instruments, do they always distribute the parts evenly? 
</P>
<P>
 No, according to pianist Andre-Michel Schub, who will appear in recital 
Saturday with violinist Cho-Liang Lin at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some music has a bigger part for one instrument or for the other," Schub said 
recently, on the phone from his home in New York City. "But in terms of the 
flow of the line, the shape and the structure of the piece, Jimmie (Lin) and I 
approach it -- and present each other -- as a 50-50 kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Their program, sponsored by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society, will include works by Beethoven, Debussy, Ravel 
and Prokofiev. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beethoven Sonata in A, said Schub, "is essentially a piano sonata. But I 
play it differently than if I were playing a sonata by myself. I don't control 
the whole thing, even if the piano predominates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Similarly, in the last movement of the Ravel (Sonate), the violin 
predominates, but Jimmie doesn't approach it as if he's playing the last 
movement of the Sibelius Violin Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Paris in 1952, Schub moved to the United States with his parents when 
he was 8 months old. He began his piano studies with his mother when he was 4 
and later studied with Jascha Zayde. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued his studies with Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute of Music 
in Philadelphia. He won the Naumberg International Piano Competition in 1974 
and the Grand Prize award at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lin, born in Taiwan in 1960, began playing the violin when he was 5. Sent to 
study at the Sydney Conservatorium after winning the Taiwan National Youth 
Competition when he was 12, he was directed by violinist Itzhak Perlman to 
study with the renowned pedagogue Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School in New 
York. He now teaches there and continues an active concert career. 
</P>
<P>
 Schub and Lin began playing together in 1980. Schub was a member of the 
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center; Lin had been invited as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played the C-minor Beethoven Sonata," Schub recalls. "We read through it 
once, and it felt great. A few years later, (Lin) was recording Stravinsky 
repertory I was interested in. We got together and made a CD (for CBS 
Masterworks). After that, we played a week of concerts each year, when our 
schedules would permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we've played quite a lot together. I know him very well, 
musically and personally, so you can get more easily into the music and not be 
bothered by externals . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We play off each other and grow. I hear (musical) lines in a different way 
than I would otherwise. I think that's great. When you collaborate with some 
someone and respect him enough to be open to growth, artistically that's the 
most satisfying part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pianist Andre-Michel Schub and violinist Cho-Liang Lin will play works by 
Beethoven, Debussy, Ravel and Prokofiev on Thursday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. Curtain: 8 p.m. $12.50 to $25. A

'BRAVE SMILES,' HISTORIC LAUGHTER; THEATER: BABS DAVY SAYS HER PARODY, WRITTEN 
FOR THE FIVE LESBIAN BROTHERS, IS A GOOD EXERCISE FOR AUDIENCES AND UCI 
ACTRESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Webster's New World Dictionary defines a phobia as "an irrational, excessive 
and persistent fear of some particular thing." Fear can be abolished with 
knowledge. That's one of the aims of Manhattan's performance group the Five 
Lesbian Brothers: to dispel a bit of homophobia and to keep audiences laughing 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brothers closed their show, "The Secretaries," Sunday at Santa Monica's 
Highways. But their wit and wisdom will linger in Southern California, thanks 
to a new UC Irvine stage production of "Brave Smiles . . . another lesbian 
tragedy." The second show the troupe created plays UCI's Fine Arts Village 
Theatre Stage for four performances beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brave Smiles" both embraces and mocks media images of lesbians in such 
popular works as Lillian Hellman's "The Children's Hour," the stage and film 
drama "The Killing of Sister George," the classic German girls' school film 
"Maedchen in Uniform" and "The Well of Loneliness." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Associate Dean of Fine Arts Kate Davy, who is directing the production, 
has strong reasons for choosing this project -- besides the fact that her 
sister co-wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the historical moment we're in, which is an extraordinary 
historical moment in terms of gay and lesbian rights, it's entirely time that 
we start addressing the issues in all kinds of ways," Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show is a wonderful way to start when it comes to this kind of work, to 
let people start to let down their guard a little and start to take some things 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play," she continued, "parodies all of the classic representations of 
lesbians in mainstream culture. The whole first act is based on the Weimar 
German film 'Maedchen in Uniform,' and other girls' school kind of movies, and 
women's prison films come into play in the second part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It both foregrounds the fact hilariously that lesbians have to be brutally 
punished or dead by the end of the narrative. It very much makes that point. 
It's also a very loving rendering, because these are the images the lesbian 
community hates, but they're the only images there were. The play hates the 
images and loves them at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a fortuitous crossing of events, the UCI production was in rehearsal while 
the creators of the play were appearing in Santa Monica. One of the founders of 
the Five Lesbian Brothers in 1989 is Babs Davy, Kate Davy's sister. The UCI 
cast went to Highways to see the play, and the Brothers visited rehearsals in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Babs Davy, an art historian and until recently registrar at New York's Whitney 
Museum of American Art, left the security of that life when the Brothers' 
touring schedule began to get heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing a rehearsal of Kate Davy's production, her sister said she was 
convinced that the play does work for other actresses. It's not a 
creator-specific work. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's exciting to me," Babs Davy said. "It really holds up. We had a 
ball watching it, and it wasn't just because we wrote it. We looked at each 
other and said, 'This is really a good play.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What I noticed most was the gay-straight thing. The actresses are straight, 
and attempting to play lesbians. It's a big jump, a cultural ocean to cross. 
It's such a giant part of a person's identity. It's an excellent experience for 
these young actors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Davy agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great learning experience for these actors," she said. "We were 
strongly concerned in finding a show that had really strong roles for women. I 
thought 'Brave Smiles' was an excellent vehicle, because it's five women 
playing 19 roles in an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 The director isn't concerned about adverse community reaction to the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Orange County is absolutely ready for this, because it's a parody, a 
spoof, and it's wildly funny. It's exactly the kind of first thing to do in 
Orange County if you're going to do this kind of work. It's a hard show to 
hate. . . . It will turn off very few people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister -- or Brother -- Babs Davy added with a laugh: "It jumps wildly from 
time to time. One tragic thing happens after another. One by one they all get 
knocked off until there's only one left. That's the joke." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Brave Smiles . . . another lesbian tragedy" opens Thursday at 8 p.m. at the 
Fine Arts Village Theatre, UC Irvine. Performances Thursday through Saturday, 8 
p.m.; matinees Saturday and Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends Sunday. $6-$8. (714) 856-6616.
