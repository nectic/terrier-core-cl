O.C. ART; AN ESSENTIALLY HOLLOW 'GESTURE' IN SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea of a show specifically about fragmentaryhuman forms in modern and 
postmodern sculpture sounded intriguing. After all, many artists have devised 
their own visual synecdoche for the human figure, replacing the whole by the 
part to heighten or emphasize certain emotional, kinesthetic or formal 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the roster of American and European artists in "The Essential Gesture" 
at the Newport Harbor Art Museum (through Dec. 31) is hard to fault in terms of 
quality. But the show itself is disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of finding fresh ways to explore artists' attitudes toward the body, 
chief curator Bruce Guenther has opted for a rote art history lesson. The 
exhibition not only lacks a sense of the relationships among pieces made at 
different times by different artists, but gives little sense of why the 
incomplete figure has been such a satisfactory solution for so many. 
</P>
<P>
 The real pity is that the same works could have had a more fruitful dialogue 
with one another in an installation (and accompanying essay) that abandoned the 
rigid classifications of art movements for a fresher look at how the art 
engages such themes as vulnerability, power, allure and implied movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The show begins with Auguste Rodin's "Walking Man," a larger-than-life bronze 
torso and striding legs dating from the late 19th Century. The artist's stature 
and the sheer power of the piece helped legitimize the use of incomplete 
figures in modern sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing fascination of "Walking Man" stems from its concentrated 
evocation of forward movement, a decisive shifting of weight from leg to leg. 
Given this overriding theme, arms and a head would be superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 Another curator might have juxtaposed the Rodin with, say, Joel Shapiro's 
"Untitled (JS 768)" from 1987, shown elsewhere in the exhibition. The small 
bronze is composed of four smooth rectangular bars representing a head, torso 
and legs. By virtue of deft angling, the figure stands on one leg. Lacking 
arms, the piece exquisitely emphasizes the tenuousness of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 In this exhibition, however, the Rodin is juxtaposed with two Giacometti 
sculptures of attenuated women, Gaston Lachaise's daintily gesticulating female 
torso with the swelling breast-buttocks of a fertility amulet and Picasso's 
flattened, tactile image of a single arm. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, these artists -- as well as Constantin Brancusi, Hans Belmer, Jean 
Arp and others -- made a decisive break with holistic or normative ideas of 
what a figure sculpture could be. But this is not news. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why not show the ultra-vulnerable Giacometti women next to Kiki Smith's 
extraordinary and shockingly fragile paper sculpture of a dead body? Drained of 
its organs and vital juices, it dangles above its cast-off head and arms, 
heaped on the floor like pathetically useless armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not let the Lachaise "Torso With Arms Raised" resonate with Louise 
Bourgeois' painfully exposed, cruelly dangling female torso, "Janus Fleuri"? 
Why not discuss the different ways male and female artists have condensed and 
exaggerated the female form? 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the essay and wall texts offer only basic information about the 
individual works, art movements and traditional sculptural materials -- 
information more appropriate to an art history survey than to an exhibition 
attempting to break new ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neglected opportunities include discussions of the psychological effects 
and art historical lineage of specific gestures, and the ramifications of works 
(by Smith, Peter Shelton and Judith Shea, in this show) that deal specifically 
with the body as a container. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of representing 22 artists with 33 pieces, the show might have gained 
breadth by winnowing out a few of the multiple works by one sculptor (was it 
necessary to have two Giacomettis?) and including more artists working in 
non-traditional media. Additionally, several works -- such as Willem de 
Kooning's "Seated Woman on a Bench," Oliver Lee Jackson's "Untitled" and Antony 
Gormley's "Word Made Flesh" -- seem rather too "whole" to fit comfortably 
within the show's theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stature of the artists and the quality of the art -- reason enough 
for many viewers to visit -- "The Essential Gesture" seems a discouragingly 
hollow curatorial gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Essential Gesture" continues through Dec. 31 at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. $4 for adults, $2 for students and seniors; free on Tuesdays.

THE LONG AND TWISTED ROUTE TO 'ISLANDS'; EDUARDO MACHADO ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS 
THE CUBAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN A COMPLEXLY PLOTTED FOUR-PLAY DRAMA. HE 
SUCCEEDS ONLY WHEN HE LETS HIS CHARACTERS GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Few playwrights in this country have explored the Cuban American experience. 
Eduardo Machado's six-hour two-part, four-play drama "Floating Islands," which 
has received a lot of ink and a lavish production at the Mark Taper Forum, 
helps to fill that gap. The problem is that Machado's epic, which opened 
Sunday, doesn't so much evoke this particular experience as over-explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands" follows the Ripoll family from middle class to affluence in 
late 1920s Cuba to exile in Woodland Hills in 1980, and the story is rife with 
personal upheaval -- infidelity, loss of business, suicide, exile, separation, 
supernatural occurrence and incest between brothers, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 In weaving so many plot twists into a story of massive political upheaval, 
Machado raises questions that are not germane to an already complicated 
dramatic schema. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates tragedy from hyperbole? Does a vast historical backdrop dignify 
soap opera? Historical events drive much of the personal anguish, and those 
events define the characters more than the author's insights or his ear for 
dialogue, which is leaden. Arguments do not erupt; they sound purely scripted: 
"We believe in fairness! Greed, my son, is a terrible thing!" says a patriarch. 
Motivation is painted on. "We'll find justice by making ourselves rich!," says 
a man whose father-in-law has just been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The first play, "The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa," establishes gender roles in 
pre-revolutionary Cuba. A mother and daughter sneak cigarettes and inhale the 
dream of independence, which takes the form of a short haircut like the ones in 
fashion magazines. But, it is stressed, an unmarried daughter should remain 
unkissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sons expect to be waited on, and they enshrine their mother and sister in 
worship while firmly demanding they go fetch a cup of cafe. Male infidelity is 
expected; female is shocking. When a daughter-in-law is seen dancing the tango 
with a man other than her husband, matriarch Maria Josefa (Miriam Colon) takes 
the terrible news to Arturo, her tyrant-anarchist husband. "I want our family 
to be respected," she tells him, something he no doubt already knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado can rarely let go enough to let his characters just live. But when he 
does, particularly in the third play, "Fabiola," he tends to go overboard, as 
if he doesn't trust himself to convey their pain. By now, it's the early 1960s, 
the time of the Bay of Pigs, and two families related by marriage are living 
under one roof in Cuba. The Ripolls have lost their thriving bus business to 
the revolution, and the families are deeply divided on the Castro issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to exemplify the decay of their society and their sense of 
dislocation, and also to show the flip side of the macho ethic, two brothers 
are engaged in a rather passionate incestuous affair. Perhaps to show the 
irrationality that is all around them, their lust spills over into the living 
room on an evening when the family is at home. As one of the brothers pulls 
their sister into the sex play, the scene reeks more of melodrama than of the 
anguish Machado is trying to convey. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of the Ripoll family and, later, the Marquez family into which they 
marry, takes many nasty turns through four generations, providing the actors 
with much to chew on. Under the direction of Oskar Eustis, the actors get to 
switch roles and play their own offspring, or, occasionally, step outside the 
family altogether. This kind of thespian reshuffling is often fun for the 
audience, and provides a chance for the actors to show off their range. But, 
because Machado's dialogue doesn't vary much from character to character, the 
technique often muddies the picture.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Oscar (Joe Urla), the animated, nervous suitor who marries into 
and becomes the head of the Ripoll family, is replaced in the second play by 
the actor (Victor Argo) who formerly played the ramrod patriarch Arturo, 
Oscar's father-in-law. But Argo's Oscar is completely different in mannerism 
and energy, far more than the passing of years could explain.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Machado doesn't explain why certain characters change so drastically 
over time or how they can simply leave their pasts behind, as if they had been 
endured by another person (or actor!). Osvaldo is one of the incestuous 
brothers in "Fabiola." By the fourth play he has divorced his wife Sonia for an 
Argentine woman yet is still drawn to Sonia. "Oh," said the man sitting behind 
me, "so he's not gay anymore?"  
</P>
<P>
 Some individual performances stand out. Miriam Colon is especially good as the 
servile Maria Josefa becomes a crusty old woman who can finally say what she 
thinks. Alma Cuervo is a life force, and she is the only actor who actually 
plays off what the actress who preceded her in the part did physically. Joe 
Urla is vivid as the nervous young Oscar, but by the time he takes on the 
play's contemporary Oscar, a rather swishy cocaine addict, he seems to be 
conducting a seminar in overacting. 
</P>
<P>
 The last play, "Broken Eggs" is perhaps the most successful because the 
playwright is no longer explaining a culture, he is simply showing us a little 
of our own. As the characters stretch out on the stage in a Valium haze as one 
sings about the lost homeland, the toll of all of the political and personal 
upheaval is exacted in a sweet, sad scene. It's as if, having told his story, 
the playwright has finally rested and let the characters and their pain simply 
take over the stage.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SOME WELL-TOLD TALES FROM STORYVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fronted by charismatic vocalist Malford Milligan and backed by seasoned pros 
who've supported the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Joe Ely and Arc Angels, the 
Texas quintet Storyville unleashed a torrent of authentic blues and soul 
Saturday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening chords of the propulsive "Wings Won't Let You Fly" through 
the signature but sad "Bluest Eyes" and culminating with a stark a cappella 
number, the 90-minute set covered a wide-ranging landscape, musically and 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing songs primarily from its debut album, "Bluest Eyes," the band was as 
equally convincing and comfortable whether unearthing feelings of intense 
longing ("Water") or just kicking out playful riffs ("Writing on the Wall"). 
</P>
<P>
 At his best, the 35-year-old Milligan -- who possesses a creamy, soulful voice 
-- explores his own deeply felt emotions in exorcising some past demons. His 
pain and rage burst out when he sang during "Bluest Eyes": "How many times did 
I bury my feelings/Silence my wounded cries/But if I had the bluest eyes/Maybe 
she'd notice me." 
</P>
<P>
 On this tour, the frequently intrusive keyboard playing heard on the record 
has been wisely scrapped. Instead, the twin guitar attack of David Holt and 
David Grissom supplies a far more muscular, grittier sound. During several 
songs, the two players alternated solo turns while bringing a playful 
competitiveness to the mix.  
</P>
<P>
 While the concert's numerous compelling moments were not a surprise, the 
reaction of the Coach House audience was. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Storyville's set, talkative, seemingly uninterested patrons flocked 
for an early exit. There were fewer than 100 people left in the house when the 
band finished its excellent set -- a performance certainly worthy of a better 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-billed Chris Duarte Band played an impressive 45-minute mix of 
blues-rock-jazz that included songs from its new "Texas Sugar Strap Magik" and 
choice covers of Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Howlin' Wolf.  
</P>
<P>
 Sounding like a cool hybrid of the Allman Brothers and Firehose, this 
Austin-based power trio showcased a welcome willingness to improvise and 
dabble, kind of like meshing a hippie-like casualness with some serious chops. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act, Heads of State, despite celebrating the release of its new 
"Monumental Event," offered little to cheer about. Locked into generic-sounding 
riffing and loaded with cliche-ridden songs, this Orange County band lies 
uncomfortably closer to '70s arena rock than sincere bearers of the blues.

JAZZ REVIEW; COLLETTE STILL BLOWING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy Collette, possessor of one of the richest careers in West Coast jazz, 
has never been more visible. 
</P>
<P>
 The 73-year-old saxophonist-clarinetist-flutist can be heard reminiscing about 
old pals Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker and Eric Dolphy on a new, two-CD set, 
"Buddy Collette: A Jazz Audio Biography," as well as speaking in a handful of 
television commercials and movie theater public-service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Collette has also been active on the playing circuit. A frequent performer for 
schools and charities, he joined the Gerald Wilson All Stars this weekend for 
the Jazz at Drew Festival, which included Joe Henderson and Cedar Walton on its 
bill. This coming weekend, he'll make a number of appearances during the 
four-day "Jazz West Coast" convention sponsored by KLON-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Collette was at Kikuya Japanese Restaurant on Friday as a guest of 
guitarist Doug MacDonald's trio. It was an ideal setting to see the gentlemanly 
reed man, looking young and fit, standing just inches from the seats as he blew 
bop, blues and ballads to the those assembled in the intimate, mirror-lined 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a compendium of West Coast styles, from the blues and bop of Central 
Avenue to the more decorous charms of film scores and the San Fernando Valley 
studio scene. With MacDonald, bassist Jack Prather and drummer Nick Martinis, 
Collette found able support for his time-traveling excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this was an unrehearsed session, Collette and MacDonald are no 
strangers. They've worked infrequently together in the nightspots of Burbank 
and North Hollywood after meeting about 10 years ago in Hawaii. They last 
shared a stage in September at Legends of Hollywood in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Collette opened the second set on flute with "Magali," a tune pulled from his 
1989 Italian recording "Flute Talk," with fellow flutist and UC Irvine 
instructor James Newton. The dance-like, be-bop-inspired theme line was stated 
in unison by Collette and MacDonald before a pirouette-filled flute solo. The 
dignity of the instrument's tone and Collette's agile handling of its lines 
lent classical overtones to its '50s feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Collette moved to clarinet for "Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise," 
wrestling with a cold instrument as he jumped his way through the familiar 
melody. MacDonald soloed first, matching hotfooted runs with two-note unisons 
and chordal strums. With his reed sufficiently warmed, the clarinetist then 
roamed the middle range of his instrument, before being joined by the guitar in 
a repeated figure that set up snappy play from Martinis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Avenue influence was most audible when Collette played alto sax, 
as he did on his own "Crystal." Though he initiated the piece at ballad tempo, 
Collette cut from the reserved time as he soloed, squirting out lines that 
sprinted. Then he tagged them with soulful, yet polished, honks of the kind he 
sounded behind vocalists back in the neighborhood's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides fitting in smoothly with MacDonald's trio, Collette occasionally 
provided accompaniment of his own, as he did with clarinet during MacDonald's 
improvising on "Softly." And when the band played "Perdido," they seemed of one 
mind, building strongly behind the alto's yakety-yak rant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald's trio has plenty of character of its own, with the guitarist's 
chord-and-phrase packed solos teamed with barely audible, Charlie 
Christian-like pulse accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prather has a quirky way of hitting his notes just behind the beat, a tactic 
that seems to frame the sound of the lead instrument, while his bowed 
improvisations are melodic treats. Martinis is a smooth timekeeper behind his 
modestly sized drum kit, and he can get enough crack and rattle out of it to 
challenge the most ambitious solo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, Collette put out an aptly titled album, "Man of Many Parts," that 
highlighted his composing skills as well as his versatility on flute, clarinet 
and a number of saxophones. That title, as the handful who saw him at Kikuya 
will attest, still describes historian, commercial actor and, oh yes, musician 
Buddy Collette today.

 Picassos Vanish: Seven paintings by Pablo Picasso were stolen from a Zurich, 
Switzerland, art gallery over the weekend by thieves who burrowed in from the 
cellar of a neighboring house. Two of the missing paintings were works that had 
been recovered in 1991 after being stolen from the same gallery, owned by Max 
K. Bollag. Eight people were arrested in the earlier theft. Police said the 
works taken this time were not insured. The two most valuable missing Picassos 
-- "Seated Woman" and "Christ of Montmartre" -- were said to be worth $40 
million and the total value of the loot was placed at $44 million. However, the 
estimate released by police apparently came from Bollag, and other experts cast 
doubt on it.

 Three's a Crowd: Here's the plot: Adam Louder (James Wilder) and his good

"hypnotizingly beautiful wife," as Fox TV describes her, hasn't been seen or 
heard from in two years. But look who shows up: Grayson Louder, the missing 
wife (played by Emma Samms, best-known for her role of Fallon Carrington on the 
dramas "Dynasty" and "The Colbys.") It all happens on "Models Inc." when Samms 
debuts Nov. 23. And you can bet that Grayson's appearance, as Fox puts it, 
casts "a dark shadow" on the happiness of Adam and Monique. Why can't things 
ever be simple?

 A preliminary estimate indicates that the Laguna Art Museum netted $100,000 
with its 13th annual art auction Saturday, a 20% decline from last year's take. 
However, last year's was seen as abnormally high because part of the proceeds 
were earmarked for artists who lost property in the Laguna Canyon fire. All the 
money raised this year will benefit the museum's education programs.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MARTHA DAVIS TRIES IT THE OLD MOTELS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martha Davis has been absent from the music scene for seven years. Not 
surprisingly, to recapture some of the long-dim fire of the early Motels, she 
has picked a band of upstarts who look as if they could be younger than her 
kids.So could it have been terribly surprising that when she resurrected the 
Motels favorite "So L.A." on Sunday at the Coach House, the newly reinterpreted 
oldie sounded so, well, Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
 To those familiar only with the slickly inconsequential latter-day Motels, it 
might have seemed a bit incongruous to see Davis -- last viewed as a 
glamourpuss of major proportions -- wearing a baggy, gas-jockey jacket, 
fronting what could actually be described as a rock 'n' roll band. 
</P>
<P>
 But to those who remember her as the most captivating female singer on the 
thriving L.A. new-wave club scene, her return to a psycho-ragamuffin staredown 
vibe and ragged hooks was nostalgic at least, hopeful at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd liked the new songs, if they weren't crazy about the abundance of 
them. Davis invested more in debuts such as the frantic "Mother's Blood" than 
in the utterly perfunctory "Take the L Out of Lover" show-closer -- not a bad 
sign. Her band provided many useful assists by going for a Pearl Jam feel on 
occasion, but lacked the reckless personality the old Motel-dwellers had to 
offset her sense of melodrama; she needs character around her at least as much 
as youth. CHRIS WILLMAN

 Miramax Films' "Pulp Fiction" scored a direct hit for the second weekend in a 
row at the box office. Warner Bros., which last week sparred with Miramax over 
who had bragging rights to the No. 1 spot, had the weekend's biggest 
disappointment in the remake "Love Affair," starring Warren Beatty and his 
actress/wife, Annette Bening.The film opened to a lackluster $5.4 million 
despite heavy marketing and hundreds of sneak previews throughout the country.

OPERA REVIEW; SAN FRANCISCO EXHUMES THE OTHER 'OTELLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took Rossini's "Otello" 178 years to reach the War Memorial Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Better never than late? 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. But certain suspensions of memory are useful if one wants to 
savor this bel-canto curio on its own ornate terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget "Il Barbiere di Siviglia." 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare's text was turned by one Francesco Maria Berio di Salsa into a 
creaky formula libretto that trivializes the heroic tragedy. Psychological 
profundity be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossini's music is always pretty, occasionally even inspired. But it trips 
very lightly over passions that Verdi made tumultuous in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
 The opus is labeled opera seria , but most of its melodic and harmonic 
conventions could serve just as well for opera buffa . All one would need to do 
is change the words. 
</P>
<P>
 And this brings up the discomforting specter of Rossini's Sevillian barber -- 
who happened to make his debut in 1816, the same year that introduced Rossini's 
Moor of Venice to Naples. The pervasive wit, subtle wisdom and breathless 
musical invention that perfectly defined the comic opera for eternity, or for a 
reasonable facsimile thereof, prove less useful when applied to this violent 
tale of love, hate, jealousy and death. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's an opera lover to do when confronted with the elegant naivete of 
Rossini's "Otello"? 
</P>
<P>
 Sit back, relax, enjoy the lovely tunes, marvel, if possible, at the 
pyrotechnical displays and ignore the anticlimax of the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera abounds in gracefully complex arias and intricately poised 
ensembles. Much of the orchestral writing is astonishingly colorful. Although 
the characterizations are always generic, one has to admire anyone who attempts 
to surmount the inherent vocal hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossini asked his cast to perform high-wire acts without a net. He savored 
singing as a spectator sport. For better or worse, his "Otello" deserves to be 
treated as an enlightened concert in costume. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert should be fabulous, of course, and the costumes should be 
wonderful (Zack Brown's lavish 16th-Century wardrobe serves nicely here). That 
may be enough. There is little to be gained by the theatrical gilding of this 
historic lily. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco forces, unfortunately, were not content to leave old enough 
alone. Laurie Feldman, the busy, all-purpose director, and Gerard Howland, the 
ubiquitous, economy-oriented designer, cluttered the proceedings with gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman introduced a masked troupe of commedia-dell-arte mimes on stilts (the 
Fratelli Bologna) who stumbled in and out of the action to add 
play-within-the-play commentary. They also reduced the orchestral interludes to 
accompaniment for inane human-puppet shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Fussy? Yes. Illuminating? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Howland provided a clumsy but cheap unit set that consisted of two antique 
portals, a couple of awkwardly raked platforms and a backdrop that accommodated 
primitive scenic projections. Overpowering everything and everyone was a 
magnificent statue of a golden lion -- 36 feet long, two stories high and 3,000 
pounds heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably one of the Turkish spoils Otello brought to Venice, the fine feline 
monster dominated the background for most of the opera. When the curtain rose 
on the final scene of desperation and murder, however, the stage revealed the 
huge lion straddling the canopy of Desdemona's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, symbolism. Alas, misplaced symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the cartoon image produced laughter throughout the house. The 
response, though understandable, proved catastrophic to the tragic mood the 
principals were trying so nobly to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
 The singers contended with enough problems without insensitive scenic 
competition. Rossini's cantilena, after all, is consistently daunting in its 
linear convolutions and altitudinous assaults. That's a grotesque 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 All three central males in the opera happen to be tenors. Even worse, they 
happen to be tenors who can climb with ease -- or an unreasonable facsimile 
thereof -- to climactic notes in the never-never-region above top C. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Merritt, who has long specialized in this sort of challenge, accepted 
the punishment of the title role with stoic authority, with astonishing 
flexibility and reassuring security at both range extremes (very low as well as 
very high). Some of the ascending flights sounded a bit squealy. Some of the 
sustained tones turned a bit unsteady under pressure. Some of the theatrical 
poses looked silly rather than imposing. Still, this was a valiant, informed 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ford provided a more mellifluous, almost equally virtuosic counterforce 
as Rodrigo. Craig Estep, who stretched at one staggering moment for a 
stentorian E-natural, held his own in the underwritten role of Iago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Gasdia exuded poignant pain and sang very sweetly, aside from some 
pitch problems, as the innocent Desdemona. Portraying her platitudinous father, 
Kevin J. Langan brought solid basso relief to a treble-dominated world. Mika 
Shigematsu made much of the modest duties allotted Emilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Summers conducted with obvious sensitivity and style. He supported the 
beleaguered singers most sympathetically, though he sometimes elicited scrappy 
playing from the hard-working orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, this was a telling exhumation. And now, please, back to Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rossini's "Otello," presented by the San Francisco Opera at the War Memorial 
Opera House, 199 Grove St. (at Van Ness), San Francisco. Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.; 
Friday, 8 p.m. $8 (standing room) to $120. (415) 864-3330.

TV REVIEW; 'FRONTLINE' GOES DIGGING IN AGRICULTURE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Frontline" wades into the swamp of vested interests known as the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and emerges displaying a lot of rotten federal 
waste in "Is This Any Way to Run a Government?" Even considering this series' 
vaunted tradition of punishing and probing investigative journalism, this is 
one of its most bruising hours.  
</P>
<P>
 The title question is, of course, rhetorical, linked as it is to the Clinton 
Administration program to "reinvent government." The USDA presents the clearest 
and perhaps most daunting test of Clintonian reform efforts, and former USDA 
secretaries insist on camera that the agency is unreformable. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, had begun to implement reforms but 
recently announced his resignation amid evidence of improper acceptance of 
perquisites from agribusiness giant Tyson Foods Inc., a company the USDA 
regulates. Espy defiantly tells "Frontline" that other agriculture secretaries 
dabbled in similar conflicts of interest but that he was targeted because his 
reforms threaten special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Espy's bill, which Congress passed this fall, does nothing to reform the 
bloated, easily abused commodity program for farmers, one of three key USDA 
areas examined here. As with the department's equally bloated Rural 
Electrification Program, commodity subsidies, created during the Depression to 
preserve family farms, have long outlived their original purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The granddaddy of bloat, though, is the Forest Service, which a lot of people 
wrongly assume is part of the Interior Department. The service, which employs 
an astonishing 40% of all USDA staffers, is a kind of virtual reality agency in 
which costs are listed as assets and the Congressional agriculture committees 
do not even oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to former Forest Service employee Jeff Debonis, the Forest Service's 
main job is to help the timber industry cut as many trees as possible. 
According to former USDA secretary Ed Madigan, the agency is "impenetrable," 
full of career bureaucrats who resent any reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this kind of bureaucratic entrenchment, as well as agribusiness' 
lobbying and campaign largess to Congressional members, that make reform ideas 
so Quixotic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Is This Any Way to Run a Government?" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 
28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15.

 AMERICAN BEST: Not all savings and loan stories are about something bad. Mario 
Antoci, chief executive for American Savings & Loan, based in Irvine, has won 
recognition from the prestigious Business Enterprise Trust for his S&L's 
leadership in loans to minority or low-income neighborhoods. . . . American's 
borrowers are 40% Latino, Asian or African American. Antoci will be honored at 
a dinner in December hosted by TV news magazine anchor Diane Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 LET'S GO FOR TWO: The Los Angeles Rams' triumph over the New York Giants last 
week made Sunday's loss to New Orleans even more frustrating for one fan. He 
wondered aloud on a radio talk show: When did the Rams last win two weeks in a 
row?. . . . It wasn't last year, or the year before that. In 1991, in a dismal 
3-13 season, the Rams beat Green Bay, then won their next game against San 
Diego. But there's even an asterisk to that: They had a bye week in between. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DEFENDER: Ron Butler was a civil attorney when he won an acquittal in his 
first criminal case -- a business client charged with a felony. It convinced 
him to go into criminal law. He's now been with the public defender's office 26 
years, appointed as public defender in 1981. . . . Butler has never regretted 
his career choice: "We practice pure law in this office. We don't have to worry 
about the business of finding clients." . . . The office celebrates its 50th 
anniversary Nov. 5 with a dinner at the Hyatt Newporter Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 AT THE BEGINNING: In those 50 years, Butler is only the fourth public 
defender. The first, Nick Meyer, and Butler's predecessor, Frank Williams, are 
deceased. But Richard L. Sullivan (1956-1960), now semi-retired from law, has 
been invited to attend. . . . The keynote speaker will be former appellate 
justice Robert Gardner, now 82, who was on the Superior Court bench when the 
office was formed in 1944. Says Butler: "He certainly knew all the key players 
then."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON ACCUSES FEINSTEIN OF IMPROPER 
VOTES; AD SAYS SENATOR SUPPORTED BILLS THAT BENEFITED A FIRM PARTLY OWNED BY 
HER HUSBAND, WHO TERMS THE CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS.

 After months of complaining that his wife was an unfair political target, U.S. 
Senate candidate Mike Huffington focused Monday on Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 
husband in a blistering television commercial that accuses Feinstein of 
improperly voting on bills that benefited the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the commercial accuses the incumbent Democratic senator of 
casting four votes on education bills that benefited a "fraud-ridden" program 
whose largest shareholder is Richard Blum, Feinstein's husband. The ad, which 
began airing statewide Monday, also charges that Blum and the Irvine-based 
company -- National Education Corp. -- have received "millions from taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Feinstein," the ad concludes, "a senator who serves special interests . . . 
and her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign manager and Blum immediately attacked the commercial as 
outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying Feinstein votes certain ways to benefit her and her husband. 
The fact is they lost money. The say the company received (more than $100 
million) since she became a senator. The facts are NEC did not receive this 
money from the federal government. . . . They are loans that go to students," 
said campaign manager Kam Kuwata. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum called the ad "a desperation attempt by a politician who, frankly, is out 
of control. And I deeply resent his taking a totally distorted shot at National 
Education Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sat by for six months while both (Huffington) and, on occasion, his 
wife, have absolutely distorted everything my wife has ever stood for. . . in 
what has been absolutely the most malicious campaign I have ever seen," Blum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign stood by the allegations, which were to be aired in both 
30-second and 60-second spots, the latter the longest negative ad aired so far 
by Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commercial clearly implies that Feinstein's husband is profiting 
from her government service, Ken Khachigian, Huffington's senior adviser, 
insisted that its intent is not to attack her husband but to show Feinstein's 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Blum is not the issue. The issue here is Dianne Feinstein voting on an 
issue that directly benefits her financially," Khachigian said. "It is one 
thing for Mr. Blum to have financial interests. It is quite another for her 
(Feinstein) not to . . . know there is a conflict and decline to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The most potentially damaging accusation centers on the alleged profit made by 
Blum because of votes cast by Feinstein in her two years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the commercial, NEC has received more than $100 million in 
federal funds since Feinstein became a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's campaign pointed out, and Huffington's spokesman admits, that 
NEC has received federal funds for student loans for years, perhaps decades. In 
addition, the funds were part of multibillion-dollar appropriation packages 
approved by Congress with no specific allocation to NEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds were provided to students, not directly to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum insisted that his company's investment in NEC has actually lost about $12 
million during his wife's tenure in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial also charges that "some controversial schools are run by the 
National Education Corp., whose largest shareholder is Richard Blum's company." 
Later, the ad claims that NEC employees pleaded guilty to 23 counts of 
defrauding the government and have been investigated by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign claims that those investigations were handled by the 
Department of Education's Office of Inspector General. Blum acknowledged that 
three employees at one NEC center in Houston did plead guilty to forging 
documents to receive about $300,000 in federal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blum added that the misdeed took place in 1988, shortly after his company 
acquired some shares in NEC only because it had purchased another company he 
owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum also disputed claims that his company is NEC's largest shareholder. It 
owns about 3.5% of NEC's shares, he said, but controls a limited partnership 
that owns another 18% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffington campaign says the ad is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she had not voted for the appropriations, I would be hard-pressed for us 
to make a case that there would be a political issue here," said Khachigian. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, I think what is clear is that Dianne Feinstein should have been 
all the more vigilant about her votes in support of this (program) given not 
only that there was a financial conflict of interest on her part but that it 
was a conflict involving a program that certainly was not exactly receiving 
kudos" from federal officials.

U.N. COMMANDER FURIOUS AT ATTACK BY BOSNIA TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian government soldiers attacked U.N. peacekeepers with machine guns, 
grenades and remote-controlled mines Monday, provoking a furious response from 
the U.N. commander. 
</P>
<P>
 No casualties were reported, but the attacks on Mt. Igman, overlooking 
Sarajevo, worsened the U.N. force's already strained relations with the 
Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 After a harsh protest from Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the peacekeeping commander 
for Bosnia, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he would order his troops 
to "desist from this sort of firing," a U.N. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose called the attacks "exceptionally dangerous and potentially 
catastrophic," said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Tim Spicer. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks occurred as Bosnian troops reluctantly began withdrawing Monday 
afternoon from a U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicer said a French army bulldozer was targeted with machine-gun fire and a 
rocket-propelled grenade. French soldiers in a nearby armored personnel carrier 
returned fire with a heavy machine gun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnians then detonated two remote-controlled mines in the path of a 
French platoon coming to support the soldiers, Spicer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result, President Izetbegovic will issue the orders to his commanders to 
desist from this sort of firing and to comply fully with already agreed-to 
decision to withdraw from the DMZ," Spicer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicer said it was the worst Bosnian attack on peacekeepers near Sarajevo in 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials had demanded the withdrawal of an estimated 500 Bosnian troops, 
whose presence in the demilitarized zone was jeopardizing a local cease-fire 
with the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under heavy pressure from the United Nations, about 100 government troops in 
the zone destroyed their bunkers and trenches and began withdrawing about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Serbs accused government forces of a new provocation: 
firing on a military vehicle in the zone and killing 11 Serb soldiers. The 
Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA called the attack Sunday "brutal, unprovoked and 
double-crossing conduct of Muslim extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations also criticized the Serbs for continuing Monday to block 
U.N. fuel convoys despite a promise to let them pass.

SUSPECTED KILLER OF OFFICER COMMITTED SUICIDE; INVESTIGATION: LAPD SPOKESMAN 
SAYS AUTOPSY REVEALS THAT THE MAN SHOT HIMSELF MOMENTS AFTER A POLICE 
SHARPSHOOTER HAD WOUNDED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seconds after he was wounded by a police rifle shot during a standoff at a 
motel in Hollywood, a man suspected of murdering a Los Angeles police officer 
died from a self-inflicted gunshot to his head, a Police Department spokesman 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that the fatal wound suffered by Manuel Vargas Perez, the 
suspected killer of Officer Charles D. Heim, came from his own .38-caliber 
handgun Sunday afternoon, not the police rifle that originally was thought to 
have mortally wounded the 26-year-old gang member, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD spokesman Capt. Bruce Hagerty said Monday that officers stormed Perez's 
room at the motel "a matter of seconds" after their rifle shot hit him in the 
throat and a stun grenade hurled toward his door exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not immediately realize he had shot himself because there was so 
much blood," Hagerty explained. Hagerty said his information about the autopsy 
came from two detectives who witnessed the medical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county coroner's office, officials declined to discuss the autopsy, 
saying the formal report had not been filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the police statement regarding the self-inflicted wound, Lt. 
Deborah Peterson of the coroner's investigations division replied: "I'm not 
saying it's wrong. But nothing has been released from this office. The doctor 
has not finished his paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams was not aware of Perez's self-inflicted wound when 
Williams told reporters at a Sunday news conference that the fatal shot had 
come from a police rifle, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chief put out the information that he had at the time, and he said that 
the investigation was not complete," the department spokesman stated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez earlier had threatened suicide, both to police negotiators during the 
three-hour standoff Sunday at the Lucky 7 Motel on Sunset Boulevard and on 
Friday, to friends he talked with before the killing of Officer Heim, according 
to Hagerty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he was suicidal, we knew he was irrational," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornered in the Lucky 7 on Sunday morning, Perez refused to surrender, fired 
on policemen and then emerged from his room bearing a handgun, police said. It 
was at that point, Hagerty said, that the suspect was wounded by a police rifle 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Monday they still are investigating the circumstances 
surrounding Heim's death Friday night after he and his partner tried to enter 
Perez's room in another Hollywood motel on a tip about drug dealing there. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Heim are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday at Grace 
Community Church in Sun Valley, with burial following at Eternal Valley 
Memorial Park in Newhall. Heim is to be buried next to a young daughter who 
died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Police Department spokesman estimated that at least 2,000 officers from 
around the state would attend the funeral for Heim, 33, who served with the 
LAPD for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The service will include a helicopter formation fly-over, but will be missing 
another tradition usually part of funerals of officers killed in the line of 
duty. Because Heim himself led the riderless horse in somber processions at 
other funerals, his widow has asked that the horse not be included at his 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Protective League has set up a trust fund for Heim's 
family, which includes his wife -- a police officer pregnant with the couple's 
first child -- and his 12-year-old son from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be sent to the "Officer Charles Heim Fund," c/o Getzoff 
Accounting, 16255 Ventura Blvd., Suite 525, Encino, Ca. 91436.

MARCH AGAINST PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "70,000 March Through L.A. Against Prop. 187," Oct. 17: I was struck by the 
accompanying photograph showing a sea of red, green and white Mexican flags and 
in the foreground one, tiny lone American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, indeed, the protesters certainly made their point. Proposition 187 is not 
good for Mexico, but the more salient point is whether or not it is good for 
California, a point the marchers seemed to have ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former teacher and a lifelong, professional educator my heart goes out to 
the kids who will be left by the wayside should Proposition 187 become law. 
Nevertheless, with populations worldwide set to double in the next 35 years, 
America will face no greater challenge than the struggle to secure and control 
her borders. Proposition 187 is a minor skirmish in the coming war to curb 
immigration. As in all wars there are going to be casualties and, I'm afraid, 
this time it will be the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time it could be you or me.

 It was sad to glimpse only a single U.S. flag amid a sea of Mexican flags in 
your front-page photo of the march to protest Proposition 187. I think it 
illustrates the frustrations that many Californians feel about this issue. Why 
should California support a foreign welfare state on its own soil? 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see all those Mexican flag-wavers go back to Mexico and demand 
free health care, education, aid to dependent children and welfare.

 I was amazed at the outrage some people expressed when they saw your 
front-page picture showing the Oct. 16 march with so many Mexican flags. They 
should have seen the front page of La Opinion . It showed some American flags. 
I also saw quite a few on the Spanish-speaking TV stations. Could it be that 
some of these marchers see in the American flag the image of Gov. Pete Wilson 
and what he represents? We know that he is using the immigration issue as a 
political ploy, but he has gone too far. He is dividing the country. He is 
reviving xenophobia.

 Now that it appears that Proposition 187 may pass overwhelmingly, it is time 
for the "Schindlers" of California to rise up. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to miss the parallels between the proposition and ethnically 
biased laws of other eras. All previous measures were equally legal. They were 
favored by a majority of the population. They were enacted for the best 
reasons. They resulted from dulled consciences and faulty memories. At least in 
Poland the people were promised brandy, sugar, and cigarettes for turning in 
illegal residents. In California morality is to be sacrificed to the god of 
supposed tax relief. Only here could a program to control illegal immigration 
become an attack on children and those least able to defend themselves against 
the strength of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is a wake-up call for those with high ethical standards. Many 
people who consider themselves to be ordinary will be called on to be heroes in 
the face of a self-righteous measure based on deep-seated injustice.

<P>
 Proposition 187 is not about constitutional law. It is definitely not about 
whether illegal immigrants contribute more than they take away (or vice versa). 
Nor is the recent tide of immigrant-bashing politics about federal versus state 
responsibilities. The current attack on immigrants is Anglo California's last, 
futile stand against the Latinization and Asianization of the Golden State. Get 
used to it, old- Californianos .

 The verbal graffiti from anti-Proposition 187 protesters against Harold Ezell 
at the Sportsmen's Lodge (Oct. 13) speak volumes about why 187 must pass. No 
respect for property or propriety and the "you must accept us because we are 
here" attitude do more to help pass 187 than a million dollars in political 
ads.

 It might seem difficult to explain the debate about Proposition 187 to a 
child. But 9-year-old Theresa showed wisdom beyond her years. Her advice: "Tell 
them that people have to go where there is no violence. They have to go where 
the children will not be hurt."

 Proposition 187 is a chance for those of us who pay taxes to voice our 
disapproval of using our tax dollars to benefit citizens of other countries to 
the detriment of our own citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger Mahony continues to beat the drum for tax-paid educational, 
medical and welfare support for illegal immigrants (Oct. 9). Nothing prevents 
the Catholic Church from using some of its tax-exempt income to open the doors 
of its private schools, its hospitals and its own structures to provide this 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 With the health of the Pope in question, I also wonder if Cardinal Mahony is 
not campaigning in papal politics.

MIDEAST PEACE OPPONENT SAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the very same morning (Oct. 20) that The Times brought its readers the 
shocking front-page photograph of Hamas' terror in Tel Aviv, you also published 
a lengthy article (Commentary) which provided a prominent Palestinian speaker 
the stage to call for renewed Arab resistance and revival of the intifada . 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Said (quoted in Alexander Cockburn's Column Left), a professor at 
Columbia University, is well-known as an opponent of Arafat and of the Oslo 
agreement. He does not believe that all stages of the agreement will be 
implemented or that peace will come. He supports his arguments with innumerable 
"facts," most of which are simply wrong and others that are baseless 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible and perhaps even desirable to hold public discussions that 
consider exactly how to implement the Oslo agreement. Open discussions such as 
these could have pointed out not only Israel's adherence to its clauses and 
stages, but also the tremendous contribution Israel has made in laying a 
foundation for an economic infrastructure in Gaza and the autonomous region, 
above and beyond that which was agreed to. Furthermore, there has been no 
comparable contribution to Palestinians themselves, including from those 
Palestinians who sit comfortably across the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the foreign minister of Israel, Shimon Peres, completed a 
36-hour sweep of Los Angeles which was dedicated in its entirety to advancing 
economic development in the region with conspicuous emphasis on the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Such open debate would also point out the remarkable gains that the 
Palestinians have made in setting up an autonomous government and the fact that 
never before in their history have the Palestinians been given the chance, by 
any other ruling power in the region, to determine their status or their fate 
by themselves. They did not have self-rule during the 19 years (1948-1967) that 
King Hussein governed them. They did not have self-rule throughout the 30 years 
(1918-1948) of British rule, nor did they have any expression of autonomy 
whatsoever during the hundreds of years that the Ottoman Empire ruled the area 
prior to 1918. Most Palestinians dismiss these facts just as most of them 
dismiss the fact that in 1967 Israel was forced to take over the territories of 
Gaza and the West Bank after repeated attacks by the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Said knows these facts well. He ought to know because upon accepting 
the Israeli proposals (after many years of refusal) the Palestinians have made 
important advances toward creating a Palestinian authority and realizing their 
goals as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these facts and statements are the likely subject, as previously 
stated, of legitimate public debate. However, publishing an article that urges 
the Palestinians to renew the intifada against Israel on the very day in which 
the world stands in horror in the face of atrocities by Hamas, is at the very 
least, miserable timing.

POLIO SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to write a response to your editorial "A Frightful Disease is 
Banished" (Oct. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 There are many, many thousands of survivors of the polio epidemic that 
occurred before the discovery of the miraculous vaccine by Dr. Jonas Salk and 
Dr. Albert Sabin.Most of these thousands of survivors are now suffering with an 
unforeseen condition known as post-polio syndrome, which is almost more 
debilitating than the original onset of this dreaded disease, because age has 
not been a kind factor. 
</P>
<P>
 While we all agree that the March of Dimes was certainly there to help during 
the epidemics, they withdrew their support from polio in 1957 and became active 
with birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a misconception for so many years. I would like to alert your 
readers that if they want to help the survivors of polio who now need 
wheelchairs, braces and other medical aids, there is a polio foundation in 
Reseda that does provide all of these needs at no charge, and is completely 
funded by public donations.

 There are two qualified candidates for state treasurer, the post now held by 
Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for governor. Phil Angelides, former 
Democratic State Party chairman, is a successful businessman and developer.His 
Republican opponent, Matt Fong, is a lawyer and for the last 3 1/2 years has 
been a member of the state Board of Equalization. Both have considerable 
practical skills as well as years of experience in Sacramento. Our preference, 
based on the comprehensiveness of his proposals for increasing efficiency and 
cutting costs in government, is Fong. 
</P>
<P>
 The state treasurer performs a number of important functions: as administrator 
inthe sale of state bonds and notes; as a member of a number of commissions 
that relateto the marketing of bonds; as disburser of state funds spent by the 
controller's office and other state agencies. Among the treasurer's most 
important responsibilities is managing California's huge $20-billion investment 
portfolio. Both Angelides and Fong are committed to investing more of this 
portfolio in California. Such a boost in investment could potentially create 
tens of thousands of jobs and help finance the construction of thousands of 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, the son of former longtime Secretary of State March Fong Eu, impresses 
with his grasp of detail when discussing state financial issues. He also 
deserves credit for taking a lead role in shaping legislation to abolish the 
Franchise Tax Board, which collects income taxes, and to consolidate its 
responsibilities with those of the Board of Equalization, which handles sales 
taxes and a host of other taxes. This would not only cut bureaucratic 
duplication but would put all accountability for taxes onto the elected 
officials of the board. Overall, we believe that, while Angelides has much to 
offer in public life, Fong would perform more effectively as treasurer, and we 
recommend his election.

NICHE BOOKSTORES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Games' article denouncing book superstores (Commentary, Oct. 16) 
expresses a jaundiced view of economic progress that has been heard for 200 
years: As the big drive out the small, the marketplace is reduced to 
uniformity. Just the opposite! Although the megastores hurt the "small 
generalists," they favor the development of what Games dismissingly calls 
"niche marketers."Added all together, these small enterprises, some of which 
will become the giant corporations of tomorrow, give our society a choice of 
goods and services thousands of times greater than when "small generalists" 
abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Our niche store gives customers the same level of personal service as the 
traditional corner bookshop while covering our field of speculative literature 
to a greater depth than any superstore. Instead of lamenting the proliferation 
of specialized retailers, Games should be celebrating the additional choices 
they provide the consumer.

PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSITION 187; PROTECT THE CHILDREN FROM POLITICS; THE 
PROPONENTS NOW ADMIT THAT IT WON'T DO MORE THAN 'SEND A MESSAGE.' THIS IS AN 
INSULT TO ETHICS AND GOODWILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carelessly written and poorly drafted laws have a way of building common 
ground among the most unlikely of allies. It should be instructive, therefore, 
to note the surprising array of individuals now sharing the editorial pages of 
newspapers and the podiums of news conferences in opposition to Proposition 
187.  
</P>
<P>
 The growing list of opponents to this measure eludes any stereotype. It 
includes conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats and persons of 
every political ilk who understand the fallacy of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues and problems that once motivated voters to support Proposition 187 
sight unseen now blur as the devastating impact of the proposition comes into 
focus. Common sense and reasoned analysis are the most prized resources for 
concerned voters. Thoughtful analysis of the issue is what the vast majority of 
voters want in order to make choices that are informed, well-grounded and in 
the best interest of California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in this light that all Californians should note that leading 
spokespersons for 187 have conceded that the initiative will not stop illegal 
immigration. For voters who search for the facts, it should be enlightening to 
hear from the proposition's strongest supporters that 187 will not deliver on 
its earlier grandiose promises. Most provisions of Proposition 187 are now 
widely recognized to be unconstitutional, in violation of privacy and 
eligibility laws and completely impotent to change immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the initiative cannot stand on its own, proponents have taken to 
manufacturing reasons to support 187 that have nothing to do with the content 
and provisions of the initiative. Voters are being asked to pass Proposition 
187 to "send a message." It is a message that includes tossing hundreds of 
thousands of kids out of school, that refuses to immunize children and that 
asks taxpayers to gamble $15 billion in federal funds that come to California 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes that there are serious issues regarding immigration that need 
to be addressed by the people of California in a responsible way. What is very 
clear, however, is that Proposition 187 is bad public policy; it fails the most 
fundamental test of lawmaking by creating more problems than it solves. 
</P>
<P>
 If the California economy were growing by 5% per year, if we were not still 
reeling from a painfully prolonged recession, Proposition 187 would not be on 
the ballot. But it is not surprising that with people losing jobs, factories 
shutting down, corporations leaving the state and the fabric of our communities 
being challenged every day, that we find people grasping for the quick and easy 
solutions that characterize Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who carefully study Proposition 187 and its impact are now realizing 
that it does not begin to solve the myriad problems we face. It will do nothing 
to strengthen California, do nothing to revitalize our economy or ease the 
burdens of ordinary working people. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous reasons -- especially those grounded in basic moral and 
ethical principles of our religious heritage and tradition -- why California's 
Catholic bishops oppose Proposition 187. The most compelling for us is how the 
initiative will threaten children. Many have criticized the bishops for 
meddling in politics by taking an unambiguous position against the initiative. 
Children, however, are not political issues. They are human beings who need to 
be protected from bad laws like Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual collection of allies is lining up to say no to Proposition 187 on 
behalf of children who have not chosen to be undocumented. Each and every voter 
in California, every woman and man of conscience and goodwill should turn back 
this failed attempt at public policy and reject Proposition 187.

PLATFORM; ISRAEL'S VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RABBI ELI HECHT, director of Chabad of South Bay and past president of the 
Rabbinical Council of California, reacts to the killing of Israelis by Islamic 
radicals: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government of Yitzhak Rabin explains all the murder and violence with a 
new cliche, "Victims of Peace." This is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 By signing a peace treaty with Jordan, Rabin abrogates the hard-earned trust 
he built with Yasser Arafat. He gives the right of caring for the holy places 
to the king of Jordan, poking Arafat in the eye, along with telling him to deal 
with starving Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. In the eyes of Hamas, 
Arafat has been diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's recent statement placing the blame on all Palestinians is wrong. Hamas 
is the culprit and Arafat cannot control Hamas. The new civil unrest between 
Arabs will travel from Gaza to the West Gank to Golan to Jordan and back to Tel 
Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's only way to ensure peace is to immediately stop all peace 
negotiations with all Arab countries. No talks, official or secret, should be 
held until the Arab countries realize that Jewish blood is not cheap. We cannot 
go on burying our dead with the words, "May they rest in peace."

WHERE WILL ARAFAT STAND ON THE MAP OF FAITH?; MIDDLE EAST: TO HAMAS' SPIRITUAL 
LEADER, A MUSLIM PALESTINE IS BEYOND QUESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK JUERGENSMEYER, Mark Juergensmeyer is a professor of sociology at UC 
Santa Barbara and author of The New Cold War? Religious Nationalism Confronts 
the Secular State (University of California Press, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The abductions, murders and bombings perpetrated in Israel by members of the 
radical Palestinian Islamic movement, Hamas, have shown them to be a potent 
force. On one level, they are clearly engaged in a power struggle with Yasser 
Arafat, one that the PLO chairman cannot afford to lose. On another level, they 
are at war with nothing less than Western civilization, and this makes the 
response to them by both Arafat and Israeli leaders an extremely sensitive 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 This point of view was brought home to me in a conversation I had with the 
Hamas spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, shortly before he was arrested by 
the Israeli government several years ago. I met the aging sheik, left virtually 
paraplegic by a crippling neural disease, in the small prayer room of his 
simple residence on a hillside above the town of Gaza. The walls of the room 
were mostly devoid of decoration, but there were two prints: one was a picture 
of the Muslim shrine, the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem; the other was a 
drawing of the holy book, the Koran, superimposed on a map. The drawing showed 
the book as if it had arms that extended from Indonesia to Africa -- in a 
sense, embracing the world. 
</P>
<P>
 This theme of Islam as a world power and a force in Palestinian affairs was 
verbalized in our conversation. At that time, before the PLO-Israeli accords, 
the sheik thought that Arafat had a responsibility to make Palestine an Islamic 
state, since the overwhelming majority of its residents were Muslims. The idea 
of a secular state serving the interests of all religious communities seemed 
alien: an American notion, not a Palestinian one. If he went to America, the 
sheik explained, he would obey American laws. In Palestine, one should obey the 
laws of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a simple but profound equation: secular society on one side, Islam on 
the other. It was a comparison that I heard repeatedly in interviews with 
religious nationalists throughout the Islamic world. With only a switch in the 
name of the religious tradition, it was expressed by Buddhist nationalists in 
Sri Lanka, Hindu and Sikh nationalists in India and Jewish nationalists in 
Israel: Western civilization was on one side, religion on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this simple equation was often a vision of social reality that involved 
a series of concentric circles. The smallest were families and clans. Then came 
ethnic groups and nations. The largest and implicitly the most important 
circles, encompassing the others, were international civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 From this point of view, the great civilizations are Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism 
or the civilizations of other religious traditions. Then there is Western 
civilization, which, although it claims today to be secular and universal, is 
seen by religious leaders like Sheik Yassin as still, in essence, the culture 
of Christian Europe -- as parochial in its own way as many Westerners think 
Islam to be. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hamas' view, nations such as France, England and the United States are 
subsets of Western civilization. Nations such as Egypt, Iran and the incipient 
Palestine are subsets of Islam. This view of the rivalry of civilizations is 
the basis for several striking ideas that follow as logical conclusions to its 
premises: 
</P>
<P>
 * The notion that the spread of Western-style secular culture and politics is 
a form of colonialism, for it is one civilization forcing its ideology on 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 * The idea that America, even when not directly involved with a region like 
Palestine, is implicitly the enemy, since it is the fount of secular ideology 
and its most powerful proponent. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fear that secular leaders like Arafat are not just bad Muslims but 
agents of a foreign ideology. This line of reasoning explains why America is so 
readily a target of religious terrorism, and why secular leaders like Israel's 
Yitzhak Rabin and the PLO's Arafat are so deeply mistrusted by the followers of 
Hamas. It also explains why Arafat's dilemma is so profound. He must combat 
Hamas as a political enemy, and yet his very act of defying the Islamic 
movement is testimony to the idea that his secularism is an enemy of Islam. 
This is especially true when Israel and America are seen as goading him on. 
</P>
<P>
 In order for Arafat to succeed, he must fight Hamas on his own Palestinian -- 
and Islamic -- terms. To act in a way that would appear to cave in to outside 
pressures and non-Islamic interests, however, would be political suicide. Or 
worse. The graves of assassinated secular leaders -- including Egypt's Anwar 
Sadat, India's Indira Gandhi and Algeria's Mohammed Boudiaf -- are tragic 
testimony to what can happen to leaders who are identified as enemies of 
religious nationalism. If Arafat suffers that fate, it will be not only 
Palestine's loss, but also Israel's and the world's. To avoid it, he must be 
allowed to do what secular leaders in similar situations around the world have 
attempted to do: embrace aspects of their traditional culture even as they 
attempt to isolate and destroy the activists who are its most extreme 
proponents.

COLUMN LEFT/ DOUGLAS E. MIRELL: ITO'S WASTING HIS POWER ON A WILLFUL PRESS; HE 
CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING BEING PRINTED OR BROADCAST. SO LET'S GET ON WITH THE 
TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS E. MIRELL, Douglas E. Mirell, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm 
of Loeb & Loeb, is a volunteer attorney representing the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Southern California in the Simpson case and serves on the 
ACLU's board of directors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a month, Judge Lance A. Ito, presiding in the O.J. Simpson case, 
has taken the public's fundamental First Amendment right of court access on a 
wild roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride began, jarringly, with the judge's threats in August that led to the 
secret filing of many legal papers in the Simpson case. Still traveling, the 
roller coaster last week negotiated the judge's frustrated reactions to 
publication of a tawdry book based on Faye Resnick's alleged reminiscences 
about murder victim Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Any effect of the Resnick book on the Simpson trial was largely created by 
Ito's public tirades about it. But in pursuing his protests, and in his related 
decision to bar reporters from jury selection, Ito spent valuable court time 
informally attempting to persuade the media not to do what he candidly 
acknowledges they have every right to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience teaches that a free press either will or will not behave 
responsibly. But it is the public, not Ito, that has the capacity to reward or 
punish media irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner he realizes he cannot cajole, shame or scare the press into greater 
responsibility, the sooner Ito will be able to return to the only truly 
important business at hand -- the trial of a double murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick's yarn is not the first -- and certainly not the most sensational -- 
story ever told about Nicole or O.J. Simpson. Had Ito simply ignored this book, 
it quickly would have faded from the public consciousness. Ito's actions have 
had the unfortunate, but entirely predictable, effect of elevating the public's 
and media's interest in this tawdry, 244-page "reminiscence." Ito played 
perfectly into the publisher's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's fury about the book also spurred the ever-resourceful Simpson defense 
team to prepare a prejudicial publicity motion that hyperbolically 
characterizes this book as the legal equivalent of "a drive-by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 In each of three letters Ito wrote to try to persuade television outlets not 
to air interviews with Resnick, the judge contended that any interview would 
serve "only to fan the flames of adverse publicity and further jeopardize the 
parties' right to a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 But what did he mean by "further jeopardize?" Is the judge now implying that 
Simpson's Sixth Amendment fair trial rights have already been jeopardized by 
prior publicity? If so, this is clearly inconsistent with his earlier view that 
none of the publicity to date -- including the infamous "bloody sock" story -- 
had prejudiced Simpson's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible response, of course, is that we are now in the midst of the 
particularly delicate process of jury selection. Yet any problems that this 
fact might have posed were remedied by the enhanced admonition delivered to the 
pool of jurors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Going the extra step of singling out the Resnick book has only drawn more 
attention to its salacious allegations. At the same time, however, we now 
confront the very real specter that Ito's own words may provide inventive 
defense counsel with grounds for an appellate reversal premised upon 
"prejudicial publicity" -- presuming, of course, that Simpson is ever tried and 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two months, Ito has acted as if he can somehow control the press. 
He has threatened to "gag" all trial participants and to impose a blanket order 
sealing all court-filed documents. Until the defense objected, he briefly 
conducted jury selection in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 He has threatened to withdraw the press pass of a local reporter whose 
newspaper published excerpts from the blank juror questionnaire one day before 
he formally released it. He has threatened to bar other reporters from the 
Criminal Courts Building and to cut off all electronic courtroom coverage in 
retaliation for the "bloody sock" story -- a report which had absolutely 
nothing to do with any in-court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 And now he is spending court resources imploring the national media to 
voluntarily muzzle itself. The sooner Ito realizes that such attempts to 
control the press are neither possible nor desirable in our constitutional 
democracy, the sooner he and the parties can return to the important tasks of 
picking a jury, disposing of ever-proliferating pretrial motions, and, at long 
last, finally deciding the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson.

PHARM REPORT: BODY WATCH; PITCHING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you read TV Guide, People or other publications, you've probably spotted 
the trend: Ads that urge you to ask your doctor about a specific prescription 
drug. They seem to be popping up everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often advertised are treatments for chronic conditions such as arthritis 
and allergies. Until recently, these ads were likely to be seen mainly in 
medical or trade journals. 
</P>
<P>
 A Growing Trend: This trend "has taken off in the last two years," says Styli 
Engel, editor of Med Ad News, a trade publication in West Trenton, N.J. "This 
year, especially, it's been booming."  
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 brand-name prescription drugs are being advertised in major 
national publications, she estimates. Here's a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seldane-D and Claritin, prescription allergy remedies. Ads for both promise 
not to put users to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hytrin, a remedy to treat enlarged prostate glands in older men and possibly 
postpone surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * DayPro and Relafen, both arthritis medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ads include an 800 number to call for information and sometimes coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the Motive?Pharmaceutical companies are trying to make consumers aware 
of alternative treatments, Engel says. "Sometimes (the ads) even make them 
aware they have a disease and that they have some power (over treatment 
decisions)." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with chronic conditions often wonder if a different drug might be more 
effective, require less frequent doses or have fewer side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for SmithKline Beecham, which advertises the anti-inflammatory 
drug Relafen, says about a third of arthritis patients surveyed are not pleased 
with their current medicine because it doesn't work well enough or has side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with arthritis are very sophisticated," says Pam Rasmussen, spokesman 
for Searle, which makes DayPro. Most patients, she says, "know there are a lot 
of different medicines with small differences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Goal: "The last thing we're trying to do is take the decision-making power 
away from the doctors," says Steve Andrzejewski of Schering Plough, product 
manager for Claritin. Its ads always encourage consumers to ask their 
health-care professional, he says. The goal, he and others say, is to 
jump-start communication between doctors, pharmacists and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pharmaceutical companies alert doctors before placing an ad. Before 
starting the DayPro campaign, Searle did a mailing to physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmacist and Physician Input: Pharmacists and physicians have mixed 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers is strictly a 
profit-oriented motive," says John Dabbs, pharmacist-owner of Greenfield 
Pharmacy in Vista. "It has considerably less to do with communication to the 
patient." Dabbs isn't suggesting further government regulation, but improved 
industry regulation of its own advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good trend," counters Dr. Gerald Klein, an allergist in Vista 
and Escondido whose patients occasionally bring in ads for specific drugs. When 
they do, he sits down with them to discuss the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people don't realize the range of products available, says Klein, also an 
associate clinical professor of medicine and pediatrics at UC Irvine and UC San 
Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor still writes the prescription," Klein adds. The ads can simply 
help open dialogue, he finds.  
</P>
<P>
 Buyer Beware: Critics of the trend point out that the ads' fine-print warnings 
and information, required by the Food and Drug Administration, can confuse and 
even scare readers. Included are warnings, precautions and possible side 
effects, however remote. Relafen, for example, lists dozens of possible adverse 
reactions with an incidence less than 1% that are "probably" causally related. 
On that list are anorexia, anxiety, weight gain and abnormal vision, among 
other problems.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE FOR THE OFFICE; TALKING FROM 
NINE TO FIVE, HOW WOMEN'S AND MEN'S CONVERSATION STYLES AFFECT WHO GETS HEARD, 
WHO GETS CREDIT AND WHAT GETS DONE AT WORK BY DEBORAH TANNEN . MORROW: $23, 368 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deborah Tannen is a Georgetown University linguistics professor who broke out 
of academia and into the mainstream a few years ago with "You Just Don't 
Understand: Men and Women in Conversation."  
</P>
<P>
 The four-year bestseller explained just how women and men talk past each 
other, but on a more profound level it absolved us all of guilt. Our 
relationships weren't strained because we lacked the empathy chromosome. Our 
mates were speaking a different dialect -- and unless we learned theirs -- and 
they, ours -- we were doomed to a life of miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 Better still, it offered hope, at one-quarter the price of a single hour of 
psychotherapy. We didn't have to delve into our murky emotional pasts; all we 
had to do was learn a new language. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tannen has entered the workplace, to figure out why employees think their 
bosses don't listen, why deserving workers don't get ahead and, most 
frighteningly, why some of them won't ask for help even when they need it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wife of a man who once got lost on the way to his daughter's music 
lesson (OK, he had my car and there was no map in it) and came back home rather 
than call for directions, I'm quite familiar with the navigational autonomy of 
men. But Tannen points out that it's much more pervasive and potentially 
troubling that a male employee will often resist asking for information even 
though he lacks the knowledge he needs to do his job properly. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the two most chilling examples of mis-talk in the book are of the 
intern (male) who prescribes a medication at a particular dosage even though 
he's not sure it's right, rather than interrupt his resident and proclaim his 
ignorance, and, on the flip side, a woman doctor-in-training who gets a 
negative evaluation purely because she's always asking questions. Who would you 
rather be treated by: the man who makes an educated guess or the woman who 
acknowledges that she doesn't know everything? 
</P>
<P>
 Tannen talks about how language can put people "one down": that is, in a 
subordinate position regardless of their professional caste. And she notes -- 
not much of a surprise -- that men are more sensitive than women to losing 
their dominant status. But as in conversation, what is not said can be as 
significant as what is.  
</P>
<P>
 In a section titled "When Is the Wage Gap a Communication Gap?" Tannen tells 
of a woman who couldn't get a raise because her bosses didn't want to seem to 
play favorites over a man who'd been with the company as long as she had -- 
even though she now had a more responsible job. 
</P>
<P>
 Tannen devotes one paragraph to other possible reasons the woman was denied a 
raise -- the "gut-level, not-logically-thought-out sense that women should get 
less," or the fact that "the image of a woman does not readily suggest 
'breadwinner.' " You can talk all you like: Those kinds of prejudices run much 
deeper than conversational style. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is a fascinating compendium of information on how we say what we 
say -- and how others so easily misinterpret it. The transcripts of 
conversations Tannen uses to illustrate her points are perhaps the most 
interesting; rarely do we get the chance to consider dialogue at leisure, to 
look back over what two people have said and see the shifts in control or the 
miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 The remedy is a bit daunting. Learning to talk right in the workplace seems 
like training for a career in psychology; you have to be adept at multilevel 
listening. There is what you say, what is said to you, who initiates the 
exchange, who's in a position of relative power, and even the topic, or a 
sudden shift in topic, to consider. And even if you do get better at 
communicating, you may happen to be employed by a conversational Neanderthal -- 
in which case all your knowledge is only going to help you footnote your 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
 But always better to be informed and, in this case, frequently entertained. We 
may think that the workplace has undergone a revolution since the women's 
movement began, but Tannen shows how deeply ingrained our sense of place is -- 
particularly, how often women apologize in advance for what they fear will be a 
foolish question.  
</P>
<P>
 "Talking From Nine to Five" shows us how men and women with the same resources 
express them differently -- and so gives men a sense of how to be less 
combative, and women, less the corporate wallflower.

KYLIAN PARES HIS VIEW OF DANCE TO THE ESSENTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Jiri Kylian fled his native Czechoslovakia in 1968, literally on 
the last train out after the collapse of the "Prague Spring" of Alexander 
Dubcek.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The then-21-year-old dancer found sanctuary in Germany with John Cranko's 
Stuttgart Ballet. He began choreographing there and later moved to Holland, 
where he became director of the Nederlands Dans Theater in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has become one of Europe's most influential choreographers. 
Ironically, he is known in this country mostly through other companies' dancing 
his work. The costs of bringing his NDT are often prohibitive, but the flame 
has been kept alive as American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, Australian 
Ballet and the National Ballet of Canada regularly dance "Forgotten Land," 
"Return to a Strange Land" and "Sinfonietta," among other works. 
</P>
<P>
 NDT itself last appeared in the United States in 1987, at the Metropolitan 
Opera House in New York. The last time the company came to Los Angeles was in 
1980. Now NDT makes an exclusive West Coast appearance in Kylian's full-length 
"Kaguyahime" and shorter repertory today through Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Kylian's emigre background, it is not surprising that concern for the 
human situation often surfaces in his work. But don't be misled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a political choreographer," he insisted in an interview from his 
home in The Hague. "I don't believe politics should be conveyed through dance. 
Other media in art convey that much clearer and better. Dance should remain 
dance. Music is about music. Dance is about dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the opportunity presents itself, the choreographer does allow his 
pessimism about the human race to surface. "Kaguyahime," a classic Japanese 
folk tale, tells the story of a beautiful moon child who comes to Earth and 
through her matchless beauty unintentionally wreaks havoc here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fascinating story of someone who wants to give love and peace and 
instead seeds hatred and wars. That's what (human beings) are about. We keep 
doing this over and over again -- Yugoslavia, Haiti, all over the place. We 
will repeat that way. Human beings don't have an ability to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, "No More Play," one of his repertory pieces on the mixed-bill 
program, was inspired by "a tiny sculpture by Giacometti that looks like a 
little board game (that) no one knows how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like life. That's what it means to me. We come to life. We only assume as we 
make our moves that we understand the rules. We finish our life. By the last 
sigh, maybe we have understood something. It is a very abstract work. This is 
what it means to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work has changed very drastically (since the Met appearance)," he 
continued. "I used to use music that was mostly written by people who could 
have been my grandfather, people who had their roots in the Romantic era and 
who did everything possible to break that, but still had their roots there -- 
Janacek, Ravel, Schoenberg. I have changed that. I use a lot of contemporary 
music (now), but also baroque music because I feel we really are the children 
of the baroque. Our real roots are in the baroque time." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has very drastically changed his movement vocabulary.  
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot begin to describe what it is. It would sound ridiculous. I think I 
have freed my vocabulary. It has become much more eclectic. It's much more 
difficult for the dancers! It's a vocabulary that engages the body and the 
emotional side and the rational side really." 
</P>
<P>
 The new pieces are "very Spartan -- stark, very little costuming, very little 
color. In fact, I went back to the essentials: music, dance, light and space, 
which is very complicated. All (of the essentials) are very complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's actually only dealing with the essential things you need. All the 
unnecessary things were chucked out. I refer to those works as like those 
children's drawings which give you the outlines and you fill in the coloring. I 
call my (new) ballets 'coloring books.' I expect the public to put in their own 
colors. I give them basically the outlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm talking about their understanding, their emotional coloring. In that way, 
I expect a lot of active participation of the audience. The audience here is 
used to that, (but) I really wonder how the Orange County audience will react. 
I should be very curious. I'm very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The choreographer, too, participates, saying he always revises his ballets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fundamentally don't understand my work. You can quote that. I start 
understanding what my work is about maybe a year after the premiere, and I 
revise whenever or at anytime I am not satisfied with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Nederlands Dans Theater will dance Jiri Kylian's "Kaguyahime" today, 
Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. and shorter repertory ("No More Play," 
"Sarabande," "Petite Mort," "Whereabouts Unknown" and "Falling Angels") on 
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $18 to $55. (714)

APPRECIATION; RAUL JULIA, A TALENT BEYOND TYPECASTING; FROM HIS BEGINNINGS ON 
STAGE, THE ACTOR'S ELEGANCE AND VERSATILITY HAD IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To moviegoers, he was Gomez, the amorous husband in "The Addams Family," but 
to theatergoers, Raul Julia was Mack the Knife (at Lincoln Center in 1976); he 
was Guido Contini (the sexy Italian film director in the 1982 musical "Nine"); 
and, most vividly, he was a good-humored Petruchio to Meryl Streep's Kate in 
the 1978 Joseph Papp production of "Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia, who died Monday in New York at age 54, was also one of the first Puerto 
Ricans to star on the Broadway stage, but his talent was such that he was 
hardly ever typecast (he played an Englishman on Broadway in 1980 in Harold 
Pinter's "Betrayal). And his looks were so thrilling that he even overshadowed 
the mesmerizing Frank Langella as the Dracula most women would have preferred 
to suck their blood when he went on tour with the 1977 play. 
</P>
<P>
 While he got a chance to mock his matinee idol image in "The Addams Family," 
Julia played it for real in the musical version of Fellini's "8 1/2," called 
"Nine," which had a book by Arthur Kopit and music and lyrics by Maury Yeston. 
The star of the show was director Tommy Tune's stunning visual conceptions, 
which surrounded the star with 22 mostly gorgeous women on a black-and-white 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a film director in midlife crisis, Julia held the show together with 
his charisma, at full flower in 1982. Dressed in black, he rose at the start of 
the show to arrange the women in his life with a conductor's baton to the 
strains of a lush orchestral underscoring. He was a man making sense of the 
many passions he had felt, and he demonstrated a calm elegance and an unusual 
ability to be intense without being ponderous. It was a tremendously winning 
and confident portrayal.  
</P>
<P>
 In person he was a dedicated activist, working tirelessly for the Hunger 
Project since the late '70s. And his passion for acting was evident in the last 
months of his life. He lost 20 pounds to play the Brazilian rain-forest 
activist Chico Mendes in HBO's film "The Burning Season," got sick, and had to 
be airlifted out of the Mexican jungle where he was filming.  
</P>
<P>
 He may have felt a kinship with Mendes; he said in an interview last month, 
"He was just a regular guy, full of life and its enjoyment. . . . The film 
shows how a human being under the right circumstances has a choice, to make a 
difference beyond himself or to retreat." 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say that Raul Julia made a difference to any young Latino actor 
dreaming of the stage, because his dignified presence effectively banished any 
lingering "Bab-a-loo!" stereotyping. But he also radiated a great warmth and a 
straightforward modesty that, combined with his heavy-lidded grey eyes, 
translated into a powerful sexuality both on stage and on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatergoers knew him first, during his formative years in the late '60s and 
early '70s, when he trained on the stages of Joseph Papp's Public Theater. And 
for theatergoers, it's those elusive images, gone as soon as they are 
experienced, that will remain the most vivid.

A CHOREOGRAPHED BREAKAWAY FROM THE ROMANTIC; DANCE: A SPARSE, EXPRESSIONISTIC 
STYLE BORNE OF LIFE EXPERIENCE CHARACTERIZES JIRI KYLIAN'S WORK FOR THE 
NEDERLANDS DANS THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jiri Kylian fled his native Czechoslovakia in 1968, literally on the last 
train out after the collapse of the "Prague Spring" of Alexander Dubcek. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience left a lifelong mark, and after the then-21-year-old dancer 
found sanctuary in Stuttgart with John Cranko's Stuttgart Ballet, he began 
choreographing in the sparse, expressionistic style that has since come to 
characterize his work as director of the Nederlands Dans Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 His ballets for the Holland-based company often depict communities devastated 
by undefined loss, estranged and struggling to cohere. These works, which he 
has developed since taking the company's directorship in 1978, have touched 
audiences -- and choreographers -- far beyond central Europe. But, ironically, 
because the cost of touring is so high, Kylian's work has become known in the 
United States mostly through other companies. American Ballet Theatre and the 
Joffrey Ballet, among others, regularly dance "Forgotten Land," "Return to a 
Strange Land" and "Sinfonietta." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nederlands Dans Theatre last appeared in the United States in 1987, at the 
Metropolitan Opera House in New York. The last Los Angeles date was in 1980. 
Now, in an exclusive West Coast appearance today through Sunday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, the company will dance Kylian's 
full-length "Kaguyahime" and shorter repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 The new work is even more lean, he says, but he insisted in a recent phone 
interview from his home in the Hague: "I am not a political choreographer. I 
don't believe politics should be conveyed through dance. Other media in art 
convey that much clearer and better. Dance should remain dance. Music is about 
music. Dance is about dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the opportunity presents itself, the choreographer does allow his 
pessimism about the human race to surface. "Kaguyahime," a classic Japanese 
folk tale he says is "almost like Shakespeare," for instance, tells the story 
of a beautiful moon child who comes to Earth and through her matchless beauty 
unintentionally wreaks havoc here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fascinating story of someone who wants to give love and peace and

doing this over and over again -- Yugoslavia, Haiti, all over the place. We 
will repeat that way. Human beings don't have an ability to improve."

 Similarly, "No More Play," one of his repertory pieces on the mixed bill, was 
inspired by "a tiny sculpture by Giacometti that looks like a little board game 
no one knows how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, like life, exactly!" he exclaims. "That's what it means to me. We come 
to life. We only assume as we make our moves that we understand the rules. We 
finish our life. By the last sigh, maybe we have understood something. It is a 
very abstract work. This is what it means to me." 
</P>

 No, they weren't playing "Sympathy for the Devil": As Mick Jagger and the boys 
wailed away at the Rose Bowl, camera shots of young gyrating spectators -- 
mostly attractive women -- popped up on the stage's giant screen. Suddenly 
there appeared a middle-aged man whose head was bopping with a bit more 
restraint. The camera lingered on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed out of context to what was going on," spectator Larry Kusnitt said 
later. "I don't think anyone recognized him at first. Then a kind of wave of 
recognition came over the crowd and you heard people saying, 'Oh, my God!' "

horror. The former Soviet leader was in the hotel to address a Town Hall 
breakfast forum. He not only consented, signing near the well-known birthmark, 
but remarked that he found the custom amusingly "American."

actor Kevin Costner has apparently become something of a gourmet. For the

has an ocean-view bungalow, which comes equipped with a butler and chef,

 We haven't heard of anything so remarkable since actor Eddie Murphy

Monroe know too much about a government UFO cover-up?" We thought that was 
Elvis.

PROFILE; 'THE TIGRESS' SHARPENS HER CLAWS FOR PARLIAMENT BATTLE IN MEXICO; 
EX-PRESIDENTS' PARAMOUR VOWS 'TOTAL WAR' AGAINST RULING PARTY IN THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Irma Serrano, this country's answer to Marilyn Monroe, published her 
kiss-and-tell autobiography several years ago, sweat ran through the corridors 
of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Former presidents squirmed. Their wives fumed. And the onetime torch singer 
turned actress, known universally here as "The Tigress," held millions of 
Mexicans spellbound by her intimate, sometimes vicious accounts of Mexico's 
political kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, La Tigresa, the lover of former presidents who modeled nude for muralist 
Diego Rivera, is about to enter big-time politics herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano will be a distinguished member of the opposition in the new Mexican 
Senate, which takes office Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is apt to be a bit more than the free-wheeling democracy promised 
by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has ruled this nation 
without challenge for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano's Senate strategy, after all, is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total war," she said, speaking of the ruling PRI and the new president, 
Ernesto Zedillo. Here, in fact, is just a sample of what the ruling party has 
in store from the Tigress when she takes her seat with fellow members of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), in the 128-member Senate: 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I'm totally at war with them," she said in an interview in the salon of 
a Mexico City mansion choked with gold-leafed Louis XIV furniture, carved ivory 
tusks from China and other lavish bric-a-brac from around the world. "I am not 
a passive person. I am a rare woman in Mexico. I have based my entire life on 
aggression and rebuttal. To fight the fight. I am a warrior. And this is war." 
</P>
<P>
 It is just such forceful opposition that the government of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari and Zedillo, his presidential heir, said they hoped would 
come with a package of reforms that made Serrano's presence in the Senate 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano did not win her Senate seat from the troubled southern state of 
Chiapas outright in a hard-fought campaign. She came in a close second in the 
Aug. 21 federal elections in which the PRI swept to victory. But under a new, 
proportional representation system designed to strengthen the opposition voice 
in the legislature -- traditionally a rubber stamp for the president that 
Serrano and others have called "a joke" -- she and dozens of other opposition 
second-place finishers were awarded seats in the Senate and House of Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although PRI legislators will maintain a comfortable majority in both houses 
of Congress, they and Zedillo will lack the two-thirds majority needed to alter 
the Mexican constitution with impunity. Further, the new face of Congress is 
likely to change this nation's staid, predictable political landscape forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano will likely be just one of the permanent -- and outrageous -- fixtures 
in a new era of congressional confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting near her will be opposition PRD member Herberto Castillo, who is best 
known for a proposal to carve mammoth tunnels and install giant fans in the 
mountains south of the capital to suck out the city's notorious pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate will also include 24 members of the opposition National Action 
Party, among them veterans such as Juan de Dios Castro Lozano. He has pledged 
to revolutionize the Congress into an aggressive, presidential watchdog 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the days since the elections, it has been the Tigress who has spoken 
out loudest and most boldly against the PRI, its new president and 
governor-elect in Chiapas, where opposition protest to that election result is 
threatening to rekindle a peasant-guerrilla uprising that left 150 dead in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigress already has vowed to put 4,000 women on guard outside the 
governor's mansion in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez to prevent the 
PRI's governor-elect, Eduardo Robledo Rincon, from entering the building, let 
alone taking office -- an event, she said, that will happen "only over my dead 
body." 
</P>
<P>
 She has called Robledo "an assassin" and "a man responsible for the slaughter 
of thousands of indigenous Mexicans." She has accused him of trying to kidnap 
her and asserted that the PRI was behind a road accident in Chiapas that left 
her injured during her first Senate bid there three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, even Serrano's own party ideologues have expressed concern. Some 
said they are worried the Tigress will go so far and outrage so many that she 
will become an embarrassment to them too. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seemed to concern Serrano as she reflected recently on her past, 
her future and the future of Mexican democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her face thick with makeup, eyebrows painted with her trademark cat lines, the 
Tigress was the picture of poise and principle as she responded to the 
suggestion that she may not be taken with sufficient gravity in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must take me seriously," she said. "I am very strong. I am not a woman 
who has gotten a single thing through favoritism, or through help of any kind. 
I have fought for each one of my positions. And I swear, if someone must be 
respected, it's going to be me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not gentle," she insisted. "I am fearsome." 
</P>
<P>
 These are qualities that Serrano and independent political analysts conceded 
do make the Tigress well-qualified for Mexico's rough-and-tumble politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to be a great senator -- a fresh and forceful voice for 
change," one prominent Mexico City analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Serrano said she is qualified in other ways, as well. She has college 
degrees in philosophy and literature and a doctorate in law, none of which, she 
said, served her well through her acting and singing careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have fallen into the artistic environment was not my choice," she said. 
"It was part of a game of destiny. Now, I believe it was time lost. I never 
liked it. I began singing because I like poetry -- many of my poems were put to 
music -- then a friend came to me and said, 'You sing awful, but you sing 
different.' In six months, I was the star of Mexico. It all happened so fast. 
It attacked me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, it's her turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how it will be possible to change an authoritarian, often corrupt 
system, she answers: "Only by fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 True, she said, war is not democracy, "but that is the view only of one who 
has a good life. For half of Mexico, which has no work, which has no pants for 
their children, which has no vitamins, which doesn't even have a quarter of a 
bottle of antiseptic for wounds, for them, war is worth it. What value is life? 
They have nothing. And he who has nothing is very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigress paused, trying to justify such populist rhetoric from one of 
Mexico's wealthiest women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I am not a liar," she said. "I am not going and telling the people, 'I 
am poor. I am dying of hunger because I am like you.' No. They don't want me 
like this. I am myself. If someone takes away everything today or tomorrow, it 
doesn't matter to me. I am not attached to material things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the people, 'I am rich -- but what I have is yours,' " she said, 
adding: "Because I have no children. I have no relatives any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano never did marry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe anyone ever proposed to me," she said with a laugh, although 
there is, perhaps, a deeper reason. Her mother, she explained, divorced her 
father when she learned he was a pure Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember," she said, "my mother saying the Indians have learned only how to 
be slaves, not her husband." 
</P>
<P>
 But such roots, she said, taught her a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano claims to have learned dozens of Mexico's indigenous Indian dialects, 
which she used extensively during her campaign in the jungle villages and 
underdeveloped towns that characterize the poor state she now represents. 
</P>
<P>
 They also taught her what she said she considers her most valuable character 
trait: "To be aggressive -- all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when the subject turned to her age that Serrano offered a vague 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never have counted the years. But I was born on Dec. 9, 1945. In my 
passport it says 1946 because I lied," she said with a hearty laugh, though 
clearly looking a bit older than both dates would testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that for a thoughtful person, time is not served by growing old, 
without growing wise," she added. "To learn every day something that takes you 
a step forward, that is what leaves beautiful memories. This (new career is) 
like that. And it is not going to kill me, nor measure me for the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I feel like my body is filled with youth, with the power to win the 
struggle. On the day that I feel I don't want to fight, or to defend a cause, 
on that day it will mean I have begun to rot." Biography

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mozambique holds its first democratic election Thursday and Friday, giving the 
war-ravaged country a chance for long-lasting peace. The United Nations, which 
is supervising the vote, hopes to recoup its record in Africa after recent 
debacles in Angola, Somalia and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, which has governed since 
the southeast African nation won independence from Portugal in 1975, is 
expected to win the poll for Parliament and president. But Chissano is under 
pressure to give former guerrilla chief Afonso Dhlakama a prominent role in the 
new government. 
</P>
<P>
 The election completes a process begun two years ago when Chissano's formerly 
Marxist government and Dhlakama's rightist Renamo rebel movement signed a peace 
plan mediated by U.N. officials to end a 16-year civil war that killed an 
estimated 600,000 people.

NATIONAL AGENDA; JAPAN LOOKS HOMEWARD -- TOWARD ASIA; THE SHIFTS IN TRADE AND 
CULTURE ARE STARTING TO AFFECT RELATIONS WITH THE WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Japan's government ministries to Tokyo's trendy youth districts, the 
scent of change is unmistakable: Japan -- an unquestioned ally of the United 
States for half a century and a passionate student of Western learning -- is 
looking to its Asian neighbors, the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War eased the need for security ties with Washington, and 
Asia's spectacular economic ascent has intensified national debate over Japan's 
fundamental interests. Should it tilt toward its Asian neighbors or stay 
anchored with the West? In a sense, the debate goes to the heart of Japan's 
identity itself, long perched between its traditional culture and modern 
economic and political development. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a century after Meiji Restoration reformists turned West to 
modernize Japan -- even discussing intermarriage to improve the racial stock -- 
the identification with Asia is growing, overriding a sometimes bitter history 
of conflict and colonization. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade is exploding, growing twice as fast within the region as with the United 
States in the last five years. Government officials are voicing a growing 
desire to play a more active political role in the region and are being 
exhorted to do so by leaders such as Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed 
and Lee Kuan Yew, the former Singaporean leader. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more Japanese are beginning to assert an agenda of "Asian values" 
that could lead to differences with the West over human rights, labor relations 
and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the sacrosanct security relationship with the United States, a product of 
the American victory over Japan in World War II, is being reviewed. In a recent 
report to the prime minister's office, a group of defense experts advised 
supplementing U.S.-Japan security arrangements with new ties to the United 
Nations and with Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 And among Japan's relentlessly trendy youth, Asia is clearly in vogue. "Asia 
is Exciting!" the young women's magazine Crea declared in a cover story, 
underscoring the heightened interest in Asian languages, food, dance and travel 
-- even boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when the once overwhelming U.S. presence in the political and economic 
spheres has diminished somewhat and the Cold War has crumbled, Asia is 
definitely assuming greater weight in Japanese policy," wrote Yoshibumi 
Wakamiya, an Asahi Shimbun editorial writer. "We may be coming to a crucial 
juncture that will finally straighten out the warp in Japanese views of Asia 
that goes back to the Meiji era." 
</P>
<P>
 But the deepening ties with Asia do not necessarily mean that Japan is 
downgrading its relationship with America. The United States remains Japan's 
single largest market and security shield, and Japanese officials vigorously 
stress that the ties with Asia are not being built at America's expense.  
</P>
<P>
 It is "patently clear that the zero-sum arguments urging Japan to determine 
which is more important to its interest -- the United States or Asia -- have no 
meaning," Foreign Minister Yohei Kono declared earlier this month at the 
Shimoda Conference, an elite gathering of U.S. and Japanese scholars, 
politicians, journalists and business executives. Kono said the U.S. military 
presence, its long history in Asia and the growing economic interdependence are 
keys to the region's stability and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, held in the western resort island of Awashima, devoted its 
agenda to Japan's role in Asia and the impact on U.S.-Japan relations. In a 
move unprecedented in its 27-year history, Shimoda's organizers invited 
participants from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand 
and elsewhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Curtis, a Columbia University political science professor who attended 
the conference, concurred with Kono. "The question of whether to leave Asia for 
the West or go back to Asia from the West is simply not the way people are 
thinking," he said. "Business and political leaders are quite comfortable with 
the idea of maintaining intimate relations with the United States and having 
close relations with Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see a tilt coming in Tokyo's policies. Asia's ascent as an economic 
superstar and China's emergence as an even more formidable military and 
political power of the future contrast with the growing image of the United 
States as a declining power saddled with criminals, drug addicts and lazy 
workers. One of Japan's time-honored proverbs advises to "move with the 
powerful," and that, to some, spells Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Japanese officials and the mass media are preparing the public for 
a disengagement from the United States in favor of the United Nations and 
Asia," argued Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research 
Institute and former University of California political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson cites Japan's solicitous policy toward China, the recent defense 
report urging new security ties with Asia and the tremendous economic resources 
being poured into the region as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he is right or wrong, such Look East sentiments are being increasingly 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
 A current bestseller, for instance, urges Asian nations to form a regional 
"yen bloc," saying that Japan can survive without America. More sensational 
than specific, "The Era of the Asian Yen Bloc: Farewell, America," by 
nationalist writers Shoichi Watanabe and Eikan Kyu, has nonetheless sold 
100,000 copies in three weeks, a phenomenal performance by Japanese standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials too are more willing to directly challenge U.S. leadership. At the 
recent Shimoda Conference, Japanese officials repeatedly insisted that they are 
becoming more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked how, exactly, they want to assert themselves in Asia and with the 
United States, they had no ready answers, conferees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese are quite ready to say no, but the question is, what do you say 
after no? What constructive policies do you suggest? They're not there," said 
Curtis, the Columbia professor. "There is such a dearth of ideas and fresh 
thinking about what Japanese policies should be about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatou Takahama, a senior fellow with the Yomiuri Research Institute, 
reluctantly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit the Japanese participants failed to provide clear answers," 
he recently wrote. "It is quite unlikely that the Japanese participants will be 
able to come up with impressive ideas on what role Japan should play in the 
Asia-Pacific region . . . because the majority of the Japanese are still hoping 
to maintain the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when wartime suspicions still limit Japan's political role, 
officials say the country's foremost contribution in Asia should be economic, 
leading the region toward greater prosperity. On this score, Japan has 
performed spectacularly, analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is now Asia's main source of loans, technology and foreign aid, and has 
provided the model of close government-business coordination that other Asian 
nations have successfully followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, Japanese manufacturers have shifted their offshore 
production in Asia from domestic products to those requiring higher quality for 
the world export market. As a result, they have passed on valuable skills in 
quality control and other management methods to Asian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia now accounts for 34% of Japan's imports and 37% of its exports, 
surpassing the United States in the latter category since 1991. Japanese 
manufacturing investment in North America plunged from $9.1 billion in 1988 to 
$4.1 billion in 1993 but rose in Asia from $2.3 billion to $3.6 billion during 
that same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important fact of post-Cold War Asia is the degree to which it has 
been tied together by Japan," said Johnson, the research institute president. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and Curtis argue that Japan must go beyond supplying loans, know-how 
and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's most important role in Asia, they argue, is to offer its market as a 
replacement for the vast and open U.S. market to absorb the region's products.  
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials say they are doing just that. Imports from Asia grew from 
28% of the total in 1985 to 34% in 1993. Moreover, the proportion of 
manufactured imports increased from 7% in 1980 to 41% in 1993, according to 
government figures.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer simply importing raw materials, Japan is now buying Korean steel, 
Taiwanese computer components, Malaysian televisions and Chinese apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, however, argues that Japan is not opening its markets fast enough, 
nor making enough headway in cutting the morass of red tape that tends to keep 
out new competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's strategy invariably invites comparisons with its World War II "Greater 
East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" campaign to free Asia from white colonialists 
and enrich the region -- a slogan that Tokyo used to justify its own plunder 
and colonization. But Japan's current activities bear important differences -- 
not the least of which is the eager demand for them by Asians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe on balance Japan is making the right move to quit identifying with 
Europeans or Americans as honorary whites," Johnson said. "Japan's beginning to 
find its place in Asia, and its talk of Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity -- not 
built at the point of bayonet but on true prosperity -- is as idealistic as the 
European Union." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign relations are trickier. Japan's wartime deeds still rankle in Asia, 
inhibiting policy-makers here from trying to assert much political leadership. 
The most notable exception is Japan's activities in Cambodia. Using the nation 
as a diplomatic testing ground, Japan sponsored the international conference on 
Cambodia's reconstruction in 1992, pledged the largest amount of aid and sent 
volunteers to U.N. peacekeeping efforts there. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. analysts are scrutinizing Japan's diplomacy with China to watch for signs 
of tilt. They say the most notable sign was its disagreement with the United 
States over linking China's trade benefits to its progress in human rights. 
Curtis said Japan's lack of support was one reason the Clinton Administration 
abandoned its policy to link the two. Such behavior contrasts sharply with the 
past, when Japan essentially followed Washington's dictates. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, most analysts agree, Japan's new assertiveness in Asia does not 
appear to conflict with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news for Washington is that when the Japanese decide on their own, 
they pretty much end up where we are," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area where the two nations still share the deepest ties is in security. 
The United States still guarantees Japan's defense, but both sides are 
beginning to question those arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report for the RAND Corp.'s National Defense Research Institute last 
year, Francis Fukuyama and Kongdan Oh said "both the alliance and the broader 
U.S.-Japan relationship are experiencing a number of strains that will likely 
necessitate modification of the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War dissolved the mutual threat and ideological glue 
holding the two sides together, and the more Japan tilts toward Asia, "the more 
likely it is that the common sense of purpose will be lost," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. analysts posed similar questions at Shimoda, asking why the United States 
should continue to defend Japan and guarantee the region's stability. Many cite 
U.S. economic interests as a major rationale -- but only if Americans are given 
a fair share of the region's growing economic pie. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is beginning to invite provocative debate. "The security treaty 
only makes sense if it is used as a quid pro quo to blast open Japan's market," 
Johnson argued. A Japanese analyst retorted, "Any hint of looking at that kind 
of policy would ignite a sense among Japanese to go toward foolish isolationism 
or an unfavorable anti-American sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia University professor Kuniko Inoguchi, who helped compile the defense 
report recommending that Japan broaden its security ties, is more diplomatic. 
"It's not a zero-sum game. We will keep our biggest emphasis on U.S.-Japan, but 
at the same time we have to get along with the neighbors," she said. "We've 
neglected that for the last 40 years, and it's high time we pay our respects." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's heightened interest in Asia finds its most pleasant expression in 
culture, for instance the growing numbers of people here taking up the food, 
dance and language of other Asian countries. Japan's image of the rest of Asia 
has changed drastically from the 1970s, when it was seen as a poor, remote 
region bout which little was known beyond the popular pandas, Kan Kan and Ran 
Ran, that China sent as gifts or the plastic "Hong Kong flowers" that decorated 
Japanese toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the early 1980s, Asia began getting fashionable. An NHK-TV series on 
the old Silk Road linking China to Europe sparked interest in the vast region 
of Central Asia and triggered a run on books, photo albums and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1980s, Hong Kong movies, Singaporean pop music and Southeast 
Asian gigolos took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomoka Seki, 25, reflects the new interest in Asia. She was initially drawn 
West, studying ballet and French in France for more than two years. But living 
there showed her the negative side of Western culture, and the constant 
questions about where she came from sparked an awareness of herself as Asian, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she studies Balinese dancing, Asian art and other aspects of the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized not just the West but Asia is also fantastic," she said.

NATIONAL AGENDA; STRUGGLING WITH THE 'TAJIK PROBLEM'; RUSSIANS STILL PROP UP 
THE CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLIC, BUT THEY ARE ALSO FLEEING IT IN RECORD NUMBERS. 
</P>

 From the watchtower at Border Post 12, a sentry scans the arid plain. A mile 
away on the horizon, shimmering in the afternoon heat, is the Pyandzh River and 
beyond it Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most volatile border in the world," said an aide to Tajikistan's head of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Post 12 -- in fact, the entire Tajik side of the 750-mile frontier -- 
is commanded by Russians. Once the Soviet Union's border, it is too vital to 
Moscow's sense of security to be abandoned to the newly independent and warring 
Tajiks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we leave here, the war will follow us home," said Sgt. Vladislav N. 
Rodinov, 19, the Russian who maintains the alarm system that detects Tajik 
guerrillas from across the river as they approach a 10-foot-high border fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gen. Grigory A. Besmertny, "This border is Russia's border." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after the Soviet Union broke up, Russians are still masters of 
this Central Asian republic, more so than anywhere else in their former empire. 
They prop up the Tajik government, supply its currency, dictate its foreign 
policy, bear the brunt of its guerrilla war. Russian diplomats help draft 
speeches for Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov. 
</P>
<P>
 For all Moscow's clout, however, Tajikistan has become unbearable for most of 
the Russians who colonized, urbanized and industrialized it in Soviet days. In 
numbers exceeding those from any other former Soviet republic, the ethnic 
Russians are fleeing war, insecurity, economic hardship and nascent Tajik 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's conflicting neo-colonial impulses -- to control this little country 
even as Russians abandon it -- have deepened Tajik resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Russian policy has reduced Tajikistan and its 5.5 million people to 
a military buffer protecting Russia from the chronic clan warfare, gun running 
and drug smuggling that spill over from unruly Afghanistan, the violent arena 
that humbled the Soviet army in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Russian diplomats join in efforts to make peace, many here believe 
that Russian military involvement has escalated the civil war, which pits a 
ruling regional clan of Tajik Communists and their 8,000-member army against 
5,000 guerrillas from rival Tajik clans led by democrats and Muslims. More than 
20,000 people have died in two years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tajikistan was a beautiful, warm and friendly part of the world -- always 
enough food and never any bad words from the Tajiks until now," said Antonina 
A. Sofyanov, a Russian who came to this country in 1939 at age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 67 and fretful, she is trying to sell her garden apartment and vineyard in 
the best district of Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, for $1,000 in rubles, about 
what it will cost to ship her belongings to Russia by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubles are in such short supply that Sofyanov, still employed as a bookkeeper 
on the Tajik state payroll, has not received her salary since February. Her 
Russian husband last collected a monthly retirement pension in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple decided to emigrate after she got up one day at 3 a.m. to stand in 
line for bread, only to have a Tajik insult her. "Go away and our life will get 
better," he snarled at her. "All our problems are because of you Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians built this country," Sofyanov said, recalling the incident. "Now 
we have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, where a Muslim village stood 70 years ago, Russian emigrants founded 
the Tajik capital. They constructed one of the world's biggest aluminum plants, 
fueled it with Central Asia's most potent hydroelectric station and diverted 
the water through tunnels to turn the arid landscape green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first doctors were Russians, our first engineers, drivers, communications 
workers, scientists, writers, composers," said Sultan Mirzoshoyev, President 
Rakhmonov's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The country remained so dependent on Russians that their exodus is crippling 
the economy and public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 500,000 Russians in Tajikistan before the civil war began in 1992, at 
least 320,000 have left, according to the Russian Embassy in Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus parallels the post-Soviet migration home of Russians from all the 
new neighboring republics and is the largest reported from any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the remaining 180,000 Russians here simply have nowhere to live or 
work in their homeland, which has a housing shortage and growing unemployment 
itself. To raise money for the next week's food, they set up informal sidewalk 
bazaars to sell their clothing and other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the fortress-like headquarters of the Russian army's 201st Motorized 
Rifle Division in Dushanbe, a ragged Russian veteran of World War II was 
stooping by a garbage dump, collecting severed fish heads in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters itself is a thriving imperial enclave within a poor colony. 
The Russian army, with its large complement of border troops here, is in the 
midst of a buildup and is one of the few institutions in Tajikistan that pays 
salaries on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has 17,000 border troops here, backed by 6,500 soldiers of the 201st 
Division who guard factories, dams and other guerrilla targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Having helped the Rakhmonov clan seize the government from its rivals two 
years ago, the Russian army now portrays itself as a neutral broker and 
defender of the border, striving to win U.N. endorsement and funding as a 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, officers say their real mission here is to preserve Russian 
hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever comes to power in Tajikistan must bow to us," said a Russian 
commander in Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
 But other voices in Moscow are warning that Russia's patronage -- $70 million 
this year alone -- is not unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Economics Ministry in Moscow, after first welcoming Rakhmonov's 
decision to stay in the "ruble zone," has balked at the high cost of supporting 
Tajikistan and set conditions that may force Dushanbe to issue its own 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that the military buildup is not working, Russia's Foreign Ministry 
successfully pressured Rakhmonov to start peace talks with the opposition. 
Although the talks last month produced a temporary cease-fire, a final 
political settlement seems far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Russians particularly want to be the colonial masters of 
Tajikistan," said a diplomat in Dushanbe. "I think they see Tajikistan as a 
black hole. They have a commitment here that they would rather not have. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's ambivalence makes the shrinking Russian community here all the more 
uneasy with its Tajik neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir P. Kondur, a Russian scientist who has lived in Tajikistan for 32 
years, described with dismay how nine of his 11 Russian neighbors have moved 
out of a Dushanbe apartment building, giving way, he said, to Tajiks who play 
loud music and let their children defecate in the hallways. "They don't belong 
here. They're not cultured," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the complaints, Russian civilians have not suffered nearly as much as 
Tajiks in the war. They are no longer targeted or openly threatened by the 
guerrillas. In fact, opposition spokesmen say they now accept the need for 
long-term Russian border protection and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as they worry about the Russian exodus, Tajik authorities have 
resisted proposals to let Russians take dual citizenship, to restore Russian as 
an official language and to give Russians representational quotas in 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei L. Loiko, a reporter in The Times' Moscow Bureau, contributed to this 
article. Rich History 
</P>
<P>
 The Republic of Tajikistan, which declared independence from the Soviet Union 
in 1991, is in a region that has changed hands many times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tajiks are descendants of Iranian-speaking people who entered Central Asia 
as early as 2000 BC. They were incorporated into the Persian Empire and later 
the empire of Alexander the Great. In the 10th Century, Turkic-speaking peoples 
overran Central Asia. Many Tajiks were assimilated then, with their culture 
surviving mainly in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Tajiks were brought under control of the Emirate of Bukhara, then 
Afghanistan in the 18th Century and finally the Russian Empire in the 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Red Army claimed most of the territory 
of modern Tajikistan. In 1922-23, the Tajiks led an unsuccessful revolt against 
Communist rule.

MARKET FOCUS; DETENTE WITH IRAQ COULD SPOIL OIL SALES FOR OTHERS; KUWAIT AND 
OTHER OPEC NEIGHBORS WOULDN'T MIND IF THE SANCTIONS STAY FOREVER. THEY ARE 
PICKING UP BUSINESS THAT BAGHDAD HAS LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Less than four years ago, when U.S. soldiers and their comrades in Operation 
Desert Storm liberated Kuwait, the emirate was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every one of Kuwait's 700 oil wells was burning, the targets of Iraqi 
saboteurs, and the rest flowed like tributaries into great lakes of oil on the 
sand. The sky was black, and droplets of oil hung like humidity in the air, 
staining dishdashas and business suits here in the capital. The crippled 
refineries were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, as one Western oil analyst here put it, "as bad as it gets in the oil 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, to the surprise of oil experts, Kuwait, a nation smaller than New 
Jersey with the third-largest oil reserves in the world, is fully back in 
business. Its three refineries are open and operating, and the nation is 
pumping 2 million barrels of crude a day, equal to pre-Persian Gulf War levels. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest threat from Iraq, and its desperation to fling off the noose of 
U.N. sanctions, has been a blunt reminder to Kuwait and its Gulf neighbors that 
one of the world's most important oil producers is still on the sidelines and 
that they owe much of their economic and political stability to the U.N. 
restraints on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Gulf War ended in 1991, the sanctions have cut Iraq, with the 
world's second-largest oil reserves, out of the world petroleum market, leaving 
Kuwait and others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
happily take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq once produced about 3 million barrels of oil a day. Today it pumps just 
about 600,000, enough to meet its domestic needs with a little left over to be 
sold at discount to friends such as Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure when, or even if, Iraq will accept all the United 
Nations' preconditions for lifting the trade embargo. But that question is 
clearly on the minds of oilmen in nations such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, 
which wouldn't mind if the sanctions remained permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 In public, those countries say regional security, and not oil revenue, is 
their main concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil prices are not the core of the whole issue," said Saud al Sabah, Kuwait's 
information minister. "The issue is Saddam's military capacity. He can export 
oil now if he uses the proceeds to buy food and medicine for his people." The 
U.N. sanctions require oil profits be used only for humanitarian causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, government officials admit that if Iraq returned to full oil 
production it could send prices for oil plummeting, touch off rancorous debate 
in OPEC and set up a testy economic battle in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, sooner or later, sanctions are going to be lifted. And when that 
happens, let's face it, Iraq is going to flood the market," a senior executive 
in the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Western oil analysts doubt that Iraq could come back to full 
production that fast. "It'll be more of a phased event," a Western diplomat 
here predicted. "I don't envision 22 tankers on the seas overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 When Iraq re-enters the market, it will also face some difficult negotiations 
in OPEC, which was formed to keep oil prices high by placing production limits 
on oil-exporting countries. Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are among OPEC's 12 
members. Many major world producers do not belong to the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some tough bargaining in OPEC," another Western diplomat 
said. "Why should Kuwait or anyone else in OPEC bend over backward to help 
Iraq?" But some industry experts point out that Iraq could end up withdrawing 
from OPEC and sharply discounting its oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The first battles on sanctions will come in the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. conditions for lifting sanctions against Iraq are open to some 
interpretation, and the United States is likely to take a harder line than 
Russia and France. Russia wants to see sanctions lifted so Iraq can begin 
paying off its debts to Moscow, and two French oil companies have reportedly 
reached agreement with Iraq to develop two oil fields once sanctions are 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 But some U.S. diplomats doubt that Iraq can ever clear the U.N. hurdles as 
long as Hussein is in power. Even if he agrees to some of the conditions -- by 
recognizing Kuwait's borders and agreeing not to use oil revenue on military 
spending, for example -- the Americans and others still won't trust him. Many 
oil market analysts believe that it will be a year, at the earliest, before 
sanctions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be just fine with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and others in the Gulf. The 
possibility of detente, and Iraqi oil on the market again, makes many oil 
executives in this region jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race against that possibility, Kuwait is rapidly expanding its oil 
production as well as its other petroleum enterprises, from refining to retail 
gasoline sales. It already has 6,500 gasoline stations, owned by the government 
oil company, from Europe to the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 With several multimillion-dollar expansion projects under way, Kuwait could 
boost its production capacity to 2.5 million by next year -- and to 3.5 million 
within five years. It has served notice that it will seek an increase in its 
quota when OPEC next revises its agreement, probably next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait's comeback from the war has been, by all accounts, remarkable. During 
the seven months of Iraqi occupation, and in the final sabotage of the wells, 1 
billion barrels of oil -- or 1% of Kuwait's total capacity -- disappeared in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kuwait has a bloated official bureaucracy, the nation's brightest 
people work in the government-owned oil industry. And they were able to bring 
back full production within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the highest regard for these people," said a Western diplomat who 
dealt with Kuwaiti oil executives in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had feared that the oil fires would provoke an environmental catastrophe 
or that some wells would be damaged beyond repair. But the fires were quickly 
put out by foreign firefighting crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The air over Kuwait is clean again, but the oil lakes have been a challenge 
for environmental engineers. After some crude was siphoned off, and some 
evaporated, all that was left were vast expanses of sludge, still visible from 
the air. Eventually the cleanup will cost millions, if not billions, of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For such a small country, Kuwait's 96 billion barrels of proven oil reserves 
are immense, more than four times the reserves of the United States. The bulk 
of that oil is in the Greater Burgan field, the world's second-largest, located 
about 20 miles south of Kuwait city. But there's oil all over the country, from 
the northern border with Iraq to Kuwait city itself.

POSTSCRIPT; INDIRA GANDHI'S TROUBLED INDIA LEGACY; TEN YEARS AFTER THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S DEATH, THE PARLIAMENT, COURTS AND PARTY SYSTEM REMAIN WOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The favorite childhood pastime of the scion of India's First Family was to 
summon the servants, clamber on top of a table and deliver a rousing speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I saw her standing at the balustrade of the veranda with 
outstretched arms," her doting aunt wrote. "She said, 'I'm practicing being 
Joan of Arc. I have been reading about her, and someday I am going to lead my 
people to freedom just as she did.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The idealistic little orator was Indira Priyadarshini Nehru, the only child of 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. As Indira Gandhi, she would become one of the 
most powerful and best-known women of the 20th Century, serving a decade and a 
half as prime minister of the world's second-most populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in realizing her schoolgirl dream, this determined, steel-willed woman 
with an intense, brooding gaze and a chinchilla streak of white in her hair 
succeeded by only half. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Joan of Arc, she led her people, and she was gratefully christened Indira 
Amma -- "Mother Indira" -- by many of her country's most desperate and 
destitute. But she also took independent India into the darkest time of its 
existence, the 18-month Emergency of 1975-77. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her legacy is a sort of continuous ruin; she did more than anyone else to 
destroy institutions in India," author Arun Shourie said when asked to assess 
her impact. Shourie lost his job as a newspaper editor in 1982 after exposing a 
suspicious $200-million government contract involving Gandhi's son, Sanjay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental point is that she didn't believe in anything," Shourie said. 
"Oh, she believed India should be strong. But she believed in no norms, only in 
the expediency of the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, on the bright, clear morning of Oct. 31, 1984, what was known as 
"Indira Raj" -- Indira's rule -- came to an abrupt and tragic end. At the 
sprawling walled compound at 1 Safdarjung Road in New Delhi where she lived, 
Gandhi rose and had a simple breakfast of milk and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first engagement, scheduled for 8:30 a.m., was a taping for Irish 
television with Peter Ustinov. There was a delay in setting up the equipment, 
and at 9:10, a restless Gandhi, shod in black sandals, left the house and 
started down a paved pathway toward her office. 
</P>
<P>
 As she reached the shade of a teak tree, at a spot now marked with glass 
flowers, two men assigned to protect her, Sub-Inspector Beant Singh, who had a 
.38-caliber revolver, and Constable Satwant Singh, armed with a 9-millimeter 
carbine, made their move. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they fired 30 shots. Nearly all pierced the light-orange sari Gandhi 
was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 She was rushed to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where she 
received 28 bottles of blood but to no avail. About 2:30 that afternoon, 
doctors pronounced her dead. 
</P>
<P>
 An era had ended in India's history, one summed up in the sycophantic yet apt 
words of Congress President Dev Kant Barooah, "India is Indira, and Indira is 
India." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her acts have outlived her -- often, observers and political 
scientists say, with baleful consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 During her reign, Gandhi increasingly ignored the country's bicameral 
Parliament, which had been designed as the keystone of India's 
Westminster-style system, and centralized power in her inner circle. 
Subordinates in the prime minister's office became the superiors of even 
members of the Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges were tightly subordinated to politicians' whims and menaced with 
transfer if they did not listen. The chief ministers of Indian states, 
once-powerful figures with their own independent power bases, became Gandhi's 
puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian National Congress, the patriotic movement to which her father and 
grandfather Motilal Nehru had been so devoted that the large Allahabad home 
where Indira grew up served for a time as its headquarters, became little more 
than her handmaiden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard her say, 'My father was a statesman. I'm a politician,' " noted 
Congress spokesman Vithal N. Gadgil, who was her minister of state for defense 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Official venality and lack of accountability, the bane of contemporary Indian 
public life, took root and flourished during Indira Raj, though their seeds 
antedate Gandhi's two terms as prime minister in 1966-77 and 1980-84. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corruption started eroding into the political system seriously around Mrs. 
Gandhi's time," said H.K. Dua, editor of the Indian Express newspaper. "The 
nexus between business and politics, and the increasing influence of money on 
politics, became stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, some members of the current Congress government are suspected of 
wrongdoing or neglect in scandals involving large sugar shortages, payoffs for 
petroleum contracts and the biggest securities scam in the country's history, 
to cite just three examples. Yet no one has been "brought to book," as Indians 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts remain so cowed by politicians that in Punjab, the chief minister's 
grandson and his friends can, according to recent reports in newspapers, molest 
women with impunity, even using their police bodyguards to procure their prey. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite different before Indira Raj, when, for instance, Nehru's oil 
minister, Kesho Dev Malaviya, was forced to resign because of allegations that 
he solicited a 10,000-rupee bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 If Americans in the 1990s are suspicious of politicians, Indians have become 
positively cynical. For people who spent their formative years under Gandhi's 
imperial style of leadership, it left deep and indelible traces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been one steady decline since she came to power," said Amrik Singh, 
former vice chancellor of Punjabi University in Patiala. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the protagonist in a Greek tragedy, Gandhi's hubris was her own undoing. 
To challenge the radical Akali Dal Party, which had humiliated the Congress in 
1977 to take control of Sikh-populated Punjab, she fostered the rise of Jarnail 
Singh Bhindranwale, an advocate of Sikh separatism who became far more 
extremist than the Akalis. To wipe out the monster she had created, Gandhi 
ordered the army to attack the Golden Temple, the holiest of Sikh shrines where 
Bhindranwale had holed up with his armed followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her "Operation Blue Star" caused a blood bath, and to avenge it, two of the 
Sikh policemen assigned to protect Mrs. Ghandi gunned her down. 
</P>
<P>
 For purely political reasons, she also packed the voter lists in Assam and 
brought down Farooq Abdullah's non-Congress government in Kashmir. Both of 
those frontier areas, like Punjab, became homes to stubborn insurrections or 
roiling unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these are her creatures," Shourie contended. 
</P>
<P>
 If political beliefs and practices are encoded in chromosomes, Indira Raj 
should have turned out very differently. It is true that her father recognized 
autocratic tendencies in himself. But as the first prime minister of 
independent India, in 1947-64, Nehru took painstaking efforts to nurture its 
young institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember as a schoolchild being taken to the Lok Sabha (lower house of 
Parliament)," Shourie said. "I saw Panditji (Nehru) sitting there while 
opposition members spoke, carefully taking notes. After four hours, he got up, 
and patiently answered the questions of people who were obviously his 
intellectual inferiors." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 24, 1966, 20 months after her father's death, Gandhi became prime 
minister. She was 48. Her husband, Feroze Gandhi, no relation to India's most 
venerated activist for freedom and justice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, had died of a 
stroke in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Timid and retiring when she served as her widowed father's official hostess, 
Gandhi was tapped for the premiership by the party barons of Congress because 
she seemed docile. It turned out, she ended up outmaneuvering the "Syndicate" 
of provincial satraps, and made Congress into a political tool for herself and 
her sons Sanjay, who died in a 1980 crash of his stunt plane, and Rajiv, who 
became prime minister after her death. Rajiv was assassinated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no easier for Indians to be as neutral about Indira Gandhi than it is 
for Americans who lived through Watergate to be coolly analytical in assessing 
Richard Nixon. She is now blamed for much, but her career may also have 
coincided with trends inevitable in a young democracy and a diverse land such 
as India: centralization of power, the subordination of party to elected 
leaders and erosion of old ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, when the Old Guard ordered her kicked out of the Congress for 
"indiscipline," Gandhi was able to coax most Congress members of Parliament to 
side with her, splitting the party. The subordination of Congress to her person 
became so complete that today the party is known as Congress-I -- "I" as in 
Indira. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintessence of Indira Raj began at dawn on June 26, 1975. Gandhi had been 
found guilty by a judge of campaign malpractice, a verdict that meant she was 
supposed to be deprived of her seat in the Parliament. A grand alliance of 
non-Congress parties throughout India had also coalesced against Gandhi, 
blaming her for corruption, inflation and other ills, and demanding that she 
leave office. 
</P>
<P>
 She responded by arresting opposition leaders and having a state of emergency 
proclaimed that suspended civil rights, imposed censorship and led to the 
imprisonment without trial of about 150,000 critics or foes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those jailed in a crowded, fly-infested Delhi jail cell was noted 
journalist Kuldeep Nayar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the one who for the first time used government machinery for political 
purposes," Nayar asserted. "She bugged the opposition's telephones, used state 
intelligence to gather information for her own ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly, for reasons that are still debated, Gandhi lifted the Emergency 
in January, 1977, and called elections that not surprisingly were a disaster 
for her and her followers. The left-wing Janata Party ended three decades of 
uninterrupted Congress rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the "Indira wave" crested back to power after voters grew frustrated 
over the Janata government's squabbling and impotence. James Manor, editor of a 
study on the office of India's prime minister, was in Delhi for Gandhi's 
comeback, and got a jolting insight into her "deep personal need to rule." 
</P>
<P>
 "Minutes after learning that a huge election victory was assured, a 
Scandinavian journalist innocently asked her how it felt to be India's leader 
again," Manor recalled. "Visibly shaking with anger, Gandhi responded 
ferociously through clenched teeth, 'I have always been India's leader.' " 
Stormy Reign 
</P>
<P>
 1966 -- Indira Gandhi, daughter of independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, is 
sworn in as the first woman prime minister in India. 
</P>
<P>
 1969 -- In November, the Congress party splits, with Gandhi forming her own 
party -- the Congress-I. 
</P>
<P>
 1971 -- As Pakistan breaks apart, India recognizes its eastern wing as a new 
country, Bangladesh, and Pakistan attacks on India's western frontier. The 
Indian army marches into Bangladesh. On Dec. 17, the Pakistanis surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 1975 -- On July 26, a national emergency is proclaimed in India. For the first 
time since independence, press censorship is imposed, and thousands of Gandhi's 
foes are jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 1977 -- The emergency ends. Congress-I and Gandhi suffer humiliating defeats 
in general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 1980 -- The "Indira wave" returns as Gandhi and Congress-I sweep back to power 
in national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 1984 -- The army invades the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, to stamp out 
Sikh separatists. On Oct. 31, Gandhi is slain by her Sikh guards.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; CHILEAN FISH VILLAGE'S LATEST CATCH: TOURISTS; A FORMER 
WHALING CENTER IS REINVENTING ITSELF WITH RESORTS AND CAFES TO SERVE AN 
INCREASINGLY AFFLUENT NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From the 1940s to the late 1960s, whaling ships towed their prey to a factory 
here, where hundreds of workers butchered the giant mammals for oil and animal 
feed. Rancid whale grease drifted over the waters of Quintay's picturesque 
cove, and the rank odor of rottingflesh hung in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 When the whaling trade collapsed, the factory was closed, Quintay cleaned 
itself up and settled into the quiet routine of a small fishing village, where 
the catch of the day is measured in kilograms instead of tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now life in Quintay is changing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing waves of weekend and summertime tourists from Santiago, the Chilean 
capital, are giving the town an economic boost. With the construction of a 
$150-million resort nearby, the boost will become a boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism and the resort project are a reflection of surging affluence in this 
South American country, whose economy has expanded by 24% in the last three 
years. Growing numbers of Santiago residents can afford holidays and vacations 
on the coast, and as a result, traditional beach resorts are being overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds are looking for new places to go. Many are discovering Quintay, 
which is profiting handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year it has gotten better and better," said Alex Tronche, a fisherman 
whose family owns a restaurant on the Quintay cove. The lunchtime tables were 
filled on a recent Saturday. Next door, a new restaurant was under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 All over town, cafes, guest houses and grocery stores have been popping up. 
Construction on the new resort, called Santa Augusta de Quintay, has added 
steam to development. The project already employs 200 workers and is drawing a 
stream of visitors interested in buying resort homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the complex is to have 1,500 houses and condominium apartments and 
a 40-room luxury hotel. There will be polo grounds, tennis courts and an 
18-hole golf course. Streets are already being paved, and the first few 
buildings are going up. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being financed by a group of French investors, headed by Yves 
Buhagiar, who also have real estate and commercial interests in France, Tahiti, 
New Caledonia and French Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisherman Tronche, 28, knows that greater change will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The activity is going to be good," he predicted.  
</P>
<P>
 But he and others wonder whether all of the changes will be beneficial for 
Quintay, which now has about 800 permanent residents. For example, Tronche 
expects increased demand for labor to drive up wages and increase operating 
costs at his family's restaurant. Others worry that hordes of tourists will 
spoil the peaceful atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito Bernal, 64, remembers when the whaling station was operating at full tilt 
in the 1950s, employing more than 1,000 workers and butchering as many as 10 
whales a day. Blue, sperm and other whales were plentiful in this corner of the 
Pacific, and the Quintay whaling company hunted them with more than a dozen 
150-foot ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were brought from other areas to operate the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was badly paid and very filthy work," Bernal said. "They were always 
covered with grease and blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers lived in a company camp and added little to Quintay's livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists shunned the town because it was "very disagreeable, stinking. . . . 
There was whale grease all over the beach," Bernal recalled. Whale carcasses 
waiting to be butchered floated in the water, often decomposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a bench in the yard of his old wooden house, on a hillside above 
the craggy shoreline, Bernal recalled that the whales became increasingly 
scarce in the 1960s. Finally, the factory was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it is a massive jumble of crumbling concrete encrusted on the rocky 
shore south of town. In a corner of the old complex, however, there is new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santiago's Andres Bello National University installed a marine 
science laboratory there. Among the small lab's activities is a hatchery for 
seafood, such as scallops and sea urchins. Those products, exported by Chile at 
premium prices, have excellent commercial potential, said Gustavo Vega, who 
heads the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said the lab is cooperating with the Quintay fishermen's association, 
supplying material and technical advice for seafood farming. In one project, 
the fishermen have begun growing scallops in wire cages. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also established a 250,000-acre preserve for sea urchins, 
crabs and mollusks, called locos and lapas -- prized as delicacies in Asia. 
"We've already harvested locos , 110,000 of them in the first harvest last 
year," Bernal said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bernal and other fishermen have readily accepted such improvements in 
their way of life, some are ambivalent about changes that will come with the 
Santa Augusta resort. When the project paves the 17-mile dirt road that winds 
into Quintay from the nearest highway, day-trippers with lunch baskets are 
likely to pour into town, leaving litter but little money, Bernal fretted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, the upscale crowd of Santa Augusta itself should 
invigorate the local economy. Developers say the complex will eventually 
provide direct employment for about 500 people, and visitors and residents 
eating at Quintay restaurants and buying seafood products from the local 
fishermen will boost incomes of other townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the tourist complex, Quintay will be a wonder," Bernal said. "Where we 
get hurt is in our tranquillity."

NEXT STEP; NEW CONGRESS HAS AN IMAGE PROBLEM; MEXICANS HOPE POLITICS WILL BE 
MORE OPEN NOW, BUT OLD WAYS DIE HARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Congress that will be seated Thursday was expected to have a higher 
profile than previous legislatures, providing lively debate and generating 
proposals as part of the political diversity and democratic reform that 
political leaders had promised. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy of the last legislature, which officially retired Monday, is a 
reminder of the immense difference between Mexico's Congress being a forum for 
discussion and being a truly independent branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Congress was at center stage in the investigation into this 
country's second major assassination in six months -- the murder of Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu, who had been designated speaker of the new Chamber of Deputies. 
He was shot to death in what increasingly is being portrayed as a plot hatched 
by an outgoing committee chairman and his legislative cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general had asked lawmakers to revoke the immunity from 
prosecution of a congressman suspected in the case, a process that would have 
required a congressional inquiry into his conduct. A hearing was scheduled, and 
deputies prepared for the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the day before the hearing date, word came down from the headquarters of 
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI: Congress should bow out 
of the investigation, and the Chamber of Deputies should grant the suspected 
congressman a leave, thus removing his immunity without an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emotional four-hour debate, the Chamber of Deputies' most powerful 
committee seemed ready to rebel by rejecting that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my conscience as a legislator, and trying to be loyal to the man -- my 
boss, my friend, Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- I have decided to vote against the 
leave of absence," Florecio Salazar, a deputy from the slain man's home state 
of Guerrero, told the committee. After his speech, Salazar broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 20 minutes of arm-twisting by PRI congressional leaders during a 
recess, discipline was enforced. The committee relinquished the chamber's right 
to police its own members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, various PRI-istas were ready to vote 'no,' but they tightened the 
screws," said Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, chairman of the leftist opposition 
Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 That display of party discipline does not bode well for attempts to create an 
independent Congress with a PRI majority, analysts said. "This was an 
exhibition of the old system of party control -- crude and primitive," Munoz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformist members of the PRI acknowledge privately that they will have a hard 
time persuading party stalwarts to loosen control, even of their own members, 
much less allowing the opposition more say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they still plan to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make the Congress the forum for discussing the national agenda, 
instead of the Zocalo," the capital's main plaza and site of daily protests, 
said Oscar Levin Coppel, leader of the city's 40-member PRI delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI members and right-wing opposition National Action Party, or PAN, officials 
were less than eager to respond to requests for interviews about the new 
legislature. "All of the deputies are reluctant to talk," said one aide, who, 
like many of those interviewed, agreed to speak only on a pledge of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 That reticence contrasts sharply with the campaign rhetoric of the two parties 
in the weeks before the Aug. 21 federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was campaigning, Fernando Solana, a former Cabinet minister who is 
expected to be majority leader in the Senate, told reporters: "I believe the 
Congress will become a political space worthy of participation, that this will 
be a new Senate. If not, I would have had no interest in participating." 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of the need for a balance of powers, which a more vital legislature 
could provide. He even agreed with the blunt assessment of PAN Senate Minority 
Leader Gabriel Jimenez that "the executive branch has been the strongest to the 
detriment of the other branches of government." 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong presidential powers used to serve us well, but this is a different era 
in history," Solana said. "For the country to function well, we need a better 
balance of powers." 
</P>
<P>
 A PRI majority in Congress already made that possibility less likely, said Ana 
Lilia Cepeda, an incoming deputy for the Democratic Revolutionary Party. "We 
lost the opportunity to make the Chamber (of Deputies) a counterweight to the 
other branches of government," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But more devastating than the election is the loss of prestige the Congress 
has suffered in recent weeks, she said. As more attention focused on the 
Chamber of Deputies, more citizens became aware of legislative traditions such 
as "The Bronx." Deputies who sit in the section by that name come mainly to 
wave banners and shout down opposition speakers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens have even begun to sarcastically dub congressional representatives 
diputaditos, little deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, within the legislative crisis, many people insist that there are signs 
of hope. "It will be much more difficult for the PRI to get its proposals 
approved without creating a consensus," Cepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin Coppel said most PRI legislators want a new relationship of respect with 
the opposition. "Let's act like adults," he proposed. "Let's negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ruiz Massieu's killing demonstrated that there are divisions 
within the ruling party, observers agree, although PRI officials steadfastly 
deny this. "The decomposition of the PRI shows that they are not the tight bloc 
we had thought," Cepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz Ledo said the Democratic Revolutionary Party is talking with the other 
major political parties in Congress to try to reach a consensus on policy 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI activists said opposition deputies and senators will be offered the 
chairmanships of minor committees and officer's posts on the more important 
committees that the ruling party will still chair. 
</P>
<P>
 But a longtime Senate staffer cautioned that those who support opposition 
parties must be careful not to be tricked by the trappings of power-sharing if 
there is no substance. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the opposition parties must also bear a share of the blame for the 
weakness of the legislative branch, compared to the presidency. "The opposition 
is not struggling for control of political power, but for the destabilization 
of the PRI," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz vowed that, in this legislature, the changes will go beyond rhetoric. "A 
basic political consensus is the only way to create stability and govern the 
country," he said. "The time of the PRI governing alone is over. If the PRI 
accepts this, OK. If not, the confrontations will continue to the detriment of 
the nation."

ENVIRONMENT; FEWER WHALES POINT TO BIG PROBLEM ON ST. LAWRENCE; TOXIC CHEMICALS 
FROM THE GREAT LAKES ARE IMPAIRING THE MAMMALS' ABILITY TO REPRODUCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The young, one-ton beluga whale broke away from its herd and glided astern of 
the research boat, basking in the bubbles of the prop wash. Daniel Lefebvre, 
braced on the observation deck atop the cabin, lowered his clipboard for a 
moment and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, beluga Jacuzzi!" he called out to the others on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just the kind of playful, spontaneous, seemingly affectionate behavior 
that endears the sleek, ivory belugas to researchers and whale watchers alike 
here, where the St. Lawrence River meets the Saguenay River and widens toward 
the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But these belugas are in trouble. They are permeated with toxic chemicals 
washed down from the Great Lakes. The chemicals appear to have impaired the 
whales' ability to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 Large-scale hunting of St. Lawrence belugas ended in the 1950s, and there are 
no other known predators of the river whales. But in all the years since, the 
population has failed to increase, stabilizing at 500 to 700. A small cadre of 
marine researchers, led by biologists Pierre Beland and Robert Michaud, is 
trying to pin down the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the most likely explanation is the toxin levels in the whales. In 
autopsies of nearly 70 beluga carcasses taken from the St. Lawrence in the last 
12 years, Beland has recorded elevated levels of mercury, lead, selenium, PCBs, 
DDT and other chemicals. Lead concentrations in St. Lawrence belugas, for 
example, are about 10 times higher than those found in belugas that live in the 
Arctic. Beland has found as many as 700 parts per million of PCBs in St. 
Lawrence whales, compared to 5 parts per million in Arctic belugas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beland and Michaud believe that the chemicals have damaged the belugas' immune 
system, slowed reproductive rates and increased infant mortality. But they 
cannot yet prove this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask your average person and they'll say, 'Yes, if you put toxic chemicals in 
a whale, it will have an adverse effect on its health,' " Beland said. "But 
science doesn't operate that way, government doesn't operate that way. They 
need proof." 
</P>
<P>
 So the research team, financed on a shoestring and based in this Quebec 
hamlet, has embarked on a two-stage approach. Beland, assisted by Sylvain 
DeGuise and the University of Quebec at Montreal veterinary school, continues 
to perform autopsies on St. Lawrence belugas and compare his findings to what 
is known of healthy belugas in the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaud and the staff of whale researchers in Tadoussac are chronicling beluga 
behavior and social patterns, trying to find out how all the toxins got into 
the belugas and exploring other potential causes for the stable population. 
</P>
<P>
 That takes Michaud, Lefebvre and their volunteer assistants out on the river 
daily, weather permitting, from May to October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tadoussac area is a rich laboratory for whale research, rivaled by few 
other places in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The colliding flows of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers -- which contain 
salt water close to the ocean -- and the end of an underwater canyon reaching 
in from the Atlantic combine to make this a profitable feeding ground for 
seagoing mammals. Blue, fin, humpback and minke whales are regularly spotted, 
along with the beluga; a sperm whale will occasionally appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale-watching and tourism are principal summer industries, and the whale 
watch boats mainly cooperate with the scientists. This year, for example, they 
agreed to stay away from belugas so they would not influence the whales' 
behavior and interrupt the research. 
</P>
<P>
 Belugas are among the smallest whales, reaching lengths up to 16 feet and 
weights of a ton or more. They are pale gray in youth but turn a bright white 
as they mature. Their life span is about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most belugas live in Arctic regions, where they are subject to subsistence 
hunting by natives and to predatory polar bears and orcas. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such pressures, the Arctic population -- perhaps 100,000 in Canadian, 
Alaskan, Russian and Greenland waters -- is considered stronger than the St. 
Lawrence colony, declared endangered in 1983. Only recently, scientists 
determined that the St. Lawrence belugas live year-round in the Tadoussac area 
and do not migrate out to the Atlantic in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists associated with Michaud are doing research on blue and fin whales, 
as well, seeking to track their migrations and social structures. But the most 
promising research is on the belugas. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has not yet figured out the main source of the toxins, in part 
because the belugas have a wide and varied diet. The latest theory is that eels 
carrying high toxin levels pass on the chemicals when they are eaten by the 
belugas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about belugas is they present an enlarged picture of 
what's happening with other species," Michaud said over a beer at a waterfront 
tavern after a day on the research boat. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, by checking his findings against what is known about the blue 
whale, Beland has determined that belugas carry more toxins than blues. His 
theory is that the belugas' higher metabolism, different diet and longer living 
period in the St. Lawrence all contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying their findings so far, Michaud noted that "a stable population in 
this context is bad news, but at least we're not going down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 Beland, however, is concerned that an unexpected disease could reduce the 
whale herd beyond the point of regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something were to happen here, we could lose hundreds of whales in a few 
weeks, and then there wouldn't be a number large enough to maintain the 
population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is helping to finance the research. 
Other contributors are the World Wildlife Fund and individual donors through 
the project's "Adopt a Beluga" program. Funding, however, is a continual 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of money, but we have a lot of people who work cheap," 
Michaud said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquisitive and sociable, with turned-up mouths that give them the look of a 
perpetual smile, belugas have become favorite symbols for Canadian 
schoolchildren learning about endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 This "poster-child" status helps with fund-raising. But in the 12 years Beland 
has devoted to whale research, he has concluded that there is something more 
profound and perhaps unknowable in man's fascination with whales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know, what is their world like?" he said. "For us, the ocean is so 
cold and dark and mysterious, and whales live there. We hear them breathing, 
like they're gasping for air, and we rarely see all of them at once. They're a 
mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Beland is looking to move on to other research. The beluga project can be 
finished by others, with perhaps his occasional participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "After doing so many autopsies, you get sort of depressed, and when you see 
one of the whales you know on the table, it's even worse" he said. "Why can't 
we (humans) clean up our act?" The Beluga Whale

 FIRE FIGHT: Wednesday is the one-year anniversary of the arson fires that 
scorched more than 68,000 acres in Ventura County. . . . So what will National 
Park Service officials be doing? They'll be setting fires of their own. Park 
officials plan a controlled burn in Palo Comado Canyon near Thousand Oaks. . . 
. The idea is to reduce vegetation that could fuel another wildfire."This is 
about the time of the year we always do them," spokeswoman Catherine Saunders 
explained.

 QUICK CONNECTION: Hoping to tap into the growing cellular phone industry, 
Thousand Oaks-based GTE of California has snapped up contracts in recent months 
to provide new directory-assistance services (Valley Business, Page 3). . . . 
The services allow cellular phone subscribers to call 411 for a phone number, 
then the option of being directly connected with that number. "We're spending a 
great deal of effort to be the best out there," GTE spokesman Jay Burrell said.

 TIS THE SEASON: Flu season is coming, but flu shots won't be available at 
Ventura County health clinics until Nov. 1. . . . That's because the county's 
shipment of flu vaccine was held up, forcing the postponement. "It's the first 
time I believe that has happened," said Rosemarie Perez at Public Health. . . . 
For those who just can't wait, FHP Health Care is sponsoring flu clinics at 
private hospitals in Camarillo, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. Fred Alvarez

NHL GAMES LOST TO LABOR DISPUTE; LOCKOUT: LEAGUE CANCELS FOUR GAMES FOR EACH 
TEAM, REQUIRING CLUBS TO OFFER ONLY MINIMAL REFUNDS TO TICKETHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five days and 134 missed games into a labor dispute that shows no signs 
of a resolution, the NHL on Monday canceled four games on the schedule of each 
of its 26 teams. That means many clubs will be obligated to refund only minimal 
amounts of money immediately to ticket holders, while holding money paid for 
future games. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tersely worded news release, the league said the two home games and two 
road games to be lost by each team will not be announced until a starting date 
for the season can be determined. But a starting date cannot be determined 
until the league and its players come closer to agreeing on a new contract, and 
there is no indication that will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the players' 
association, had a surprise meeting Monday in Chicago -- their first of any 
substance in two weeks -- but they made no progress toward an agreement. It was 
learned that each delegation consisted of only four or five people, 
significantly smaller groups than attended previous sessions. Club owners, 
whose criticism of Goodenow fueled acrimony in recent talks, were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesman for the NHL Players Assn., Goodenow said the meeting 
was a general discussion that mentioned future talks but made no commitment to 
convene again. 
</P>
<P>
 The lockout, which has already cost players one paycheck, has begun to hit 
home with front-office employees as well. The Calgary Flames will lay off 11 
full-time staff members on Nov. 1, and all remaining full-time employees face 
20% pay cuts effective that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Those to be laid off work principally in concessions and maintenance, 
including the operators of the Olympic Saddledome sound system and score clock. 
The Flames are the first club to take such drastic measures. The Winnipeg Jets 
previously laid off a secretary-receptionist and one of their trainers. Other 
clubs are expected to cut back as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bettman and Goodenow left their plans on hold, players continued to 
look to other ways to play hockey during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Alexei Yashin, who led the Ottawa Senators in scoring last season and 
was the runner-up in rookie-of-the-year voting, became the first NHL contract 
player to sign with an International Hockey League club when he agreed to a 
one-year deal with the Las Vegas Thunder. His contract, which includes a clause 
allowing him to return to Ottawa when the NHL season begins, is believed to be 
worth more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of players heading for Europe also continued. Two Pittsburgh 
Penguins, right wing Jaromir Jagr and center Martin Straka, returned home to 
the Czech Republic to play for Kladno and Skoda Plzen, respectively. King 
center Robert Lang was also said to be seeking a place on a Czech team. Forward 
Dan Quinn of the Kings made his debut Sunday with Zug, of the Swiss Elite 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like most of the players returning to their European teams, it hasn't been 
for the sake of the economic benefits, it's for the opportunity to train under 
game conditions as opposed to sitting and waiting for the labor dispute to 
end," said Michael Barnett, Jagr's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri of the Kings has been in his native Finland since last week, 
playing for the Helsinki-based Jokerit team, and Penguin forward Shawn 
McEachern on Saturday became the first North American-born player to play in 
Europe during the lockout when he played for Kiekko-Espoo in Finland. Boston 
Bruin forward Ted Donato has reportedly agreed to play for TPS Turku in 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also confirmed that center Patrik Carnback of the Mighty Ducks agreed 
to spend the entire season with Frolunda of the Swedish League after that 
league voted not to accept NHL players who intend to return to North America 
when the lockout ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, he has a chance to play hockey and make a very nice living 
and I just don't think the NHL and the NHLPA are about to kiss and make up," 
said Neil Abbott, who represents Carnback. 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful that Yashin's contract will trigger a rush to the IHL, which 
continues to caution its clubs against signing locked-out NHL players. Las 
Vegas, which several weeks ago signed top NHL draft pick Radek Bonk away from 
Ottawa, is an independent club and has more financial resources than its 
rivals. IHL payrolls total about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL players jumping to other leagues must also pay steep insurance costs or 
ask their new clubs to bear that burden. Toronto Maple Leaf defenseman Dave 
Ellett is said to be negotiating with Wichita of the Central Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our teams have indicated they will not be pursuing those players," 
IHL spokesman Tim Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL spokesman Arthur Pincus would not say when further cancellations might be 
announced. Most NHL clubs have issued refund policies, which include returning 
money to holders of single-game tickets and crediting season-ticket accounts 
for canceled or rescheduled games and applying that credit to future tickets. 
Spokesmen for the Kings and Mighty Ducks said their previously announced 
policies had not been changed by Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL said it could not specify which games will be canceled because when 
the season begins, the schedule will be redrawn to accommodate divisional and 
conference play. Some games might be rescheduled, rather than canceled, to 
create a balanced schedule. Under normal circumstances, each home game would 
net $250,000-$750,000.

 Meanwhile, the league and the union are busy talking, but not to one another. 
The NHL is to meet today with off-ice officials, who are entitled to be paid 
through the first 45 days of a work stoppage. The union has called a meeting

NEWSWIRE: TWO PLAYERS SUE NBA OVER SALARY CAP REDUCTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two players sued the NBA on Monday, alleging the league's salary cap was 
artificially reduced this season by $2.75 million per team. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., by David Wood of the 
Golden State Warriors and Howard Eisley of the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends the NBA lowered the players' share of revenues by some 
$74 million, anticipating a contribution to the players' pre-pension benefit 
plan. But the plan was terminated by the union last June, so the suit alleges 
the money would improperly go back to team owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are seeking an increase in the salary cap of about $2.75 million 
per team. College Basketball

 Johnson said he "was under a university gag order and could not comment on the 
investigation."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders aren't exactly packing them in at the Coliseum, but the noisy 
Pirates' Pavilion, located behind the east end zone, has become the L.A. 
equivalent of the Dog Pound at Cleveland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was afraid it was going to be another long Sunday afternoon for Coach Art 
Shell when the scoreboard, listing Raider members of the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame, identified him as a former defensive tackle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What made the sacks of Atlanta's Jeff George unusual was that two of the three 
were recorded by cornerbacks, Albert Lewis and James Trapp. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth time in the last five years that the Rams have been 3-5, 
but it beats last year's 2-6. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Phil Simms might have gotten the New York Giants into the playoffs, something 
it doesn't appear Dave Brown or Kent Graham will be able to do. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Browns (6-1) will be tested for class on the road by Denver, 
Philadelphia and Kansas City three of the next four weekends. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis rookie Marshall Faulk, who caught eight passes for 127 yards and 
rushed 22 times for 86 yards against the Washington Redskins, is quickly 
becoming one of the most prolific double threats in the NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The UCLA-Stanford game at the Rose Bowl Saturday, which shaped up before the 
season as one of the most entertaining matchups on the Pacific 10 Conference 
schedule, has become so unappetizing that it won't even be televised live. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brad Otton, who played as a freshman last year at Weber State, is 
eligible this year at USC because transfers from Division I-AA to Division I-A 
schools don't have to sit out a season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who are off this week, hope they have the same success Nov. 5 
against Washington State at Pullman that they did earlier this season against 
Baylor after a week off that followed their trouncing at Penn State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The battle of the bands between USC and California at the Coliseum last 
Saturday was much more competitive than the football game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Bear quick- steppers were a refreshing change from the crassness of 
the Stanford band, which saluted O.J. Simpson during halftime the previous week 
at Palo Alto. . . . Many Cardinal fans booed the performance that set a new low 
for bad taste. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hail Columbia, which has a winning record and sometimes even scores more 
points than Chet Forte used to put up for the basketball team. . . .

 Kansas State quarterback Chad May transferred from Cal State Fullerton before 
the Titans dropped football, and Utah quarterback Mike McCoy transferred from 
Long Beach State after the 49ers quit the sport. . . .

 Maybe all second-year Clipper guard Terry Dehere needed was some playing 
time.He scored 43 points against Sacramento in an exhibition game last week. .

<P>
 Michael Jordan phoned George Raveling, one of the 1984 U.S. Olympic team 
assistant coaches, the other day to see how he was recuperating at USC 
University Hospital. . . .

 The longest trip of Rafael Ruelas' life, 32 hours from Los Angeles to Hong 
Kong and back, was for naught. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least he got to see the sights. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation of Ruelas' defense of the International Boxing Federation 
lightweight title against Billy Schwer and the rest of the four-bout, 
pay-per-view card was announced at 5:30 p.m. Saturday Hong Kong time, before 
the fighters were to weigh in for the show that was supposed to start at 10 
a.m. Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 British manager Barry Hearn withdrew his four fighters when promoter John Daly 
couldn't come up with the guaranteed purses. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This never would have happened in California, where promoters have to post 
bonds. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the ones who are hurt the most are the fighters," said Ruelas' 
manager, Dan Goossen. "It cost them eight weeks of wear and tear on their 
bodies." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum is trying to rearrange the Ruelas-Schwer bout for somewhere in the 
United States. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Carlo, 33, a last-minute substitute, knocked out Leon Spinks, 41, in the 
first round Saturday night at Washington, D.C. The former heavyweight champion 
never threw a punch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Riggleman's tenure with the San Diego Padres was terrific preparation for 
managing the Chicago Cubs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: Raul Mondesi becomes the third consecutive Dodger to be voted 
National League rookie of the year. Reaction: I hope Fred Claire doesn't think 
this is an assembly line. Brett Butler and Tim Wallach, who have filed for free 
agency, should be re-signed, no matter how appealing the prospects from 
Albuquerque and San Antonio are.

 Danny Kanell, who has struggled in Florida State's last two games, will 
continue as the starting quarterback, while redshirt freshman Thad Busby will 
be his backup, Coach Bobby Bowden said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell, who has been intercepted four times without throwing a touchdown pass 
in the last two games, still leads the Atlantic Coast Conference in total 
offense with an average of 241.5 yards.But Kanell missed open receivers in the 
end zone Saturday on two drives that resulted in no points.

 The ninth-ranked Seminoles (5-1, 5-0 ACC) will play No. 16 Duke (7-0, 4-0 ACC) 
on Saturday.

 Brook Berringer, who has been bothered by a partially collapsed lung, is

Saturday. Backup Matt Turman suffered an arm injury Saturday against Missouri. 
</P>
<P>

 Florida coach Steve Spurrier declined to name who will start at quarterback 
Saturday against Georgia, but players say he told them it will be Danny 
Wuerffel, not senior Terry Dean. . . . The Gator Bowl, which was passed over by 
the Bowl Alliance in August, struck a deal to get the runners-up from the 
Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big East for the game in Jacksonville, Fla. . 
. . Pittsburgh Coach Johnny Majors is urging injured running back Curtis Martin 
to return as a fifth-year senior next fall. Martin, who led all NCAA Division 
I-A rushers after a 251-yard season opener against Texas, hasn't played since 
suffering a severe ankle injury in Pitt's second game and isn't expected to 
return this season.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: LA VERNE (6-0) CLOSES IN ON ANOTHER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 La Verne's football team is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Leopards won the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 They took a major step toward their second consecutive title by beating 
Redlands on Saturday, 35-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, La Verne (6-0) is looking at a nine-game winning streak dating to last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it really nine?" La Verne Coach Rex Huigens said. "Well, that's great. We 
are doing a little better than expected. We're really not that deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, in a game that was expected to be a scrap between the SCIAC's 
toughest teams, La Verne won easily. The Leopards took advantage of six 
turnovers and led in the third quarter, 35-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Although junior quarterback Ryan Campuzano threw only six passes, he completed 
five, three for touchdowns. And he ran for two more. Campuzano usually throws 
more, but still leads the SCIAC in passing efficiency (153.7). Running back 
Darren MacLellan leads the team and the conference in rushing with 833 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, we would go into the game (against Redlands) thinking, 'We 
could win this game,' " Huigens said. "Now we know that if we play well, we 
have the talent to win. We feel we should win, so it's a little different 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne is ranked third in the NCAA West Region poll and 23rd in the Columbus 
Multimedia Division III poll. Wisconsin La Crosse is the top-ranked team in the 
West Region and Central College of Iowa is second. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands' loss leaves surprising Occidental as La Verne's main challenger. 
Occidental (6-0) showed that its record is no fluke when it beat Chapman two 
weeks ago, 30-20. Both La Verne and Occidental are 4-0 in SCIAC games. They 
will play in the season finale Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne plays Chapman this week in an intriguing matchup. Although Chapman is 
not ranked and is in its first year, the Panthers (4-1-1) were generally 
considered to have the best talent in the Southland before losing to 
Occidental. A victory over Chapman might improve La Verne's chances of moving 
up in the NCAA poll and thus qualifying for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing to me personally is conference play," Huigens said. 
"We might hold out a couple of players against Chapman to give them extra rest, 
but we want to win this game. Our ranking puts emphasis on this game for sure. 
When you have a chance to be ranked and go to the playoffs, that's obviously 
something you want. But personally, I think conference is the most important 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 An NCAA committee votes on which team will be invited to the playoffs. La 
Verne won the SCIAC title last year and was not invited but Huigens figures 
that if his team wins the SCIAC title again, the rankings and the playoffs 
might take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got off the blocks faster than I thought we would," Huigens said. "Our 
first (string) guys are playing really well. But we need to stay healthy." 
</P>

 All five of the Westmont and Azusa Pacific fall sports teams have been ranked 
in the NAIA top-25 polls at the same time this season. It is the second 
consecutive fall for Westmont and the first for Azusa Pacific that it has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 For Azusa Pacific, the women's volleyball team (19-6) is No. 6 and the men's 
cross-country team is No. 3 -- the highest rankings ever for both. The women's 
cross-country team is No. 11, the women's soccer team (10-4-1) is No. 19 and 
the men's soccer team is No. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 All five of Westmont's teams were ranked until Monday, when the Westmont 
women's volleyball team (17-13) dropped out of the top 25. But the four other 
teams remain.  
</P>
<P>
 The Westmont men's soccer team (13-3) is ranked third in the nation and has 
been in the top 25 every week of the season. Westmont has been ranked since 
midway through the 1984 season and has won six Golden State Athletic Conference 
titles in that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont's men's cross-country team is No. 12, the women's cross-country team 
is 13th and the women's soccer team (11-4-2) is 10th. College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Los Angeles volleyball team, ranked second in the nation, has 
been less than dominant since losing to top-ranked Bakersfield two weeks ago. 
Cal State L.A. followed that up by beating Cal State San Bernardino, but then 
was upset by No. 20 UC Riverside. On Friday, No. 19 Cal Poly Pomona extended 
the match to four games before the Golden Eagles won. The new poll comes out 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Fleischaker was named the new softball coach at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. She was an assistant at Nevada Las Vegas last season and the head coach 
at Whittier two years ago, when the Poets finished 14-19. Fleischaker replaces 
Estela Gutierrez, who left after two years to work in the sporting goods 
industry. . . . Cal State Bakersfield's men's basketball team, two-time 
defending NCAA champion, will open practice with three new assistant coaches: 
Steve Barnes, Wade Green and Todd Lee. They replace three coaches who left: 
Erin Vines, Don Verlin and Henry Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 When Azusa Pacific's football team lost to Chapman, 59-18, on Oct. 8, it was 
the worst defeat in school history.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; NOT LISTENING TO AGENTS, EDWARDS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone has been ringing frequently at Donnie Edwards' apartment in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, a junior linebacker, has stood out in UCLA's miserable season, 
perhaps never as much as Saturday, when he had 16 tackles -- six for losses -- 
at Arizona, and there are agents who would like to negotiate an NFL contract 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really listening, because I'm more concerned about playing now and 
winning," said Edwards, who will graduate in the winter and has applied to 
graduate school with the idea of playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will send a letter to the NFL at season's end, inquiring about his 
chances in the 1995 draft. It's something almost every top junior, including 
UCLA tackle Jonathan Ogden, will do. 
</P>
<P>
 At 220 pounds, Edwards is light for an NFL linebacker, but that's something 
that can change with money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only get one meal a day at the training table, and I have to budget my 
money for my apartment and phone bill," he said. "Sometimes I don't eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Edwards played at 230 pounds, but he says he feels more 
comfortable a little lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 He likens his situation to that of the Rams' Roman Phifer, who also was 
considered light when he was playing with the Bruins.

 "I talk to him a lot, and I think I'm a lot like him," Edwards said.

 Coach Terry Donahue said he expects wide receiver J.J. Stokes to be ready to 
start against Stanford on Saturday at the Rose Bowl. "I think he will have a 
full week of practice, and I don't think he's far away from being ready," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes played Saturday at Arizona, catching one pass for 18 yards, after 
sitting out all but one half of one game since being injured in the season 
opener against Tennessee. Wide receiver Bryan Adams is expected to sit out 
Saturday's game after suffering a separated left shoulder while making a catch 
at Arizona. JIM HODGES

EAGLES' BARNETT PROVES READY FOR PRIME TIME; INTERCONFERENCE: PHILADELPHIA 
RECEIVER HAS FIVE CATCHES FOR 187 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN IN THE 21-6 VICTORY 
OVER OILERS.

 Fred Barnett hasn't done much for the Philadelphia Eagles this season -- 
except on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, returning from a knee injury that cost him the last 12 games of last 
season, caught five passes for 187 yards and a touchdown to lead the Eagles to 
a 21-6 victory over the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's any doubt about Fred Barnett coming back, he's certainly back," 
Eagle Coach Rich Kotite said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Barnett's second exceptional Monday night performance this season. On 
Sept. 12 against the Chicago Bears, he caught eight passes for 102 yards. In 
the Eagles' five other games, Barnett has 17 catches for 257 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the blitzing they do, Calvin (Williams) and I were praying we'd have 
a big game," Barnett said. "I was hoping I'd get a lot of balls thrown my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham completed 13 of 24 passes for 310 yards and two touchdowns 
as the Eagles (5-2) stayed within a game of first-place Dallas in the NFC East 
and handed the Oilers (1-6) their third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep working hard to get over this thing," Oiler Coach Jack Pardee 
said. "We're struggling and we know we can get out of it. There's no magical 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Carlson, who has sat out three games this season with a shoulder injury, 
returned to start at quarterback for the Oilers, but left the game at the start 
of the fourth quarter. Sacked twice, he completed 11 of 22 passes for 164 yards 
with a fumble and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 The interception, which came in the second quarter, was costly. Eric Allen 
stepped in front of a pass intended for Haywood Jeffires at the Houston 31 and 
returned it 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, rookie running back Charlie Garner scored a one-yard 
touchdown that put Philadelphia ahead, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to play good defensively and good offensively and you have to 
protect the ball," Pardee said. "We did two of the three. We need to do a 
better job of protecting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Eagles leading 14-6, Billy Joe Tolliver replaced Carlson and led the 
Oilers on a 72-yard drive in the fourth quarter, but Gary Brown fumbled a toss, 
and the ball was recovered by Philadelphia's Britt Hager at the Oiler five. 
</P>
<P>
 James Joseph closed out the scoring for the Eagles on a 35-yard pass from 
Cunningham with 2:18 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett had three catches of more than 50 yards, including the 53-yarder for 
the touchdown that increased the lead to 14-6 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett flew past Cris Dishman, made the catch at the 13, avoided the 
defensive back's arm tackle and spun into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The play made up for an earlier 53-yard reception that ended with Dishman 
stripping the ball from Barnett and returning the fumble 29 yards. Barnett also 
had a 36-yard catch called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia reached the Houston one midway through the second quarter, but, 
on fourth down, Cunningham's pass to Brian O'Neal in the end zone went off his 
fingertips.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL FINDS JENKINS FITS THE MOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell kept scratching his head. He liked what he saw, but he 
couldn't understand why nobody else did. A Hall of Fame offensive lineman, 
Shell is understandably confident he can spot talent at that position.And he 
thought he had spotted it in Robert Jenkins, a 6-5, 295-pound former UCLA Bruin 
who had spent eight years with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember liking him coming out of college," Shell said. "I always thought 
he was a good lineman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders signed Jenkins before training camp last summer and brought him to 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about two days," Shell said, "I (told myself), there's something wrong. 
(Why is) this guy out in the streets? We happened upon him. Something has got 
to be wrong because he was that good in training camp as far as I was 
concerned. He showed a lot of quality with his feet. And the thing that 
surprised me was his strength, his ability to really strike somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell wasn't ready to move Jenkins ahead of a proven veteran such as Gerald 
Perry, but when Perry suffered a broken bone above his right ankle a week ago, 
Shell didn't hesitate to use Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to find quality linemen," Shell said. "Everybody's looking for 
them. We needed one and he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins' play helped limit the Falcons to two sacks and helped tailback Harvey 
Williams become the first Raider back in two years to rush for at least 100 
yards, gaining 107. STEVE SPRINGER

MEASURE TO SLOW GROWTH QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT; VENTURA: 'SAVE THE GREENBELT' 
INITIATIVE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A CITYWIDE VOTE TO BUILD ON PROTECTED FARMLAND, 
WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST IN NOVEMBER, 1995. PETITION DRIVE NETTED ABOUT 7,000 
VALID SIGNATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura's "Save the Greenbelt" initiative -- which would prohibit development 
of protected farmland without voter approval -- has qualified for the November, 
1995, ballot, Ventura's city clerk said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's supporters submitted 8,900 signatures, about 7,000 of which were 
valid, meaning they belonged to registered Ventura voters, City Clerk Barbara 
Kam said. The measure only needed about 5,800 valid signatures to qualify for 
next year's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more relieved than excited," said Sheri Vincent, an eastside homeowner 
who poured her free time this spring and summer into organizing a petition 
drive aimed at getting the initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent acknowledged that much of her effort lay ahead in the campaign to 
persuade residents to vote for the measure. But like most of those involved in 
the signature-gathering effort, Vincent is a political novice who learns as she 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what comes next," she said. "We've never done this before."  
</P>
<P>
 Some council members are already greeting the initiative with skepticism, 
concerned that if it passes they will have trouble planning development for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't trust the council, do they continue trying to hamper the 
council, or do you just elect a new council?" asked Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson. "That's the way it's always been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said a successful initiative would mean that even a decision to build a 
regional park in the greenbelt would have to go to a citywide vote. Not only 
would that cause significant delays in the planning process, he said, but it 
would also cost the city money to mount campaigns in favor of various 
development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive grew out of fiery neighborhood opposition to a developer's 
proposal to build more than 400 homes on a city-owned, 87-acre lemon orchard. 
In exchange, the developer, Ron Hertel, would have donated 94 acres to the city 
for use as a regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the orchard and the proposed parkland belong to a belt of land winding 
across eastside Ventura, which the council has promised will remain farmland 
until 2010. Developers can only build on this land if the council amends the 
city's Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of heated debate, during which eastside preservationists traded 
verbal darts with sports and parks boosters, the council declined to vote on 
the project and it died at a late August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 By that point, however, the initiative had developed a life of its own. The 
residents working on the petition drive said they wanted to ensure that the 
council never builds on land that it has pledged to preserve without the 
voters' consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fulton, a Ventura resident who edits a statewide planning newsletter, 
said he can sympathize with the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the existence of the Comprehensive Plan, Fulton said council members 
seem to regard each new project separately, with little or no attempt to make 
it part of a cohesive planning effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But however flawed the system, he said, segregating some planning decisions 
out for a vote while leaving others up to the council's discretion makes for a 
schizophrenic public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's motivating this is the parochial concerns of people in one 
neighborhood who don't want their trees cut down," he said. "I sympathize with 
them, but I don't think that's a good reason for city planning."

THORNTON MURDER CASE IN FINAL PHASE OF JURY SELECTION; COURTS: LAWYERS EXPECT 
PANEL TO BE SEATED THIS WEEK IN THE TRIAL OF THOUSAND OAKS MAN ACCUSED OF 
KILLING WESTLAKE WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers on Monday began the final phase of jury selection in the death-penalty 
trial of a Thousand Oaks man charged with slaying Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of 12 jurors, along with four alternates, is expected to be seated 
this week, attorneys said, setting the stage for the trial of 20-year-old Mark 
Scott Thornton to begin next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 When jury selection began four weeks ago, 336 jurors were called for duty. By 
Monday, only 65 remained -- the others having been dismissed either because of 
economic hardship or bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances from the defense and the prosecution that the jury will be 
narrowed to its final version this week, the selection process moved slowly 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, only three of the 65 jurors had been bumped from the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three who were dismissed, two women told Superior Court Judge Charles 
R. McGrath that they could no longer commit time to the case. One of them said 
she needed to be home to care for her 102-year-old mother and her husband, who 
is 80. A third juror was excused after saying she might sympathize with the 
defendant because her own teen-age son is seeing a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can be a good juror at this time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority of jurors said they would have no problem serving in the 
trial, expected to last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that did not stop the defense from trying to determine the veracity of 
those claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson quizzed each juror about his or her 
views on learning disabilities and alcoholism. The defense is expected to say 
that Thornton is not totally responsible for his actions because he was a 
special-education student who was abused and neglected by his alcoholic father, 
who is now deceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also questioned jurors about past jury service, their family 
backgrounds, their personality traits and their views toward psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher, Thornton's second lawyer, wanted to 
know why one woman suggested on a jury survey that criminal defendants seem to 
have too many rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the woman first said that "I think everybody should get a fair 
shake," she added that she does believe that defendants "are protected as far 
as I can see from Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the woman said, victims appear to be left to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the jurors seemed bored by the lack of progress. Some rested their 
heads on their hands in the courtroom. Others moved impatiently in their 
chairs. One woman dozed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Things livened somewhat when Olson was quizzing one elderly man, who did not 
seem to be challenged by the defense attorney's questions. "I have a very low 
tolerance for conversations of little merit," the man told the attorney as 
laughter erupted throughout the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting moment came when a relatively young woman was asked if she 
might be intimidated during deliberations by her older fellow jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who wore jeans, sweater and hoop earrings, said she considers 
herself to be "strong-minded" and would have no difficulty defending her views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that they would treat me like they would want to be treated," 
she said.

SENTENCED TO BASIC BLACK, JUDGES FIND CHATSWORTH FIRM DE RIGUEUR ; COURTS: 
ACADEMIC CHOIR APPAREL OUTFITS JURISTS' ROBES WITH EVERYTHING FROM VELVET TRIM 
TO SECRET GUN POCKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The most famous judge in America, Lance A. Ito, got his there. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the judge who used to be the most famous guy on the bench, Joseph 
Wapner of "People's Court" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John Ouderkirk, who presided over the Reginald O. Denny beating trial, 
hangs on to his, a gift from when he first took the bench. Judge Stanley 
Weisberg, in charge of the Menendez brothers murder trial, wears his 
faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, such as Judge Judith Chirlin, who presided over the "Boxing Helena" 
case involving actress Kim Basinger, the verdict is in on the robes produced by 
Academic Choir Apparel: they're black and they're beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth-based, family-owned business is the leading couturier to 
California's newest class of celebrities, the judicial glitterati. Polyester or 
silk, monogrammed or plain, elbow patches or a secret pocket for a gun -- if a 
judge wants it, Michael and Evelyn Cronan's plant delivers. 
</P>
<P>
 They dominate a side of the judge business that's highly visible and yet a 
virtual afterthought -- the business of robes, the uniform that every 
California judge must, by law, wear. It's a business rich in lore and in 
history, and a company notable for innovation -- such as it is, the subject 
being robes. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, conceded Michael Cronan, president of Academic Choir, there's only 
one thing lacking: "The garment industry is about fashion. We're not fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it's about law and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Current state law says that a judge must wear a robe in open court and that it 
must be black, reach to the knees and have long sleeves. It also says judges 
must buy the robes at their own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Because judges purchase their own robes, they tend to become attached to them. 
And perhaps because judges are given to frugality, they tend to keep their 
robes a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin has had hers for nine years, since she took the bench. Robert Letteau, 
who is the supervising judge of the Van Nuys Superior Court, is going on 13 
years. "It's starting to shred," Letteau said. "I'm starting to feel insecure 
as I take the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An Academic Choir robe costs $127 to $413, depending on the fabric and style. 
Silk costs more; polyester less. The most popular model, a lightweight 
polyester the company calls Coupe de Ville, runs $147 for Style 366, which 
features fully lined, coat-like sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapered sleeves, said Evelyn Cronan, are an Academic Choir innovation, 
thought up by her father, Harry Stanley, who founded the company in 1946. 
Judges complained that the traditional but pouffy bell sleeves were always 
getting in the way, she said, so her dad slimmed down the sleeves and found 
customers receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, she said, Stanley rode the circuit, traveling the state with 
his wares. He would show up in the back of a courtroom, and that was that -- 
the judge would call a halt to the proceedings and summon all the other judges. 
"That's all he'd have to do," Evelyn Cronan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business grew by word of mouth, she said, and now the company sells 700 or 800 
judicial robes a year, mostly in California. That accounts for about 10% of the 
firm's revenues; the bulk of business is robes for graduation and for church 
and school choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's principal California rival, Ireland Needlecraft of Glendale, 
just changed hands and is temporarily out of production. New owner Bob Stotts 
said he hopes to be back in business by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, judges order robes by mail. Academic Choir graciously provides a 
five-foot-long tape-measure and gladly accommodates those judges who find that 
the sedentary nature of the law has left them portly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some real big ones," Michael Cronan said. "We just make them bigger 
across the front, sew in some extra panels, some extra material in back." 
</P>
<P>
 For the best fit, the company inquires whether a judge's shoulders are 
straight, have an average slope or are "very sloped." 
</P>
<P>
 Female judges can opt for Style 366W. The brochure boasts that it allows a 
"woman to look like a woman while retaining the dignity of the office," with 
piping along the neckline and sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is a difference between girl robes and boy robes," Chirlin said. 
"The difference is the pockets. Girls have pockets; boy robes have slits so 
guys can reach in their (pants) pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 At no cost, Academic Choir will monogram the inside of the robe, above the 
tag, usually with a judge's initials. Extra are elbow patches ($6), an eyeglass 
pocket (also $6), an added pocket ($5) or, for the gloriously vain, a velvet 
front ($85). 
</P>
<P>
 The Cronans also welcome special orders. A judge in "one of the Dakotas, North 
or South, I don't remember," ordered a robe made from denim, Michael Cronan 
said. Another judge "from back East somewhere" wanted one in green and 
embroidered with a shamrock. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles judge used to order pink robes. And a judge from Riverside 
County really did order a pocket for a concealed gun. "It was a Beretta," 
Michael Cronan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company fashioned a special pocket inside the robe and lined it with an 
especially smooth fabric so that the judge could whip the gun out with ease, 
Cronan said. "That's what he asked for and that's what we gave him," he said. 
"It was a fairly low-cost option. It was under $20." 
</P>
<P>
 That order, he said, led him to think that a robe lined with bulletproof 
Kevlar could be a big seller. "But it would take a lot of research to get it 
going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust into the line of fire, new judges find that wearing a robe takes some 
getting used to. Cecil Mills, the supervising judge of Los Angeles County's 
criminal courts, recalled one of his first days on the bench 19 years ago, with 
a robe that dangled well down toward his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to get up from the bench and the thing was laying there under my 
chair," Mills said. "As I stood up, it pulled me right down on the floor. It's 
kind of embarrassing to have to climb up from under the bench, to announce that 
you've tripped over your dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced judges highly recommend snaps down the front instead of zippers. 
"Zippers are bad," Chirlin said. "For a woman, you can get your blouse caught. 
Guys get their ties caught." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truly savvy take it even a step further. Letteau said his wife sewed 
Velcro straps onto the front of his robe: "So now, as I take off my Superman 
robe I'm in and out in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, said Irwin Nebron, who retired a few weeks ago from the Los Angeles 
Superior Court after nearly 29 years on the bench, one San Diego judge many 
years back really did think his robe turned him into Batman. 
</P>
<P>
 Flapping his arms and billowing about in the robe, the judge would walk down 
the courthouse halls, crying out, "I'm Batman! I'm Batman!" Nebron added: "He 
was removed from office." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, there's the one about the judge in Sacramento who suffered a 
heart attack on a baking-hot summer day in the Central Valley. The paramedics 
found he had nothing on underneath. "This is all part of robe lore," Nebron 
said.

 As is the "best April Fool's joke you can play on a judge, to sew the sleeves 
shut," according to San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell. "You're 
rushing out into court and you're trying to get your arms through and you 
can't. That happened to me once." 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell still has that same robe -- which is no surprise to the Cronans. 
"It's a work uniform," Evelyn Cronan said. "But it gets to be like an old 
bathrobe. It's comfortable. They don't want to part with it. It gets to be 
personal. Even if it may not be high fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, more or less, was the message from Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 He allowed that his robe has his initials inside it, but passed along the word 
through another judge that he thought "he'd hold off on any further comment 
until Mr. Blackwell," the self-appointed fashion snob, "called to inquire about 
his robe."

CHIPPENDALE CLUB OWNER KILLS HIMSELF; CRIME: SOMEN BANERJEE, FOUNDER OF THE 
MALE-STRIPPER NIGHTSPOT, IS FOUND DEAD IN HIS CELL. HE WAS TO BE SENTENCED IN 
THE MURDER-FOR-HIRE OF HIS FORMER BUSINESS PARTNER.

 A Playa del Rey man who owned Chippendale's -- the male strip club -- 
committed suicide in a Downtown jail cell early Monday morning, just hours 
before he was scheduled to be sentenced to a lengthy prison term for the 
murder-for-hire of his former business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal prison spokesman said that correctional officers found Somen (Steve) 
Banerjee lying dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center shortly 
before 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Banerjee tied a piece of bedsheet around his neck, placed it on a 
wall-mounted jacket hanger and pulled down on it while he kneeled, causing the 
flow of air to be cut off; that caused his death," said Reonard McFadden, 
executive to the warden at the detention center. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden said that although Banerjee, 47, had been suffering from depression, 
there was no hint that he might take his own life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banerjee, like every other inmate, had been interviewed by a staff 
psychologist. There was no indication he was suicidal," McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee had been held at the detention center since Sept. 2, 1993, the day he 
was arrested and charged with conspiring to kill three of his former business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, a federal prosecutor, arguing that Banerjee should not be 
released on bail, said to a federal magistrate-judge that Banerjee had told an 
informant that he planned "to leave the country or kill himself" if 
apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles expanded the charges, 
indicting Banerjee for orchestrating the 1987 murder of Nick De Noia, an 
award-winning television director who was once the choreographer for 
Chippendale's touring dance company. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury also charged Banerjee with racketeering and arson. The charges 
followed a lengthy investigation by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, Banerjee pleaded guilty in federal court to the racketeering 
charge, which included arranging DeNoia's murder and attempted arson. Banerjee 
also agreed to forfeit his interest in Chippendale's parent company, Easebe 
Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the plea bargain, Banerjee was to be sentenced to 26 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief hearing Monday afternoon, federal prosecutor Steven D. Clymer 
told Judge William Rea that Banerjee had been found dead in his cell and that 
the FBI was conducting an investigation into his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee's defense lawyer, Barry Tarlow, asked that the prosecution against 
his former client be "abated," a term that could prove significant to 
Banerjee's widow. Tarlow said that since Banerjee was dead, the entire case 
against him is over, meaning that the government would not be able to seize any 
of his assets, thus frustrating part of the plea bargain agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clymer said he would need to study federal law before responding. Another 
hearing is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said a note in an Indian language was found in Banerjee's cell 
and that FBI agents were attempting to have it translated.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Bombay, Banerjee bought a failing bar, Destiny II, on Overland 
Avenue on the Westside in 1975. Four years later, he renamed it Chippendale's 
and launched "Male Exotic Dance Night for Ladies Only." 
</P>
<P>
 The club began drawing overflow crowds of women, who for a $20 admission could 
ogle and kiss sweaty, tanned, well-muscled young men in G-strings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of his success, Banerjee had clubs in New York, Dallas and 
Denver that spawned a plethora of imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee's concern about those competitors led to three arson attempts, 
according to the government's sentencing memorandum. The memorandum states that 
two of the attempts led to minor damage at two competitor bars and that 
Banerjee abandoned plans to torch a third establishment after being told it 
would be difficult to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 After DeNoia moved to New York in 1984 to set up a Chippendale's show there, 
he and Banerjee had a series of disputes that led to DeNoia's murder, 
prosecutors say. A sentencing memorandum states that Banerjee induced Augustine 
Colon, a friend who had been involved in the arson, to murder DeNoia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Colon refused to commit the murder, Banerjee harassed and threatened him 
in an effort to convince Colon to commit the murder," the memo states. "Among 
other tactics, Banerjee showed Colon a notice that he had received from the 
government showing that he had been intercepted on a wiretap related to an 
organized crime investigation. Banerjee told Colon that he had organized-crime 
contacts and would have Colon killed if he did not commit the murder."

PROP. 187 FUELS A NEW CAMPUS ACTIVISM; EDUCATION: FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS, 
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN WALKING OUT OF SCHOOL TO PROTEST THE 
ANTI-ILLEGAL-IMMIGRATION MEASURE. NOT SINCE THE LATE 1960S HAS AN ISSUE SO 
COALESCED LATINO YOUTHS.

 Motivated by rage and adrenaline and, yes, the desire to cut class, students 
throughout Los Angeles County have been walking out of schools by the hundreds 
during the past two weeks, protesting Proposition 187, a ballot measure they 
perceive as disrespectful of their very genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning at Paramount High School, students were filled with elation and 
gossip from Friday's march against the controversial immigration initiative. 
The march prompted the strongest law enforcement response so far to the 
uprisings: stingball grenades thrown by sheriff's deputies into a crowd of 
about 450 teen-agers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during (morning) assembly that we all just walked out," junior Martin 
Hidalgo recalled, smiling at the fresh memory. "People were talking about it 
(walking out) in the back of the room and then we just went. . . . It was all 
Latinos. We were all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the East Los Angeles "blowouts" of 1968, when more than 1,000 
students marched from their classrooms to expose substandard education, has an 
issue so coalesced local Latino students. Under Proposition 187, undocumented 
students would no longer qualify for a free public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young students are very moralistic; they deal in what is fair," said Rudy 
Acuna, professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge. "This proposition 
is clear-cut racism to them, and it's clear-cut that it's about them too." 
</P>
<P>
 The student protests continued Monday at several campuses, including Reseda 
High School, where administrators and teachers joined about 200 students in an 
early morning march, provided a bullhorn, then held a lunchtime debate on the 
anti-illegal-immigration measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda as at other schools, Latinos were joined by a few students of other 
races and ethnicities who shared their concerns about the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at Marshall Fundamental Secondary School in Pasadena, Armenian 
immigrant Serob Zetilyn, 16, was among 200 students who walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of friends who will have to quit school if Proposition 187 
passes because they're illegal," Zetilyn said. "Plus classes will be smaller 
and some teachers will get fired. I want people to know that students disagree 
with this." 
</P>
<P>
 From Pasadena to Long Beach, Reseda to South Gate, some who have walked out 
are openly proud of their newfound activism while others fear recrimination 
from school administrators. But most share a basic understanding of why they so 
vehemently oppose the measure that would limit illegal immigrants' access to 
public services -- including education -- and why they are willing to speak 
with their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the marchers say, is an insult to their parents, their 
ancestors, their friends and neighbors. This, they say, opens the door to 
discrimination against them just because they are brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is mostly a Latino school and everyone's proud of their heritage -- they 
want to defend it," said Vicky Velasco, a 15-year-old sophomore at Paramount, 
where, during the morning footrace to class, teen-age chatter slips fluidly 
between English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Park High School, Stephanie Bernal and her friends are surprised 
to find themselves gathering before class and during lunch breaks to discuss 
such heavy topics as politics, lobbying and social activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal likes to call herself a "mixed chocolate swirl." Half Latino, half 
Anglo, she has had only fleeting and apolitical contact with Mexico -- the land 
of her mother's family. But now Bernal, a senior, is among those organizing her 
school's anti-187 movement and reveling in her ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're worried about what happens if it (Proposition 187) passes, 
it feels great right now just to be doing something about it," said Bernal, who 
helped plan four recent walkouts, the most recent last Thursday. "When we get 
together to talk about it, we speak Spanish and just feel good about being 
Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 At a variety of campuses, student plans already are in the works to continue 
the protests -- which began in Pomona Oct. 12 -- during the weeks before the 
vote and to stage a student sickout before the Nov. 8 election.  
</P>
<P>
 Who is behind the efforts remains in dispute, and accounts vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Student recollections of the days and incidents leading up to the walkouts are 
vague -- someone told them to leave when the tardy bell rang; their friend said 
it would happen at the start of lunch; they heard it started with a guy from 
another school who has a car; they saw people walking and they went along. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespeople for the formal anti-187 campaign have denied responsibility for 
the student actions or, for that matter, the huge Oct. 16 protest march by 
70,000 people through Downtown Los Angeles. Several of the students interviewed 
Monday attended the Downtown march and said it was there that they first heard 
people advocating school walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they decided to act after watching television, both because of 
news reports of marches from other schools and because of a pro-187 
advertisement that students refer to simply as "that commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which shows people scurrying across the California-Mexico border at 
night, caused Latinos at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale to angrily plan a 
walkout last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insulting," said sophomore Jorge Higareda. "They show Mexicans, but they 
don't show Asians coming over in boats or anybody else. It's like we're the 
only ones coming here. And then they call us illegal. Well, everybody here is 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leuzinger students did not even get out the door. Campus security guards 
rounded up the 20 organizers before they could rally others and took them 
straight to Principal Sonja Davis' office. Davis called in the district 
superintendent and a district mediation specialist, and the three talked with 
the students for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they cannot condone cutting classes, many school administrators and 
teachers also philosophically oppose the ballot measure, which, if enforced, 
would require them to report suspected illegal students and their parents to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the Tomas Rivera Center of superintendents of 50 districts 
with large Latino student populations found that 71% perceived no potential 
benefits in Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of enthusiasm for the measure may account for the widely divergent 
school responses to the walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 When about 200 teen-agers from Pasadena High School charged off campus last 
Thursday, carrying banners that said "No on 187" and waving Mexican flags, they 
were accompanied by the district superintendent, Vera Vignes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the students had walked five miles to Pasadena's Civic Center, Vignes 
ordered three school buses to take them back to campus, where administrators 
held a "cool-down" session in the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the walkout in Pomona two weeks ago -- by 100 students from 
Ganesha High School who were protesting a variety of issues including 
Proposition 187 -- resulted in about 70 suspensions for what an assistant 
superintendent called unsafe and dangerous behavior in defiance of authority, 
including scrambling up fences to get off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is one of the rare issues on which many of the teen-age 
opponents seem to be in sync with their parents. Parents have actually joined 
in some of the marches, while others have encouraged their children to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was something trivial, I would not want them to do it," said the 
father of two East Whittier Middle School students, where a handful of students 
walked out last week. "But we told them if they really felt strongly, that we 
would be supportive if they walked out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 The father asked not to be named for fear that school administrators would 
punish his children. 
</P>

SUSPECTED KILLER OF OFFICER COMMITTED SUICIDE; INVESTIGATION: LAPD SPOKESMAN 
SAYS AUTOPSY REVEALS THAT THE MAN SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD MOMENTS AFTER HE WAS 
WOUNDED IN THE NECK BY A POLICE RIFLE SHOT. 
</P>

<P>
 A man suspected of murdering a Los Angeles police officer died from a 
self-inflicted pistol shot, not -- as originally thought -- from the wound he 
received seconds earlier from police rifle fire during a standoff at a 
Hollywood motel, an LAPD spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy performed Monday showed that the fatal head wound suffered Sunday 
by Manuel Vargas Perez, the suspected killer of Los Angeles Police Officer 
Charles D. Heim, came from his own .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun, 
according to Capt. Bruce Hagerty, an LAPD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams told reporters that a 
police rifle shot fatally wounded the 26-year-old gang member. Williams had 
made no mention of a second wound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officers stormed Perez's room at the Lucky 7 Motor Inn on Sunset Boulevard "a 
matter of seconds" after their rifle shot hit him in the throat and a stun 
grenade hurled toward his door exploded near the doorway, Hagerty said. He said 
the officer then heard a third blast -- presumably from Perez's pistol -- and 
moments later, found his sprawled body. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not immediately realize he had shot himself because there was so 
much blood," said Hagerty, who saw Perez's body. "The head was very bloody. It 
was not discernible there was more than one wound." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers did not closely examine the body Sunday, Hagerty said. He said 
coroner's deputies did not finish their initial examination in the motel room 
until after Williams held his afternoon news conference, so Williams was 
unaware of Perez's self-inflicted wound when he told reporters that the fatal 
shot had come from a police rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chief put out the information that he had at the time, and he said that 
the investigation was not complete," Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty said his information about the autopsy came from two detectives who 
witnessed the medical procedure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the coroner's office declined to discuss findings of the autopsy, 
saying the formal report had not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the police statement about the self-inflicted wound, Lt. Deborah 
Peterson of the coroner's investigations division replied, "I'm not saying it's 
wrong. But nothing has been released from this office. The doctor has not 
finished his paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his death, Perez had threatened suicide, both to police negotiators 
over the telephone during the three-hour standoff on Sunday and to friends he 
talked with on Friday before the killing of Officer Heim, Hagerty said. Perez 
also told negotiators that he would kill another police officer rather than 
surrender, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he was suicidal, we knew he was irrational," Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornered in the Lucky 7 on Sunday morning, Perez refused to surrender, fired 
on officers and then emerged from his room in a low crouch bearing a handgun, 
police said. As he stepped outside, police opened fire and Perez received a 
wound to the neck that "was not immediately fatal but was potentially fatal," 
Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez crawled back into the room and shot himself in the head, the police 
spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Monday that they still are investigating the circumstances 
surrounding Heim's death Friday night when he and his partner, Felix F. Pena, 
were met by a fusillade of bullets as they tried to enter Perez's room at 
another Hollywood motel after receiving a tip about drug dealing there. Perez 
reportedly fled into the night after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim died a few hours later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Pena, who was 
wounded in his right hand, was treated and released Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Heim are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday at Grace 
Community Church in Sun Valley, with burial following at Eternal Valley 
Memorial Park in Newhall. Heim is to be buried next to a young daughter who 
died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Police Department spokesman estimated that at least 2,000 officers from 
around the state would attend the funeral for Heim, 33, who served with the 
LAPD for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The service will include a helicopter formation flyover, but will be missing 
another tradition that is usually part of funerals of officers killed in the 
line of duty. Because Heim himself led the riderless horse in somber procession 
at other funerals, his widow has asked that the horse not be included at his 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Protective League has set up a trust fund for Heim's 
family, which includes his wife -- herself an LAPD officer who is pregnant with 
the couple's first child -- and his 12-year-old son from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be sent to the "Officer Charles Heim Fund," c/o Getzoff 
Accounting, 16255 Ventura Blvd., Suite 525, Encino 91436.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; U.S. 
TRANSIT CHIEF, LOCAL OFFICIALS DISCUSS SUBWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton on Monday met privately with 
Mayor Richard Riordan and local transit officials to discuss plans for resuming 
tunneling for Los Angeles' subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting closer to some resolution," Linton said."But we're not quite 
there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton earlier this month ordered that federal funding for the Downtown-to-San 
Fernando Valley subway be frozen until the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority demonstrates that it can competently manage the troubled project. 
Tunneling in Hollywood has been shut down since Aug. 18 because of ground 
sinkage of up to nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton, who planned to return to Washington today, described the meetings as 
productive. He would not predict, however, when federal funding is likely to be 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Linton wanted to make sure that MTA board members fully support 
the plan drafted by transportation authority chief Franklin E. White for 
preventing a repeat of the problems that have plagued subway construction. 
White has proposed, among other things, shifting safety and quality assurance 
inspectors from a private firm to direct employment by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz, who met with Linton, 
said the federal transit administrator wanted to make sure that MTA board 
members "appreciated the gravity of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I reassured him that we want to get this thing resolved," said MTA chairman 
and County Supervisor Ed Edelman, who also talked with Linton.

<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has claimed another victim: the Chatsworth Holiday 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth Chamber of Commerce, which has organized the annual event, has 
been unable to find enough volunteers to stage it, said Bill Powers, the 
chamber's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dozens of business people who normally volunteer their time have 
been busy trying to recover from the earthquake, Powers said, adding that the 
chamber has lost about 200 members since the earthquake. He said the chamber 
intends to revive the parade next year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COUNTY SETS UP 24-HOUR HOT LINE FOR JOB OPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has established a 24-hour job hot line that features 
information about openings available in all 38 departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a person looking for a county job calls this number, they will be 
connected by phone to a menu of employment opportunities," said Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are hoping the hot line will simplify the job seeker's search. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're looking for a job with Los Angeles County, you will no longer 
have to commute to the Civic Center or shuttle from department to department to 
stare at the bulletin boards bearing job opportunity notices," said Michael J. 
Henry, the interim director of the Department of Human Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county has been under a hiring freeze for several years, some 
critical posts are exempt and are routinely filled, Henry said. Most of these 
positions are in the Sheriff's Department and the Department of Health 
Services, each of which has about 300 positions available, Henry said. Overall, 
the county will have about 1,000 job openings over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone number is (213) 351-LIST. Accessing the menu requires a touch-tone 
phone.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / 41ST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; RUNNING FOR A NEW ROLE; IF SHEILA 
KUEHL WINS, SHE WILL BE STATE'S FIRST OPENLY GAY LEGISLATOR. MICHAEL MEEHAN, 
HER GOP FOE, SAYS HE IS TARGETING THE EX-ACTRESS'S LIBERAL AGENDA, NOT HER 
SEXUAL ORIENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From her perch atop a table in a Santa Monica meeting room, Sheila James Kuehl 
is holding forth on a favorite topic -- the glacial pace of making laws work 
for real people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We crawl across the law like inchworms," says the Democratic candidate in the 
41st Assembly District, drawing an appreciative chuckle from her audience. 
</P>
<P>
 As a women's rights lawyer who has toiled for more than a decade on domestic 
violence legislation, Kuehl knows whereof she speaks. And as a former actress 
-- best known for playing Zelda in the television series "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis" -- Kuehl knows how to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 With her engaging rat-a-tat-tat delivery, pithy one-liners and seemingly 
inexhaustible energy, Kuehl, 53, is a pro at winning over a crowd. Add to that 
her inveterate networking, and you have the makings of what local political 
analysts predict will be a winning effort on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a milestone. If elected, Kuehl will be California's first openly 
lesbian or gay state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 With the chance to make history, gay and lesbian groups have responded to her 
candidacy. By Kuehl's own reckoning, they accounted for about 40% of her 
contributions through the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But sexual orientation defines neither the campaign nor the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for that goes partly to her Republican opponent, reserve sheriff's 
deputy and law student Michael T. Meehan, 28. He has dismissed the sexual 
orientation matter as irrelevant in the race to represent the 41st District, 
which stretches from Santa Monica to the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 In Meehan's view, it is Kuehl's liberal agenda that makes her the wrong choice 
for a district that includes such suburban enclaves as Calabasas and Hidden 
Hills. And despite a lack of funds, Meehan insists that the contest will be 
close. He contends, for instance, that he will be helped by a large turnout of 
conservative voters attracted to the polls by some of this November's ballot 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no questioning Kuehl's momentum, stemming in part from her 
easy win over five opponents in the Democratic primary. She also benefits from 
a decided Democratic edge in the district's voter registration figures, as well 
as a war chest in the mid-$400,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan has raised only $40,000 and lacks the money for a single districtwide 
mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to drum up support (for Meehan) among the Republican 
leadership," says GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum. "But there's not much 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kuehl rejects the label lesbian candidate, she says being a lesbian has 
been a character builder. It was the reason, for instance, she got kicked out 
of her sorority when she was an undergraduate at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 During one summer vacation, someone rifled through Kuehl's bureau drawers at 
the sorority house, finding "incriminating" letters that revealed her sexual 
orientation. Kuehl says she was summarily booted from the sorority and further 
humiliated when the stolen letters were spread out on a table for all her 
"sisters" to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," she says. "I thought that my life was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern to her was whether her sexuality would become known to 
those in charge of the "Dobie Gillis" series. At the time, Kuehl was poised to 
get her own show, to be called "Zelda." The pilot for the show had been a hot 
commodity, Kuehl says, but the final green light for it never came. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Kuehl says, its director "sat me down for a little talk." She says the 
director told her, "The President of CBS said you were just too butch." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl went on to work at UCLA, eventually becoming an associate dean of 
students during the turbulent early 1970s. Later, she enrolled at Harvard Law 
School, graduating in 1978 at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
 At law school, she embraced what became her life's work: trying to improve 
women's lot in the legal system. In 1989 she co-founded the California Women's 
Law Center, a nonprofit group she left last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl lives alone in a Santa Monica bungalow with enough Rolodexes to hold 
what she calls her "Christmas card list" of about 1,500 friends. And it seems 
as if every group Kuehl has ever been affiliated with has rallied around her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A reunion/campaign fund-raiser attended by 150 fellow counselors from 
Uni-Camp, a UCLA summer program for sick and underprivileged children, is but 
one recent example. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's supporters also include her former colleagues in the "Dobie Gillis" 
cast, who appeared en masse at a fund-raiser during the primary. Though a 
Republican, Dwayne Hickman -- who played the title role in the series -- said 
he is casting his ballot for Kuehl. 
</P>
<P>
 Her public identification as the character Zelda has come in handy, Kuehl 
says, by making her sexual orientation less threatening. "It jams the 
homophobic radar," she says.

COUNTY PREPARES FOR FLU SEASON WITH FREE SHOTS; HEALTH: SHANGDONG, A NEW 
STRAIN, IS EXPECTED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS WINTER. THE VACCINATIONS ARE 
BEING GIVEN AT MORE THAN 300 CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the onset of flu season only weeks away, Los Angeles County health 
officials began jabbing residents with free vaccinations Monday to minimize the 
annual outbreak of fevers, headaches and runny noses -- and sometimes fatal 
complications that can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Influenza shots will be administered at more than 300 county health centers, 
hospitals and senior citizens' centers to help battle a new flu strain -- 
Shangdong -- expected to hit Southern California this winter. The strain was 
first detected in China last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most people recover from flu within a week or two, those over age 65 
and people with chronic heart and lung disease, diabetes or other long-term 
health problems can develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. More than 
130,000 people are expected to receive publicly funded flu shots this winter in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And with memories of last winter's aches, sniffles and chills still strong, 
flu-wary residents poured into public health clinics Monday to take advantage 
of early inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadene Gray, a nurse at the San Fernando Health Center, said more than 40 
people, most of them elderly, had been immunized at the clinic by lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been calling since the beginning of October," Gray said. "Some people 
experienced (another kind of respiratory virus) recently, and the older people 
get a little anxious. They want it immediately, so they can build up an 
immunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Shirley Fannin, chief of communicable-disease control for the county 
Department of Health Services, said she expects only a mild flu season this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 She described the Shangdong strain as a "garden variety" virus that did not 
result in widespread deaths in China. Two previously known flu strains that 
also are circulating have mutated little, and caused only a mild outbreak in 
the county last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any of the danger signs for a heavier season," Fannin said. "We 
have the same old virus, or varieties of virus, that have been cycling since 
1967." 
</P>
<P>
 Flu symptoms typically include fever of 100 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit in 
adults and higher in children, respiratory problems such as cough, sore throat 
and stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle ache and often extreme fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Complications from flu can occur at any age, but the elderly and those with 
chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications 
than younger, healthier people. 
</P>
<P>
 Flu is associated with about 20,000 deaths each year in the United States, and 
thousands more are hospitalized, according to the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. But flu generally affects fewer people in California, 
because of mild winter weather that allows for better ventilation of homes and 
workplaces, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the East Coast, people spend much more time in the winter in rooms with 
closed windows and with heating and air conditioning systems that dry the air, 
she said. Drier air causes cracks in human mucous membranes, which provide the 
virus with an entry route, Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccination drives in Southern California have been aimed at those with the 
highest risk -- the elderly and chronically ill people -- who are advised to be 
vaccinated each year. But public health officials warn that vaccine 
effectiveness varies from year to year, for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 One, flu viruses mutate over time, with new strains attacking humans whose 
bodies have developed antibodies to old strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, vaccines are formulated nine or 10 months before flu season actually 
starts. That means the virus may have altered itself before vaccines are 
distributed, making them less effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that vaccines are 70% to 90% effective in preventing 
illness in healthy young adults. In the elderly and those with chronic health 
problems, shots are often less effective, although the vaccine can reduce the 
severity of illness and the risk of serious complications and death. For the 
Flu For information on when and where free influenza shots are being given: 
</P>
<P>
 * Contact the county Department of Health Services at (800) 427-8700. 
</P>
<P>
 * Free shots will be administered until Dec. 9 at more than 300 health 
clinics, hospitals and senior citizens centers throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 * The shots can also be obtained through many private doctors.

AL MARTINEZ: ACHING WITH AARON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are roughly 2 million people in L.A. County who are over 50 years of 
age, and I'm one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention that by way of explaining why I was drawn to Aaron Binder, who has 
just published a book and produced a videotape about lifting weights, aimed at 
those of us who have lived for at least half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Binder, who is 67, promises that if we follow his advice, we will look like 
him. His photograph on the cover of his book, "Pumping Iron After Fifty," shows 
a guy of radiant good health, looking like he is 42, holding two weights aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 I studied the picture for several minutes. No matter what I did, I could never 
end up looking like Aaron Binder. In the first place, I don't smile. Someone 
told me I looked like a barracuda when I smiled, so I gave it up years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I do not have a flat stomach, do not radiate good health and haven't 
lifted anything heavier than a martini for several years. I even had to give up 
olives because of the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Binder intrigued me because he was once a high-rolling, hard-drinking, 
fast-lane kind of guy who discovered good health in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A stockbroker and financier who, among other achievements, founded the 
All-American Burger chain, he ended up in the slammer for 44 months for his 
involvement in an illegal tax-shelter scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there he was taught to lift weights by inmates with hair on their backs 
and tattooed arms that were longer than their legs. 
</P>
<P>
 His mentors were guys who killed once or twice and who belonged to prison 
fraternal organizations called the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican Mafia. 
When they said lift, Binder lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that about every third person in L.A. is trying to sell an 
exercise video, beginning with ex-radical-turned-wifey Jane Fonda. She went 
from hating ugly war to hating ugly fat, which is a quantum leap in anyone's 
book, but the American Legion still doesn't love her. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant Bubba Smith, who as a professional football player used to throw 
quarterbacks around like they were macadamia nuts, also produced a tape when he 
noticed that in other exercise videos, women never seemed to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubba set out to change that. The women in his video were sometimes drenched 
in perspiration, which he found sexier than hell. To each his own. Sweating 
women don't turn me on, but I'm not about to argue with a guy who is 6-feet-8 
and who used to slice past center like an armor-piercing shell while crowds 
yelled, "Kill, Bubba, kill!" 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Binder was small and flabby when he got to prison and couldn't lift 40 
pounds. But word had spread that during the trial he had refused to involve 
others in his crime and for that was considered a stand-up guy. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to express their primitive form of appreciation for his refusal to 
snitch, the men in the slammer led Binder to the weight pile where primates 
named Mike and Tony taught him how to bench-press, curl and work the pulleys, 
which was their form of recreation when they were not maiming or gang-raping. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of working out, Binder was able to bench-press 250 pounds, 
and now wants to share his expertise with those in his age group who are 
spindly, potbellied, indolent lumps. People like me. 
</P>
<P>
 His videotape is intended for both men and women over 50, and you don't have 
to be in federal prison under the tutelage of Mike and Tony to follow its 
simple instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I met with Binder at the Sports Connection on the Westside to view in person 
what he proposes on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched him work pulleys, pectoral machines and a lot of other clanking 
equipment, then bench-press 225 pounds five times just to prove to me how easy 
it could be. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was crowded with beautiful men and women who worked out in varying 
degrees of enthusiasm to soft rock played over a P.A. system. Bubba Smith was 
there, by the way, sitting on a bench, resting between workouts, watching women 
sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Binder's formula for reconstituting old people is simple. You start small and 
work your way up. I don't have room for details, but if you're a woman, he 
promises cuter breasts and tighter tushes. Same if you're a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can lose your stomach within six months," he said to me. "I can see it's 
an ego thing with you. You want to look good, right?"

 Well, I suppose. I've begun working out a little by putting olives back in my

Tony are hovering over me like creatures from the early Cenozoic, growling and 
shouting, "Lift!" I'll lift.

UCLA WINS GRANT FOR HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government has awarded UCLA a $549,000 grant to develop a plan for 
eliminating slumlords and increasing the quality of affordable housing in three 
areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, which will be made available by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development over two years, also will fund a study of how to increase 
residents' borrowing power in the targeted areas: Pico-Union, Vernon Central 
and the Alameda Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA plan also will address environmental health issues, creation and 
expansion of community credit unions and development of a building materials 
recycling program.

STATE PANEL ALLOCATES FUNDS FOR FREEWAY PARK-AND-RIDE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission has set aside $12.2 million to pay 
for a Transit Center park-and-ride facility at the interchange of the Artesia 
and Harbor freeways near Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding includes money for landscaping, a bus terminal, widening of 182nd 
Street, a water treatment center and a 1,000-space park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the lot is scheduled to begin in March. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators previously found low levels of hazardous substances and 
methane gas at the site, which was used as a landfill in the 1960s. Caltrans, 
the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Integrated Waste Management 
Board have jointly monitored the area. 
</P>
<P>
 All three agencies approved Caltrans' remedial action plan to cap the 
landfill, drill wells to ensure that the landfill remains isolated from the 
underground water table and install a gas collection system and water treatment 
center.

PROPERTY VALUES: REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FACE DEADLINE ON HOUSING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redevelopment agencies throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties are 
scrambling to come up with housing plans by Dec. 31, as mandated by the 
California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, several hundred million dollars already set aside for housing hasn't 
been spent. And many agencies are failing to set aside the funds they are 
obligated by law to spend on low- and moderate-income housing. That's because 
Assembly Bill 1290 is forcing redevelopment agencies to come up with a solid 
plan by year-end to set aside and spend at least 20% of their "tax-increment 
income" on housing. This works by directing a portion of residential and 
commercial property taxes into a redevelopment area in an effort to eliminate 
blight and encourage development. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, most of that money has gone for speculative commercial projects 
rather than residential projects, this at a time of great demand for low- and 
moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of California's roughly 330 redevelopment agencies have been 
doing an inadequate job on housing, conceded Bill Carlson, executive director 
of the California Redevelopment Assn. in Sacramento. "Many agencies have been 
paying more attention to commercial projects while housing gets shoved aside." 
The use-it-or-lose-it provisions of AB 1290 will force many redevelopment 
agencies to set aside 20% of their tax-increment money and actually spend it on 
housing, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 30, about $350 million statewide in housing money already set aside 
hasn't been spent by California agencies, Carlson said. Housing advocates are 
hoping that AB 1290 will help generate more housing soon. "It will be a boon to 
low- and moderate-income housing. The money will go out the door faster," 
Carlson said. "It will motivate those who have been sitting on their hands." 
Agencies that don't spend their housing money within a certain period of time 
will be basically blocked from engaging in any other redevelopment activities 
until they've met their housing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development agencies are hustling all of a sudden to get a housing plan 
together," observed David Kroot, partner at the law firm of Goldfarb & Lipman 
in San Francisco, which represents about 60 redevelopment agencies in 
California -- including the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. "There 
is something of a rush to get plans finished by December 31." Cities and 
agencies that don't have a housing implementation plan approved by that date 
may find themselves sued by citizens trying to stop other redevelopment 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires a variety of housing projects. Agencies must produce a mix 
of housing for very-low-income residents (those who have 50% or less of median 
income for a particular area); low-income (80% of median income), and 
moderate-income (120% of median income). This can be done by providing grants 
or loans for rental projects or housing developments that dedicate certain 
units for low- and moderate-income renters and buyers. With just 2 1/2 months 
to go, only about 5% of Kroot's clients have finalized their plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition from middle-class households to new low-income housing has kept 
many redevelopment agencies and cities from spending the money they have set 
aside for housing in special funds, said Patrick Richardson, project manager 
for the city of Ventura Redevelopment Agency. Some agencies have been 
collecting money and not spending it because of political opposition to 
introducing lower-income residents into wealthier neighborhoods, Richardson 
observed. Some cities have even tried to spend their required housing set-aside 
on projects outside of their city limits. And in upscale Hidden Hills, the city 
disbanded its redevelopment agency rather than build low- and moderate-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ventura has three relatively small redevelopment areas, Richardson 
said, only about $100,000 a year in tax-increment income is set aside for 
housing. Most tax-increment money, in fact, goes to pay off the debt generated 
by projects undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s. In order to undertake larger 
projects, cities such as Ventura may bank several years worth of tax-increment 
income in order to undertake larger housing projects from time to time, 
Richardson said. The fact that a city or redevelopment agency has unspent 
tax-increment money doesn't necessarily mean the city is dragging its feet in 
developing low- and moderate-income housing, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura hasn't yet finalized its housing plans for the next five years, 
Richardson said. The basic goal is to create about 500 new housing units 
downtown -- about 20% of which would be set aside for low- and moderate-income 
renters. The units remain set aside for these renters with deed restrictions 
for a certain number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are opposed to low- and moderate-income housing because "it has an 
undeserved reputation for bringing in the riffraff," said Toby Lieberman, 
project manager at Kosmont & Associates Inc., a real estate consulting company 
in Sherman Oaks. In fact, she said, "a lot of people who are considered 
low-income are just plain working people." Families earning minimum wage just 
can afford the average San Fernando Valley rents of $550 for a one-bedroom 
apartment and $650 for a two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities and redevelopment agencies are also unfamiliar with housing 
projects. "There are a lot of redevelopment agencies that have never done any 
housing," Lieberman said. "They started as suburbs and they don't want to 
become 'real cities.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a lot of ways to skirt state housing requirements, Lieberman 
said. Not surprising, given that state regulatory law is basically "thousands 
of pages of regulatory mumbo-jumbo." Now each redevelopment agency has to come 
up with a more solid plan for housing than before -- and they have to execute 
the plan, she said. "It's now becoming a matter of use it or lose it."

SUPERVISOR SAYS CLOSING PLAN FAILED; GOVERNMENT: ROGER STANTON WANTS COUNTY 
OFFICES OPEN EVERY FRIDAY. HE DISPUTES COST SAVINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton wants to end a program of closing down 
county offices every other Friday because he says it has failed to achieve its 
cost-cutting goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, this plan is not saving us money," Stanton said. "We are 
in business to serve the people, and we should be open every working business 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said a staff report, which recommends that the work plan be renewed at 
the Board of Supervisors meeting today, is misleading and filled with 
inaccuracies. Furthermore, he said, the program is not only inconvenient to the 
public but may be costing the county money. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the work plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, which offer the 
public a range of services from welfare assistance and health care to building 
permits and tax collection, are closed every other Friday. Most of the offices 
are open longer during the week to make up for the Friday shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 When the board approved the plan in December, 1992, it was told by the 
administrative office that the county could save about $1.1 million because of 
reductions in utility costs, janitorial services, sick leave and overtime. The 
board was also told the program would help promote better air quality by 
reducing worker commutes. The plan was approved 4 to 1, with Stanton opposing. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff report presented to the board last week states that over a 12-month 
period, the county saved $562,190 in utility costs, about $100,000 in custodial 
costs and between $100,000 and $300,000 in employee incentives to comply with 
state-mandated air-quality regulations for ridership programs. The report, 
however, noted that sick leave time had actually increased by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, part of the sick leave increase may be attributed to 
the fact that employees are taking nine hours of sick leave because of a longer 
work day, instead of eight hours under a normal week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton challenges several of the report's key findings. He said the utility 
savings were inflated because the staff included the savings that occurred from 
a vacated building that had nothing to do with the work plan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to calculations provided to Stanton from county officials, the 
utility savings were closer to $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton also said he was shocked about the increase in sick leave time, and he 
criticized the staff report for not calculating the costs of that increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not presenting the negatives," he said. Stanton's staff estimates 
that the sick leave increase has cost the county about $520,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the sick leave deduction, the staff report estimated that the program 
saved the county between $762,190 and $962,190. Stanton, however, contends that 
the work plan may actually be costing the county about $236,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't match up to our goal," he said. "The trial period failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and William G. Steiner said they are studying the 
merits of the work plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have some questions (about the staff report) that I would like to get 
answered," Vasquez said. He added that the purported savings in the utilities 
and the increased sick leave have "raised an antenna or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she supports the work plan and believes 
that it has achieved its cost-saving goals. She also said that the program 
helps reduce commuter pollution and has been adopted by many municipal 
governments in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had no complaints from any cities or constituents," she said. "As of 
this point, I'm very supportive of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because some of the supervisors are concerned about the staff report, a vote 
on the work plan may be postponed for two weeks so that County Administrator 
Ernie Schneider can address their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton has "raised some legitimate issues and we're going to look at them," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said the savings that did occur do not justify closing the public 
access to the county, particularly the offices in the Santa Ana Civic Center, 
26 weekdays a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buildings are the heartbeat of the operation," he said. "When the body 
is sleeping the heart still pumps. We should be open." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he supports giving employees flexible work schedules, provided 
that offices remain open five days a week. Stanton is the only supervisor who 
has required his office staff to work on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county officials and the staff report, most employees favor the 
work plan that allows them to have every other Friday off. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said his primary concern is public access to county operations and 
services. But he added that he also supports giving employees the convenience 
of a flexible work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where those two agendas can come together, that would be the best of both 
worlds," Steiner said.

TIME TO PACK IT ALL IN?; THIS YEAR'S HARVEST MAY BE THE LAST FOR IRVINE CITRUS 
PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The eerie stillness inside the 66-year-old Irvine Valencia Growers 
packinghouse on the northern outskirts of the city signals more than the end of 
the busy summer harvest -- it may foreshadow the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Valencia Growers Cooperative is considering permanently closing the 
Jeffrey Road packinghouse, one of only three left in Orange County, because of 
a steady decline in the quantity of locally grown oranges as groves have made 
way for development. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, at the peak of the citrus industry, there were 45 packinghouses and 
65,000 acres of orange groves in the county. Now, only 3,000 acres of orange 
groves are left. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the declining acreage base, we are having to examine the 
feasibility of running the packinghouse here on the Irvine Ranch," said Peter 
Changala, Irvine Co. director of agriculture and company representative on the 
Irvine Valencia Growers Cooperative board. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has been a part of that packinghouse for generations," Changala 
said. "It's something we have to look at first as a business, but from an 
emotional standpoint (closing) it would be a hard decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the effects of creeping urbanization, the Irvine Co. pulled out 1,800 
acres of old, poor quality orange groves several months ago, leaving about 800 
acres of groves in the Irvine area, according to packinghouse manager Michael 
Yorba. The Irvine Co.'s oranges and a smaller amount of the company's Star Ruby 
grapefruit account for 90% of the packinghouse business. The other 10% of the 
Irvine Valencia Growers Cooperative consists of about 19 growers in Ventura and 
San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the citrus processed in the Irvine packinghouse is shipped to 
markets in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question mark whether we're going to open up again," said Yorba, a 
descendant of the Yorba family that received title to much of the Irvine area 
from Spain in 1810. Yorba, whose father and grandfather were both citrus 
growers, has managed the Irvine packinghouse since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to see the groves go out and you hate to see the packinghouse go, 
but things are changing, and we have to change with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the Irvine packinghouse shipped about 1.7 million field boxes 
of citrus a year. A field box holds about 60 pounds of fruit. This summer, 
Irvine Valencia Growers shipped about 900,000 field boxes of citrus, Yorba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the declining quantity of citrus in Orange County has come a 
commensurate plunge in its value, which fell by nearly half in 1993 to $8.5 
million, according to the annual Orange County crop report released in June. 
County agriculture officials said fruit from the county's aging orange groves 
is smaller and less competitive with Central Valley oranges for Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations have worked at the Irvine packinghouse, which employs about 300 
during the busiest season, from March through September. Often, it's the wives 
and daughters of the pickers who work in the packinghouse, sorting and packing 
the oranges. In 1989, the packinghouse automated some operations, with about 
60% of the sizing, grading and packing done by computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest technological developments for growers came in the late 
1960s with the elimination of smudge pots that had long soiled Southern 
California skies. The smudge pots burned diesel oil to warm groves and keep 
fruit from freezing. Growers switched to propeller-driven wind machines that 
break up stagnant air to keep temperatures from falling too low. Two wind 
machines still stand next to the packinghouse in an empty field that was once 
lined with orange trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But modernization was not enough to the save the Orange County citrus industry 
from residential development. Of the county's two other packinghouses, growers 
say the packinghouse in Orange, operated by the Villa Park Orange Growers 
Assn., is operating at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions remain about the viability of the packinghouse in Placentia operated 
by the Yorba Growers Assn., according to Changala, as well as a number of 
packinghouses in surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are running into the same obstacles," Changala said. "This is more 
of a regional issue than an Irvine issue." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Irvine Valencia Growers packinghouse is closed permanently, the growers 
cooperative will not disband. The growers will seek another packinghouse, 
likely in another county, with enough volume to keep costs low, Yorba said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grower has to make money if he's going to stay in business," he said. "I 
can understand it." End of an Era Orange County's fruit-packing peak occurred 
1943, when there were 45 packing houses here. But now, with the likely closing 
of Irvine Valencia Growers Cooperative, just two would remain. Some background 
about the co-op and plant: *

RELUCTANT HERO FOILS KIDNAPING IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>

 Edward Estrada had no idea when he stopped to answer a call on his pager early 
Monday morning that he would wind up getting into a struggle with a 
shotgun-toting stranger bent on kidnaping a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he saw the barrel of a shotgun pointed at his stomach and the 
gunman's finger on the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt so vulnerable," said Estrada, 41, of Garden Grove. "It was like 
I was in the water surrounded by sharks." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was seriously injured in the incident, and a man was later arrested on 
suspicion of attempted kidnaping and assault with a deadly weapon, Police Lt. 
John Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began to unfold about 1 a.m. after Estrada, a window washer who had 
just gotten off work, stopped at a phone booth at a shopping center near 
Brookhurst Street and Westminster Avenue to answer a call on his pager. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was talking on the phone, Estrada said he saw a woman tumble out of a 
moving pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a leg pop out," he said. "Then a woman fell out, doing two somersaults 
before she hit the back of her head on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said the pickup driver had offered the unidentified 24-year-old woman a 
ride after she got in a fight with her date several blocks away. But when the 
woman wanted to get out of the truck, the driver held her back and kept 
driving. After a struggle, the woman opened the door and jumped out of the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken but apparently uninjured, the woman ran over to Estrada. He said the 
woman spoke in Vietnamese and he could not understand what she was saying, but 
there was no mistaking her terror as she threw her arms around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't let go," Estrada said. "I was her life jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup screeched to a halt not far from where Estrada and the woman stood. 
The driver got out and shouted threats as he approached them. Estrada said he 
took out his pager and pretended to be calling police. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the ruse seemed to work. The man jumped back into his truck and drove 
off through the shopping center parking lot. But he made an abrupt U-turn and 
drove back. When he emerged from the truck this time, he had a shotgun, Estrada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman refused to get into the truck, the assailant leveled the 
shotgun at Estrada's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him pump the shotgun, then I saw him swallowing," Estrada said. "I knew 
he was ready to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said he grabbed the barrel and struggled with the assailant. Finally, 
Estrada said he let go of the shotgun, and he and the woman ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman managed to cross the parking lot to a fast-food restaurant. The 
assailant pushed Estrada out of the way, jumped into his pickup and drove off 
after her. Estrada said the man had the shotgun pointed out the window as he 
drove over the concrete islands "as if they weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the woman flagged down a passerby in a gray Honda, Estrada said. He 
then called police. The Garden Grove woman returned a short while later with a 
translator and told her story to police. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, officers arrested a pickup driver in the vicinity, and 
called Estrada to the Police Department to identify him, he said. A shotgun in 
the pickup was seized, Woods said.

BODY OF MISSING WOMAN IDENTIFIED; INVESTIGATION: THE REMAINS OF KYU-HEE PARK 
FERNANDEZ, WHO DISAPPEARED IN AUGUST, WERE FOUND BY HIKERS NEAR RIVERSIDE. 
POLICE ARE SEEKING HER HUSBAND. 
</P>

<P>
 The body of a Garden Grove woman missing since August has been found in 
Riverside County, and authorities on Monday were hunting as far as Europe for 
her husband and the couple's two children. 
</P>
<P>
 The decomposing body of Kyu-Hee Park Fernandez, 30, was identified by 
sheriff's investigators on Thursday after being discovered by hikers a week 
earlier at the base of a mountain east of the city of Riverside, said Riverside 
County Sheriff's Sgt. John Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband, Manuel Fernandez, 27, holds a French passport and his family owns 
property in France and Spain, Horton said. While Horton said police want to 
question more people locally, they also have enlisted the help of federal and 
international authorities to find Fernandez and the children, Christopher, 6, 
and Sharon, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably outside the country," Horton said. "We do want to contact him." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives reported all four members of the family missing from their Garden 
Grove apartment on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 A week or two earlier, Manuel Fernandez had moved back in with his wife and 
children after she dropped plans to divorce him, although he had beaten her 
during much of their six-year marriage, she charged in documents seeking a 
divorce and a restraining order against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got up in the morning and they were just gone," neighbor Ana Acevez said. 
"The children's bikes were out and the shoes were out and their mail started 
piling up. They were just gone." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the couple's two cars was found parked at Los Angeles International 
Airport, Garden Grove Capt. Dave Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevez said she befriended Kyu-Hee Fernandez and her children after they moved 
into the next-door apartment last spring, finding her new neighbor pretty and 
outgoing. Relatives said she was increasingly active in a local congregation of 
Jehovah's Witnesses. But friends and relatives said she also was troubled by 
her deteriorating marriage -- a union beset by charges of recurrent abuse and 
fears that her husband would leave the country with the children, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple wed as students in Paris in 1988. Both spoke several languages and 
traveled all over the world, from the South Pacific to South America, according 
to their attorneys and police. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manuel Fernandez, who was working as a convenience-store clerk at the time 
he disappeared, acknowledged in court papers this year that the marriage was 
unstable, saying he attended counseling for six months after "we had a problem 
with physical abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said his wife had left three times in six years and said he feared 
that she would be the one to leave the country with the children, according to 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Kyu-Hee Fernandez obtained a court order to keep her husband away, 
saying she once had to flee to a battered-women's shelter with the children. 
She charged in court papers that one beating while she was pregnant in 1992 
left her unable to eat or get out of bed for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyu-Hee Fernandez began divorce proceedings in July but changed her mind days 
later and asked her lawyer to get the restraining order and divorce suit 
dropped, said her attorney, Tonya Prescott. A judge ordered Kyu-Hee Fernandez's 
lawyer to hold the family passports, but the order was never put into place 
before the couple reconciled, Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott said she advised against the reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reluctant to do it," Prescott said. "When she came and said 
everything's peachy keen, yeah, I was concerned."  
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy failed to determine the cause of death, police said, and the 
results of toxicology tests are pending.

COUNTY SAYS FEWER OWNERS DUE TAX REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far fewer property owners than originally believed might be due tax refunds 
because the county failed to hear their assessment appeals before the legal 
deadline, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working through the weekend, officials found that at least 150 of the 300 
parcels believed to be past or near deadline were not acted upon because the 
property owners withdrew their appeal requests. Investigators were still 
reviewing the remaining 150 cases late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm somewhat relieved. But I find this incident intolerable," Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez said. "We haven't seen the end of this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Monday that they are still trying to determine how many 
property owners are due refunds and how the county could have missed the 
deadline for appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began last week after an appeals board ruled that the county 
must accept Bank of America's valuation of property in Brea because the county 
missed a Sept. 15 cutoff date to hold an appeals hearing. The bank's valuation 
was $100 million less than what the county claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that ruling could cost the county as much as $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the county has two years from the time a property owner files 
an assessment appeal to resolve the case by holding a hearing. If the county 
misses the deadline, the property is automatically assessed at the value 
suggested by the property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 When the real estate market faltered in the early 1990s, tens of thousands of 
Orange County property owners requested new assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last year, the county faced a backlog of 68,000 appeals. The 
backlog prompted the Board of Supervisors to hire more assessment workers -- a 
move that significantly quickened the appeals process. But the county still 
faces a backlog of 36,000 appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are now trying to determine what role the backlog played in the 
missed deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the problem as due to a lack of resources," Supervisor William G. 
Steiner said. "It's a system breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has yet to determine exactly how the deadlines were missed 
or who is responsible, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both the county assessor's office and the clerk of the Board of Supervisor's 
office play roles in the appeals process. Last week, County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider said officials from both offices should have known 
about the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should not have happened to begin with and it should not happen again," 
Vasquez said. "I'm extremely disappointed that those who are generally 
responsible . . . have basically allowed this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of county workers has spent the last week pouring through more than 
3,000 assessment records, said Phyllis A. Henderson, the clerk of the board. 
The process has been slowed somewhat because a few case files proved difficult 
to find, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said that while he considers the missed deadlines to be a "very 
serious matter," it should be noted that the property owners who receive 
refunds because of the error might have won them anyway if the appeals board 
ruled in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not excusing the behavior," Steiner said. "We need to get beyond just the 
blame and make sure this scenario is not repeated."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEENS PAY TRIBUTE TO PEER WHO WAS KILLED

<P>
 The bright face smiling at passers-by on the memorial plaque in the Cypress 
High School quad is that of a young woman just beginning her journey into adult 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In a solemn tribute Monday, friends and family of former student Allison 
Saliture remembered how an allegedly drunken driver brought a tragic and early 
end to her journey last March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time we pass by Allison's memorial, we will remember how she lived, but 
also how she died. She is forever in our hearts," said her father, John 
Saliture, echoing the inscription on the black, stone tablet. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,700 of Allison's classmates filed silently past the memorial after 
the brief ceremony. Some wept. A few shuddered as they passed. Others craned 
their necks to read the inscription. Many just walked by, not even looking at 
the marker. One or two left the line to join the Saliture family. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Saliture died March 31, five days after the crash and just 22 days 
after she and twin Jennifer had turned 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I get reminded every day, by people looking at me and staring," 
Jennifer said. "We got our first job together and we got our car together. It's 
just hard thinking of how she's not there to share all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Saliture and his wife, Haze, chose the first day of Red Ribbon Week, an 
anti-substance abuse observance, to dedicate the plaque, in the hope that it 
will discourage Jennifer's classmates from drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Rene Castorena's car was going more than 100 m.p.h. on Valley View 
Avenue, running stoplights and weaving into opposing traffic lanes before it 
slammed into the rear of the car in which Allison was a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Castorena, 19, who police say tested as intoxicated, faces a charge of 
vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence in a trial set for Nov. 14. 
Castorena is in the Orange County Jail. Red Ribbon Activities 
</P>
<P>
 The use of red ribbons as an anti-substance abuse symbol began as a tribute to 
federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, who was 
tortured and slain by drug traffickers in 1985. Some of the Red Ribbon Week 
observances in Orange County this week: 
</P>
<P>
 * Paularino Elementary School, Costa Mesa: Students will view a "Fantastic 
Kids Show" on how to say no to drugs today; participate in a barbecue and "wear 
red day" Wednesday, pledge not to use drugs Thursday, and join a Jog-a-Thon 
fund-raiser Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Goldenwest Street at the San Diego Freeway: 400 Westminster School District 
students will stage an anti-drug march Friday through Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Amigos High School, Fountain Valley: "Virgin" drinks including 
strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas will be sold at lunch today; students 
will dress in red and launch balloons Wednesday and take pledges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * McGarvin Intermediate School, Garden Grove: Students will write brief essays 
today, sign a banner at lunch Wednesday and wear red Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other Garden Grove Unified School District schools: Plans include "wear red 
days," displays of cars wrecked by drunken drivers, Red Ribbon Week quilts and 
essay contests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton School District schools: Bells toll at noon all week to remind 
students to remain drug-free. Drag-racing car at Golden Hill School on 
Wednesday will show "Drugs Are a Drag"; a pledge banner will be posted in the 
cafeteria Thursday, and a clown will visit Friday to hand out red candy whips 
and remind students not to "Clown Around with Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange Unified School District board: Passed resolution supporting Red 
Ribbon Week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brea-Olinda Unified School District schools: City of Brea sponsors events, 
including bumper sticker design contest for K-6 students; seventh- and 
eighth-graders will be asked to write letters to family members who smoke, 
drink or take drugs to ask them to stop; ninth- through 12th-graders will write 
essays on "How to Resist Peer Pressure."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI WRITING DIRECTOR WINS RESEARCH AWARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of a writing program in UC Irvine's education department has won 
a statewide award for educational research. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Booth Olson, director of the UCI Writing Project, was selected as the 
first winner of the 1994 Caddo Gap Press award for education research.Olson was 
the principal investigator on the "Reading, Thinking and Writing About 
Culturally Diverse Literature" program, which explored ways to interest 
adolescents of various ethnicities in academics. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials said Olson will receive the award, which consists of $250 and 
publication in the 1994 Yearbook of California Education Research, at the fall 
conference of the California Council on the Education of Teachers in Irvine on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said the project first tried to interest students in reading stories by 
introducing them to diverse authors dealing with issues of heritage, including 
Latin Americans, Europeans, Africans and Asians. Educators then taught students 
the basic structure of writing essays. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the changing demographics of Orange County, the students are becoming 
more and more diverse," Olson said. "Very often, they're at school but not 
academically or emotionally interested in school. We wanted to come up with a 
way to engage them more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten teachers participated in the project, Olson said. They taught at a variety 
of schools, from Santiago Middle School in Orange, which is about 53% white, to 
Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, which is about 47% Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 The teaching portion of the project lasted from January to June, 1993, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other educators who collaborated with Olson were: Brenda Borron, of Irvine 
Valley College; Pat Clark, of Century High School in Santa Ana, and Bob Land, 
of the Center for the Study of Evaluation at UCLA. ALICIA DI RADO

 Pet owners will no longer be able to get around the city's limit of three pets 
per parcel by buying adjoining vacant properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week tightened the zoning code to eliminate a loophole 
no city official ever anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, we never thought someone would buy a vacant lot just to house 
their pets," community development director Patricia M. Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Lewis and Roberta Davis did. City officials told Lewis and Davis last 
year that they would not be able to keep their eight German shepherds and one 
chow chow in their back yard, so they bought two adjoining vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 After neighbors complained about the dogs, who were kept in a fenced area that 
encompassed all three lots, city officials changed the zoning code to require 
residents to get a conditional use permit to house more than three dogs or 
cats, regardless of the number of properties the residents own. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance only applies to dogs or cats older than 4 months. DANIELLE A.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; PARCEL DIVISION OKD FOR 3 HOMES ON 2 LOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeowner has received permission to split two parcels of land into three so 
that he can build two more homes, something neighbors had fought for years. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members last week upheld a Planning Commission decision allowing 
Rick Evans to divide his land. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-2 vote rejected an appeal made by the neighbors who wanted the 
council to reverse the Planning Commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors said they opposed having three homes on a hill at Park Way. The 
homes, they said, would cause mud sliding problems and lower the property 
values of surrounding homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want three homes there," said Frank Mejia, who lives below the Park 
Way lots. "I'm against (the lot split). I hate the way it's going to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Mejia, who lives next door to his brother, Frank, added: "It's going 
to be a hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor argued that the creation of the three irregularly shaped lots 
is not consistent with the city's General Plan and that the Mejias' properties 
would be damaged by dirt and mud from the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who already has one home on the lots, said he plans to build two more 
homes. He promised to install a retaining wall so mud won't slide into the 
Mejias' properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Steven Anderson and Juan Garcia sided with the neighbors and voted 
against the split. They said dividing the land would be inconsistent with the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William D. Mahoney said that Evans' plan would enhance the 
neighborhood: "I think the Mejias, once this is done, would probably not find 
it as objectionable as they think it's going to be." MIMI KO

 A Huntington Beach man died Sunday night when the car he was driving failed to 
negotiate a curve on Live Oak Canyon Road, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Joseph Cruzat, 37, who was alone in the car, was driving east about 10 
p.m. when the car went off the road and struck an embankment, said CHP Officer 
Bruce Lian.The car flipped over and rolled back onto the road near Canyon Creek 
Drive, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found a small amount of methamphetamine on Cruzat and were 
investigating the crash as drug-related, Lian said. No other vehicles were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruzat, who was wearing a seat belt, was partially ejected from the car and 
suffered head injuries, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said officers did not know how fast Cruzat was going on the winding road, 
which has a posted 35-m.p.h. speed limit. KEN ELLINGWOOD

 A top El Toro High School cross-country runner who was injured in a car 
accident in August is slowly coming out of a coma, according to his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Mejia, 16, will be moved to a Laguna Hills convalescent hospital where

 "He's starting to come out of it," Hagin said. "His one eye is open, and he

 Mejia and three teammates were driving to a fast-food restaurant on Aug. 26

 Emergency crews used the "Jaws of Life" to cut the youths free from the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the teen-agers were hospitalized with broken bones and concussions but 
have since recovered and are running with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard for all of us," Hagin said. "We've tried to talk about it and 
learn from what happened, but it's all been real difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia had been a star on the cross-country team, which finished fourth in the 
Sea View League last year and recently finished third in a prestigious Orange 
County cross-country invitational meet. 
</P>
<P>
 About $15,000 has been raised to help support Mejia and his family. Neither 
parent is working, and the family has no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations are still being accepted. Checks can be sent to the Tomas Relief 
Fund, El Toro High School, 25255 Toledo Way, Lake Forest, Calif. 92630. FRANK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; LAKE FOREST ADOPTS TRAUMA PROGRAM

 Plans to provide crisis help for South County residents have won support from 
another city, as the Lake Forest City Council agreed to fund the Trauma 
Intervention Program. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city's approval last week was conditioned on the participation of 
the other South County cities.So far, Mission Viejo has agreed to join the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as TIP, the program would train a network of community volunteers to 
assist firefighters and police in emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers would lend emotional support to victims and their relatives at 
accident and crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff said that TIP workers would help people who repeatedly call the 911 
emergency line -- often elderly persons who are confused, lonely or need help 
with a non-emergency situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a San Diego program, supporters say TIP helps free emergency 
personnel to do their jobs better. Volunteers would be on call around the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 TIP volunteers could also be used during a disaster, such as an earthquake or 
major fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to spend $7,000 on the program. In addition, council 
members appropriated $4,200 for the Orange County Sheriff's Chaplaincy Program. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials liked the idea of combining the two programs, saying there is a 
potential need for both crisis volunteers and the presence of a chaplain in 
many emergencies. FRANK MESSINA

 For the first time in four years, the Orange County Fire Department began 
accepting applications Monday for firefighting positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will give as many as 10,400 written exams in December, drawing 
applicants from a 13-day recruitment drive, which begins this week at fire 
stations throughout the county, said spokeswoman Emmy Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruitment on Monday started in Laguna Niguel at Fire Station No. 49, where 
nearly 250 applied in less than three hours, and ended with applications being 
accepted in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 A deluge of telephone calls to the department's job hot line prompted fire 
officials to hire two extra telephone operators, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system almost shut down," Day said. "The voice mailbox has capacity to 
handle 40 messages simultaneously. It was overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 The department plans to fill about 100 full-time positions, created by 
retirements and other attrition. The application drive ends Nov. 7 in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must pass the written exam and a physical agility test. Those who 
are accepted must also graduate from the county's fire academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has 637 full-time firefighters and about 600 firefighters who are 
on paid call, Day said. 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; ADJUSTERS TAKE CRASH COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fender-bender between a Pontiac and a rusted Buick was probably the first 
accident where police tape went up before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver buckled his seat belt, donned a crash helmet and circled the 
Pontiac before hitting it at 5 m.p.h. to simulate one of those seemingly small 
accidents that can spawn whiplash suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration Monday was the opening act of a daylong course put on for 
lawyers, police officers and insurance adjusters by the National Institute of 
Forensic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not much dispute when someone's bones are broken and his brain is 
splattered on the windshield," explained the institute's executive director, 
Frederick J. Kakis. "The most interest is in the low-impact crash." 
</P>
<P>
 After the early morning collision, about 150 observers went into classrooms in 
the Doubletree Hotel to discuss documentation techniques. The mantra of the 
course is that "everything means something," from the characteristics of skid 
marks to minute pieces of hair and flesh embedded in the car's windshield, 
Kakis explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a well-documented crash scene, a technical expert has little hope of 
accurately assessing blame, the course handbook states. But various methods can 
help determine the "what, where, when, why and who" of a crash.LESLEY WRIGHT

 Paragon Cable's Channel 3A will air taped interviews today with City Council 
and mayoral candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasts will start with the five candidates for mayor appearing at noon 
and continue with the 12 council candidates featured at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different format," said co-producer and show host Bob Nash."We 
decided to let the viewers get to know the candidates in a series of one-on-one 
interviews. It produced some rather interesting comments, more candid than you 
might get in an open forum." 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews of council candidates will be broadcast again at 4 p.m. today, 
and the mayoral candidate interviews will be rebroadcast at 6:30 p.m. The 
programs will be replayed for the rest of the week and during the first week of 
November, Nash said.

 An Explorer program for teen-agers interested in careers in law enforcement 
has been approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously endorsed Police Chief David Barr's request for 
authorization for the program earlier this month.Barr told the council that Boy 
Scout executives have been working with the Police Department to help launch a 
city-sponsored Explorer Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr noted that La Palma formerly sponsored an Explorer Post, but it folded in 
the late 1970s because of declining interest among young people. In recent 
years, Barr added, there has been an increase in interest among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beginning about four years ago, we began to notice a resurgence of interest 
by area young people in Police Service Exploring, and just recently Boy Scout 
executives handed us a roster of 177 names of Kennedy and Cypress high school 
students who expressed an interest in Police Service Exploring in recent 
surveys," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he does not expect all 177 to join the new post. He estimated 
that about 30 teen-agers initially will be involved in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized Barr to spend up to $1,500 in drug-seizure-asset funds 
to start the Explorer Post. Barr told the council he expects the program to 
cost the city about $500 a year once it has been started. The annual cost also 
will be funded by money the city gets from seizing assets of convicted drug 
dealers, the council said. BILL BILLITER

 A man suffered second- and third-degree burns when gasoline vapors in his 
garage exploded Monday, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name was not released by fire officials, was airlifted to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange after the vapors were ignited by a water heater at 
12:36 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 No damage was reported to the house, said Emmy Day, spokeswoman for the Orange 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was draining gasoline from a car he was repairing into a pan when the 
fire occurred in 32900 block of Paseo Del Lucero, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor, Ron Richardson, called 911 after he heard the explosion. 
Richardson said the man was burned on the upper portion of his body. Medical 
center officials would not release the man's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all too frequent," Day said. "Most people don't understand that when you 
have a combination of three things -- heat, air and something that will burn -- 
there's bound to be a fire." THAO HUA

WASHINGTON PLANE CRASH KILLS ANAHEIM MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim man was one of two men killed Sunday night when a small plane 
crashed shortly after takeoff from a private airstrip on Shaw Island, San Juan 
County Sheriff William G. Cumming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the crash of the Beechcraft Baron BE-58 were C. Larry Cornelius, 39, 
of Anaheim and the plane's registered owner, Edward C. Darling, 38, of 
Bellingham, the sheriff's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot got an FAA briefing from the Seattle Flight Center before takeoff, 
but there was no indication a flight plan was filed nor that there were any 
radio messages of trouble before the crash, said Dick Meyer, a spokesman for 
the Federal Aviation Administration in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigators were 
headed for the island in the San Juan Islands chain about 75 miles northwest of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane went down in clear weather, and there were no reports of unusually 
strong winds, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was badly damaged, but there was no fire, a news release from the 
sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airstrip is "carved out of the trees . . . in a rather isolated location" 
on the island about 20 miles southwest of Bellingham, he said.

BLOODHOUND TRAILS IRVINE MURDER SUSPECT; CRIME: THE DOG TRACKED AN 18-YEAR-OLD 
JUST RELEASED FROM CUSTODY, POLICE SAID. THE TEEN WAS ARRESTED IN THE JANUARY 
BLUDGEONING DEATH OF A WOMAN IN HER HOME.

<P>
 A bloodhound who trotted through busy downtown Orange and into a shopping 
center, following a scent, led to the arrest of an 18-year-old man accused 
Monday in the slaying of an Irvine woman in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the unusual arrest occurred Friday after Earl Rhoney was released 
from Orange County Juvenile Hall, where he had been held on an unrelated 
burglary charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to Rhoney, police had arranged to have the bloodhound near Juvenile 
Hall in Orange when Rhoney was released. The bloodhound previously had sniffed 
an item of clothing that Patricia Lea Pratt, 45, wore when she was fatally 
bludgeoned in her home Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some time after (Rhoney) left, we brought the dog to the front entrance" of 
Juvenile Hall, Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog trailed Rhoney "half a mile through a parking lot, down the street and 
through The City Shopping Center," Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog gave police "the last piece" of evidence needed to arrest Rhoney, the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that having the bloodhound trail and find him was a pretty definite 
identification," Allevato said. "In addition to the bloodhound, we have 
statements (Rhoney) has made, forensic evidence, other witnesses and so forth. 
This last piece of evidence we couldn't conduct until he was released. And, it 
was a very positive piece of evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodhounds, according to their handlers, have noses that are 3 million times 
more sensitive than a human's. Their noses are so sensitive that they are able 
to track people by the scent of their body scurf, microscopic skin cells that 
are sloughed off at a rate of around 50 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoney, a former Irvine resident, is expected to be arraigned today in 
Juvenile Court on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 17, a juvenile, when Pratt was killed. Prosecutors are also expected to 
file a motion to try Rhoney as an adult in Orange County Superior Court, 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was a service manager for PacTel Cellular.

 With details still sketchy, the council agreed that if development occurs, a 
maximum of 1,000 homes should be built on the mesa and no homes built on the 
ecologically sensitive lowland areas. Also, any development must include plans 
for wetlands restoration, the council decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group, which owns most of the wetlands, proposes to build 
4,286 homes and to restore 1,100 acres of wetlands. The county has suggested 
alternatives of 3,200 and 2,500 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first choice," said Councilman Dave Sullivan, "is to preserve the mesa 
and lowlands by a land swap or other mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, the council indicated that if development in the wetlands is 
inevitable, it wants as much control as possible, with future annexation of the 
wetlands as an ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have done is clarify the council's preference," said Councilman 
Victor Leipzig. "We clarified that one preference is to utilize the entire 
Bolsa Chica for open space but recognize that development might occur." 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga added that if the area remains 
unincorporated, it will substantially affect the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really should be planned by the city," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to a September council meeting on the wetlands that drew an 
estimated 350 people, Monday's session had only one speaker from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nelson, Amigos de Bolsa Chica president, said that talking about a land 
swap to keep the wetlands undeveloped was tantamount to having the council 
members bury "their heads in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the city needs to be realistically addressing the possibility of 
development," he said, adding that Amigos de Bolsa Chica supports some form of 
development of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 While Koll's proposed residential development of Bolsa Chica is the only plan 
officially under consideration, city officials Monday expressed concerns about 
its impact on Huntington Beach's water supply, sewer system, streets, schools, 
public safety, city services and finances. 
</P>
<P>
 A council subcommittee will hold a public hearing on the city's alternative on 
Oct. 31 at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall.

APARTMENT PROPOSAL HEARINGS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public hearings on a proposed 850-unit apartment complex have been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Co. officials asked for a 90-day continuance for their City 
Council hearing, originally scheduled for Monday, because of the Nov. 8 city 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Peterson, a consultant for the developer, wrote the city asking for the 
delay "in order that the newly constituted City Council may consider the 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing set before the Planning Commission last week was delayed to Nov. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would retain a reasonable time period between a Planning Commission 
action and the City Council's consideration of the project," Peterson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing development is proposed for a 112-acre site off El Toro Road at 
the city's northern border. About 50 acres of the parcel are suitable for 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been opposed by local environmentalists and city officials, 
who say it would exceed population levels established in a development 
agreement signed by the company and the city in 1991.

CHANNEL BUILT TO END GOLF COURSE FLOODING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials have announced the completion of a flood control channel they hope 
will be a long-term solution to a problem that has plagued the Shorecliffs golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter storms in the late '70s and early '80s washed out parts of the golf 
club and adjoining neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a public and private partnership, the Prima Deschecha Creek 
flood-control system was built.

TAVERN HOST TOPS COSTA MESA CITY COUNCIL RACE FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council candidate Gary Monahan, manager of Henry and Harry's Goathill 
Tavern, has raised the most money so far in his bid for a seat -- just under 
$9,000, according to campaign statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven candidates have filed campaign statements at City Hall.Five candidates, 
however, said they did not expect to raise or spend more than $1,000. They were 
Lynn D. Clements, Bob Brady, Janet Lea McCammon, Michael B. Collier and James 
S. Wysopal. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Planning Commissioner Libby Cowan, a community services director 
for the city of Irvine, received $6,181, the second-highest amount. Incumbent 
Peter F. Buffa came in third with $3,763. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two open seats on the council. Councilman Jay Humphrey is stepping 
down after four years of service, and Buffa's seat is up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he received the most contributions to date, Monahan downplayed his 
political war chest, saying it was "too early to paint a picture." Monahan said 
he spent $8,600 on a combination of activities, including the golf tournament 
he held to kick off his campaign, lawn signs and political flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan received the financial backing of employees of various alcohol 
distributors and brewing companies who played in his golf tournament. He also 
received $1,000 from Harbor Boulevard of Cars Political Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Steel, a self-employed financial consultant, reported that he has dished 
up his $3,500 bankroll from his own pocket. Costa Mesa Planning Commissioner 
Mark Korando, a code enforcement officer for the city of Irvine, raised $3,416. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan received $434 from Friends of Jay Humphrey, a group endorsing Cowan. She 
also received $125 from the Committee to Elect Tom Umberg for Attorney General. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Buffa's $3,700 in contributions, $900 came from Robert Bein, William Frost 
& Associates, a civil engineering firm in Irvine.

COMPROMISE FORGED ON ROOF-RAISING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission landed in the middle of a homeowners association 
roofing dispute and wound up offering a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners agreed last week to allow Shirley Forbes to install a roof 
designed to last 30 years, as opposed to the 40-year roof mandated by the 
Seville Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Forbes was required to paint all moldings, gutters and exposed wood and 
metal surfaces on her Via Juanita home to match others in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years is the minimum allowed by city code," Planning Commissioner 
Sherrie Butterfield said. "This homeowner already started the process of 
re-roofing." 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield said Forbes shouldn't be forced to "tear off this roof and start 
over since the city code doesn't require a 40-year roof." 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, the Seville Homeowners Assn. is a voluntary group 
whose contracts with residents don't specify what type of roofing is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Willowdean Vance, a Lake Forest resident who has pushed for state legislation 
of homeowners associations, opposed the Seville Homeowners Assn.'s roofing 
restriction.

FATAL SPEARING CASE JURY TO START DELIBERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors are expected to begin deliberations today in the case of a young man 
charged in the 1993 fatal spearing of a San Clemente High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-person jury in Orange County Superior Court heard closing arguments 
Monday from attorneys on whether Juan Alcocer, 20, of San Clemente should be 
found guilty of murder and assault in the alleged gang attack that ended in the 
death of 17-year-old Stephen Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer likened the attack on Oct. 15, 1993, to a pack of 
dogs bringing down a game animal. He argued that conspiracy laws make each of 
the six who participated in the assault individually responsible for Woods' 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Gene E. Dorney told the jury that Alcocer is not a member 
of the alleged gang, the San Clemente Varrio Chico. Although Alcocer has 
admitted to throwing a piece of wood during the confrontation, he did not 
intend to kill anybody, Dorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods and his friends were pelted by blocks of wood, full cans of beer, rocks 
and paint-rollers as they tried to leave Calafia Beach County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was in the passenger seat of a friend's Chevrolet Suburban when a 
paint-roller rod crashed through the window and lodged in his skull, according 
to testimony. The rod had been stripped of its casing to expose a long spike. 
Woods died 25 days later without ever regaining consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The case ignited public outrage over gang violence in Orange County. It also 
enraged some Latino leaders who complained that prosecutors had overcharged the 
Latino defendants in the case because the victim was white.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMERICAN PACIFIC'S PROFIT RISES, ASSETS SET RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank reported earnings of $576,000 in the September 
quarter, up 21% from $476,000 in the same three-month period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For its nine-month period, the bank reported net income of $1.46 million, a 6% 
increase over a year earlier, when the bank posted earnings of $1.37 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank J. Ures Jr., chief executive of the Sherman Oaks-based bank, attributed 
the results to "improved net interest margins, substantial deposit growth and a 
tight rein over expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's assets reached a record $277 million on Sept. 30, up 20% from $232 
million a year earlier. The bank said deposits grew through aggressive 
marketing programs and the opening of new branches in Van Nuys and Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan loss provisions in the latest quarter were $582,000. Non-performing 
assets rose 2% to $5.44 million on Sept. 30 from $5.31 million a year earlier.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: TEKELEC TURNAROUND REPORTED FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tekelec, a Calabasas-based producer of switching systems for communications 
networks, said its profit for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $1.36 
million, compared to a loss of $2.8 million the previous year. The turnaround 
was on revenues of $15.6 million, up 24% from $12.66 million in the third 
quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company said its earnings were $2.36 million,

</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the nine-month results to improved sales, which

devices transfer signals for telephone calls, check calling card numbers and do 
other communication functions.

GTE TO PROVIDE QUICK-CONNECT 411 SERVICE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PHONE COMPANY 
CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL CELLULAR FIRMS TO OFFER DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE THAT DIALS 
NUMBER FOR THE CALLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With characteristic quietness, GTE of California in the past few months has 
snapped up lucrative contracts to provide new directory-assistance services for 
cellular phone companies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tiny business for GTE of California in Thousand Oaks, a unit of giant 
GTE Corp., which is the nation's largest independent phone company, with $20 
billion in annual revenue. But operator services generally are highly 
profitable for local phone companies, and GTE's new operations stand to benefit 
from the explosive growth of the cellular phone industry. In California, GTE 
won the contracts over other providers of directory services, including Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The new services allow a cellular subscriber to call 411 for a phone number, 
then the option of being directly connected with that number. These so-called 
quick-connect directory services are being introduced around the country, and 
they save customers from having to hang up and dial the number -- something 
thought to be particularly appealing when the caller is driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Another feature of the new cellular 411 services provided by GTE is that 
callers anywhere in the Los Angeles area do not have to dial an outside area 
code, then 555-1212, to obtain a number in a different area code. A caller in 
the 818 area code, for instance, could dial 411 and obtain a phone number in 
the 714 area code. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE is providing these directory-assistance services for AirTouch 
Communications Inc., L.A. Cellular and GTE Mobilnet, the cellular arm of GTE 
Corp. That means when subscribers of these cellular phone companies dial 411, a 
GTE operator answers and has the ability to put the call through. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE initially offered to provide the services to cellular operators in 
California and Hawaii, but is now hoping to expand the business nationwide, 
said Jay Burrell, product manager for wireless services at GTE Telephone 
Operations in Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing new services to cellular operators is being aggressively pursued by 
GTE and others because the cellular phone industry is expected to grow 30% a 
year. What's more, local phone companies increasingly are forced to seek new 
revenue sources because of regulatory and pricing changes in their traditional 
business, and the likely opening of local phone markets to competition from 
cable TV and long-distance phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing new services to cellular phone companies "is such a natural fit" for 
GTE, said Burrell. "We're spending a great deal of effort to be the best out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other 411 services that might soon be offered include theater listings and 
directions to certain destinations, Burrell said. Also in the near future, GTE 
plans to provide all these services in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The directory-services business has "pretty good growth prospects," said 
analyst Robert B. Wilkes at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Witness, he 
said, the announcement earlier this month by long-distance phone company MCI 
Communications Inc. of its new service allowing callers to dial a single 
toll-free number to find just about any published phone number in the United 
States or overseas. MCI will also offer to automatically dial the number for no 
extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But 90% of directory-assistance calls are for local numbers. And that business 
stands to expand with the increasing use of cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 The first local cellular company to go on-line with the new 411 services was 
GTE Mobilnet, which debuted the services in April in its California markets, 
including five area codes in central and Northern California. All cellular 
callers to 411 are now automatically connected to the numbers for 60 cents per 
call. A regular 25-cent directory-assistance call without the direct-connection 
feature now requires dialing a number other than 411. 
</P>
<P>
 David Avirom, marketing manager for GTE Mobilnet in California, said that, 
although GTE is providing the new services for its cellular arm, bids from 
other companies were also considered. Avirom said that usage of the call 
completion feature among cellular subscribers so far is nearly 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch began its new 411 services in the Los Angeles area in June. GTE has 
in the past provided 411 services for AirTouch within the local calling areas 
that GTE serves. But "this is a very different animal than what we did before," 
said Melissa May, an AirTouch spokeswoman. The changes required "a whole new 
contract" with GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Although AirTouch was spun off in April from the parent of Pacific Bell, May 
said AirTouch chose GTE for the new services over a competing bid from Pacific 
Bell because GTE offered "better service at a better price." 
</P>
<P>
 An AirTouch 411 call costs 33 cents, and if the customer pushes a button to be 
automatically dialed through, there is no additional charge. The new services 
are in effect throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. The company hopes to expand them statewide in early 1995, 
at which time a cellular customer could call 411 for a number anywhere in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell previously provided L.A. Cellular's 411 services, said Mike 
Cymbrowsky, senior marketing manager for L.A. Cellular. But earlier this month, 
under a new contract with GTE, L.A. Cellular also began offering customers the 
ability to make a 25-cent 411 call, and for an additional 50 cents be connected 
with the number. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer need only dial 411 for any number in the company's service area of 
Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE's Burrell wouldn't say, but it's a good bet that GTE is also hoping to win 
a contract to provide similar services to the remaining major cellular phone 
company in the state. McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., which operates in 
various parts of California as Cellular One, is planning to add new directory 
services within the next several months, said Sylvia Schnopp, marketing 
coordinator for Cellular One's south coast district.

 Most American companies have difficulty selling products in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 A small Van Nuys firm has proved an exception. It has been profitably 
exporting everything from oil tank cleaning systems to customized Chevrolet 
vans, souped-up motorcycles and studio lighting systems to Japan for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "American products are so salable in Japan, if they just had a touch," said 
Tadabumi Takasu, 47, a Japanese-born electrical engineer who founded United 
Hi-Tech Inc. in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we provide is the Japanese touch," Takasu said as he sat in an office 
cluttered with electronic parts, a model of a Porsche 911 and a gleaming 
motorcycle engine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his company's sales have ranged between $2 million and $8 million a 
year since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasu's five-man team exports a variety of products, but he said, "generally 
we get involved with high-tech items, electronics or mechanics -- items 
Japanese people will buy, if they just had a a slight modification." 
</P>
<P>
 Customized Chevrolet vans, for example, have been a staple of Takasu's 
business since 1988. A friend at a Nissan dealership in Tokyo told him 
Chevrolet Astro vans had become a hot seller. But, he told Takasu, more vans 
could be sold if the interiors were upgraded with luxury appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought vans for conversion, just the metal frames with bare interiors -- 
no seats, no dashboard, nothing inside, and we totally redid them. We cut out 
the windows ourselves, put in leather seats, deluxe burled wood dash, put in a 
new, higher roof, improved the suspension. Then, you have a product the 
Japanese will buy," Takasu said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Hi-Tech contracts out the conversion work and exports between 30 to 40 
vans per month to Japan, charging about $10,000 per van. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasu emigrated to the United States in 1970, and for a while pursued 
graduate studies in electrical engineering at Caltech. In 1973, in need of 
money to support himself, he contacted a friend in the Japanese used car 
business, asking him if he could use any American-made cars. "He arranged for 
me to get a letter of credit with his company and asked me to send him some 
Camaros," Takasu said. "That's how I got started. I sent him about 50 cars in 
the first year: Camaros, Mustangs and Firebirds." 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Takasu, who never finished at Caltech, sent his friend about 
200 American-made cars. "The price difference, the cost of these American cars 
in Japan was incredible," Takasu said. "I didn't even have any capital. Just a 
letter of credit, some good contacts. . . . The personal part is very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Other early ventures included importing computer boards for video games and 
negotiating the rights to distribute some early Japanese videotape machines, 
with only playback, that were rented through local video stores. "The video 
players were the biggest hit we had in the beginning. We didn't know, we 
guessed it would work. That's why we try a little bit of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 After exporting to Japan for more than 20 years, Takasu has learned that the 
Japanese like American-made goods. They like American houses, art, vehicles, 
clothes -- even some technology. But they prefer them to be tailored to meet 
Japanese tastes or specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Takasu became interested in the concert and stage lighting export 
business about five years ago, after an Italian lighting company asked him if 
he'd be interested in marketing their computerized stage lighting systems to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were interested, but their lighting systems were much too large and heavy 
for stages and studios in Japan," Takasu said. "The technicians in Japan 
handling the lighting systems are usually women. . . . They need something 
light, easy to handle. We helped the company design a more compact computerized 
lighting system and found some friends to help us market it in Japan." The 
product, Takasu said, cost up to $1,000 per system in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides customizing vans and lighting systems, Takasu, who once raced 
motorcycles as a hobby, does motorcycle customizing as well. "Whatever the 
customer wants -- twin spark plugs, more speed, more power, more endurance -- 
we will design it that way," Takasu said, showing a glossy Japanese motorcycle 
magazine with photos of a replica 1982 Kawasaki racing cycle custom-designed by 
his company. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle replicas sell for about $30,000. Takasu makes only two or three 
replicas each year, and sells to a single distributor in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new venture is exporting custom-made, American prefabricated housing 
parts to Japan. "We take the American-made house parts because they are 
superior and cheaper than the prefab house parts available on the market in 
Japan. We export the floors, the cabinets, the windows, the doors. . . . The 
parts are American, the finishing is Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest moneymaker for United Hi-Tech Inc. over the past five years has 
been overseas distribution of low-volume petroleum tank steam-cleaning systems 
designed by an American environmental engineering firm. Called the Super Max 
Cleaning System, Takasu said the units sell for approximately $2 million. His 
company moves three or four units per year to Japanese and Argentine petroleum 
and oil-tank cleaning companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Takasu has also made some mistakes. In 1983, after exporting American-made 
cars for about 10 years, he got involved in a joint venture importing a new, 
Japanese, three-wheel vehicle, the Zoe Zipper Personal Transportation Vehicle. 
The cars sold for less than $3,000 and got 112 miles per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 He imported about 300 of the cars. But the product liability insurance was so 
great because the car was so tiny, Takasu said, that he couldn't afford to 
import them. The cars eventually were sold as novelty vehicles to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Swanberg is one of Takasu's employees. "He likes to know the people he 
does business with. I knew him for three years before he hired me." Takasu 
hired Swanberg, a half-Japanese, half-American native Californian, a year ago 
to pilot the development of the company's first product for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol Guard is a bullet-resistant, removable car window that Swanberg said is 
the first such product available to the consumer. Takasu came up with the idea 
after the 1992 riots. Initial plans were to market the protective windows -- 
which clamp to car door frames with brackets and industrial strength Velcro -- 
to the Los Angeles Police Department. But with a price tag of $495 per window, 
department officials said they couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanberg said Toyota inquired about installing the custom-made windows in its 
vans they use to shuttle executives around Los Angeles, and a Czech exporter 
wants to market them to clients in East Asia. But so far, not one unit has 
sold. Car dealers, like Auto Stiegler Inc. in Encino, a Mercedes-Benz 
dealership that briefly had a Patrol Guard window on display, said they're 
loath to push an accessory that stirs customers' fears about owning an 
expensive car in a high-crime city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no corporate hierarchy. If something works, we keep it going. If not, 
we try something different," Swanberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 One key in doing business with Japan today, Takasu said, is to recognize the 
Japanese have been money savers for decades -- and now are beginning to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Japanese citizen, he said, has "$60,000 in the bank. They have 
been saving for years. Now, they can afford nice things. It is a good time for 
a business like mine."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: IWERKS CUTS STAFF BY 35 IN REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank supplier of special-format movie theaters 
and virtual-reality attractions, said it has laid off 35 of its 260 employees 
and eliminated plans to add 14 new positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The work-force reduction, announced Monday, is part of a company-wide 
reorganization to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Since going public in one of last year's hottest initial stock offerings, 
Iwerks has encountered setbacks in its ambitious plan to sell its attractions 
around the world and build urban-based entertainment complexes called 
Cinetropolis. In its fiscal year ended June 30, Iwerks lost $8.06 million on 
$36.6 million in revenue, and its stock has collapsed from a high of nearly $40 
a share to a closing price of $6 a share on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Iwerks announced the resignation of three outside 
directors, including former Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. 
The company said the directors left to "devote more time to their other 
business interests." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its restructuring, Iwerks said it would begin a search for a chief 
operating officer and combine its sales and marketing efforts for its various 
attractions and Cinetropolis under George Wade, the company's newly named 
president of business development. Other management functions have been 
combined, thus eliminating four positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley B. Kinsey, Iwerks' chairman and chief executive, said he expects the 
financial benefits of the reorganization to appear in the third quarter of the 
current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, Iwerks has announced several product sales. On Monday, 
the company said it has signed a $2-million pact to design and build a 100-seat 
simulation theater at the Ocean Park theme park in Hong Kong. The theater is 
scheduled to open in 1996, it said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: INDEPENDENT TELEMEDIA TO ACQUIRE 2 COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent TeleMedia Group, a Sherman Oaks media investment firm, said it has 
signed an agreement to acquire two cable television advertising companies: 
SkyConnect, of Boulder, Colo., and Mediatech Inc., of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisitions are aimed at marketing a new technology that could 
significantly cut the costs of advertising on cable television, said Lew 
Eisaguirre, chief financial officer of Independent TeleMedia. 
</P>
<P>
 SkyConnect has developed a network of systems it calls digital video file 
servers -- a technology capable of distributing advertisements digitally, using 
computers. This could replace the more cumbersome process of duplicating 
videotapes and sending them by mail, Eisaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement with SkyConnect, Independent TeleMedia will offer 90% of 
its common stock in exchange for 100% of SkyConnect's outstanding shares, the 
company said. The agreement with Mediatech requires that Independent TeleMedia 
exchange $9.25 million in common stocks and assume $4.5 million of Mediatech's 
debt to acquire the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: JANEX BOWS OUT OF SALES PACT WITH DENTSU PROX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janex International Inc., formerly named With Design in Mind International 
Inc., said it will end its 4-year-old agreement to license a three-dimensional 
imaging technology called MicroTheatre from Dentsu Prox Inc. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In canceling the agreement, Janex will pay Dentsu $75,000 in cash and 50,000 
shares of Janex restricted common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Janex, a Woodland Hills-based toy company, stopped marketing MicroTheatre 
nearly two years ago after attempts to produce a commercially viable product 
failed.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NEW INDEX TO INCLUDE BENTON OIL AND GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Gas Co., an Oxnard-based petroleum exploration and production 
firm, said it has been chosen for inclusion in the S&P SmallCap 600, a new 
stock index compiled by Standard & Poor's to follow the stock performance of 
600 small-capitalization companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex E. Benton, chief executive of the company, said inclusion in the new 
index should bring the company "increased visibility, wider coverage by 
securities analysts and increased liquidity in its stock, as institutional 
investors create investment portfolios which mirror the index." 
</P>
<P>
 The index will be disseminated by Standard & Poor's starting Oct. 31, Benton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The median market capitalization of the 600 stocks is about $267 million. 
Benton said its current market capitalization is about $190 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton has domestic operations in the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana, and 
international operations in Venezuela and Siberia.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: VITESSE CONTINUES MOVE INTO PROFITABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. of Camarillo reported its second consecutive 
profitable quarter after two years of heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse, which manufactures gallium-arsenide semiconductors, posted a profit 
of $174,000 in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a 
year-earlier loss of $3.2 million.Revenues totaled $9.7 million in the latest 
quarter, up 21% from $8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fiscal year, the company reported a $4.1-million loss on revenues of 
$35.6 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $19.1 million on revenues of 
$26.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse, which has struggled with the decline of the supercomputer market, 
attributed its improved financial results to a broadened customer base and 
expansion into communication markets, including fiber-optic transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it has reached a tentative settlement of a class-action 
lawsuit filed against the company by two shareholders in 1992. The suit alleges 
Vitesse violated securities laws by making misleading statements in its 
prospectus in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse said it has agreed to pay $1.4 million to the plaintiffs, of which 
about $975,000 will be covered by the company's insurance carrier. Earnings in 
the latest quarter were hampered by a one-time $425,000 charge related to the 
settlement of the suit.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: QUARTERLY EARNINGS RISE SHARPLY AT CU BANCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, reported a 
sharp rise in earnings in the third quarter, as the bank continued to reap the 
rewards of a management overhaul launched in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $671,000, up 19% from the same 
three-month period a year earlier.For nine months, the bank posted earnings of 
$1.86 million, up 23% from $1.51 million in the same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank made no loan loss provision in the latest quarter, as asset quality 
has improved dramatically over the past year. Non-performing assets totaled 
$113,000 on Sept. 30, down dramatically from $4.03 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Total assets on Sept. 30 were $280 million, down 6% from a year earlier. But 
much of that decline came late last year, when the bank sold its mortgage 
banking operation, slicing about $30 million from its balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Carpenter, chief executive of the bank, attributed the improved 
results to "continued aggressive efforts to manage down problem real estate 
loans, and the bank's effectiveness in capturing an increasingly larger share 
of Southern California's commercial loan business." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter headed an expansive management overhaul in June, 1992, when the bank 
shifted its emphasis from real estate to commercial lending.

 Newhall Land & Farming Co., a Valencia-based land development firm, said its 
earnings for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30 were $906,000, down 50% from 
$1.8 million in the same period a year earlier.Revenues for the quarter were up 
17% to $23.4 million from $20 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company reported earnings of $6.7 million, more than 
double the $3.2 million it earned in the same period the year before. The 
increase was on a 39% growth in revenue to $78.7 million from $56.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the third-quarter results to variations in the housing 
market and continuing payments toward a $3.7-million charge for uninsured 
losses stemming from the Northridge earthquake.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEW IMAGE EARNINGS DROP; REVENUE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Image Industries Inc., a Canoga Park maker of dental cameras and imaging 
systems, said earnings for its first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, were 
$148,000, down 78% from $677,000 in the same period last year. The drop came on 
a 27% increase in revenue to $6.97 million from $5.47 million the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the results to falling prices due to increased 
competition and to the decline in the value of the dollar against the yen, 
which made it more expensive for New Image to buy components for its products. 
Operating expenses were higher because of the expansion of customer service and 
technical support operations. The company said also it paid higher commissions 
to sales representatives in the first quarter, further dampening earnings.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: REXON INC. WILL CLOSE HEADQUARTERS AND MOVE TO OHIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rexon Inc., whose Wangtek computer cartridge division was one of Simi Valley's 
largest employers as recently as the late 1980s, is joining the list of 
companies that are saying goodby to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the year, Rexon will close the Wangtek plant, long an industrial 
landmark on Moreland Road. Rexon's corporate headquarters, which moved into 
that building from Manhattan Beach only last January, will be relocated to 
Solon, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves, part of a series of steps aimed at revitalizing Rexon's earnings 
and operations, will mean a loss of 140 Ventura County jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 employees are expected to transfer to Ohio or to a newly opened plant 
in Longmont, Colo. The rest will be laid off or will leave voluntarily, said 
Rexon spokesman J. Embry. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1989, Wangtek had a payroll of 350. A pioneer maker of 
quarter-inch cartridges used as computer memories and backups, it had to cut 
back because of the recession and increased competition in the computer 
industry, Embry said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rexon hopes to improve efficiency by shutting down in Simi Valley, Embry 
said the action isn't being prompted by California's regulatory climate, which 
some critics contend is anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If California had offered to make us tax-free for 10 years, we still would 
have come to this decision," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, he noted, Rexon closed its tape-drive facility in Irvine, 
transferring the work that was done there to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves are part of a restructuring effort launched last year, when Rexon 
reported a loss of $53 million caused by the recession and asset write-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 A new chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Genesi, succeeded longtime 
company head Michael O. Preletz in January. The company has indicated that it 
expects to show a modest profit for fiscal 1994, which ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Rexon, a worldwide producer of software and computer data-storage systems, has 
annual sales of about $200 million and 1,000 employees in such locations as 
California, Florida, Colorado, Ohio, Puerto Rico and Singapore. After the Simi 
Valley plant is shuttered, the only remaining California operation will be a 
small engineering unit in Fresno.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PINKERTON'S EARNINGS LEAP AFTER RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinkerton Security & Investigation Services said its fiscal third quarter 
earnings jumped to $1.8 million from $170,000 a year earlier after the Encino 
security services provider completed its restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-quarter, 1993, results included a $1.6-million after-tax charge to 
cover costs of the restructuring. Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 9 was 
$198.3 million, up 13% from $175.9 million a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest nine-month period, Pinkerton's profit was $3.31 million, an 8% 
gain from the $3.06 million in net income it reported a year ago. Its revenue 
rose 15%, to $583.7 million from $506.5 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interlink Electronics, a Camarillo maker of computer devices, reported a 
third-quarter profit due to the sale of its interest in a European joint 
venture for $3.38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale resulted in net income of $3.25 million for the three months ended 
Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $681,000 a year earlier. Interlink's revenue 
in the September quarter was $2.25 million, up 86% from $1.21 million in 
revenue a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 For the recent nine-month period, the company earned $2.3 million, while its 
revenue rose 58%, to $5.49 million. In the first nine months of 1993, it lost 
$2.57 million on $3.48 million in revenue.

<P>
 Advanced Photonix Inc., a Camarillo producer of photodetector devices and 
other electronic products, has received an order to provide components of a new 
B.F. Goodrich system that remotely measures and records the fuel level of 
aircraft wing tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 To operate the system, ground crew members simply aim a pointer at a device 
inside the tanks. The system eliminates manual operations that can take as long 
as an hour, Advanced Photonix said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an example of how defense know-how can be applied in commercial 
markets," said James W. Ward, the company's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial contract is for $700,000, but add-on orders may increase that 
amount substantially in the coming year, the firm said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles company, Commonwealth Associates Inc., has acquired Westlake 
Village-based KCD Inc., maker of an over-the-counter body fat reducer, in an 
exchange of stock valued at $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonwealth will change its name to KCD Holdings Inc. and will relocate to 
Westlake Village, according to Clark M. Holcomb, Commonwealth's president. 
</P>
<P>
 KCD Inc. produces SeQuester, which it claims can contribute to a gradual loss 
of body fat and weight. Some side effects may occur, Holcomb noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five months since it was introduced, SeQuester has been placed in 
thousands of drugstores and other outlets nationwide, Holcomb said. He said a 
major marketing campaign will be launched soon.

QUAKE RECOVERY; REBUILDING EFFORTS ARE A STUDY IN FRUSTRATION; OWNERS OF 
DAMAGED BUILDINGS FACE VANDALISM, STRAINED CREDIT, REPAIR WORK LIABILITY AND AN 
UNCERTAIN RENTAL MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake fractured ceiling beams, shattered windows, 
sheared Sheetrock walls and bent anchor bolts at the Northridge Oaks apartment 
complex on White Oak Avenue. But somehow, a potted fern appears to have held 
its perch atop the ledge of a ground floor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 The fern is there today, still visible through the chain-link fence that 
surrounds the complex. But its once-green fronds have turned a burnt brown, the 
color of nine months of neglect. For the fern, the quake itself was easier to 
endure than what followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the same might be said of owners of quake-damaged apartment 
buildings near the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some apartment owners have no tenants and no income, but still must meet their 
mortgage payments. Many must decide whether to sell at a fraction of what their 
properties could fetch a few years ago, or shoulder daunting debts to rebuild 
for an uncertain rental market. All face frustrations ranging from financing 
delays to vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a horrible, disconcerting experience," said Howard Sachar, owner for 15 
years of the 97-unit Northridge Oaks complex until he sold the property in 
disgust three months ago. "In 45 seconds, mother nature can change your life." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 18,000 apartment units were rendered uninhabitable by the quake 
throughout Los Angeles, according to housing officials. Fifteen neighborhoods 
were damaged so severely that they are officially termed "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of these ghost towns straddle the campus of Cal State Northridge. Filled 
with vast complexes that housed thousands of students and young families, these 
neighborhoods suffered $31.6 million in damage. Twenty-eight of the 36 
apartment buildings in these areas were tagged with yellow or red markers by 
building inspectors -- strictly limiting access or denying access altogether to 
the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of three red-tagged properties in these neighborhoods have taken 
different roads since the quake. One apartment owner is rebuilding with high 
hopes, another sold in frustration, and a third said she just wishes her 
troubles would end. Optimist 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of White Oak Avenue and Lassen Street, construction workers buzz 
about a three-story hive called the White Ridge Apartments. Scaffolding 
surrounds the building's gray stucco exterior, and giant, moon-shaped windows 
have already been installed in the luxury apartments on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias Karraa, owner of White Ridge since it was built in 1987, is among the 
first in the area to rebuild, and he wishes his apartment complex neighbors 
would hurry up and join him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do not like to live among ruins," said Karraa, 61, clutching the 
gold-colored keys to his new Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 In good years, Karraa's 42-unit building provided him $50,000 in profits 
annually. After the quake, Karraa was told the building would have to come 
down. But he found a structural engineer with a more hopeful prognosis, and he 
considers the repair project under way a marvel of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper floors sustained little damage in the quake, but the bottom floor 
was knocked so hard it leaned sideways by nine inches. To yank the building 
back into alignment, workers connected cables from the building's cement 
foundation to the floorboards on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Each night, the workers increased the tension on the cables slightly, and 
gradually, the building straightened out. To keep it that way, workers are 
installing dozens of new beams, anchor bolts to the foundation, and sturdy 
plywood walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a repair bill that could have totaled $2.5 million, Karraa said he 
expects to pay about $1.1 million. That savings is critical for Karraa, who, 
like most apartment owners, didn't have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think an earthquake was going to hit," said Karraa, who operates a 
Tarzana-based property management firm. "Insurance would have cost $2,000 a 
month, and I'd rather go invest it in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the repairs -- as well as repairs on two other apartment buildings 
he owns -- Karraa secured a $1.5-million loan from the Small Business 
Administration, a federal agency that offers low-interest loans to disaster 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 He also persuaded his bank to forgive $652,000 of his $4.4-million mortgage, 
and to allow him to stop making his $15,000 monthly payments until he gets his 
first renter. 
</P>
<P>
 The building could be ready to rent by February, Karraa said. By offering a 
free month's rent to new tenants, and by reversing his former policy against 
pets, he expects the White Ridge apartments to be 90% occupied and breaking 
even within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an optimist," Karraa said.

QUAKE RECOVERY; SURRENDER; REBUILDING EFFORTS ARE A STUDY IN FRUSTRATION

 Across Lassen Street from Karraa's building, the Northridge Oaks apartment 
complex, and the fern, sit silently. Howard and Beverly Sachar built the 
97-unit complex in 1979, and collected profits exceeding $100,000 a year during 
the mid-1980s. When the quake hit, the Sachars were among the few who had quake 
insurance, but their rebuilding plans were entangled and finally suffocated in 
a web of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Their insurance company didn't pay its first visit to the property until 
nearly two weeks after the quake, Howard Sachar said, and didn't produce a 
damage estimate until May. Even then, the Sachars and the insurance company 
remained widely apart on how to go about repairing the building, and how much 
it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company said the building could be repaired without demolition, 
and offered $2 million, Sachar said. But the Sachars, who had consulted their 
own structural engineer, believed the building needed to be demolished, and 
suspected replacement costs could total $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sachars, who still own five other apartment buildings in the county, also 
became concerned with the liability risks of patching up the quake-damaged 
structure in Northridge. "If something goes wrong with that building, you're 
responsible," said Howard Sachar, 67, a former executive with TRW Inc. "Why 
would you want to risk your future?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And your children's future, and their children's future," added Beverly. "It 
goes down to all your heirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Sachars grew increasingly frustrated in their attempt to secure 
a $1-million SBA loan. By June, they had dealt with six different SBA loan 
officials, each of whom asked for a different batch of information. The last 
straw came when the Sachars, who live in Redondo Beach, were summoned to a 
meeting with a loan official staying at the Ritz-Carlton resort in Marina del 
Rey, accommodations the Sachars judged a bit pricey for a government worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "In June, I told the SBA to write me a letter and tell me what the hell they 
wanted so we could process this loan," Howard Sachar said. "I never heard from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking financing to tear down their building and start over, and exhausted 
from haggling with their insurance company, the Sachars surrendered. They took 
the insurance money, paid off the mortgage, and sold the complex for less than 
half the $5 million the property might have fetched five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave up," Beverly Sachar said. "We just gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners, a partnership headed by real estate developers McCormack Baron 
& Associates, said the Northridge Oaks will be demolished in February, and they 
hope a new building will be finished by the end of 1995.

 The 112-unit Woodridge apartment complex stretches along Plummer Street near 
Reseda Boulevard. Its facade of tan stucco and dark brown shingles reveals 
little quake damage, but the sagging east end of the complex dangles 
precariously over empty parking spaces, and is propped up on wooden boxes that 
look like coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Jones, co-owner of the property since it was built in 1970, shudders 
every time she looks across the street at the remains of the infamous 
Northridge Meadows apartment complex, where 16 people died in the quake. No one 
was injured at her complex, Jones said, and though one of her buildings 
collapsed, the other four at the complex are still standing. Still, Jones 
doesn't feel lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a day that goes by that doesn't have a new problem," said Jones, 
a clinical psychologist who lives in West Los Angeles. "When does this ease up? 
When can I get on with my life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, thieves have stripped her complex of its light fixtures, air 
conditioners, shower doors, and almost anything of value. Some looters pulled 
up in pickup trucks, which they loaded with items thrown from second-story 
windows. Recently, thieves cut electrical wiring in the apartments so they 
could take the circuit breakers. "They take anything," Jones said. "Even old 
used light bulbs." 
</P>
<P>
 The complex has also been a haven for squatters who crawl through broken 
windows, crash through quake-jammed doors, and sleep on mattresses left behind 
by tenants, Jones said. Some squatters have even started small fires in the 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Jones and a clean-up crew walked through the supposedly empty 
complex to remove rotting food left behind by tenants. They found toilets that 
hadn't worked since the quake filled with urine and feces. When the toilet 
bowls filled up, Jones said, the squatters simply relieved themselves on the 
carpet of a room next-door. 
</P>
<P>
 Even skateboarders have been a scourge, ruining the empty swimming pool by 
skating up one side and down the next. Jones tried to stop them by filling the 
pool with construction scaffolding, but the skateboarders simply removed the 
mini-roadblocks and skated on. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of vandalism and theft has already reached $150,000, Jones 
said, and it climbs a little higher every week. The problem has waned since 
electricity and lighting were restored to portions of the property. An employee 
of the construction crew Jones hired to rebuild the complex now sleeps in one 
of the undamaged apartments, she said, and the city has begun patrolling the 
ghost town neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones recently received a $1.5-million loan from the SBA. Jones said the loan 
should cover rebuilding costs, and she hopes to begin construction within a few 
weeks. But many uncertainties remain. After the complex is rebuilt, for 
instance, will anyone want to move in? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her former tenants were CSUN students, Jones said, and she went to 
great lengths to keep them happy. She kept rents relatively low -- $600 for a 
one-bedroom and $750 for a two-bedroom -- and rewarded good students by 
offering a $5 discount for every A on a tenant's report card. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 16 units were empty before the quake and occupancy rates have been 
sinking throughout Northridge in recent years. Even without any rental income, 
Jones must make monthly mortgage payments of about $12,000, and soon even more 
with her SBA loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the market is going to be like," Jones said. "I could rehab 
the building and then not be able to afford my SBA loan."

NASD CENSURES, FINES BROKER IN SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Burbank securities firm and one of its agents have been censured and fined 
by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers under a settlement reached with the 
association, which oversees member firms' trading in over-the-counter stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Following arbitration, Toluca Pacific Securities Corp. and Peter J. H. Blowitz 
agreed to pay a $10,000 fine and $14,747 in restitution for allegedly selling 
stock in the secondary market at unfair prices.They did not admit or deny the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD has taken disciplinary action against Blowitz previously. Also, in 
March, Blowitz was permanently barred by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
from future violations of certain securities laws. The SEC had alleged that 
Blowitz artificially inflated the price of a stock between November, 1986, and 
February, 1988.

 Short-Term T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $13.6 billion of 
new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.07%, up from 4.92% last 
week. Another $13.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 5.51%, up from 5.34%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 5.11% on Sept. 30, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since they averaged 5.59% on Aug. 5, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 5.21% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,871.80 and 5.75% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,721.40. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; TIME WARNER'S BERT WASSERMAN WILL RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time Warner confirmed Monday that Bert W. Wasserman will retire at the end of 
the year as executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The move had been rumored for weeks amid reports that Wasserman -- one of a 
dwindling number of Time Warner senior executives who had close links to the 
late Chairman Steven J. Ross -- had a falling-out with current Time Warner 
Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, 62, spent 28 years at Time Warner and predecessor Warner 
Communications, serving as a board member of the company from 1990 to 1993. The 
company said a search is under way for his replacement and that it "doesn't 
have a name to put forward now." The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this 
month that the favorite candidate was Stephen L. Key, chief financial officer 
of ConAgra Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner's Atlantic Records unit made official the naming of Ron Shapiro 
as senior vice president and West Coast general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, most recently vice president of media and artist relations, replaces 
Paul Cooper, who last week was named vice president of Warner Music-U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney Television & Telecommunications named Dean Valentine president 
of network television. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hachette Filipacchi's film office division named Franck Ribiere director of 
television development and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>

production for Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carla Fry was named vice president of production for New Line Productions. 
</P>
<P>

president of finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph A. Fischer, executive vice president of MCA's Motion Picture Group, 
was named a director of Harvey Entertainment Co., which is 10.6%-owned by MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mitch McDiffett has been promoted to vice president of financial planning 
and analysis at Sony Pictures Entertainment Television Group. He previously was 
a director of budgeting and forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. said it promoted Executive Vice President 
Jeffrey Kaplan to the new post of president and chief operating officer of its 
trading card company Fleer Entertainment Group Inc.

FIRMS TO PAY $750 MILLION FOR PIPE LEAKS; CONSUMERS: CLASS-ACTION SETTLEMENT 
CALLED LARGEST EVER FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. CHEMICAL COMPANIES ADMIT NO 
WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest legal settlements of its kind, three big chemical makers 
Monday agreed to pay at least $750 million to replace and pay for damage caused 
by leaky plastic plumbing installed in an estimated 6 million homes, apartments 
and businesses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Oil Co., DuPont Co. and Hoechst Celanese agreed to settle a Texas 
class-action lawsuit over an allegedly defective polybutylene piping system, 
which was touted during the 1980s as being more flexible and cheaper than other 
kinds of plastic or copper plumbing. The class-action settlement is believed to 
be the largest ever involving property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 While polybutylene was never approved for use in the city of Los Angeles, the 
gray plastic piping sold primarily under the Qest and Qick Sert II brand names 
was widely used in other parts of Southern California. An estimated 40,000 
homes in San Diego County, for instance, have polybutylene pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really popular where it was legal because it weighed a heck of a lot 
less (than other pipes), was easier to transport and much easier to work with," 
said Jeffrey Masters, a Century City attorney who represents many area home 
builders but is not involved in the class-action suit. Since polybutylene was 
so widely used, he said, "the question you would ask yourself is, is this 
(settlement) enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 The class-action suit, filed on behalf of all affected homeowners in 
September, 1993, alleged that the polybutylene systems leaked and caused 
millions of dollars of property damage. Consumers were never told the pipes and 
fittings would corrode and ultimately leak when exposed to chemicals such as 
chlorine, which is found in most U.S. drinking water, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative settlement, which is expected to be approved by the court 
in late 1995, eligible consumers who have suffered damage and related repair 
costs will receive total reimbursement. They must apply for reimbursement 
within a year after the court approves the agreement. The three firms will 
provide complete replumbing for consumers who have had at least two previous 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement will also cover future leaks based on when the system was 
installed. Homeowners will be eligible for reimbursement for up to 16 years 
after installation, depending on the makeup of their systems. Mobile homeowners 
will be eligible for 10 years after installation. 
</P>
<P>
 When a final settlement is reached, consumers will be instructed on how to 
file for reimbursement through advertisements and will be able to call a 
toll-free number for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 Polybutylene is a resin product developed by Shell to manufacture plumbing 
pipes. DuPont and Hoechst Celanese helped produce resins used to make fittings 
for the pipes, which were promoted for their durability.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the polybutylene systems were manufactured by other companies, 
including the U.S. Brass unit of Eljer Industries Inc., which filed for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection in May over plumbing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorneys for the homeowners said the larger chemical companies knew 
of the pipe's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shell participated in the marketing of the product," said Arthur Bryant, 
executive director of the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, a Washington-based 
public interest law firm and co-counsel on the class-action suit. "These 
companies knew when they were selling this plumbing that it would corrode on 
exposure to common drinking water." 
</P>
<P>
 The three companies agreed to the settlement without admitting any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hoechst Celanese is not liable for any alleged defects in such systems, which 
were designed, manufactured and marketed by other companies," said a statement 
issued by the Somerville, N.J.-based firm.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit does not cover consumers who had filed lawsuits before the 
class-action suit was filed. Those consumers will be reimbursed under separate 
settlements reached with the companies involved, an attorney said. Several 
other kinds of plastic pipes, including polyvinylchloride, or PVC, are not 
involved in the suit and have not produced any major problems.

T-BOND YIELDS ABOVE 8% SEND STOCKS TUMBLING; MARKETS: HIGHEST LONG-TERM 
INTEREST RATES SINCE APRIL, 1992, REFLECT STRENGTH IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND 
INFLATION FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields closed above 8% for the first time in 2 1/2 
years Monday, spurring another slump in the stock market and raising the stakes 
in the Federal Reserve Board's gamble to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, 
including mortgage rates, jumped to 8.04% on Monday from 7.97% on Friday amid a 
flurry of morning selling by bond traders. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bond yield had flirted with the psychologically important 8% level last 
week as market interest rates moved steadily higher, but Monday's session 
marked the first close above 8% since May, 1992, and was the highest yield on 
the bond since it hit 8.06% on April 29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, which had rallied in the morning thanks to continuing strong 
corporate earnings reports, gave up its gains in the afternoon and closed 
sharply lower. The Dow industrial average dropped 36 points to 3,855.30, 
bringing its losses over the past three sessions to 81 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts described the bond market's latest selloff, in a bear market that is 
already a year old, as a continuation of the same basic theme: Investors fear 
that the economy isn't slowing, and thus that the Fed will have to raise 
short-term interest rates further -- and perhaps dramatically -- to dampen 
growth in order to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said one catalyst for Monday's yield surge was traders' jitters over 
this Friday's scheduled government report on third-quarter economic growth. 
Fears are rising that the report will show the economy expanded at a fast pace 
in the quarter, despite five Fed rate hikes this year, the most recent in 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of another Fed rate hike were evident in Monday's weekly auction 
of three- and six-month Treasury bills, where yields rose to their highest 
levels in more than three years. The yield on six-month T-bills jumped to 5.75% 
from 5.57% a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is tightening credit for the Fed," said Kevin Logan, economist at 
Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. While the Fed is widely expected to wait until 
after the Nov. 8 election before making a decision about short-term rates, the 
market has already decided that the economy is strong enough to warrant higher 
rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as short-term rates continue to rise, investors have little incentive to 
buy long-term bonds, despite the relative attraction of 8%-plus yields, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, analysts say the danger is that the longer the Fed delays tightening, 
the bigger the eventual rate boost may have to be to allay market fears about 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment among bond investors has turned "overwhelmingly" negative, said 
Kevin McClintock, who manages $7 billion in bonds at Aeltus Investment 
Management in Hartford, Conn. "It's about as bearish as I've seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on investors Monday were concerns about a heavy new supply of 
bonds coming to market this week. The Treasury will sell a total of $28.25 
billion of new two- and five-year notes today and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the bond market virtually ignored a piece of good news, as 
President Clinton announced Monday that the fiscal 1994 federal budget deficit 
was $203 billion, the smallest in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the deficit, once the bond market's biggest bogeyman, has been 
eclipsed by worries about robust economic growth and potentially higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market Monday, an early rally in the Dow was credited to strong 
quarterly earnings from Caterpillar, an industrial issue that has become a 
symbol of the renaissance in American manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar closed up 1 7/8 to 58 1/4, but the broad market began to slide in 
late morning as bond yields rose, and most stocks closed near their lows for 
the day. On the NYSE, losers outnumbered winners by more than 2 to 1, though 
trading was moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major stock indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 lost 4.06 points to 
460.83, and the Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks fell 4.17 points to 
761.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive stocks such as banks and insurers were broadly lower as 
bond yields jumped. Citicorp fell 3/4 to 44 1/2, BankAmerica lost 5/8 to 42 
1/4, SunAmerica sank 1/2 to 37 1/2, Coast Savings lost 3/4 to 15 5/8 and 
Federal National Mortgage dropped 1 7/8 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers hit some industrial issues. Alcoa fell 2 1/2 to 86 1/4, Kodak 
lost 1 7/8 to 47 3/4 and International Paper dropped 2 to 76 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though third-quarter earnings reports have been generally positive for the 
market, a notable disappointment Monday was Airborne Freight, which plunged 6 
3/8 to 19 1/8 after reporting lower-than-expected results. 
</P>
<P>
 The news dragged other transportation issues lower, including Federal Express, 
off 1 3/4 to 61 7/8, and AMR, parent of American Airlines, down 1 5/8 to 51 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, Stratus Computer jumped 1 3/4 to 36 1/4 after it posted a 
sharp rise in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended down 46.71 points at 
19,852.37. In Frankfurt, the DAX index inched up 3.16 points to 2,025.38, while 
London's FTSE 100 index was off 3.7 points at 3,029.1. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar finished in New York at 1.494 German marks, 
compared to 1.499 on Friday in light trading. Against the Japanese yen, the 
dollar eased to 97.13 yen from 97.19. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, gasoline futures prices hit an eight-week high on 
continued worries over a severed Houston pipeline that has cut back shipments 
to the Northeast. November gasoline futures rose 2.59 cents to 52.46 cents a 
gallon on the New York Merc.

VIGILANCE IS STILL THE WATCHWORD; INVESTING: THE SEC'S PROPOSED NEW RULES WOULD 
AID CUSTOMERS. MARKET OFFICIALS SAY BUY-AND-HOLD POLICY IS BEST FOR INVESTORS.

 As the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission look into 
problems on Nasdaq, what can small investors do to protect themselves in the 
over-the-counter market? 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, at least, Ron F. Keller of San Jose has chosen the most 
extreme solution: He says he has decided to stop buying Nasdaq stocks, even 
though some of the country's fastest-growing companies are listed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq has become the nation's busiest stock market, with an average daily 
volume of nearly 300 million shares. As reported last week, the Justice 
Department's antitrust division has said it is looking into alleged 
anti-competitive practices on Nasdaq, including possible price fixing by market 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq and market makers have strongly denied there is any collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, a 59-year-old mechanical engineer who was forced to stop working 
because of medical problems, says he has spent much of his time over the last 
year trading Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange stocks in his individual 
retirement account. But Keller says that in the last nine months, he has come 
to realize that spreads as wide as half a point on a $10 stock make the 
possibility of near-term profits remote. (Spreads are the gap between the price 
market makers are willing to pay to buy a stock and the price at which they are 
willing to sell.) 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to get inside the spread by placing limit orders -- orders to buy or 
sell only at a specified price -- haven't worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller says he came to the decision to stop buying Nasdaq stocks on Oct. 14, 
after watching an interview on CNBC that led him to decide to buy shares 
immediately in Cyrix Corp., a Richardson, Tex.-based maker of microprocessors. 
He says he put in a limit order to buy 500 shares of the stock at $37.50, right 
in the middle of the spread of $37.25 bid, $37.75 asked. And as he continued to 
watch the TV screen, with the Nasdaq price tape flashing across the bottom, he 
saw trades being reported right at his price and better. Yet his limit order 
was never filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who uses deep-discount broker Waterhouse Securities, says his limit 
orders are almost never filled for Nasdaq stocks. "I feel I'm being treated 
unfairly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 John Chapel, the brokerage's president, says the failure to execute the order 
was an inevitable consequence of the "extreme fragmentation" of the Nasdaq 
market. He says Waterhouse sent the order to an independent market maker for 
execution, but because that dealer wasn't actively trading in Cyrix at the 
time, the limit order wasn't filled. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the SEC goes ahead with plans to impose strict new protections for 
small investors' limit orders, this problem is likely to be greatly improved. 
The SEC approved some new protections for customers' limit orders in June. If 
it approves a proposed next step, as seems likely, the cardinal rule for small 
investors on Nasdaq will be to place limit orders, as opposed to ordinary 
"market orders" to buy at the prevailing market price. Market orders are almost 
always filled at the quoted bid or asked price, seldom in between. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, market makers would no longer be allowed to let 
customers' limit orders sit while they trade for themselves at better prices. 
So investors such as Keller would have a much better chance of getting their 
limit orders executed, thus circumventing the wide spreads. However, the 
proposed SEC rule would not require market makers to accept limit orders at 
all, raising fears that some might stop doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would the new rules fix the highly fragmented nature of the Nasdaq market, 
which has multiple market makers for each stock and many separate computer 
systems handling orders for the same stocks at the same time. This means, for 
example, that a customer placing a sell order through one brokerage house may 
still not get it filled even though a matching limit order to buy at that price 
is sitting unfilled at another brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say brokers seldom tell customers about the advantages of limit 
orders. Kevin D. Clark, vice president for trading at Milwaukee-based Heartland 
Value Fund, says that "retail (stock)brokers in general don't want their 
clients to realize they can buy stock in between" the spreads by placing limit 
orders. One reason, he says, is that if the customer pays a lower price, the 
broker gets a lower commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the improvements proposed by the SEC, customers will still need to 
be vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran traders say investors should do as much independent research as 
possible about stocks before investing, and be especially wary of brokers who 
call them touting stocks, particularly if the broker says he can get it for you 
at a reduced or no commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, brokers get hidden payments known as "sales credits" from their firms' 
trading desks for selling certain Nasdaq stocks -- which customers seldom find 
out about. This occurs, for example, when a trading desk wants to get an 
unwanted position in a stock out of its inventory and calls on the brokers to 
sell it to the firms' retail customers, in effect paying the broker a bonus for 
doing so. As a result, the broker may have a personal financial motive to push 
a stock that is not in customers' best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dayan, 71, owner of a dressmaking company in New York, contends in 
documents filed in an arbitration case that he learned this lesson the hard 
way. His broker, Jonathan Lyons, at brokerage firm Gruntal & Co., heavily 
recommended Candela Laser Corp., a Nasdaq stock. In April, 1992, Lyons 
allegedly told Dayan that Candela was a "definite" takeover target. (In fact, 
the company is still independent, and the stock, which Dayan bought at prices 
above $12 a share, is currently trading for less than $3.) 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the recommendation, Dayan in three transactions bought 53,500 shares 
of Candela. The confirmation slips Gruntal sent to Dayan after each trade 
showed that he had paid $17,134 in commissions. But documents obtained in the 
arbitration case show that, including the hidden sales credits to Lyons, the 
commissions totaled $27,490. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry D. Frisch, a lawyer for Gruntal, denied that Gruntal breaks any rules by 
not telling customers about the extra sales credits it pays to brokers, a 
position the National Assn. of Securities Dealers has generally agreed with. 
Lyons has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kord Lagemann, Dayan's lawyer, says the only way customers can find 
out about the hidden credits is to ask -- and hope the brokerage firm gives an 
answer. Often, he says, brokerage firms refuse to disclose the sales credits to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran traders say that among other things customers can do to protect 
themselves: 
</P>
<P>
 * Invest in mutual funds instead of directly buying Nasdaq stocks. Mutual 
funds are usually able to buy Nasdaq stocks at prices inside the wide quoted 
spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 * Follow the advice of the NASD's president, Joseph R. Hardiman: Buy and hold 
Nasdaq stocks for the long term; don't do a lot of short-term trading. 
"Individuals should not trade a lot of stocks in the Nasdaq market," he says. 
By holding growth stocks for the long term, the initial cost of spreads and 
commissions becomes much less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harold Bradley, chief trader for the $27-billion Twentieth Century group 
of mutual funds in Kansas City, Mo., among others, says the steps individual 
investors can take are not enough. He says there must be additional action by 
securities regulators and even by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One step the securities industry has so far adamantly opposed is moving to 
"decimalization" -- quoting stock prices in hundredths of a dollar instead of 
what many market experts view as an archaic system of eighths. For most stocks, 
the smallest allowed spread, or price move, is one-eighth, or 12.5 cents. Under 
decimalization, already widely used in foreign stock markets, the smallest move 
would be one penny. So prices of anywhere from, say, $20.01 to $20.99 would be 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of decimal pricing say the current system of eighths keeps spreads 
artificially wide. It also hinders competition on price, since one dealer 
competing with another may not be willing to drop its price an entire eighth, 
but might be willing to cut it by a penny or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley and others say there should also be a move to one centralized computer 
system for handling Nasdaq limit orders. Such a centralized book already exists 
on the so-called auction markets, such as the NYSE. NASD Chief Operating 
Officer Richard G. Ketchum has said such a move would undermine Nasdaq as a 
"dealer" market in which multiple market makers compete on each stock, because 
it would hurt the market makers' profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bradley notes that most Nasdaq market makers themselves, as well as big 
institutional investors, now heavily use Instinet, a computerized system owned 
by Reuters, which in effect is a centralized limit-order book for the big 
players. It enables them to trade with each other instantaneously, getting 
prices inside the wide spreads. Small investors and even some small market 
makers don't have access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How likely is it that there will be major changes on Nasdaq? 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department investigation is in its early stages, sources say, and 
price-fixing cases are often difficult to prove. Even if the department isn't 
able to bring an antitrust case, however, Junius W. Peake, a finance professor 
at the University of Northern Colorado and a former vice chairman of the NASD's 
board of governors, says he thinks the spotlight put on Nasdaq by the antitrust 
inquiry is likely to spur the SEC and the NASD itself to bring about changes, 
especially to narrow spreads and give more protection to small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC's division of market regulation has direct responsibility for 
overseeing the NASD. It has come under some criticism in recent years for not 
cracking the whip more strongly. Critics note that there are longstanding 
relationships between SEC market regulation officials and the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum, the NASD chief operating officer, is a former SEC chief of market 
regulation. Brandon Becker, the current chief of market regulation, confirms 
that he is a personal friend of Ketchum's and that the two in recent years have 
socialized at each other's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Becker and Ketchum strongly deny that this has had any influence on 
SEC regulation of the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. has indicated in public SEC meetings that he is 
anxious to move more quickly to remedy some inequities on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, investors and even executives of companies whose stocks are 
listed on Nasdaq say the market, divided up into 510 market-making firms for 
more than 4,800 stocks, is difficult to understand, sometimes preventing public 
investors from making intelligent decisions about buying and selling stocks. 
About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic Nasdaq market has grown into the nation's busiest marketplace 
for buying and selling stocks, with trading volumes exceeding those of the 
better-known New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of 
Intel, Microsoft, MCI, Apple Computer and other leading firms, as well as those 
of hundreds of smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are questioning the fundamental fairness of Nasdaq's trading system, 
however, and the Justice Department has begun investigating alleged price 
fixing and other illegal activities.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER: 'DREAM TEAM'S' 1ST PROJECT: MASTERING 
SPIN CONTROL 
</P>

 As Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen go about forming the 
most ambitious Hollywood studio since the days of Charlie Chaplin, they've 
already accomplished self-promotional feats worthy of another early show 
business legend: P.T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
 The media blitz behind the new studio, which is still more concept than 
reality, has been masterfully handled even by modern-day spin control 
standards. And the credit clearly belongs to the three entertainment icons 
themselves -- Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen -- who have wrested control of 
the flow of information by parceling out details about their evolving plans 
like political patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 Timely and well-targeted disclosures about a possible MCA partnership, a 
late-night strategic meeting among the three after a White House dinner 
honoring Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, scouting trips to possible studio 
locales and a pilgrimage to the home of Hollywood's reigning patriarch, MCA 
Chairman Lew Wasserman, have all added to the aura surrounding the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen even christened themselves the "Dream Team," 
apparently figuring it was needlessly risky to allow someone else to apply an 
appellation. The outcome has been the kind of propaganda campaign more closely 
associated with Yeltsin's former buddies in the Politburo than modern-day 
Hollywood. But by virtue of their success, Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen 
have achieved ultimate media manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their campaign started with an unexpected call to reporters Oct. 11, with the 
news that a "very important" news conference was planned for the following 
morning with Jeffrey Katzenberg. The message was compelling: Be at the 
Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills at 10 a.m, and by all means reserve space on 
Page 1. Something big was about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of tease is like waving a red flag in front of reporters -- a 
challenge to beat the newsmakers to the punch. Within two hours, word began 
filtering through Hollywood that the announcement probably concerned a new 
company involving Katzenberg and his two closest friends, Spielberg and Geffen. 
That perception was fueled by the fact that the three executives, who are 
normally accessible to the entertainment press, turned away or tried to avoid 
calls to their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 By the morning of the news conference, the secret was out. The Los Angeles 
Times and the Hollywood trade papers carried front-page stories on the planned 
studio. The New York Times got something into its late edition, and the Wall 
Street Journal ran a speculative story. Sources say this infuriated Katzenberg, 
Spielberg and Geffen, who had hoped to use the glitzy conference -- complete 
with smoked salmon and fresh berries -- to trumpet their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were soon back in control, staging an event that had more of the 
flavor of a Hollywood A-list party than a news conference, with top talent 
agents such as Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, CAA President 
Ron Meyer, International Creative Management President Jim Wiatt and United 
Talent Agency partner Jim Berkus milling about with studio executives, 
Hollywood lawyers and Spielberg's and Katzenberg's wives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With all of them looking on, events unfolded like a love fest. Katzenberg 
intoned to the media, "I look at the three of us, and think, 'This has got to 
be the Dream Team.' " Added Spielberg: "We're interested in creating a company 
that will outlive us all." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the scenes, the story was already moving past the happy talk and 
the vague details revealed that morning. The big rumor that began circulating 
immediately after the news conference was that the Dream Team was actually 
engaged in a much grander master plan to join in a bid for MCA Inc. with its 
top executives, Wasserman and Sidney J. Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 By the next day, it was still unclear whether the rumor was true or part of a 
team effort to aid Wasserman and Sheinberg in their negotiations to gain more 
autonomy from MCA's parent, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. In any event, 
the payoff was more front-page coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, the media queued up for the inevitable play-by-play accounts 
of the deal. But, unlike their colleagues in the past, Katzenberg, Spielberg 
and Geffen didn't just passively respond to the inevitable flood of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 One publication was fed the dramatic-sounding story of how they had agreed to 
form the studio after attending a White House dinner honoring Yeltsin. Another 
got the blow-by-blow reconstruction of their movements afterward, including the 
seminal meeting with MCA's Wasserman. Spielberg even offered up the details of 
his deliberations with his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, who worried about the 
demands on his time. 
</P>
<P>
 The major news magazines followed with other selected studio details. 
Hollywood's trade papers, meanwhile, were bursting with coverage of every 
conceivable angle. Between them, Variety and the Hollywood Reporter ran close 
to 20 stories in the first 10 days after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 An odd and distracting sideshow to the whole spectacle, especially for people 
who were supposed to be busy birthing a studio, was an unattributed attack on 
CAA's Ovitz, who happens to represent Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Post gossip columnist Neal Travis reported that Ovitz was somehow 
being blamed by Spielberg for the studio plans being revealed early to the 
press. Sources close to Katzenberg and Geffen had been peddling that unlikely 
scenario since the news conference, but the Post was the first outlet to buy 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation of a fight, which was publicly denied by Spielberg and CAA, 
seemed to be merely spillover from Katzenberg's and Geffen's long-running feud 
with Ovitz. But it continued to fester as the Washington Post printed the 
supposed leak as fact and tried to make the case that Ovitz was dubious about 
the new studio, which is an odd notion since it's likely to create millions of 
dollars in new business for clients of his and other talent agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with that non-issue finally fading, the Dream Team's attention has turned 
more recently to splashy magazines like Vanity Fair and Premiere, which will 
hit the stands in the coming weeks. Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen have 
already taken advantage of the inevitable photo op with Vanity Fair's Annie 
Leibovitz, and will be showcased in countless other stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big test still looms. The trio has yet to reveal the name of its 
studio, line up the financing needed to go into full-throttle operation or lay 
out concrete creative plans. With a possible bid for MCA on hold, the partners 
are scouting studio space in a new development in Playa del Rey to replace 
their temporary headquarters at Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after expending so much energy on image and the press, the plain truth is 
that they have yet to prove that their dream machine is more than just a 
publicity machine.

 Pfizer Touts New Arthritis Drug: The drug Tenidap is the first to ease pain, 
improve mobility and slow a crippling form of arthritis, and marks a major 
advance in treating rheumatoid arthritis, Pfizer Inc. research executives told 
a meeting of stock analysts.Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 2 million people 
in the United States, mostly women. It can eventually freeze many of the 
joints, distort hands and fingers and leave its victims helpless to perform 
even basic tasks. Pfizer also hopes to use Tenidap for the more common but less 
serious form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, which affects about 15 million 
mostly elderly Americans.

CARRIERS MOVE TO MATCH NORTHWEST'S HOLIDAY FARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major airlines said Monday they will match fare cuts initiated by Northwest 
Airlines that will slash ticket prices by as much as 40% during much of the 
peak holiday travel season, traditionally the most profitable time of the year 
for U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel industry experts say that Northwest's move was unusual, since airlines 
customarily "black out" discounted travel from Dec. 16 to Jan. 2. Still, 
airlines are finding that many consumers simply won't travel unless they 
receive a discount, putting pressure on carriers to offer more fare sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers "always wait until another deal comes through," said Dianne 
LaPorte, vice president of World Travel in Santa Ana. "The mentality is, if you 
miss this sale, there will be another one." 
</P>
<P>
 The fare reductions by Northwest, for example, could cut the price of a 
round-trip ticket from Orange County to Minneapolis to $398, down from $468, or 
a round-trip from LAX to Memphis for $388, down from $450. American, United, 
Continental and Delta, among others, all matched the fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no discounts are being offered on the five most popular days around 
the holidays: including the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after 
as well as the Friday before Christmas Day, which falls on a Sunday this year. 
The other two dates on which the discounts don't apply are Dec. 26 and Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The deepest discounts are available during midweek, but the tickets are 
non-refundable and must be purchased by Friday for travel between Nov. 24 and 
Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives holiday travelers a last chance to buy some good discounts," 
Northwest spokesman Jim Faulkner said Monday. "They probably won't see holiday 
discounts like this again." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, United Airlines said its Shuttle by United will 
match the $39 fare for flights inside California started by Southwest Airlines. 
The tickets must be purchased at least 21 days in advance.

SAVINGS & LOAN; TRIAL OPENS FOR FORMER HEAD OF COLUMBIA; COURTS: PROSECUTORS 
PORTRAY THOMAS SPIEGEL AS GREEDY, WHILE HIS LAWYERS SAY HE LOST MILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Federal prosecutors Monday portrayed Thomas Spiegel as an unscrupulous banker 
who treated Columbia Savings & Loan as if it were his personal piggy bank, but 
his lawyers said that Spiegel never broke any laws and was among the biggest 
losers when the Beverly Hills-based thrift failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad D. Brian, lead attorney for the thrift's former chief executive, told 
jurors in his opening remarks that Spiegel personally lost $140 million because 
of the thrift's demise, and Spiegel's family lost about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel and his relatives once owned more than half the stock of Columbia, 
which was seized by the government in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian also said that one of the prosecution's chief witnesses, the owner of a 
luxury auto dealership who made a deal with the government to plead guilty to 
two counts of defrauding Columbia, is "a liar . . . (and) a con man" who will 
testify against Spiegel in an effort to gain a lighter sentence for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Spiegel did not defraud or steal from Columbia," Brian told jurors in the 
Downtown Los Angeles federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney has filed 45 felony counts ranging from bribery and fraud to 
misappropriation of funds against Spiegel, who the government claims looted the 
thrift of millions over a four-year period before he resigned at the end of 
1989. Regulators say the bailout should cost taxpayers about $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant's motive was simple: greed," said John F. Walsh, the 
government's chief prosecutor, claiming that Spiegel turned to fraud because he 
felt that the millions he earned as Columbia's president and chief executive 
was not enough to match the earnings of his friend, junk bond king Michael 
Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 The effectiveness of the prosecution's opening remarks seemed somewhat diluted 
by Judge Robert M. Takasugi's pretrial ruling that the term "junk bond" could 
not be used in front of jurors because it could make them prejudicial against 
Spiegel. Columbia was once one of Milken's biggest customers, and its earnings 
collapsed when the market for the risky securities collapsed in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the term banned inside the courtroom, Walsh was forced to refer to the 
bonds as "high-yield, high-risk" securities. However, he also mentioned 
Milken's name about a dozen times in his hour-long opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Brian, in opening remarks that took about 90 minutes, put 
much of the blame for Columbia's collapse on the federal government. He said 
legislation passed in 1989 forced the thrift to mark down and sell its bond 
portfolio in a sour market, causing the thrift to become insolvent just one 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
 While the prosecution showed jurors simple black-and-white charts in its 
attempt to explain Spiegel's complex business dealings and alleged misdeeds, 
Brian used a wide-screen television to show color pictures ranging from a chart 
that depicted Columbia's explosive earnings growth in the mid-1980s to a 
photograph of Spiegel and his elderly father, Abraham.

SAVINGS & LOANS; FORMER LINCOLN OFFICIAL GETS PROBATION, FINE; SENTENCING: JUDY 
J. WISCHER AIDED AUTHORITIES IN THEIR PROBE OF KEATING AND $3.4-BILLION 
COLLAPSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal judge in Los Angeles Monday sentenced Judy J. Wischer, once the top 
aide to former Lincoln Savings & Loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr., -- to 
three years of probation and ordered her to pay $3.5 million in restitution for 
her role in Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer's sentencing ends the long investigation and court proceedings against 
those responsible for the thrift industry's most notorious failure during the 
go-go 1980s. Lincoln's failure in 1989 is expected to cost taxpayers $3.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bankruptcy of the S&L's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. in Phoenix, wiped out nearly 22,000 investors, most of them elderly 
Southern Californians. The investors lost a total of more than $285 million, 
though they eventually recovered about 70% of that by filing civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, 70, whose arrogance and outspokenness made him the national symbol 
for greed and excess in the thrift industry, is serving concurrent sentences 
totaling 12 years, 7 months for his racketeering, conspiracy and fraud 
convictions in state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Assistant U.S. Atty. Alice C. Hill and defense attorney Donald C. 
Randolph had asked the court to put Wischer on probation. She had faced up to 
15 years in prison for her 1992 guilty plea to two bank fraud charges and a 
securities fraud charge. As part of a plea bargain, she agreed to testify 
against Keating and to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement to U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, Wischer 
apologized for hurting others, particularly the small investors who bought 
risky American Continental bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I'd like to say I'm very sorry," she said, her voice trembling. "I 
regret the losses, especially to the bondholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer praised Wischer for cooperating with federal prosecutors and the FBI 
and said her testimony at Keating's federal trial two years ago was crucial to 
convicting the former Arizona businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think the case could have been prosecuted without you," said 
Pfaelzer, who presided over the trial. "I thought that when I was listening to 
the testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with liquidating failed 
thrifts, told Pfaelzer in a letter that Wischer's cooperation was a 
"substantial factor" in recovering $80 million from lawyers, accountants and 
other professionals who helped Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she provided information on Lincoln's deals with thrifts in 
Arizona, Colorado and Texas. Besides helping the RTC, she also traveled to 
Washington to help the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in various investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer, did not help state prosecutors in their case against Keating. She did 
not enter a plea to six counts of state securities fraud until after Keating 
was convicted in state court. Under her state plea bargain, she will be given 
an identical probation term to be served concurrently with her federal term.

 FTC Makes Second Inquiry on Lockheed-Martin Merger: The Federal Trade 
Commission has asked for further information from Lockheed Corp. and Martin 
Marietta Corp. about their $10-billion merger plan.Lockheed said a second 
inquiry, extending the review period, was to be expected with such a complex 
proposal. The agency will decide whether the merger would violate antitrust 
laws. It can ask for information only twice and must respond within 20 days of 
receiving supplemental information. Lockheed said it hopes to win approval in 
time for the two aerospace companies to be combined during the first quarter of 
1995.

HOSPITAL 'REPORT CARDS' TO BE MADE PUBLIC FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS MAIER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once-secret report cards issued to 11,000 U.S. hospitals, nursing homes and 
other health providers will gradually be made public, starting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the detailed performance reports prepared every three years by the 
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations remained 
confidential.The agency would say only whether an institution was accredited. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, for the first time, the commission will release its latest surveys 
of about 700 hospitals, 450 home care programs and 160 nursing homes and other 
long-term care facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's dramatic change of policy comes at a time when employers, 
insurers and consumers -- along with the Clinton Administration -- are calling 
for greater public disclosure about the strengths and weaknesses of health care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much more information than we've ever given the public," commission 
spokeswoman Alice Brown said. "It will help people decide if they want to go to 
a certain health care organization for care." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials acknowledged a certain uneasiness within the medical community. 
"I don't know if anyone ever likes getting a report card," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each survey released will provide an "overall evaluation score" for each 
hospital and health provider. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of America's hospitals and health care facilities are accredited by 
the commission. Copies of reports of providers that have been evaluated can be 
obtained from the commission by calling (708) 916-5800 starting next month. The 
cost is $30.

OIL COMPANIES REPORT GENERALLY STRONG QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big oil companies reported generally stronger quarterly results Monday, 
reflecting higher prices for crude oil but weaker refining profits and a sharp 
drop in natural gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, reported a 15% drop in earnings 
compared to last year's results, which were inflated by one-time gains. Without 
those, Exxon would have shown a 10% earnings increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co. said results were boosted by $273 million in after-tax 
income from a stock sale by Arco subsidiary Vastar Resources Inc. Even without 
that boost, earnings would have been higher, with oil and gas profits 
increasing more than sevenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Amoco's profit dropped 14% because of one-time costs recorded this year for 
cleanups of old refineries and a special gain last year. Amoco's profit would 
have risen 7% without the special items. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon said it earned $1.16 billion, or 92 cents a share. In 1993's third 
quarter, profit was $1.36 billion, or $1.09 per share. Exxon's results last 
year were elevated by $306 million worth of tax credits and asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose nearly 6%, to $29.6 billion from $27.9 billion in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Arco earned $435 million, or $2.67 a share, on revenue of 
$4.42 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. A year ago, the company earned $68 
million, or 42 cents a share, on revenue of $4.69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Amoco said it earned $445 million, or 89 cents a share, for the 
three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $520 million, or $1.05 a share, for 
the same period a year ago, when the results included $70 million in special 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 10%, to $7.8 billion from $7.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir Group Inc.'s losses widened slightly in the third quarter as revenue 
languished. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarter was marred by two fatal crashes. A Boeing 737 crashed near 
Pittsburgh last month and a DC-9 crashed in heavy rain near the Charlotte, 
N.C., airport in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh crash hurt bookings for at least a month and revenue was lower 
than the company expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arlington, Va.-based carrier lost $180.1 million, or $3.32 per share, in 
the three months ended Sept. 30., compared to a loss of $177.6 million, or 
$3.33 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The company had fewer 
shares outstanding last year, skewing the per-share results. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue was flat in the quarter at $1.75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing continuing improvement in its workers' compensation lines, Fremont 
General Corp. said its quarterly earnings increased 24%. The Santa Monica-based 
company reported third-quarter net income of $14.1 million, or 90 cents a 
share, compared to $11.4 million, or 78 cents a share, for the corresponding 
period of 1993. Quarterly revenue was up 4% to $173.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont General Corp. is a holding company, engaged through subsidiaries in 
select insurance and financial service businesses.

 Mobil May Cut 15,000 Support Jobs Mobil Corp. announced plans to eliminate up 
to that many staff positions worldwide in an effort to eliminate "hundreds of 
millions of dollars" in overhead costs.Mobil currently employs 60,000. The cuts 
could involve as much as 40% of the support staff at Mobil headquarters in 
Fairfax, Va. Support staff jobs range from clerical workers and computer 
programmers to lawyers and accountants. In many cases, the cuts will involve 
consolidating overlapping functions or eliminating operations by contracting 
out the work. Staff support services currently account for 25% of Mobil's 
controllable cash expenses. In recent years, Mobil has eliminated 17,000 jobs 
worldwide at an estimated annual savings of $700 million.

 Proposed Railroad Merger Scrapped: Plans by Illinois Central Corp. to buy 
Kansas City Southern Industries' 2,500-mile rail operations for about $686 
million in stock were terminated, the companies announced, citing a failure to 
agree "on a number of issues." The merger would have created the nation's 
seventh-largest railroad by linking two north-south systems that cover the 
nation's midsection. Kansas City Southern said it also canceled plans to spin 
off its mutual funds and financial services lines, which include the Janus and 
Berger fund families.

COMPANY TOWN; WARONKER TURNS DOWN OFFER OF TOP JOB WHEN OSTIN LEAVES WARNER 
RECORDS IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tensions mounted Monday at Time Warner Inc.'s New York headquarters as Warner 
Bros. Records President Lenny Waronker rejected an offer to take control of the 
label in January when Chairman Mo Ostin steps down. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I love this company and its artist roster, I just can't take this 
job," said the 52-year-old executive, who sources predict will leave the 
flagship label of Time Warner's $5.4-billion music division before his contract 
expires in 1996. "The way things are right now, it just doesn't feel right." 
</P>
<P>
 Waronker declined to comment further, but sources say he is upset about recent 
restructuring moves made by Warner Music Group Chairman Robert J. Morgado, 
which included forcing out Ostin and former Elektra Entertainment chief Robert 
Krasnow. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate drama continued to unfold Monday behind closed doors at Time 
Warner as high-level meetings were called to discuss complaints about Morgado's 
stormy relations with other key executives within the Warner Music Group, 
parent of Warner Bros. Records, The Atlantic Group and Elektra Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say top brass at the media giant has voiced concern about a wholesale 
exodus of executives as well as superstar acts such as R.E.M., which may soon 
follow Waronker out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Metallica, another best-selling rock group, has already blamed Morgado's 
"arrogant" behavior for a lawsuit it filed to sever its decade-long association 
with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions held by senior officials Friday and Monday focused primarily on 
reducing the scope of Morgado's powers, insiders say. Morgado could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a long-anticipated restructuring of Elektra/EastWest will kick in 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About three dozen employees and a handful of recording acts are expected to be 
issued pink slips as the firm's new chair, Sylvia Rhone, seeks to streamline 
expenses and consolidate operations at Elektra and EastWest, which were merged 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Sire Records chief Seymour Stein is expected to be named president of 
Elektra/EastWest soon and to be joined in the transition by his highly 
respected sidemen, Howie Klein and Joe McEwen. 
</P>
<P>
 EastWest employees will vacate the label's former suite in the Atlantic Group 
building on Sunset Boulevard and move to Elektra's Beverly Hills office, which 
will operate as the firm's West Coast branch.

COMPANY TOWN; CAN TECHNOLOGY BRIGHTEN THE PICTURE?; ECONOMY: STATE TURNS TO JPL 
IMAGING FOR HELP HOLDING ON TO PRODUCTION WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSANNE GAYLE HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an alarming share of production moving out of state and California in 
need of a boost, the California Film Commission hoped NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory might use its technological talents to earn a star on Hollywood's 
Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the CFC, envisioning a high-tech marketing tool to stimulate local 
production, asked the Pasadena-based JPL to design a computer imaging program 
for its location photo library -- one that would enable location scouts to view 
shooting sites and obtain filming permits on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 After a labor-intensive collaboration, an initial prototype of the new 
"Library Automation Project" was completed last month. But while it should 
fulfill its promise to strengthen the CFC's competitive advantage, that 
advantage may be short-lived: Rival film commissions have been pressing the CFC 
to reveal the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been approached by other film commissions about the system we're 
developing, but (we) must walk a fine line between protecting California's 
economic interests and promoting the global interests of the California-based 
film industry," says CFC director Patti Stolkin Archuletta. "Of course, we want 
to cooperate, but our first responsibility is to strengthen California's 
competitive advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone in the image technology business -- from on-line services to 
photo CD firms -- has lobbied relentlessly in recent years for film commissions 
worldwide to automate their location photo libraries. But in an era when 
intellectual property rights are redefined by each new deal, how real is that 
advantage? 
</P>
<P>
 The JPL's basic technology is available to any U.S. film commission, since the 
CFC obtained it in a non-exclusive deal. But the CFC has the first option to 
license its exclusive commercial rights for a renewable, two-year term in a 
deal with the JPL. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the tool used to create a database is available to anyone, you can't 
create a competitive advantage simply from the rights to license it," says 
Roger McNamee, a partner in Menlo Park, Calif.-based Integral Capital Partners, 
a software investment firm. "Other factors then become important, like lead 
time in the marketplace, quality of the database and how user-friendly it is." 
</P>
<P>
 At risk is California's $16.3-billion production industry, which employs 
164,000 residents directly and 184,000 others in supporting businesses from 
catering to advertising. Other filming venues throughout the United States and 
Canada have captured millions of production dollars by cutting red tape, 
handling film companies with kid gloves and, most importantly, offering 
financial incentives such as cheaper labor and tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, California has lost 60% of all current one-hour TV dramas and 
made-for-TV movies to other locations -- a record loss. And though local 
feature film production has remained stable, technological advances will soon 
enable facilities throughout North America to challenge Hollywood's 95% hold on 
producing situation comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new electronic library won't resolve the crucial issue of higher 
local production costs, the CFC believes its sheer volume of resources and 
their accessibility will have a big impact on production company decision 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu-driven program -- based on computer systems that enable scientists to 
study the massive volumes of planetary images collected during explorations of 
outer space -- will allow production personnel to view more than 200,000 site 
photos from multiple perspectives. It will include logistical, historical and 
aesthetic information for landscapes and buildings; list nearby vendors for 
equipment, food and lodging; combine still photos with full-motion video, and 
provide mapping capabilities, elevation and even weather information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some scientists want planetary information relevant to a specific scientific 
problem and others want peripheral information, so we've had to learn to handle 
huge data sets quickly," says the JPL's J. David Nichols, who never expected to 
be in show business. "Similarly, if you want a site location for a cowboy 
movie, you could call up images of Western street scenes all over California, 
while the next user could take a video tour of the interior of an urban 
building or warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 On the commercial front, 10 film commissions and several major studios are 
already testing Kodak's Eastman Exchange Location Search Network -- a photo CD 
imaging system designed to create a global hookup for location scouting. While 
the CFC has not signed on with Kodak, last June the two innovators did agree to 
collaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, state government has pledged an undisclosed annual sum to develop the 
system -- to be funded in stages -- and NASA has committed $150,000 in 
personnel hours every year for three years. But the CFC suffered a minor 
setback last week when the Clinton Administration's Telecommunications and 
Information Infrastructure Assistance Program denied its request for a $250,000 
grant. Eventually, the California Department of Trade and Commerce, the CFC's 
parent agency, hopes to expand the new database to promote tourism and real 
estate development statewide.

 Earnings: Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said its third-quarter profit jumped 71% due 
to strong advertising business at its broadcasting and publishing units, with 
revenue rising 12%. The owner of the ABC network said it earned $133.7 million 
in the three months ended Oct. 2, compared to $78.3 million a year earlier, and 
that revenue climbed to $1.46 billion.Income from operations jumped 64% to $243 
million, due in part to rising ratings and advertiser demand at ABC. The 
company's eight TV stations showed substantial increases in operating profit, 
due to rising ad demand and cost-control efforts. Capital Cities also reported 
improved results from the ESPN cable sports channel and publishing operations. 
For the first nine months of the year, the company earned $439.2 million, 
compared to $288.5 million a year earlier.

INTEL SPREAD IS CUT BY HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nasdaq market makers Monday abruptly gave up half their profit margin on 
trading Intel Corp. stock, the over-the-counter market's second-largest 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread on the stock -- the gap between the bid price at which market 
makers were willing to buy the stock, and the higher asked price at which they 
were willing to sell -- narrowed to 12.5 cents and remained there all day. For 
years, traders said, the stock's narrowest spread had been 25 cents, except for 
periods of a few minutes in recent months when two small, maverick market 
makers cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing quotation for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer chip maker's 
stock was $59.375 bid, $59.50 asked. Most New York Stock Exchange-listed 
companies, including many much smaller than Intel, have spreads of 12.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that it had begun an antitrust 
investigation into possible collusion among Nasdaq market makers to keep 
spreads wide. A six-part Times series on Nasdaq trading has also raised 
questions about the spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq and the big market makers have denied there is any collusion to set 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 National Assn. of Securities Dealers spokesman James D. Spellman said Morgan 
Stanley & Co., a Wall Street investment bank and a major Nasdaq market maker, 
began cutting the spread on Intel on Friday. Morgan Stanley and nearly all of 
the stock's 62 other market makers in the past had quoted the stock only in 
increments of 25 cents, which meant the spread couldn't be less than that. But 
Friday the firm began quoting bid and asked prices in eighths, such as $60.125 
or $59.875. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of trading Monday, most other market makers joined in, for 
the first time quoting the stock in odd eighths. Spellman said the NASD "had no 
idea" what led to the narrowing. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Tracey Gordon said 
she wasn't immediately able to provide comment from the firm late Monday. SCOT

MEASURE FUELS A NEW LATINO CAMPUS ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Motivated by rage and adrenaline and, yes, the desire to cut class, students 
throughout Los Angeles County have been walking out of schools by the hundreds 
during the past two weeks, protesting Proposition 187, a ballot measure they 
perceive as disrespectful of their very genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning at Paramount High School, students were filled with elation and 
gossip from Friday's march against the controversial immigration initiative. 
The march prompted the strongest law enforcement response so far to the 
uprisings: stingball grenades thrown by sheriff's deputies into a crowd of 
about 450 teen-agers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during (morning) assembly that we all just walked out," junior Martin 
Hidalgo recalled, smiling at the fresh memory. "People were talking about it 
(walking out) in the back of the room and then we just went. . . . It was all 
Latinos. We were all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the East Los Angeles "blowouts" of 1968, when more than 1,000 
students marched from their classrooms to expose substandard education, has an 
issue so coalesced local Latino students. Under Proposition 187, undocumented 
students would no longer qualify for a free public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been kind of happy to see that finally something has happened to move 
young people to get involved again," said Father Pat Murphy, a member of a San 
Fernando Valley community group opposed to the initiative. "I think it's 
touching them because they're looking at the possibility of not being able to 
go to school. That's something people have worked hard to get a right to." 
</P>
<P>
 "Young students are very moralistic; they deal in what is fair," said Rudy 
Acuna, professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge. "This proposition 
is clear-cut racism to them, and it's clear-cut that it's about them, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The student protests continued Monday at several schools, including an early 
morning march at Reseda High School, in which administrators and teachers 
walked along with about 200 students, provided a bullhorn, then held a 
lunchtime debate on the anti-illegal-immigration measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda as at other schools, Latinos were joined by a few students of other 
races and ethnicities who shared their concerns about the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at Marshall Fundamental Secondary School in Pasadena, Armenian 
immigrant Serob Zetilyn, 16, was among 200 students who walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of friends who will have to quit school if Proposition 187 
passes because they're illegal," Serob said. "Plus classes will be smaller and 
some teachers will get fired. I want people to know that students disagree with 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 From Pasadena to Long Beach, Reseda to South Gate, some who have walked out 
are openly proud of their newfound activism while others fear recrimination 
from school administrators. But most share a basic understanding of why they so 
vehemently oppose the measure that would limit illegal immigrants' access to 
public services -- including education -- and why they are willing to speak 
with their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the marchers say, is an insult to their parents, their 
ancestors, their friends and neighbors. This, they say, opens the door to 
discrimination against them just because they are brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is mostly a Latino school and everyone's proud of their heritage -- they 
want to defend it," said Vicky Velasco, a 15-year-old sophomore at Paramount, 
where, during the morning footrace to class, teen-age chatter slips fluidly 
between English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county at Huntington Park High School, Stephanie Bernal and her 
friends are surprised to find themselves gathering before class and during 
lunch breaks to discuss such heavy topics as politics, lobbying and social 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal likes to call herself a "mixed chocolate swirl." Half Latino, half 
Anglo, her contact with Mexico -- the land of her mother's family -- has always 
been fleeting and apolitical. But now Bernal, a senior, is among those 
organizing her school's anti-187 movement and reveling in her ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're worried about what happens if it passes, it feels great 
right now just to be doing something about it," said Bernal, who helped plan 
four recent walkouts, the most recent last Thursday. "When we get together to 
talk about it, we speak Spanish and just feel good about being Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 At a variety of campuses, student plans already are in the works to continue 
the protests -- which began in Pomona Oct. 12 -- during the weeks before the 
vote and to stage a student sickout before the Nov. 8 election.  
</P>
<P>
 Who is behind the efforts remains in dispute, and accounts vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Student recollections of the days and incidents leading up to the walkouts are 
vague -- someone told them to leave when the tardy bell rang; their friend said 
it would happen at the start of lunch; they heard it started with a guy from 
another school who has a car; they saw people walking and they went along. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sofia Barra, 14, who participated in four walkouts that started 
at South Gate High School, the majority of those involved at her school have 
been girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys just fool around too much, all they do is joke around," said Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pomona, school administrators blame adult community activists for 
organizing the student march to Pomona City Hall. Fabian Nunez, director of a 
Pomona immigrant rights group called La Alianca, says, however, that high 
school students came to him seeking advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the formal anti-187 campaign have denied responsibility for 
the student actions or, for that matter, the huge Oct. 16 protest march by 
70,000 people through Downtown. Several students interviewed Monday attended 
the Downtown march and said it was there that they first heard people 
advocating school walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they decided to act after watching television, both because of 
news reports of marches from other schools and because of a pro-187 
advertisement that students refer to simply as "that commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which shows people scurrying across the California-Mexico border at 
night, caused Latinos at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale to angrily plan a 
walkout last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insulting," said sophomore Jorge Higareda. "They show Mexicans, but they 
don't show Asians coming over in boats or anybody else. It's like we're the 
only ones coming here. And then they call us illegal. Well, everybody here is 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leuzinger students did not even get out the door. Campus security guards 
rounded up the 20 organizers before they could rally others and took them 
straight to Principal Sonja Davis' office. Davis called in the district 
superintendent and a district mediation specialist, and the three talked with 
the students for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing back to class after Monday's Reseda High protest, organizer Miriam 
Peniche said she and several friends got the idea for the walkout from other 
schools where protests already had occurred. They wanted to make a public 
statement, the senior said, and even asked the principal to call local news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they cannot condone cutting classes, many school administrators and 
teachers also philosophically oppose the ballot measure, which, if enforced, 
would require them to report suspected illegal students and their parents to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the Tomas Rivera Center of superintendents of 50 districts 
with large Latino student populations found that 71% perceived no potential 
benefits in Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of enthusiasm for the measure may account for the widely divergent 
school responses to the walkouts -- with some favoring punishments, including 
suspension of organizers, some preferring to just issue stern warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 When about 200 teen-agers from Pasadena High School charged off campus 
Thursday, carrying banners that said "No on 187" and waving Mexican flags, they 
were accompanied by the district superintendent, Vera Vignes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the students had walked five miles to Pasadena's Civic Center, Vignes 
ordered three school buses to take them back to campus, where administrators 
held a "cool-down" session in the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the walkout in Pomona two weeks ago -- by 100 students from 
Ganesha High School who were protesting a variety of issues, including 
Proposition 187 -- resulted in about 70 suspensions for what an assistant 
superintendent called unsafe and dangerous behavior in defiance of authority, 
including scrambling up fences to get off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 is one of the rare issues where many of the opposing teen-agers seem 
to be in sync with their parents. Parents have actually joined in some of the 
marches, while others have encouraged their children to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was something trivial, I would not want them to do it," said the 
father of two East Whittier Middle School students, where a handful of students 
walked out last week. "But we told them if they really felt strongly, that we 
would be supportive if they walked out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 The father asked not to be named for fear that school administrators would 
punish his children.

SCOTT HARRIS: PRO-INCUMBENT THOUGHTS TO CHEW OVER; FOR ALL THEIR SURFACE 
SIMILARITIES, RIORDAN OBVIOUSLY HAS SOMETHING HUFFINGTON LACKS. WHAT IS IT? 
</P>

<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen," the caterer announced, "your dessert is almond 
amaretto mousse cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did I suspect that the grub would be so fancy. When colleagues invited 
me to dine with "The Angry Undecided," what I expected was a spirited political 
discussion. The seafood crepes and the dessert were an unexpected bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angry Undecided -- 15 Swing Voters Give Views." That was the headline 
over Daniel M. Weintraub's front page article in The Times on Oct. 10. This was 
the first dispatch inspired by a journalistic experiment: To identify 15 likely 
voters from the San Fernando Valley who are undecided about the governor's race 
and study how they reach their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded intriguing, so I accepted. Besides, I had a pet question: I wanted 
them to compare two multimillionaire Republicans who used their personal 
fortunes to advance their political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 One, of course, is U.S. Senate hopeful Mike Huffington. The other is Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a scientific sampling, the group of 15 includes eight men and seven 
women; 10 are Democrats, four are Republicans and one is Independent. This 
time, 13 showed up. If anger was the theme of the first dinner at The Times' 
Chatsworth office, frustration dominated this discussion. Had you been there, 
it probably would have all sounded familiar, only more intense. The attitudes 
ranged from skeptical to cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub began his first story with the anger expressed by Marvin Hershman, a 
Litton Industries contracts manager who senses that California is deteriorating 
and that politicians care more about getting elected than the problems of 
constituents. Fourteen of the 15 said that things were getting worse in 
California. And yet, when pressed about who they would vote for if they were to 
decide immediately, they leaned overwhelmingly toward the incumbents, Gov. Pete 
Wilson and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 For his second dispatch, Weintraub found his lead in the words of Mary Kranz, 
a college librarian who is fed up with negative political ads and wants to hear 
a positive message. The story appeared Monday, under the apt headline: "Voters 
Ask for Vision, Not Venom." When pressed about the candidates this time, there 
was a softening of support for Wilson and Feinstein, with more voters saying 
they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the group was leaning 3-2 for Wilson over challenger Kathleen 
Brown, with the remainder declining to say. They leaned 8-1 for Feinstein over 
Huffington, with the others undecided. Still a big margin for Feinstein, but at 
the first dinner, she was favored 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Brown earned both criticism and praise for her debate performance and the 
issuance of her 62-page economic plan. She stirred things up. As for 
Huffington, one voter here said she was giving him a second look because the 
media seemed to be ganging up on him. In "Doonesbury," for example, 
Huffington's been portrayed as an empty suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set for my question: Who did you vote for in the last mayoral 
election?  
</P>
<P>
 There were seven hands for Riordan, one for Michael Woo. Another said he would 
have voted for Riordan, but didn't live within city limits. The remaining few 
either declined to say or perhaps didn't vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's popularity wasn't surprising; the Valley elected Riordan. And the 
mayor will be happy to know that, in this group, his approval rating remains 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 My next question concerned the difference between Riordan and Huffington. For 
all their surface similarities, Riordan obviously has something Huffington 
lacks. What is it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Riordan was positive, as opposed to negative. And he had a track record," 
said Rhoda Glassman, a Northridge businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an outstanding businessman," added Hershman. ". . .He didn't say vote 
for me because the other guy's an S.O.B." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I'll be penalized for piling on, but let's add a few more key 
differences. Riordan is a self-made millionaire; Huffington bought into Dad's 
company. Riordan, though a novice as a candidate, has been active in Los 
Angeles civic affairs much longer than Huffington has lived in Santa Barbara. 
And though this may seem trivial, it bugs me that the Huffington campaign has 
made an issue of insisting the media refer to the candidate as Mike, not 
Michael. Why do they care? Riordan doesn't care if people call him Richard or 
Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another: Huffington recently jumped on the Proposition 187 bandwagon in 
a transparent effort to bolster his campaign. If it's such a swell idea, why 
didn't he stand up for the anti-illegal immigration measure earlier? Riordan, 
meanwhile, has consistently spoken out against the scapegoating of immigrants. 
Critics would have a tough time drawing him as an empty suit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the dessert, incidentally, was sublime.

TEACHERS, STUDENTS DEBATE PROP. 187; SCHOOLS: AT RESEDA HIGH, PEACEFUL WALKOUT 
BECOMES A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. OTHER VALLEY CAMPUSES HAVE LESS ORGANIZED 
DEMONSTRATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An early-morning student protest against Proposition 187 at Reseda High School 
on Monday took a decidedly different turn when administrators and teachers 
joined the march, provided the students with a bullhorn, and then organized a 
lunchtime debate on the illegal immigration ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda protest was in stark contrast to the student walkouts in Downey 
last week that prompted police to use special grenades to disperse the crowds. 
Reseda Principal Bob Kladifko met with the students to discuss the proposition 
and to find a way to let them make a statement in a safe and orderly manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we turned this around and made it a terrific educational opportunity 
for them," he said, shaking hands with students as about 200 of them returned 
to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from four other San Fernando Valley campuses also held walkouts 
Monday. Los Angeles Unified School District officials said the morning protests 
were peaceful at John H. Francis Polytechnic High and Olive Vista, San Fernando 
and Sepulveda middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In a somewhat disorganized protest, about 200 students left campus at San 
Fernando Middle School. "It definitely appeared to be organized by students," 
said Principal Arturo del Rio. "They didn't have any coordinated strategy. They 
were wandering around looking for a place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda, meanwhile, the protesting students crowded into Regents Hall, 
listening while two teachers discussed their support for the measure and other 
students and teachers blasted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country is made up of immigrants," said Luz Castillo, a Reseda senior 
who helped organize the walkout and debate. "We should protect the rights of 
immigrants. I don't know how anyone could think of passing such a proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, Al Benson, a social studies teacher, said the issue boils 
down to money. He said illegal immigrants are costing the state -- and the 
country -- too much money during recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your presence here . . . it doesn't come free of charge," said the teacher to 
a mostly orderly crowd. "The point is we have to take care of our own in 
certain times of crisis -- I see nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Shaffer, who teaches history and oversees student government activities, 
said he, too, supports Proposition 187 because he said this country "rewards" 
illegal residents by giving them a free public education and other social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S., historically, has been the land of opportunity . . . my feeling is 
let's not stop immigration -- that's what this country is founded on," Shaffer 
said. "But I do draw a line between legal immigration and illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 calls for schools to verify students' legal status and 
ultimately to report illegal students and their parents to authorities. The Los 
Angeles Board of Education, which has voted to oppose the measure, expects to 
join legal challenges if the measure is approved on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting students and their families could turn schools into "a police state, 
McCarthy-era, Nazi Germany," Castillo said. "This is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Lincoln, a science teacher, got a rousing response from the students when 
he told them his father came to this country from Russia as an illegal 
immigrant. "I say give them all a chance," he said to a standing ovation and 
loud cheers and whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing back to class, Miriam Peniche, a senior who helped organize the 
protest, said she believes Proposition 187 would hurt most of her friends at 
the school and deny them an education. "I think the proposition is inhuman and 
racist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peniche said she and several friends got the idea for the walkout from other 
schools where protests already had occurred and said that they wanted to make a 
public statement. The students even asked the principal to call local news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most administrators and teachers said they believe that the majority of the 
students are sincere in their desire to protest the measure but that others are 
joining friends to ditch classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this age, some are concerned about it -- no question," said Jean Whitaker, 
assistant principal at Olive Vista. "But at this age, some are doing it because 
they see the opportunity" to miss classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Kladifko, who said he would not penalize the students for missing 
five class periods, said, "They didn't want to ditch class, they wanted to make 
a statement. They had an issue and I wanted to support them."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY JOINS SUPPORT FOR MTA LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has voted to join a program in which a group of 
cities hope to band together to pay the salary of a lobbyist to represent their 
interests at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas, which has committed to paying $1,566 toward the salary of the 
lobbyist, acted on the urging of Larry Zarian, vice chairman of MTA's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume and variety of technical issues facing the MTA board requires an 
extensive amount of research, analysis, investigation and preparation prior to 
meetings," Zarian, who is also on the Glendale City Council, wrote in a letter 
to 11 cities. "We believe that hiring a full-time staff person for our corridor 
is essential to adequately represent our interests to the MTA." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff person would be paid about $50,000 annually plus benefits, Zarian 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping this person would be an ombudsman and get us the transportation we 
need," said Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas officials, Foley said, want the city's bus line extended past the 
Valley Circle interchange. Extended service is also needed in Calabasas Park, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas, Foley said, might also be able to provide a high school 
student to work as an intern to help the lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula for how much each city would pay is based on its population, said 
Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities that have been invited to join are Agoura Hills, Burbank, 
Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, Hidden Hills, Lancaster, Malibu, Palmdale, San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our initial discussions indicate that some of the cities are very 
supportive," Zarian wrote. He asked the cities to sign non-binding letters of 
intent saying they want to join. FRANK MANNING

 Wanted: ghouls, ghosts, gremlins and other terrifying creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the call being put out by organizers of the Calabasas Days Halloween 
Parade to be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries will be accepted until Thursday, organizers say. All it takes to 
qualify is to bring costumes that show lots of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the parade to be known as the biggest Halloween parade in the West," 
said Laura Marcinik, the parade's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday night there were 40 entrants -- or about 600 marchers of all ages 
-- said Marcinik. Those who want to enter can contact Marcinik, (818) 591-9153, 
Ext. 243. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade begins at 4 p.m. and will last about an hour, Marcinik said. It's 
timed to get the children off the streets before dark, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will proceed down Calabasas Road through Old Town to Park Centre, 
where it will turn left and disband at Park Sorrento. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will feature categories such as Halloween legends and horror 
classics, most unusual, history of the Old West, and best use of pumpkins, said 
parade spokeswoman Margery Gould. Other categories include environmental 
themes, music of Halloween, and the Screaming '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade is part of the city of Calabasas' annual fall festivities. It 
follows the third annual Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival held last weekend at 
Paramount Ranch. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; RED RIBBONS, PEP RALLY MARK WEEK AGAINST DRUGS IN 
RESEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To celebrate Red Ribbon Week, a nationwide anti-drug abuse program that 
started Monday, students in the Reseda area have gathered at school-wide 
assemblies, a pep rally and other drug awareness activities. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda Elementary School, students and teachers kicked off the week's 
activities by tying red ribbons around the trees in front of their campus. They 
will wear smaller red ribbons on their clothing all week. The youngsters have 
the added incentive of receiving trinkets from DARE, an anti-drug program 
sponsored by the Los Angeles school district and police department, if they 
wear the ribbons every day through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 students at Melvin Elementary School with the help of some Cleveland 
High School students started their observance of the ninth annual Red Ribbon 
Week on Friday, chanting "Say No!" as they spelled out the same message with 
their bodies on a school playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 The week is intended to teach children the dangers of drug abuse. Red Ribbon 
Week also memorializes the 1985 murder of federal drug-enforcement agent 
Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland High School and the elementary and middle schools that feed into 
Cleveland, such as Melvin Elementary, have banded together to teach kids of all 
ages about drugs for this year's Red Ribbon Week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that it does take a village to educate a child," said 
Deborah Leidner, a Los Angeles Unified School District official who oversees 
the Reseda area. "We have to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Say No" rally at Melvin also featured members of the Cleveland 
cheerleading and football teams, who spoke of their drug-free lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do think we are their role models," said Vanessa Meza, 17, 
co-captain of the cheerleading squad. She said squad members get good grades 
and serve on student government positions and do not abuse drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I've never used drugs and I think I'm kind of successful," said 
Eric Brown, 16, a receiver and linebacker for the Cleveland football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids come up to me and they say, 'I want to play football when I grow 
up,' and when I was that age I used to say that, too," said Brown, who added 
that if he had ever taken drugs, he probably would not be involved in football.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; LONELY PETS LOOKING 
FOR HELPING HANDS

 Judy Levine walks down the lonely row of bars and cages as the captives howl 
and plead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know some of them came from homes," Levine says. "Where are their 
owners?" 
</P>
<P>
 Around her, shepherd and Doberman mixes, toy dogs and cocker spaniels, vie for 
attention, as though trying to lick and plead with visitors to take them home. 
The dogs drum their beds with their tails when they see Levine. They recognize 
her and somehow know she is trying to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a volunteer with the city's West Valley Animal Shelter and the Pet Mobile 
Adoption Program, Levine, a fund-raising consultant, works to find new homes 
for a wide variety of dogs and cats.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get this one out," she says, as she approaches the cage of Amigo, a 
shepherd mix taken to the shelter by his owner. "He's been here too long." 
</P>
<P>
 After seven days in the shelter, the pets become available for adoption. When 
the shelter runs out of space, the animals are euthanized, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter's population has dropped since the Northridge earthquake Jan. 17, 
when Levine became a volunteer. Hundreds of frightened, lost pets wound up at 
the shelter after the temblor, some boarded at five or six to a cage. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of those animals were either reunited with their owners or found new 
homes. The success of that effort has inspired shelter volunteers to find new 
ways to get the animals adopted and bring down the 70% citywide euthanasia rate 
in Los Angeles, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new program called Mobile Pet Adoption, volunteers like Levine take 
animals to stores and shopping centers so people can see them outside cages. 
Volunteers also have persuaded shelter officials to let prospective owners take 
animals from the cages at the shelter so they can get a better sense of what 
the animal is like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside, they have more personality," Levine said. The cages and bars are 
sometimes too depressing to inspire an adoption, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to change the image," Levine said of the shelter. "We're trying 
to get people to come here to adopt before they go to a breeder." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Mobile Pet Adoption program started in June, more than 250 cats, 
dogs, puppies and kittens have found homes, shelter officials said. The group 
is expanding the mobile program to other shelters in the city and needs more 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The next mobile pet adoption is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Nov. 6 at the 
Body Shop at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park. Information: Levine at (310) 
455-3709. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed in a low-income housing project for 1,200 residents in 
Palmdale that is part of AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service 
program. In exchange for 1,700 hours of services, volunteers will receive a 
living allowance, benefits and loan repayments or tuition vouchers at their 
school of choice. The AmeriCorps volunteers will be helping to put together and 
run programs and activities at the housing project. Information: Peggy Tapping 
at (714) 835-0406.

 When the earthquake rolled through on Jan. 17, the Los Angeles city 
firefighters of Station 70 in Northridge had to take one engine out a back door 
because the front door was so damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned from the scene of 16 deaths at the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments complex -- where they were the first company to arrive -- it became 
apparent that more than the door was damaged.And the firefighters were booted 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine months of working out of neighboring stations, the crews of Task 
Force 70 are back home, and the Los Angeles Fire Department will celebrate with 
a rededication ceremony Thursday at 9:30 a.m. at the station, 9861 Reseda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of public figures are scheduled to be on hand, including Gov. Pete 
Wilson, Mayor Richard Riordan and Fire Chief Donald Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers invite the public to welcome the firefighters back. ERIC SLATER

ELECTION '94; 38TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Schwada 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), 54, was first elected to the Assembly in 1990. 
The former owner of a real estate brokerage firm, Boland is married and has 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challenger Josh Arce, 19, is a UCLA sophomore who lives with his 
mother in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional view is that the San Fernando Valley is a GOP redoubt. But 
Boland is only one of two Valley Assemblymembers. Democrats control four other 
area Assembly seats. (Bill Hoge, who represents the Sunland-Tujunga area, is 
the Valley's other GOP assemblymember). 
</P>
<P>
 After her 1992 reelection, Boland's fought to dismantle the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, a behemoth widely scorned by her constituents. But her 
effort was stalled earlier this year by opposing teachers and African-American 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, Boland's district was hit by the Northridge earthquake. The 
nation's most costly natural disaster wreaked havoc on her constituents and on 
Boland herself, who could be found sleeping in a car after her Northridge home 
was rendered uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the devastation, Boland stuck to her guns as a fiscal conservative and 
opposed a Democratic-sponsored plan to pay for a multi-billion dollar quake 
relief effort with a sales tax hike. She did vote to put Gov. Pete Wilson's $2 
billion bond-financed quake relief plan on the ballot but felt the federal 
government should pick up the lion's share of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland has won adoption of measures to lift the statute of limitations on 
filing charges against persons who sexually molest minors and to give rape 
victims the right to review their assailants' HIV test records. 
</P>
<P>
 This election may be Boland's political swan song. If reelected as expected, 
term limits will force her out of the Assembly in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, who tried (unsuccessfully) to get course credit at UCLA for his 
experience as a candidate, is a conservative Democrat who calls his campaign "a 
grass-roots alternative to the high-cost, cynical campaigns" of mainstream 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38th District, which includes precincts in heavily Republican Simi Valley, 
is 46% Republican, 41% Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Green Party candidate Charles Wilken, a teacher from 
Northridge. John Schwada

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BRAND BLVD. RENEWAL GETS INTO HIGH GEAR 
</P>

<P>
 A plan to revamp South Brand Boulevard and put Glendale's car dealerships in 
an "auto park" was set in motion last week -- four years after city officials 
and car dealers first began working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews have begun installing a concrete median divider that will 
bisect a two-mile section of Brand Boulevard, the city's main drag, between 
Cerritos Avenue and Colorado Street. The divider is aimed at smoothing traffic 
on the heavily traveled street and making it safer for pedestrians to cross, 
but officials said it is only the first step toward sprucing up the street and 
reviving it economically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car dealers are very glad to see this is finally happening. The city 
knows and understands the auto business is very important to Glendale, and 
they've been very supportive," said Jarrett Anderson, an attorney for the 
Glendale Motor Car Dealers Assn., which includes nine owners with 29 different 
auto franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the South Brand Boulevard Specific Plan, approved by the City 
Council in 1992 and paid for by federal grant funds, will help solve several 
problems long faced by the auto dealers.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the dealers' primary concern has been their lack of visibility, with 
business signs cluttering the street and overgrown trees obscuring the view of 
signs and showrooms. The plan includes high-profile signs that will be built 
along the median in both directions to direct car shoppers to the dealerships. 
The trees that have lined the sidewalks for 20 years will be replaced by taller 
pines extending past the buildings' rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem has been the heavy traffic on the street. The new median will 
pass through several intersections at smaller side streets along the 
thoroughfare, preventing drivers from making left turns or crossing the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The median is going to be the major change you'll see on Brand," said Marlene 
Roth, a city planning consultant who worked with the auto dealers on the 
project. "The traffic has been a problem not only for the dealers, but also for 
the residents. Some of the neighbors had complained of trucks pulling into the 
middle of the street and unloading new cars from trailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the plan is an array of zoning changes that will allow auto 
dealers to develop retail, office and medical buildings on their property -- a 
provision that could pave the way for new merchants and neighborhood commercial 
centers along the street, officials said. Eventually, overhead electrical 
cables are to be removed and reinstalled underground. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; AGENCY CLOSES AMID DISPUTE OVER FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their hammer-wielding employees have donned surgical masks and goggles and 
smashed apart toilets for recycling, distributing thousands of free 
ultra-low-flush toilets to replace the old water hoggers.  
</P>
<P>
 They've also provided computer training -- including how to use the Internet 
-- to community members and taught teen-agers valuable job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Debra J. Santos, executive director of Keeping the World at Peace 
Inc., a nonprofit agency in Pacoima, told her 11 employees to put down their 
hammers and keyboards and go home: The agency is broke. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the company that provides funding has begun sending invoices 
seeking repayment of thousands of dollars provided to the nonprofit agency 
since last August, Santos says.  
</P>
<P>
 All 11 of the employees showed up Monday morning, however, saying they'll work 
until the last toilet is delivered and there's nothing more to do. Santos was 
heartened by the employees' response, but said she feels betrayed by CTSI 
Corp., an Orange County company that manages a joint conservation program for 
the Metropolitan Water District and the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power. CTSI provides Santos' agency and other area nonprofit organizations with 
funds to operate the toilet exchange program, giving the agencies a rebate of 
$25 for every toilet they replace with a low-flush model. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying operating expenses, funds left over can be used by the nonprofit 
groups to fund other community services, such as the Community Information 
Center the Pacoima agency has operated since September. The center provides 
residents with training including "Internet for Beginners" and Wordperfect.  
</P>
<P>
 But a few weeks ago, CTSI sent no rebate funds in exchange for the toilets 
that Keeping the World at Peace replaced, Santos contends. "We replaced 180 
toilets last week and over 200 the week before, but we haven't received any 
money," she said. "And they aren't sending us enough toilets to meet the 
demand. They're slowly squeezing us out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 CTSI Corp. officials acknowledge there are problems with Santos' agency, but 
won't say what those problems are. "Our situation with KTWP is extremely touchy 
at this moment," said Alan Roth, CTSI's financial operator. Rick Ruiz, program 
manager for CTSI, said: "Whatever the problem is, it's on her (Santos') end. If 
they're not getting as much funding as they were, it's because they're not 
distributing as many toilets. The organizations we fund get $25 a toilet. 
There's no other funding through us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Santos contends CTSI had been funding her agency at a level of about 
$10,000 a week to operate the toilet exchange program, and supplied the agency 
with even more funds after the January earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Metropolitan Water District had no comment on the dispute. 
"We're taking the position that the problem is between the program manager 
(CTSI) and the community-based organization -- unless it goes to a lawsuit," 
said Kathy Gibson, associate resource specialist with the water district.  
</P>
<P>
 Employees at KTWP milled about Monday and discussed the future.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what we're going to do," said Ascencio Flores, who helps break 
apart the old toilets and distribute new ones. "I was out of work for three 
months before this job. I don't have a family of my own, so I'm not as bad off. 
But it still hurts, all the way around." TIM MAY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON VERDUGO TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank city officials on Monday celebrated the groundbreaking of Verdugo 
Tower, a 121-unit apartment building for needy seniors, which will be built 
with a $9.9-million loan from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, to be located at the northwest corner of Verdugo Avenue and San 
Fernando Road, is being built by the nonprofit corporation Verdugo Tower Inc., 
which also runs three other senior housing complexes in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for an apartment, applicants must be at least 62 years old and 
meet HUD income limitations and other requirements. Rent will equal 30% of the 
residents' adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the eight-story building, which will have a 68-space 
underground parking garage and private balconies for some units, is expected to 
be finished in mid-1995. Project officials said they expect a flood of 
applications for apartments. A public drawing will be held a few months before 
the building opens. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; NEIGHBORS ARE SOUR ON DELI'S REOPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Restaurant patrons cheered when the popular Art's Deli reopened last week, but 
neighbors angry about customers parking on their streets are withholding their 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of side streets near the Ventura Boulevard eatery objected to 
the city's granting of a variance that allowed the restaurant to provide six, 
rather than 65, parking spaces when it reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest setback, residents said, in their ongoing struggle to get 
the city to institute permit parking on streets including Cantara and Hillslope 
streets and Laurelgrove and Vantage avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers and employees alike park on residential streets, making it difficult 
for motorists backing out of their driveways to see oncoming traffic, neighbors 
said. In addition, they said they are disturbed by employees revving their car 
engines late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful street, a wonderful neighborhood -- but we've got this one 
problem: We're being used as a parking lot, and it's just not fair," said 
Darlene Urwin, who lives on Cantara. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., said residents 
have been trying to get permit parking for more than two years. They originally 
wanted to make it illegal for non-permit holders to park on their streets 24 
hours a day. But the city Department of Transportation has proposed instead to 
allow two-hour parking between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., saying that people have a 
right to park on public streets, particularly those near a business district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to privatize city streets," said transportation engineer Rafael 
Prepena. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepena said it usually takes 18 to 24 months for residents in an area -- 
which must include a minimum of six blocks -- to get permit parking. He said 
his department's staff is handling three other areas slated to get permit 
parking before the Studio City neighborhood. A subcommittee will likely take up 
the issue in December, Prepena predicted, and about six weeks later the City 
Council will consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it will take about three months to get the signs made and up to a month 
to erect them, the engineer said. Neighbors can expect to see them next April 
or May, Prepena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ginsburg, a co-owner of Art's Deli, said that he is sympathetic to the 
neighbors' concerns but knows of no other place where his customers and 
employees can park. He said he cannot afford to buy an alternative parking 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the fault lies is the city of Los Angeles," Ginsburg said. "It has 
refused to help us resolve the situation" by building a public parking 
structure "where we could put all of our employees." 
</P>
<P>
 As for employees revving their engines at odd hours, Ginsburg said he has "no 
knowledge of that being true." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we are very good neighbors, and very sensitive to everyone's needs," 
Ginsburg said. KAY HWANGBO and JON D. MARKMAN

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATES TRADE BARBS OVER POLITICAL PASTS, FAMILY VALUES; DEBATE: 
DEMOCRAT SCHIFF QUESTIONS STABILITY OF INCUMBENT ROGAN'S BELIEFS. ROGAN, AN 
EX-LIBERAL, SAYS HE HAS SIMPLY MATURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic candidate Adam Schiff charged Monday that the 1988 political 
conversion of state Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale), a former liberal 
Democratic party activist now aligned with the GOP right wing, was so radical 
that it calls into question the stability of his political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's charge, bolstered by an obscure 14-year-old document, was made during 
the pair's penultimate debate, at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, 
during which Rogan ascribed the change in his political beliefs to growth in 
his family and religious values as he matured.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mail campaigns of the two candidates have begun moving into 
high gear with Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, trying to capitalize on a 
controversial plan to remove toxic wastes from the Lockheed plant. At the same 
time, Rogan, a former deputy district attorney, has released a letter of 
endorsement from the son of an elderly couple whose accused murderer Rogan 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men are seeking the 43rd Assembly District seat formerly held by GOP 
leader Pat Nolan, now serving a state prison sentence for political corruption. 
Rogan gained that seat in a special election last May and is now seeking to win 
his first full two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43rd District includes Glendale, Burbank and parts of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's main assault on Rogan in Monday's debate was to disclose documents 
showing that Rogan, now heavily supported by conservative Christians, was a 
supporter of liberal U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy's (D-Mass.) insurgent candidacy 
in 1980 to deny President Jimmy Carter the Democratic party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The document -- part of Rogan's own bid to get elected as a Kennedy delegate 
to the Democratic convention -- includes a resume that notes that Rogan had 
previously worked on the campaigns of such liberal notables as Robert F. 
Kennedy and George McGovern. Also included is a photo of Rogan, with a beard 
and a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff called Rogan's change in beliefs "an amazing transformation." In an 
interview after the debate, he said he wondered how Rogan's beliefs would 
change in the future: "Whither Rogan next?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan laughed off the questions, saying his beliefs have matured with his 
hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schiff campaign also questioned how honest Rogan has been in describing 
his political transformation. Rogan has previously downplayed the extent of his 
conversion, saying that he had been a conservative Democrat who simply made the 
logical transition to the GOP as the Democratic party grew more liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Schiff campaign has said that the evidence about Rogan's background 
shows a radical leap. "He's not being honest with the voters about how far he's 
moved," said Parke Skelton, Schiff's campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rogan defended the change in his views as the product of deeper thought 
and additional experience as he gained a wife and children. He stressed his 
status as a family man, in contrast to Schiff -- especially when Schiff 
criticized him for agreeing to accept a $20,000 annual pay hike for state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said Schiff had no right to criticize him for taking the money because 
Schiff has no family responsibilities -- "no wife, no children, no connection 
to the district." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before criticizing me for exercising my family responsibilities, perhaps you 
ought to get one," Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff told the audience of 150 that his fiancee, Eve Sanderson, was with him, 
joking about their names that, "We are, in fact, Adam and Eve." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bob D'Amato, a perennial Metro Rail critic, accused Schiff of not 
being the tough prosecutor he has claimed to be when he was assigned to 
investigate complaints of contract fraud involving the Metro Rail subway. 
Schiff is a former assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wolf in sheep's clothing," D'Amato said, claiming the federal probe 
was marked by "prosecutorial foot-dragging." D'Amato owns his own Northridge 
safety consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff declined to comment on the accusation, saying that he is bound by 
ethical constraints because the criminal investigation is continuing. He said 
in an interview later that he was on the case for a year, not enough time to 
bring a prosecution in such a complicated matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in his mail campaign, Schiff has redoubled his efforts to tap into 
growing opposition in Burbank to construction of a system for removing toxic 
deposits from soil at the local Lockheed plant and releasing the filtered 
products into the air via a 65-foot-tall "smokestack." 
</P>
<P>
 In a mailer to Burbank voters, Schiff has provided residents with petitions to 
sign objecting to the project. Schiff has said he will personally present the 
petitions to the South Coast Air Quality Management District as part of his 
campaign of "doing everything I can to stop this smokestack." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff has also sent out a districtwide mailer (his first since last summer) 
touting his record in the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office. Schiff, the 
mailer contends, had a "100% jury trial conviction rate" and was the lead 
prosecutor in the case that led to the 1990 conviction of former FBI agent 
Richard Miller as a Soviet spy. Among other things, the mailer shows a photo of 
Schiff holding a military-style assault rifle marked as an exhibit in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In several mailers, Rogan has continued to hammer away at his theme that he is 
the toughest candidate on the issues of illegal immigration and crime. Rogan 
supports Proposition 187, the measure to deny illegal immigrants schooling, 
medical and welfare benefits, while Schiff instead supports plans to beef up 
the nation's border defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest Rogan pieces is a letter from Kenneth Goldman, a Canoga Park 
businessman, who called Rogan "a hero to my family" because of his tenacious 
efforts to prosecute the accused murderer of Goldman's mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Bertha Goldman were killed in Altadena in December, 1984. Harles 
Hamilton, a Pasadena resident, was later arrested in connection with the 
murders. "Jim Rogan fought tooth and nail for over two years to bring this 
vicious killer to justice. He never gave up. Jim's tenacity earned my respect 
and my friendship," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was never convicted after four trials -- all resulting in hung juries 
-- and three of the trials were prosecuted by Rogan.

CITY COUNCIL LIABILITY ON THE LINE IN POLICE-BRUTALITY SUIT; COURTS: PLAINTIFF 
SEEKS MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE MEMBERS, BUT WILL SETTLE FOR A $1-MILLION ANNUITY 
FOR THE 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

<P>
 A police brutality trial that begins today in federal court could lead to a 
groundbreaking ruling forcing Los Angeles City Council members to pay damages 
out of their own pockets for votes they cast in council. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges among other things that council members are personally 
liable for the actions of officers from the LAPD's Special Investigations 
Section who shot four robbers after a holdup at a McDonald's restaurant in 
Sunland on Feb. 12, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that when the council members voted to use city funds to 
pay damages assessed against the officers in a trial two years later, they 
approved of misconduct and so should share in the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the robbers sued former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates and 
nine officers nine days after the shooting, contending that the police shot the 
men without provocation and that Gates was responsible for the way the 
department was run. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they opened fire because the men pulled pistols, which were 
subsequently shown to be air guns. Three were killed and one was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found in favor of the families in March, 1992, and assessed just over 
$44,000 in punitive damages against Gates and the officers -- saying the amount 
was deliberately set low enough so that it would be paid by the officers, not 
the taxpayers. But the City Council subsequently voted to pay the damages, a 
common decision in cases involving city employees who are sued over actions 
they took in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Yagman, the attorney representing the families, subsequently filed an 
identical lawsuit asking for unspecified damages from the city, the council 
members and police, on behalf of 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, daughter of Javier 
Trevino, one of the slain robbers. She was born seven days after her father was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office tried to get the suit dismissed, citing 
the common legal doctrine that lawmakers cannot be sued personally for votes 
they cast as part of their official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But in July, 1992, U.S. District Court Judge J. Spencer Letts rejected the 
city's position, a decision upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which ruled unanimously that the decision to pay the police officers' damages 
was an administrative, not a legislative, action. 
</P>
<P>
 The city appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, 
setting the stage for this week's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant City Atty. James Pearson said the trial will be broken into 
two phases. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a jury must determine whether to award the child compensatory damages 
for the loss of her father and, if it does, how much. An award of compensatory 
damages would stem from the previous jury's finding that officers used 
excessive force when they shot the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the jury must determine whether the City Council members can be held 
personally liable for voting to use city funds to cover the punitive damages 
assessed against Gates and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said the council members did not violate anyone's constitutional 
rights when they decided to pay the punitive damages because there is no legal 
precedent for such a contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly feel there is no basis for there to be damages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson also said his office, which has retained former Atty. Gen. John Van de 
Kamp to serve as an adviser in the case, plans to file a motion this week 
seeking a delay in the second phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said Monday that although he has offered on at least two occasions to 
settle the case, it is in the public's best interest that it go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the government steps in and saves a bad public official from (the 
consequences of) wrongdoing, it is the public that is hurt," Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said jurors must also decide whether the LAPD officers were in the 
habit of using excessive force and, if so, whether the city and the council 
members should be held liable for the development of such a habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said he contacted Pearson Saturday and offered to drop the suit if the 
city would agree to set up an annuity for the child. Pearson said that he plans 
to present Yagman's $1 million offer to city officials this week and that a 
settlement in the case is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl is expected to be present in court for the trial, Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the incident that resulted in the suit, 19 members of the Special 
Investigations Section followed four men suspected in a string of restaurant 
robberies. They trailed them from Venice to Sunland and watched as they broke 
into the closed McDonald's about 1 a.m. and robbed the lone employee inside, 
who was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the robbers got into their car, the officers moved in. They testified 
they fired 35 rounds from shotguns and handguns when the robbers pointed 
weapons at them. It was later learned that they were unloaded pellet guns, not 
firearms.

COUPLE PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO FILING FALSE RELIEF CLAIMS IN 2 CALIFORNIA 
DISASTERS; COURTS: WOODLAND HILLS PAIR IS ACCUSED OF MAKING FRAUDULENT FEMA AND 
SBA APPLICATIONS THAT BROUGHT THEM $13,000. 
</P>

<P>
 A Woodland Hills couple pleaded not guilty Monday to federal charges that they 
filed false disaster relief claims with federal agencies after two natural 
disasters, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Maskart, 53, and Joyce Maskart, 44, were indicted by a federal grand 
jury on Oct. 18 for allegedly filing fraudulent claims with the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration that brought 
them more than $13,000 in assistance after the 1992 Southern California floods 
and the Jan. 17 earthquake, according to the U. S. Attorney's Office.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first incident of someone . . . who has taken advantage of two 
natural disasters," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman. "Fraudulent 
conduct like the Maskarts prevents FEMA and SBA from fulfilling the needs of 
truly desperate people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maskarts' trial is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, FEMA has issued more than 363,108 checks to Northridge quake victims 
totaling $1.004 billion for temporary housing, emergency repairs and mortgage 
and rental assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the severe floods of February, 1992, the Maskarts applied to FEMA and 
SBA for compensation for damage to their home in the 4500 block of San Blas 
Avenue in Woodland Hills. They filed forged monthly rental receipts using the 
address of another home they owned in the 22000 block of Covello Street in 
Canoga Park and received 18 months of rental assistance from FEMA totaling 
$11,256, Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FEMA regulations, the Maskarts would not have been eligible for 
assistance funds to live in their second home. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Maskarts filed three separate FEMA 
applications for disaster relief. One application listed the San Blas Avenue 
house as their primary home, while the other two listed the Covello Avenue 
house as their primary residence, Hochman said. They received a total of $2,300 
in FEMA assistance based on their applications. 
</P>
<P>
 They also submitted four false disaster home loan applications with the Small 
Business Administration after the earthquake, all declined. Although the 
Maskarts had claimed that they had not lived at the San Blas Avenue home since 
the floods, they stated on the applications that they lost $34,380 in personal 
belongings including Waterford crystal, electronic equipment and a piano. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the Maskarts could be sentenced to up to 110 years in prison and 
fined as much as $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the government began filing fraud charges in such cases, more than $12.9 
million has been voluntarily returned to FEMA by people who improperly received 
the assistance, authorities said. They were not prosecuted.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; ON BRINK OF DEPARTURE, ROBERTI TALKS OF HIS PAST, STATE'S 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time state Sen. David A. Roberti was a private citizen was in 1966, 
three years before man landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Roberti is preparing to end his 28-year political journey, rejoining 
civilian life after a career that boosted him to the heights of Senate 
president pro tem for a record 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly three decades in Sacramento, Roberti served in the Assembly and then 
the Senate, representing Hollywood, East Los Angeles and, most recently, the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered the Legislature on a wave of protest against the Vietnam War. He 
leaves it believing that California is in the midst of another sea change -- 
this time in demographics, the economy and the state's fiscal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 As he looks for a new job, probably in law, Roberti has started teaching a 
political science course at USC. In a recent interview, he talked about a range 
of issues as he prepares to leave office in December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've served in the Legislature for 28 years now, and you are about 
to become the first legislator to be displaced by voter-mandated term limits. 
How do you feel about term limits? Do you still oppose them, or do you think 
they may eventually lead to good government?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The term limits we have are too extreme. Especially in the state 
Assembly, where six years is just way too short. California's problems are too 
complex to be solved in a sort of musical-chairs, revolving-door kind of 
legislative system. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, I think there probably is a benefit to term limits that 
aren't quite as drastic. If a longtime officeholder chooses to run again, fine. 
They should be able to do so -- after a break from the Sacramento or Washington 
routine. You can get awfully wound up in what you're doing in office. So, being 
out of office, being forced to consider the outside world, I think, will be a 
liberating experience for a number of legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of power players and special interests will find that, maybe in a 
legislator's last couple of years in office, he or she is somewhat detached 
from their influence. So that might be good. 
</P>
<P>
 But our term limits are too short. I think that's the biggest problem. It's 
not with the idea of having them. Because change is inevitable and usually 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Looking back at your legislative career, what are some of its biggest 
highlights and your proudest achievements?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think I've had legislation covering the whole sweep of life in 
California. I'm pretty proud of what I've been able to accomplish, particularly 
with banning assault guns, which I hope is the start of a wave of rationality 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 I was able to get child care, urban parks and waste management legislation 
passed. I've been able to pass the California Privacy Act. I've been a pretty 
good environmentalist. I think, to an extent, it's because of my work that 
renters are now part of the California political landscape and are not just a 
forgotten population. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of your regrets -- things you wish you would have 
accomplished or seen the Legislature as a whole accomplish?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As far as policy is concerned, frankly I think one of the things we need to 
do in California is restructure our governmental system. We have too many 
jurisdictions, both horizontal and vertical. It's too complex, too 
self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guise of local control, we create a multitude of governmental 
bodies, creating gridlock and logjam. We don't integrate our decision-making. 
We have our air quality boards and transportation agencies, without giving any 
thought to the fact that maybe these should be coordinated together. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a feature of California life that whenever we have a problem, we create 
an ad hoc commission or governmental body to deal with that. Therefore, we 
create a system of ad hoc bodies dealing with one issue without any perspective 
of how one issue plays on another. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very difficult to change once you go down that road. But for California 
government to function, that is something that has to be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As you prepare to leave office, what kind of shape do you see California 
in?  
</P>
<P>
 A: California, in the long run, is in good shape. As they say in real estate, 
the three most important things are location, location, location. California 
has it. We're on the edge of the Pacific Rim. We have a long seacoast. We have 
transportation and educational systems that, frayed as they may be, are in 
place. So in the long run I think the prognosis is looking very, very good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, we're having all the problems that usually are attendant to 
a major demographic change, both in the type of people who live here and the 
numbers of people who live here. Obviously we have to work those out without 
resorting to rhetoric. We're so concerned about who's living here, rather than 
how we educate the people that are here. Long-range, California is going to 
prosper based on whether we have an educated population. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about Proposition 187, the ballot measure to limit services 
to illegal immigrants?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Terrible. The controlling of the borders has to be done. That's a 
legitimate issue. We have to have some assistance for that. But Proposition 187 
presumes we will be tossing little kids out of school. If they are 
undocumented, is that how we are going to solve our problems? What does that 
say about civilization in California? Or people of one background getting along 
with people of another background? 
</P>
<P>
 In the last analysis, we have to be civil with each other, we have to learn to 
live with each other, we have to understand each other. And throwing little 
kids out of school is not going to solve the problem. It's just cruel. I hope 
the polls are wrong. In the long run, it's going to cause us much more societal 
pain for having done this than for the costs we're going to be facing. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't pretend that there aren't costs attendant to undocumented 
immigration. We need help from the federal government, both in terms of money 
and controlling the border. And for those people who entice illegal 
immigration, I think there should be penalties. But going after little kids and 
people who are sick -- to me, it's incredible that we have come to that point 
in California. Which now might mark me as a hopeless liberal, but I think it's 
shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you regard the budgetary clash between the cost of crime prevention 
and maintaining prisons, and the cost of education?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if I necessarily consider it a clash. I think the biggest 
problem is the two-thirds vote required in the Legislature on the budget. 
Because we sort of accept that as a given, as an inevitable, as something that 
we are never going to change. Looking at that, we then say, well, we have a 
clash between all the competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact of the matter is, we have to have a chance to do a better job. I 
think it would be a mistake to pass Proposition 184, the "three-strikes" 
initiative which bars changes in the law without a two-third legislative 
majority. I voted for it here, but you have to leave the Legislature some room 
to adjust. If there isn't enough money, then obviously, we will have to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything the Legislature could have -- or should have -- done 
differently to prepare for the budgetary crisis we now are in? Are there steps 
that should have been taken to cope with the aftereffects of Proposition 13?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think in retrospect we should not have so generously bailed out local 
government after the implementation of Proposition 13. Maybe what we succeeded 
in doing was only frustrating the will of the people and making it impossible 
to understand what the problems were. Now that the problems have occurred, we 
don't have a cause and effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of state bailouts, local governments would have found the mechanism to 
adjust to the extent they could adjust -- to the extent that you create a cause 
and effect and let the people make a decision. If the effects aren't as bad 
vis-a-vis the benefit of the tax cut, then that's the decision they want to 
make -- fine. But we created a situation where you couldn't make an intelligent 
decision because you couldn't see any cause and effect. You could probably say 
it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think will be the lasting impact of the state's taking back 
property tax in 1992-93 from counties and local governments, reversing the 
earlier bailout?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, it's not a lasting impact of taking the bailout back, it's the 
lasting impact where finally you have Proposition 13 felt in its reality. The 
problem is, a lot of people aren't going to believe that's the reason for the 
cutbacks because there's no immediacy about it. I think the reason why we're 
closing libraries, and some counties don't even have them anymore, is 
Proposition 13, and the cutback of services. So if you're talking about 
regrets, we should have undertaken a more political and vigorous addressing of 
the concern over property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that we didn't hear the public, we did. But we weren't organized 
about it. We should have had a concise, prompt, unified response. I think we 
could have come up with something that was real property tax relief and would 
have had the support of the public. And we had missed the political opportunity 
to present a program and then have enough time to sell it. So if you're talking 
about another policy regret, I guess that's the biggest one. I don't think 
anything else comes close. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything you'd like to add?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I guess reflections on the mixed emotions of leaving the place. It's sort 
of like, hey, I'm getting my privacy back, and the price of that is losing the 
fun of being in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the first legislator to go through term limits, and to others who are 
going to face it: Maybe it's not so bad. So I'm not saying that term limits are 
great, but longevity in public office in a democratic system has an element of 
inconsistency about it.ROBERTI, DAVID A

BULLETS BOUNCE OFF GANG MEMBER IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A gang member was shot in the head and chest as he stood on a Pacoima sidewalk 
Monday, but the bullets bounced off, doing him little harm, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old man, whom police would identify only as a gang member from Van 
Nuys, was standing on Correnti Street in Pacoima at about 6:30 p.m. when a car 
drove by and someone inside fired at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullet didn't enter his skull and the shot to his chest bounced off his 
breastplate bone," said Sgt. Charles Evans of the LAPD's Foothill Division. The 
man was treated for superficial wounds at a local hospital and released, Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a second man, standing a few feet away, was also shot in the 
attack. He was hospitalized in fair condition with wounds to the foot and 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known whether the second man was with the gang member.  
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects but plan to continue their investigation. They said 
witnesses and victims were reluctant to give any information about the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said the shooter may have used a .22-caliber handgun -- the weakest 
cartridge available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not all that unusual," he said. "If the bullet hits you a certain way, 
it can be easily deflected." JEANNETTE REGALADO

COURTHOUSE EXPECTED TO REOPEN IN APRIL; SAN FERNANDO: QUAKE REPAIR ESTIMATES 
LOWER THAN EXPECTED DESPITE SIX-WEEK DELAY IN TARGET DATE, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 The San Fernando courthouse, which was damaged extensively in the January 
earthquake, will reopen in April, Superior Court officials said as bidding 
began Monday on the first phase of the multimillion-dollar fix-up job. 
</P>
<P>
 Court and city officials had hoped that the four-story building, which 
provided a steady stream of customers for nearby businesses in downtown San 
Fernando, would reopen next March. 
</P>
<P>
 But hassles with federal disaster relief officials and with insurance 
adjusters pushed the target date back about six weeks, said Judge Judith 
Ashmann, supervising judge of San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "As these things go," she said Monday, "that's not too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ray Ojeda added that an April, 1995, reopening was particularly good 
news for downtown merchants, many of whom feared that the courthouse might 
never reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can do it that fast, it would really help our economy, since we 
depend a lot on the courthouse," he said. "I didn't realize until they had to 
pull out the impact (the courthouse) had." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every part of the 11-year-old courthouse was damaged in the Jan. 17 
quake -- support columns, concrete walls, stairwells and pipes. At first, 
officials with the county's Internal Services Department, which maintains 
county buildings, were not even sure the building could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial repair estimate came in at $30 million. Officials were not sure a 
fix-up was feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 When bidding for the first phase of the project opened Monday, however, cost 
projections were only about one-third that much, about $9.5 million to $13.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase -- lugging broken goods out of the courthouse and fixing 
surface cracks -- is due to begin in early December and cost $500,000, Ashmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase -- the reconstruction of columns and walls -- is due to start 
mid-January, she said. It should cost $9 million to $13 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracts will include a penalty for late completion and the incentive of a 
prompt payment guarantee for on-time work, Ashmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the work is done, it will take the court's 13 judges, 60 staffers and 
50,000 files a month or two to move back in, Ashmann said. For now, most of the 
Superior Court judges, staffers and files are camping out at the Van Nuys 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller San Fernando Municipal Court is still in operation, at the old 
courthouse across the street from the police station. Quake damage to that 
court building was light. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you know, a lot of small businesses in the city are suffering from our 
being gone -- the restaurants, the cleaners," Ashmann said. "I'm sure they'll 
all be happy to know we are coming back. We are."

QUAKE RAINS ON PARADE FOR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE; CHATSWORTH: THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY 
EVENT LACKS VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE MANY ARE STILL REBUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has claimed another victim: the Chatsworth Holiday 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth Chamber of Commerce, which has organized the annual event, has 
been unable to find enough volunteers to stage the parade, said Bill Powers, 
the chamber's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dozens of business people who normally volunteer their time have 
been busy trying to recover from the earthquake, said Powers. The chamber has 
lost about 200 members since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community that has been devastated," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, three parade volunteers had signed up, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 It takes about 60 volunteers, donating 30 hours each, to organize the parade, 
a 13-year tradition held on the second Sunday in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Potvin, who has chaired or co-chaired the event for the past five years, 
said some of the businesses that donated money last year indicated they could 
not do so this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no funds," she said. "There is no committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Afflerbach, corresponding secretary for the Chatsworth Coordinating 
Council, a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding community organizations, 
said she heard about the chamber's difficulties in early September. The chamber 
asked the council to help, Afflerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the board, we just felt it was too late," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Things were such in our own organization that there wouldn't be enough people 
in our own organization to get the people together we need." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake threw the entire process into disarray, say those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally we have our first meeting in March. We never even had an actual 
meeting this year," said John Thorpe, who has been a parade volunteer for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said he hopes the community can organize an alternative event on a much 
smaller scale, but Afflerbach said it was unclear whether even that would 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a definite thing yet," she said. "We have not even discussed it, and 
we are running out of time. It takes four to six weeks to get flyers printed. 
It may also be too late to recruit groups that would want to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Powers said, the chamber plans to resume the parade next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't over; we're taking a break this year," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have every intention of trying to put it together again next year."

ELECTION '94; 36TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman William (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), 63, was first elected in 1992. 
The retired U.S. Air Force colonel and test pilot, has a wife and seven 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hutchins, the Democratic challenger, 44, is a material quality 
specialist at Northrop-Grumman Corp. Hutchins is married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's legislative career began with an inauspicious bang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only six months into his first term when it was reported that the 
freshman lawmaker had distributed a derogatory poem about illegal immigrants to 
some of his GOP capitol colleagues. Widely condemned statewide, Knight gave an 
emotional address before the state Assemby in May, 1993 to apologize and 
declare: "I am not a bigot." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Knight has tried to regain his balance and get on with his 
conservative agenda. To streamline state government, Knight has proposed 
abolishing several state boards and commissions, including such "politically 
correct" entities as the Commission on the Status of Women and the Native 
American Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 For his constituents back home, Knight brought home some pork when he won 
approval for a new Superior Court district to serve the Antelope Valley. Still, 
Knight's bigget goal has proved elusive: getting Palmdale designated as an 
enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36th District, with Santa Clarita and the Antelope Valley as its 
population anchors, is solidly Republican. Of its registered voters, 51% are 
Republican, 35% are Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins has unsuccessfully run twice for school board seats in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Knight has failed to be a strong friend of the area's now-troubled 
aerospace industry and has only weakly dealt with threats to the environment 
posed by a plan to develop Elsmere Canyon as a landfill and a project that 
dumps human waste sludge, imported from Los Angeles, in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Knight has been an embarassment to the district," says Hutchins, who has 
lived in the Antelope Valley since 1988. "His poetry was garbage and he has 
still not apologized to local Hispanics for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian candidate Eric Fussell, an aerospace technician 
from Palmdale. JOHN SCHWADA

 A motorcycle slammed into a truck at a Lancaster intersection Sunday night, 
killing the rider and seriously injuring his passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office identified the motorcyclist Monday as 
James Marsh, 32, of Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's traffic investigators said the collision occurred at 9:25 p.m. when 
Marsh failed to stop for a stop sign while riding south on 50th Street East. 
His motorcycle struck the side of an eastbound semi-trailer truck that had just 
entered the intersection at Avenue K, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh was killed instantly, deputies said. His passenger, Angel Janes, 29, of 
Tujunga, was taken to Lancaster Community Hospital with serious internal 
injuries. She was reported in stable condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Mark Smith, 36, of Lancaster, was not injured and was 
not cited, deputies said. PHIL SNEIDERMAN

CANDIDATE AIMS FOR A FATHER-SON TEAM IN STATE ASSEMBLY; ELECTIONS: WITH A WIN 
IN THE HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC 47TH DISTRICT, LAWYER KEVIN MURRAY WOULD JOIN DAD 
WILLARD (D-PARAMOUNT) IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Confident of joining his father in the state Assembly after the November 
elections, Windsor Hills lawyer Kevin Murray is already looking ahead to rising 
to a leadership role in the political vacuum expected to result from term 
limits for legislative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But first Murray will have to beat Republican challenger Jonathan Leonard and 
two minor-party candidates for the seat vacated by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, 
who made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has reason to be confident -- 75% of the 47th District's registered 
voters are Democrats. In the 1992 election, Leonard won only 14% of the vote 
against Moore's 81%. And this time around, Leonard does not appear to have the 
resources for an aggressive, districtwide campaign. He reported no campaign 
bankroll in his most recent finance statement, while Murray has reported 
raising $108,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of that in a tough, nine-candidate primary. With the help of his 
father, Assemblyman Willard Murray (D-Paramount), and supporters including 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Murray beat primary opponents who included a 
candidate backed by the powerful political machine of Reps. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 He had something else going for him, he says. He knows the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very important for me and my peer group, my friends, to run in an area 
where I grew up, where I rode my bike, where I had my first job," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th District covers parts of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district, Culver 
City, Palms and South-Central Los Angeles. Its heart is predominantly black, 
upper- and middle-income neighborhoods, and it also has less affluent areas and 
a significant Jewish population, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts consider the district a sure win for Democrats. Leonard acknowledges 
that his challenge is to persuade voters to look beyond the party labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a lot of crossovers," he said. The younger Murray did not 
take a traditional career path for a politician. He said that unlike the 
African American politicians of a previous generation, many of whom came from 
the church and the civil rights struggle, his experience is in business. 
</P>
<P>
 While a talent agent for the William Morris Agency, he studied comparative 
Asian economic systems for his MBA and then studied law. He received his 
business degree in 1983 and his law degree in 1987, both from Loyola Marymount 
University. In 1989, he began working in entertainment law and as a children's 
court advocate.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, his father was skeptical about his run for office. "He 
wanted to make sure that I really wanted to do it, and he wanted to make sure I 
had what it took," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his father eventually helped run the campaign, lined up support in 
Sacramento and put him on his slate mailer. Murray won 21% of the primary vote, 
four points ahead of Ed Johnson, an aide to U.S. Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) who was backed by the Berman-Waxman machine, and teacher Jimmie Woods 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Murray said he expects to continue working closely with his son in 
Sacramento, where they would be the first father-son team in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can take credit for anything, I have more credit as a father who helped 
raise a person who developed into a fine citizen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They do have differences. Willard Murray said his son supports strict gun 
control, while he does not, and in general his son is more liberal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They're both hoping Kevin will rise to leadership roles in the Assembly. 
Because of term limits, one of the new Assembly members elected in November 
will be a speaker in six years. But "we're not looking that far ahead," Willard 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard, 63, a retired firefighter and lifelong resident of the area, said he 
believes he can appeal to Democratic voters with his ideas for improving 
education through increased community involvement and improving the economy 
with enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 California's social problems, he said, cannot be resolved by the state's 
massive increase in prison construction. "We need to get jobs for this 
community," Leonard said. "Penitentiaries are not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity of Murray's name to that of a third-party candidate in the 
race, Libertarian Kevin Murphy, could confuse some voters.  
</P>
<P>
 A supporter of a cautious approach to such Libertarian policies as 
legalization of drugs, Murphy, a computer programmer, said he hopes to show 
that voters will respond if the Libertarians target less controversial issues 
such as lower taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Peace and Freedom candidate in the race is Tamara Taleebah, a teacher. In 
the primary, both Murphy and Taleebah ran uncontested.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PROP. 187 RISES AS KEY THEME IN TOP 2 RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not the economy, stupid. It's not "three strikes, you're out." Not 
welfare or health care or the death penalty. It's not even the general subject 
of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue that has suddenly emerged as the central theme of California's 
hard-fought gubernatorial and Senate races is Proposition 187, the initiative 
that proposes to deny most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as it has split the races in an obvious way -- Democrats on one side, 
Republicans on the other -- Proposition 187 is proving to be treacherous ground 
for those seeking major office in California this year. For starters, the 
ground may be shifting -- opponents of the measure say their polls show support 
for Proposition 187 narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates from both parties are finding ways to seize on the measure as a 
potential tool. Yet it is clear that Proposition 187 can cut several ways, 
depending on party, incumbency and record. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, just over two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Gov. Pete Wilson 
released two new ads on illegal immigration that urge Californians to vote yes 
on Proposition 187 because "there's a right way and there's a wrong way, (and) 
to reward the wrong way is not the American way." 
</P>
<P>
 "American citizenship is a treasure beyond measure. But now the rules are 
being broken," say both of the ads, the latest indication that the Republican 
incumbent is tethering his reelection hopes to Proposition 187. "Join Gov. 
Wilson in sending a strong message to Congress and to the courts to stop 
illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's new ads come even as Democrat Kathleen Brown also has seized upon 
Proposition 187 with renewed vigor. Brown aggressively attacked the measure 
during campaign stops over the weekend as racially divisive and irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her GOP opponent, Mike 
Huffington, staked out positions on opposite sides of the measure -- Feinstein 
against it, Huffington for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major national politicians also weighed in last week, notably 
President Clinton and Republicans William J. Bennett and Jack Kemp, who 
denounced Proposition 187 as ill-conceived and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the sudden flurry of activity on Proposition 187? Political analysts said 
the sweeping initiative has touched such deep-rooted concerns among California 
voters that the major political figures could hardly avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time when candidates must distinguish themselves once and for all 
in a way that voters care about, and Proposition 187, which sparks emotional 
responses from both opponents and proponents, is the kind of issue that lends 
itself to such distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said it also is the kind of issue that could be used to the advantage 
of politicians on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown and Huffington, the sudden increased emphasis on Proposition 187 is 
an attempt to motivate their base voters -- liberal Democrats in Brown's case, 
conservative Republicans in Huffington's. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, may be trying to tone down what some describe as the "us 
vs. them" messages of his earlier ads on illegal immigration. While those ads 
had an ominous tone -- "They keep coming," warned a narrator -- the new ads 
focus on fairness and on following the rules, noted Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the 
Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson's polling must be indicating that his harsh rhetoric on immigration is 
beginning to backfire," Jeffe said -- a suggestion that Wilson's campaign 
flatly denies. "If Wilson ratchets up the rhetoric to the point where he 
mobilizes the right, he may well risk losing the moderate liberals and 
Democrats to Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 For Feinstein, the issue of Proposition 187 is more complicated, and some 
analysts speculate that the incumbent senator would have avoided taking any 
position on it had her opponent Huffington not first announced his support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 is a very difficult issue for any Democrat and I think it is 
only human for virtually any Democrat to hope that he or she can avoid taking a 
stand," said Darry Sragow, a Democratic political consultant who once worked 
for Feinstein but is not involved in the race this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not only a broadly popular proposition, it's also one that is supported 
with a great deal of passion," Sragow said. "Democrats . . . are afraid if they 
oppose it it will cost them a lot of votes in a year when votes aren't easy to 
come by."  
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll earlier this month found that 59% of likely voters planned to 
support Proposition 187, while 33% opposed it. Of the measure's proponents, 21% 
said they were motivated to vote by Proposition 187. Of the opponents, 30% said 
the measure was a reason they would go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's chief campaign spokesman, says there is only one 
explanation for Brown's aggressive attacks on Proposition 187: Brown expects to 
lose and wants to do it gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a decision to mobilize her base and write off the swing voters who 
will decide this race once for all," Schnur said. "This is the Michael Dukakis 
lose-with-dignity strategy. You go back to your base, you close the margins, 
but by giving up on the swing vote she is tacitly conceding defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffe disagrees. She said the state treasurer, who has been criticized for 
running a lackluster campaign that does not motivate loyal Democrats, may be 
trying to lure previously unconvinced Democrats to the polls by drawing a sharp 
contrast between herself and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "For months, people have been yelling that there is no clear distinction 
between the two gubernatorial candidates. (Proposition) 187 is one issue (on 
which) she had the ability to articulate an alternative," Jeffe said. "Up till 
now, liberal Democrats didn't seem to care enough about this issue or about 
Kathleen Brown. . . . But that may be changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign also may be gambling on a shift in public sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said Brown's opposition to the measure might win her votes "because 
she's viewed as courageous. But that strategy is only going to work if there's 
a major shift in 187. (The Brown campaign) is praying that the public opinion 
on 187 is going to move in a significant way as the Kemps and the Bennetts come 
out against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Woodward, whose political consulting firm is running the Taxpayers 
Against 187 campaign, said that tracking polls they are conducting five times a 
week show that the race has tightened up considerably. Woodward says his recent 
polling shows 46% in favor of Proposition 187, 42% against. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the gubernatorial race, to the extent it helps or hurts, it's helped 
Wilson as much as it's going to," Woodward said. "It has the potential for 
helping Kathleen Brown out, depending how well we do. I think you can make the 
judgment it might help Kathleen the better we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts said Proposition 187 may have less impact on the Senate race, 
in part because Feinstein has a solid record on illegal immigration and in part 
because she and Huffington have waited so long to make their views public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it hurts Dianne because, like Pete Wilson, she has been 
out in front on immigration," said Dick Rosengarten, editor of California 
Political Week. "She has been out there pushing for more border guards, she has 
been out there on the crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Steinberg, a political strategist who primarily works for Republicans, 
said for Huffington, support of Proposition 187 is a pure political gambit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is closing in the polls so either you are supporting it because you are a 
person of enormous courage and conviction or you are still looking at tea 
leaves and feel on balance that it will pass," he said. "And no one has ever 
accused (Huffington) of being a person of enormous courage and conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, several political analysts said, even the clearest split between 
candidates on one key issue is often not enough to guarantee a vote. Indeed, 
they said, voters almost always look at more than one position before settling 
on a candidate.

SOUTH-CENTRAL SHOOTING ATTACK KILLS 3, INJURES 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A barrage of gunfire that claimed the lives of three men and wounded six 
others in a South-Central Los Angeles front yard was carried out by gang 
members seeking to scare "nickel and dime" drug dealers encroaching on their 
turf, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the attack, which occurred at 10:15 p.m. Sunday in the heart of 
one of the city's most crime-scarred sectors, said it was terrifying even for 
their neighborhood -- where the staccato pop of gunfire is a nightly 
occurrence.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like it went on for 10 minutes, must have been 30 or 40 rounds," 
said Tony Miles, who lives near the scene of the attack and said he had "never 
seen or heard anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the wounded said the gang members walked up to the wrought-iron gate 
shouting, "Shut up and get on the ground!" Then, he said, they robbed the 10 
people in the yard of the peach-colored duplex on East 53rd Street and opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 " Gracias a Dios , they didn't get me," said the 23-year-old witness, who 
identified himself as Jose Estrada, 23. He nonetheless nursed a pistol-whipped 
forehead and a bullet wound in one calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Govea, 34, and Jesus (Chuy) Gonzalez, 27, were shot dead in the front 
yard of the two-story home, detectives said. A third victim, Arturo Macias, 24, 
died later at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at least two of the wounded were lingering near death Monday. 
Daniel Bravo, 20, was listed in critical but stable condition at County-USC, 
and his 34-year-old brother, Jose Bravo, was in critical condition at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the shooting victims, all men, were playing cards, shooting 
dice and drinking beer when about half a dozen gun-toting youths, dressed in 
T-shirts and baggy pants, strolled en masse up the darkened block and into the 
run-down yard. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the witnesses said, the assailants seemed only interested in the 
victims' wallets, but within minutes a barrage of bullets was peppering the 
night air. Two of the victims were killed instantly; others were left bleeding 
in a litter of beer bottles as their assailants fled down the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias' brother said he had just left the duplex and walked into his own home 
two doors down when he heard the gunfire erupt. Alarmed, he turned and sprinted 
back down the block, just in time to see his wounded brother gasping for air. 
</P>
<P>
 As terrified neighbors peered in through the fence, the brother tried in vain 
to revive Macias through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Macias -- who lived at 
the duplex with his wife and children -- later died. His family was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a war," said Eric Johnson, who was inside a nearby house when the 
shooting began. "All you heard was gunshots everywhere -- boom, boom, boom."  
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the crime-toughened neighborhood, which is populated mostly by 
impoverished African Americans and Latino immigrants, blamed the shooting on 
the Playboys, a neighborhood Latino gang that had reportedly warned some of the 
victims to stop selling rock cocaine on its turf. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one neighbor said that, as they headed toward the duplex, the killers 
-- Latino males in their teens or early 20s -- warned the area's black 
residents to clear the streets so bystanders wouldn't be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said something was about to go down, so everybody should go inside," 
said resident Melanie Hughes. "When we got here, the bodies were everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives would not corroborate the name of the gang allegedly involved, but 
confirmed that some of the duplex's occupants -- who were not in any gang -- 
apparently had begun running what they termed "a nickel-and-dime" crack 
operation in the heart of an area notorious for its cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the whole area around 53rd (Street), there's a lot of narcotics 
trafficking," said Lt. Jim Voge of the LAPD's Newton Division. "I would have to 
say that probably six blocks in any direction (from the duplex) is a high 
volume of narcotics sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivor Estrada denied that any of the victims had been involved in the drug 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just drinking and talking -- that's all," he said Monday, standing on 
crutches outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams said the shooting had been an 
apparent retaliation by the gang members, who had warned the residents of the 
duplex one or two days earlier to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams noted, however, that not all the shooting victims were suspected drug 
dealers and that many of those at the attack scene were unaware of any 
narcotics activity. The chief added that uniformed officers have been 
dispatched from throughout the city to the area in an attempt to forestall any 
plans for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to prevent any escalation of violence in the community," Williams 
said.

 A 3-million-gallon reservoir in Laguna Beach finally will be built. Two 
water-dumping helicopters are on their way. And firefighters throughout Orange 
County have been fitting their engines with everything from flame-retardant 
foam to swimming pool siphons. 
</P>
<P>
 As fire officials and county residents this week mark the one-year anniversary 
of last year's firestorm, they do so better prepared and better equipped to 
handle another massive blaze than at any point in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no better time to move than immediately following an incident," said 
Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on public concern, fire officials across the Southland have lobbied 
successfully for better equipment and pushed for stricter fire and building 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always easier for politicians to make policy decisions when the public 
is supportive of that action," Holms said.  
</P>
<P>
 The massive destruction last year jolted the public awake, Holms said. 
Homeowners finally realized, he said, that they needed to make their homes fire 
safe and help prevent such disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the fire," Holms said, "it was pretty much falling on deaf ears. Now 
people are listening." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's about time. An increasing number of fire experts say that there will 
never be enough firefighters or enough new equipment to counterbalance the 
explosive potential energy that has been accumulating in the hills for several 
decades. Without clearing thousands of acres of land or restricting the flood 
of flatlanders into the foothills, more disastrous firestorms are inevitable, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fires are burning more intensely than they have in the past, and the wild 
land fire problem is getting worse and worse," said Matt Mathes, the U.S. 
Forest Service's regional spokesman. "Suppression alone is no longer going to 
do the job of protecting people from fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Counties from Ventura to San Diego were hit by a series of large, destructive 
fires last October. In Orange County, three large fires combined to burn more 
than 36,000 acres and destroy or severely damage 469 structures. Two of the 
fires, the Stagecoach fire near Anaheim Hills and the Ortega fire in the 
eastern part of the county, were primarily wild brush fires. The third and most 
destructive blaze occurred in Laguna and left hundreds of people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the devastation in the county, no lives were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The infernos ignited controversy, bureaucratic second-guessing and ultimately 
fire-related legislation in Orange County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if anything good came out of this tragedy it was the heightened 
awareness that this type of thing does indeed happen," Orange County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner said recently. "The impact on Orange County was 
unprecedented. It forced us to look more closely at fuel modification plans, 
building codes, and made us do some soul-searching about our (fire) helicopter 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, where four firefighters were seriously burned in the brush 
above Chatsworth, the city Fire Department's focus has been on safety. The 
department has acquired 1,000 pairs of fireproof pants and will eventually get 
more, to go to all 2,800 firefighters. Also, the force will be fitted with new 
belts to carry protective foil blankets, and with helmet flaps that shield the 
neck. Throw in new canteens and first aid backpacks and the total cost of the 
new gear will run to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Fire Department also helped broker a deal that brought 
highly touted Super Scooper airplanes to Southern California for testing this 
summer -- an arrangement that officials hope to extend into next year. Unlike 
many other airborne firefighters, the plane can reload its 1,600-gallon water 
tank without landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fire victims who lost their homes in the firestorm changed their 
outlook on fire safety. Of homes that have been rebuilt, most bear no 
resemblance to the tinderboxes that existed before. Fire-retardant roofs, metal 
support beams, enclosed eaves and drought-resistant landscaping are the style 
du jour in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is still so stressful," said JoAnna Schoon, a resident of 
Mystic Hills in Laguna Beach who is rebuilding her home. "We're minimizing the 
amount of exterior wood showing, putting stucco on our eaves and other things 
to make our home more fire resistant." Schoon and her husband also are dropping 
a fire safe into their cement foundation for their valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schoon says they have learned other lessons as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she is more aware of vegetation overgrowth around her house and 
the fine print in fire insurance policies. And she is making plans about "what 
items to grab and where they are," should another fire break out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners are even discussing imposing an assessment tax on themselves 
to make sure that nearby brush is cut back far enough from their homes. No 
matter what their response, one thing is clear: The fire has left an indelible 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking toward the anniversary with anticipation and dread," said 
Schoon, who plans to move into her rebuilt home in November. "It's still not 
over for us by any means." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire's impact on county officials was equally noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the embers cooled, local fire authorities conducted a governmental 
autopsy on the firestorm, trying to determine why it became so massive and how 
fire could be prevented in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings were: A severe lack of water, inadequate aerial support, 
dangerous vegetation overgrowth next to homes and poor firefighting access to 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials concluded that helicopters able to scoop water from nearby 
lakes probably could have extinguished the blaze long before it reached the 
developed areas of Laguna Beach from the brushy canyon where it was started. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, fire officials determined that a lack of water pressure and a 
three-hour power failure at a pumping station of the Laguna Beach County Water 
District seriously hampered the district's ability to keep water reservoirs at 
higher elevations filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials contend that the city's longtime refusal to build the 
3-million-gallon reservoir at the city's highest point was a significant factor 
when water virtually stopped flowing to the firefighters as they battled the 
blazes in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Others dispute that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even had the reservoir been built there wouldn't have been enough water to 
stop the fire," said Laguna Fire Chief Richard Dewberry. But it would have 
helped, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of lessons to be learned from that fire," said Holms, the 
county fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a price tag of $528 million, the knowledge didn't come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the fire, the Laguna Beach City Council finally approved the 
massive reservoir, despite some council members' concerns over the appearance 
of the structure. The council also voted to widen fire breaks, conduct fire 
safety inspections of more than 1,000 homes and spend $350,000 for a fuel 
modification program this year, compared to $65,000 for last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also employing the services of at least 650 goats to clear paths 
by eating the wild vegetation in the Laguna Canyon area. Goats have been used 
in the past, but their dining grounds have been refocused and expanded because 
of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is working on building a couple of fire access roads and an emergency 
vehicle turnout in several areas that had been difficult to reach during last 
year's blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think clearly the city council is doing everything it can do to make things 
as fire safe as possible," said Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank.  
</P>
<P>
 At the county level, the Board of Supervisors approved the acquisition of two 
firefighting helicopters that will be equipped to drop about 4,000 gallons of 
water an hour. Fire officials have also applied for federal grants to improve 
firefighting capabilities in several areas. These include retrofitting fire 
equipment to allow foam to be sprayed as well as water, adding portable pumps 
to fire engines and upgrading the communications systems, which were severely 
overloaded during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, supervisors have endorsed a list of stricter building 
and fire codes that are expected to become county ordinances soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the concepts that the board approved: stricter brush-clearance 
standards, more training for firefighters who battle blazes in areas that mix 
urban and rural environments, fire-resistant roofs and building materials, and 
controls over landscaping, property setbacks and structural designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody understood the threat, but not to the degree that it 
occurred," Dewberry said. "This was the worst fire that any of us had been on. 
Not only did it send a pointed message to the citizens, but to the fire 
officials as well." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was pleased that the city and county examined the fire and looked 
for ways to better prepare for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will happen again," he said. "And things tend to happen the same way 
unless you change. You need to learn from such incidents and reduce your risk."

NEW LIFE BLOSSOMS IN FIRE-CHARRED LAGUNA; ECOLOGY: PLANTS, ANIMALS RE-EMERGE 
AFTER LAST YEAR'S SOUTHLAND BLAZES. BUT EXPERTS SEE FULL RECOVERY YEARS OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 If a symbol of hope and renewal has emerged from these fire-ravaged canyons, 
it is embodied in a modest little shrub called laurel sumac. 
</P>
<P>
 Springing from a moonscape of blackened bark and gray ash, knee-high clumps of 
emerald-green sumac are already dotting the hillsides of Laguna Beach's prized 
Laurel Canyon. Born of autumn fire, weaned on spring rain, the native shrub is 
one of the first to stage a comeback after last October's wind-whipped 
wildfires scorched about 150,000 acres of sage scrub, chaparral and woodlands 
in five Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
 From Orange County's San Joaquin Hills to the Santa Monica and San Gabriel 
mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the torched earth had barely 
cooled when tiny branches of wild sumac began sprouting like clones from the 
blackened stumps of their predecessors, which everyone but a botanist might 
assume were hopelessly dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid regeneration of laurel sumac and other native plants and animals 
without human help seems miraculous, but this is one miracle that nature 
performs routinely in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire is Mother Nature's New Year's Eve, clearing out the old and ringing in 
the new. From Thousand Oaks, Malibu and Altadena to Laguna Beach, Temecula and 
Escondido, thousands of acres of dense, decades-old shrubs and chaparral were 
incinerated last fall, only to be replaced with small, fresh sprouts and fields 
of wildflowers by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire destroys momentarily but rejuvenates in the long term," said Mickey 
Long, director of Altadena's Eaton Canyon Nature Center, which burned down and 
is yet to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the first anniversary of the beginning of the firestorms arrives 
this week, ecology experts say it will take about eight years, perhaps longer, 
for Southern California to return to the lush, healthy diversity of flora and 
fauna of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, much of Southern California's prime parkland and other 
wilderness hovers in a fragile, eerie gap between death and resurrection. 
Forlorn piles of shriveled, fried cactus and raw earth lie next to festive 
poppies and lilies that rose from the ash in bursts of color last spring. 
Gnarled, old sycamores and oaks, rendered charcoal black, are sprouting tender 
green shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wild animals have survived -- even thrived -- in the aftermath, including 
burrowing rodents that are vital to the ecosystem as prey for mountain lions, 
hawks, eagles and other predators. But the gnatcatcher, a federally protected 
songbird, has not fared as well. About 14,000 acres of some of the bird's best 
habitat was destroyed in the Laguna Canyon fire, and it could be years before 
the tiny birds return. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how quickly these animals and their natural habitats recover is almost 
completely at the mercy of natural forces. The land will fare best if blessed 
with mild winter rains and spared major fires, at least for awhile. Frequent or 
ill-timed man-made fires, instead of rejuvenating the wilderness, can 
permanently denude it of native plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, wildlife biologists and botanists are pleased with the nascent 
recovery of the wilderness, especially the return of some spectacular, 
long-dormant wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scorched valley oaks, sycamores and other trees also survived, including 
90% of 200 oaks burned at Eaton Canyon. Oldest trees fare the best, while some 
saplings have such thin trunks and bark they cannot survive flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is recovering beautifully," said Suzanne Good, a state parks associate 
resource ecologist in the Santa Monica Mountains, who oversees 40,000 acres of 
parkland, most of which burned. "There are certain areas where it is difficult 
to tell there ever was a fire, especially Malibu Lagoon, where some (native 
plants) are already shoulder high." 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon last week, a full moon rose on one side of Laguna Beach's Laurel 
Canyon as the sun set on the other, bathing the chasm in the muted shades of 
autumn. While most of the wheat-colored ridges were still naked, many were 
attired in new patches of lemonade berry, sumac and pastel flowers. Hawks and 
great horned owls, even one rare golden eagle, soared above. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks better than I thought it would," said botanist Fred Roberts of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as he toured the area for the first time since 
the first days after the October fire. "I really thought it would still look 
dead. I'm impressed we're seeing so much green." 
</P>
<P>
 Before arson-spawned flames fanned by Santa Ana winds whipped across it, this 
parkland wedged between Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Irvine had been one of 
Southern California's largest and most biologically diverse wilderness areas. 
Its thick clumps of sagebrush, lemonade berry and buckwheat attracted 
gnatcatchers, deer, rare lizards, butterflies and other creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 After the firestorms, some experts worried that the heat was so intense that 
the plant roots would be incinerated. Trish Smith, a Nature Conservancy 
biologist who manages nature reserves owned by Orange County's largest 
landowner, the Irvine Co., was relieved that the initial fears were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying it was such an intense wildfire that (vegetation) wouldn't 
come back very well, so from that perspective, this is better than I expected," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the flames ignited Oct. 27, Smith was exploring Laguna Beach's lush Boat 
Canyon, and preparing for a long-awaited grand opening of the Irvine Co.'s 
sprawling reserve the next day. Watching a giant plume of black smoke approach 
over the ridge, she evacuated. When she returned after the fires were 
extinguished, about 80% of the Irvine Co.'s 6,600-acre southern reserve had 
burned, along with 90% of adjacent Crystal Cove State Park and Orange County's 
year-old Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing but bare ground and white ash," she recalled. "I was in a 
state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months since then, the expansive area has turned into what Smith 
called a botanist's dream -- long-dormant flowers such as California fuchsia 
have sprung to life. The public opening of the Irvine Co. reserve was 
postponed, but the tours are even more popular than expected, Smith said, since 
nature lovers swarm to the area to watch the rapid changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire, flower seeds couldn't compete for the sun's rays because much 
of this land was dense with brush. Fertilizer-like nutrients in the ash, 
sunlight reaching the soil and mild spring rains combined to revive the buried 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fire-scorched areas -- especially Point Mugu State Park in Ventura 
County, Leo Carrillo State Beach near Malibu and Caspers Wilderness Park in San 
Juan Capistrano -- also attracted visitors with striking springtime shows of 
wildflowers, including many varieties that hadn't appeared for years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park in south Orange County, the fire poppy, a 
pink and orange flower that had not been seen until after the fires, provided a 
splendid splash of color that was "just beautiful," said Tom Collins, a 
maintenance supervisor at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vegetation is looking good," Collins said. "I'm surprised at how fast 
it's growing back." 
</P>
<P>
 Caspers lost foliage on 5,000 of its 7,600 acres in last October's fire. Park 
officials say the fire helped clear away underlying brush that had been choking 
other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fire, manzanitas, laurel sumacs and native herbs have been springing 
from the remains. However, oak trees, which take longer to grow back, are still 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers have also seen California quail, deer, coyotes and gray foxes roaming 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking out there now, it's hard to tell which areas were burned," said Larry 
Norton, a ranger at Caspers. "The landscape is looking good." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Altadena area, where about 5,000 acres of wilderness burned, 20 
varieties of flowering plants new to the area -- including monkey flowers, 
lilies and phacelia -- and half a dozen new species of birds have appeared in 
Eaton Canyon. Only one local inhabitant -- the acorn woodpecker -- seems to 
have declined in numbers, apparently because its food supply of acorns was 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Poppies in burn areas of Leo Carrillo State Beach were more spectacular last 
spring than the famous annual display in the Antelope Valley. And after Ventura 
County's Green Meadow fire scarred 44,000 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains, 
wildflowers there bloomed in abundance, including two rare types of Mariposa 
lilies at the Circle X Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circle X was in fact the best display I've ever seen in my life," said Rick 
Burgess, a Thousand Oaks city planner and board member of a local branch of the 
California Native Plant Society. "The combination of yellow, lilac and purple 
was just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the flowering plants, dubbed fire followers, require the intense heat 
of a fire to pop open their tough seed jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm particularly fond of the cream-flowered eardrops, which will bloom 
profusely the year after a fire, then a little less in subsequent years until 
they disappear," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildflowers, while impressive to human visitors, are not vital to 
sustaining Southern California's ecosystems. Much more critical are California 
sagebrush, lemonade berry and other shrubs that native animals use to feed and 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the shrubs have begun to re-sprout, they are not nearly mature enough to 
allow creatures such as gnatcatchers, a threatened species that resides in 
Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties, to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Laguna Canyon fire, 47 pairs and nine single gnatcatchers lived on 
14,000 acres of prime sage scrub habitat between Laguna Beach and Newport 
Beach. After the blaze, none remained, according to spring, 1994, data 
accumulated by the Orange County Environmental Management Agency. Also, only 
three pairs of cactus wrens -- compared to 101 pairs before the fire -- were 
found on the burned land. 
</P>
<P>
 Gnatcatchers, just 4 1/2 inches long and feeble flyers, cannot easily flee 
flames and smoke. Most are presumed dead, although 29 pairs showed up in the 
spring on unburned scrub to the northwest, offering hope that they were 
refugees that escaped the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses to the gnatcatcher, however, were originally feared to be much 
worse; biologists had thought 100 to 200 pairs inhabited the area before the 
fire, but a review of the data now shows that the birds apparently had been 
over-counted, said Tim Neely of the environmental management agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gnatcatchers and cactus wrens also were wiped out in the firestorms that 
swept through Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gnatcatcher took a big beating," said Bill Wagner, biological resources 
coordinator at the Metropolitan Water District's Riverside County Multi-Species 
Reserve, two-thirds of which burned. "But over time, they should come back 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 While the species survived, wildlife biologists warn that it cannot take much 
more stress -- from either fire or urban development -- before slipping closer 
toward extinction. Orange County, as a result of the Laguna firestorm, is now 
reviewing its policies for managing wild land, including new policies for 
controlled burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a large amount of habitat that went up in one fell swoop," Neely said, 
"and we are very concerned about the effects of these kinds of catastrophic 
occurrences, not just on the gnatcatcher but the total biodiversity of the 
region." 
</P>
<P>
 Mice and many other rodents -- important prey for hawks, eagles, coyotes and 
other predators -- have flourished because thick, tangled brush was burned, 
leaving more hospitable and nutritious grasses and buds. 
</P>
<P>
 One endangered species, the Stephens' kangaroo rat, might even be better off 
now than before the Riverside County fire, which cleared several thousand acres 
of brush that was becoming too dense to suit the burrowing creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was probably beneficial in the long term," said John Bradley, a U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service biologist. "It opened up a lot of coastal sage scrub 
habitat, (which) gives the Stephens' kangaroo rat a chance to move into some of 
those open areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's top predator -- the mountain lion -- also seems to be 
thriving because of a healthy increase in mule deer and other prey that feed on 
tender sprouts, said state Fish and Game warden John Wilcox, who patrols the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenacious and destructive weeds, however, such as mustard and artichoke 
thistle, are invading and crowding out some native shrubs and grasses that feed 
deer, birds and other creatures. 
</P>

 Undesirable red brome and wild oat have grown on slopes in southwestern 
Riverside County, where more than 25,000 acres burned. Rare grasslands in Point 
Mugu State Park's La Jolla Valley are in particularly poor shape, since mustard 
took hold there after the fires and grew nearly 12 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (mustard) gets a head start on everything else," said Milt McAuley, author 
of "Wildflowers of the Santa Monica Mountains," as he hiked through the valley. 
"This year there was no competition. It won't get quite so high next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the responsibility for the appearance of non-native grasses belongs to 
the state Department of Forestry, which sprayed hillsides with seeds to control 
erosion. Native seed was preferred by forestry officials, but it is difficult 
to obtain, so a mix containing ryegrass, which can overtake local shrubs and 
grasses, was sprayed in parts of Altadena, Thousand Oaks and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Towne, a Pasadena Glen resident involved in reseeding efforts by the 
Forest Service and the private Forest Preservation Society of Southern 
California, said cost was a key factor in choosing seed, leaving them with the 
choice of spraying ryegrass or risking mudslides in residential areas. The mix 
containing ryegrass was considerably less expensive than the native seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our choices were very pragmatic," Towne said. "The preservation of life and 
property and watershed topsoil was what led me to participate in putting 
ryegrass, a controversial procedure, on the watershed." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such unnatural intrusions, hopeful signs lie in the return of a 
vestige of wild California -- the ecologically valuable but mundane shrubs such 
as laurel sumac. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like to see is all those little green bushes all over the hills," said 
McAuley, who hikes in the Santa Monicas several times a week. "That'll be a 
nice forest in five years."

 * RECOVERY DRAGS ON: Rebuilding is painfully slow in fire-ravaged Laguna 
areas. D1 Reliving the Fires 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, on a crisp October morning near Escondido, a downed power line 
ignited a blaze. Later that afternoon, in Thousand Oaks, an arsonist set a 
second fire. By the end of the next day, vast regions of the Southern 
California landscape were ablaze. The fires consumed nearly 200,000 acres and 
caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. A year later, the region 
still struggling with the fires' emotional and financial toll.

HAITI BUSINESSMAN REVERSES, ACCEPTS POST OF PREMIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smarck Michel, a wealthy businessman who originally rejected President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's nomination as prime minister, has accepted a second 
offer after being assured he would have a free hand to direct a free-market 
economic program, U.S. and Haitian sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was settled finally this morning," a senior U.S. official said after 
reports circulated that Aristide would submit Michel's name to the Parliament 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Michel, who resigned from Aristide's original Cabinet in 
June, 1991, because the two disagreed over both the president's method of 
governing and his policies, puts an end to efforts by Aristide's left-wing 
supporters and perhaps Aristide himself to name a prime minister more attuned 
to social programs than a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief candidate from that side was Claudette Werleigh, the foreign 
minister in the government's acting Cabinet and a past supporter of a radical, 
populist government program. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide aides said she was considered only after Michel had rejected the 
position, but some Haitian political experts said it is possible that the 
president had made his initial offer so conditional that Michel had to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would have cleared the way for a prime minister so aligned with his real 
thinking that she is called his twin," one source said of Werleigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Her nomination was discarded in a Presidential Palace meeting of Aristide 
advisers and political leaders Thursday after Michel supporters successfully 
convinced the president that she would seriously hurt efforts to obtain foreign 
aid and investment, Haitian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several respected economists and planners who are counted on by the United 
States and international development agencies and lending organizations to 
follow an austere free-market economy had made it clear they would not serve 
under Werleigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among these were Leslie Delatour, a recent Aristide adviser and 
free-market advocate who drafted an economic plan endorsed by the president and 
enthusiastically received by the United States and the other developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Leslie Voltaire, an admired economic planner, and Marie-Michele 
Rey, an experienced and respected private banker, also ruled themselves out if 
Michel was not persuaded to reconsider his rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Delatour and Rey will be offered jobs as finance minister and 
Central Bank president, respectively. Voltaire will serve as either planning 
minister or an economics adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Haitian law, Aristide submits his nomination for prime minister to the 
Parliament for approval. The Cabinet ostensibly is selected by the prime 
minister and ratified separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, a 57-year-old rice importer and wholesaler, first turned down the 
prime minister's position one or two days before Aristide returned Oct. 15 to 
reclaim the office taken from him three years earlier in a military coup, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates said Michel was unsettled by Aristide's apparent ambivalence about 
pursuing an aggressive free-market economic program as his main policy in the 
15 months left in his term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Furthermore," a political associate said, "Smarck thought he saw the same 
signs that caused the first break." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Michel's resignation as commerce minister in 1991 in a 
dispute over fixing prices and government subsidies of food products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surface reason was a disagreement over whether the government should help 
people by lowering the cost of living by reducing prices or by creating jobs 
and cutting government intervention," another Haitian political figure said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another equally important and maybe more important reason was Aristide's 
practice of telling Smarck one thing in the morning and then meeting someone 
with a different view and changing his mind in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials here and in Washington had sought to induce Michel to change 
his mind almost from the moment he rejected the first offer. Ranking Clinton 
Administration officials in Washington pressed Aristide, through his U.S. 
advisers, to assure Michel that he would have authority to carry out his 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The same message was delivered in several phone conversations and two meetings 
that U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing had with Aristide last week, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear late last spring that Aristide would actually return, 
Michel was not the Clinton Administration's first choice for prime minister, 
one diplomat said, "because they were concerned he wouldn't be independent 
enough and because the traditional business elite doesn't really know him." 
</P>
<P>
 There was concern on some counts, one businessman here said, "that he was too 
sympathetic to Aristide's original position and that he was resentful of the 
old elite because they never accepted him." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, who is married and has two daughters, comes from the relatively humble 
background of a father who was an army captain. Yet he was able to study 
business in the United States and became a millionaire on his own in the risky 
field of commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michel is a good compromise," a senior U.S. diplomat said Monday. "He is 
close to Aristide, but he is trusted by the foreign financial community, and 
he's shown that he's no Aristide puppet." 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been close friends since the 1980s, when Michel became involved 
in Catholic Church social programs involving Aristide, then an activist priest. 
Michel hid Aristide when he was pursued by military thugs and joined with other 
wealthy supporters to buy him a home to meet a constitutional requirement that 
presidential candidates own property. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel's daughter Marjorie was Aristide's 1990 campaign manager and served as 
his palace hostess at official events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two have been friends for years; they even stayed friends after Smarck 
resigned," a friend of Michel's said. "I think that Aristide will keep his word 
because he knows that this time Smarck is serious."

ITO REJECTS BID TO OUST 80 PANELISTS; COURT: SIMPSON CASE PROSECUTOR FAILS IN 
EFFORT TO REMOVE PROSPECTIVE JURORS. DEFENSE EFFORT TO DELAY TRIAL IS ALSO 
REFUSED AS NEW CONCERN OVER JURORS' CANDOR ARISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Smarting from the release of transcripts in which she questioned the honesty 
of prospective jurors, a prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder trial on Monday 
unsuccessfully tried to remove about 80 panelists -- the entire first wave 
being considered during a selection process marked by controversy and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito denied the motion by Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Marcia Clark, who at first sought to disband the entire 300-member jury pool. 
At the same time, Ito turned down a renewed defense effort to have Simpson 
released on bail and to have trial in the case postponed for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both motions were prompted by deep frustrations about the task of selecting a 
jury. During a closed-door hearing last week, prosecutors and defense attorneys 
expressed misgivings about the candor of the prospective jurors they were 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Their remarks were first made public in a transcript unsealed by Ito on 
Friday. In it, Clark suggested that "many, if not most" prospective jurors in 
the case had been lying in order to win a place on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito rejected Clark's motion Monday, concerns about the jury pool 
rapidly resurfaced once the judge and lawyers returned to the business of 
questioning potential jurors. The first candidate called to the box said other 
members of the jury pool may be less than candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe them," said the woman, a 51-year-old Glendale resident 
who was later excused from service. "I think they're saying one thing and 
they're meaning something else. . . . I think they're coming here with a menu 
or agenda I haven't even seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said those comments redoubled her fears about the possibility of jurors 
tainted by exposure to publicity, and emphasized the need to eventually 
sequester the jury that is chosen to hear the Simpson murder case. Simpson has 
pleaded not guilty to killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sequestration is no longer simply an option," Clark said. "It's a mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to persuade Ito that the idea is feasible, Clark said prosecutors had 
found a possible site for the jury to be sequestered, an area near an 
unspecified college campus where jurors could walk, exercise and attend 
lectures. Transportation to and from court would be convenient, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 But her pitch met with a scornful response from Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., who has vigorously opposed sequestering the jury despite the 
publicity surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a place: It's called Neverland," Cochran told the judge, apparently 
referring to the estate of another celebrity client, entertainer Michael 
Jackson. "It has all kinds of rides." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he left open the option of eventually sequestering the jury, Ito 
declined to approve that idea Monday and said he would wait to see how further 
questioning goes before making a final decision. "I'm not at the point of 
imploding yet," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution request for the first panel of prospective jurors to be sent 
home is the latest indicator of the government attorneys' mounting frustration 
with the results of their jury questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Ito released the previously sealed transcript in which Simpson 
lawyer Robert L. Shapiro said he was concerned that prospective jurors would 
say anything to get on the "case of the century." In response to that, Clark 
was quoted as complaining that many of the prospective jurors appeared to be 
lying in order to cover up their fondness for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many if not most (of the prospective jurors) are lying to the detriment of 
the People because they are sitting there as fans of this defendant saying: 'We 
want to get on this jury because we want to turn a blind eye to your evidence 
and a deaf ear to the testimony so we can acquit this man no matter what,' " 
Clark said during that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she added that she wished she could subject prospective jurors to lie 
detector tests, Clark said Monday that she meant that remark facetiously and 
that the context was lost on reporters forced to rely on a transcript rather 
than hearing the statement directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, however, Cochran said he did not take Clark's comments as a 
joke. And Shapiro, Clark's principal nemesis, agreed, calling his adversary's 
remarks "one of the most idiotic statements ever made in a courtroom anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 When defense attorneys first proposed that the transcript from the Oct. 19 
hearing be made public, prosecutors objected. On Monday, Clark complained that 
its release resulted in news coverage unfavorable to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those remarks were made in closed hearings that the People were confident 
would remain closed," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had said they believed the transcript should remain sealed because 
it included a statement by Simpson to the judge that they characterized as 
self-serving. But defense attorneys accused the government lawyers of fighting 
the transcript's release because it was embarrassing to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Ito was right to release that transcript because prosecutors were 
not allowed to seal documents merely because they were interested in 
"protecting themselves from their own stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the motivation for prosecutors seeking to seal the transcript, its 
release would not matter if prospective jurors were obeying an admonition given 
to them by Ito. Last week, he instructed the 80 or so members of the jury panel 
then being questioned not to read newspapers or magazines and not to watch 
television, listen to the radio or enter bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as they are abiding by that admonition, the coverage should not affect 
their ability to be fair, defense attorneys noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, however, told Ito that prospective jurors cannot avoid media coverage 
even if they want to, a point made last week by at least one potential juror 
who conceded that he had overheard news reports despite his attempts to stay 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the air," that man said before being dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 As questioning of prospective jurors continued Monday, the prosecution's fear 
that some jurors were being exposed to media reports appeared to be borne out. 
One man said he read the sports section of USA Today and threw away the rest of 
the paper, apparently not realizing that Ito wants panelists to avoid all 
media, not just coverage of the case. That man was dismissed, as was a 
prospective juror who admitted to listening to the radio and turning it off 
whenever news came on. 
</P>
<P>
 After one of those panelists was excused, Shapiro mumbled: "Pretty soon, we 
won't have a panel." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Glendale woman who voiced concerns about her fellow panelists 
emphasized how difficult it was to abide by Ito's strict rules. Saying she had 
been forced to make many adjustments in her life to accommodate the judge's 
concerns, that woman noted that she had resorted to walking her dog over and 
over to fill the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk my dog almost constantly," she said. "The dog cries when I walk in the 
door: 'No more, no more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although legal experts sympathized with the difficulties both sides have in 
finding impartial jurors, some questioned the wisdom of Clark's criticisms of 
the panel and her attempt to have it dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that if there is a conviction and appeal in the Simpson case, 
prosecutors could be in the unusual position of having to defend verdicts 
reached by the very people whose credibility they have now publicly assailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the prosecution has done is laid the groundwork for the defense appeal," 
said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor and former federal 
prosecutor. "If this group becomes the jury, you have to work with the 
assumption that they're fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson and others said one irony of the prosecution seeking to excuse the 
first panel is that those are the only prospective jurors who have received 
Ito's stern admonition directing them to avoid all media, not just coverage of 
the Simpson case. Thus, the panel that prosecutors wanted to be excused may be 
the group of people most protected from publicity surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be folly for us to start over and think we're going to be any 
better," said Cochran in opposing the prosecution motion. "You'll never find a 
panel that knows less than the panel we have now. And they know everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a noted criminal defense lawyer and former deputy district 
attorney, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going to get any better jurors than these?" he asked. "They are 
probably the most shielded people out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting the prosecution motion, Ito sounded some of the same themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that this particular panel has had the benefit of the court's 
strongest admonition," Ito said. "I'm not willing to say this panel is lost at 
this point. This panel is our best hope."

COLUMN ONE; DRACULA IS NO VILLAIN IN ROMANIA; MANY ARE DISTRESSED TO LEARN THAT 
THEIR NATIONAL HERO, VLAD THE IMPALER, HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A BLOODSUCKING 
MOVIE MONSTER IN THE WEST. 
</P>

<P>
 A neck-biting nobleman dispatched by 19th-Century literature to haunt this 
wind-swept outreach of Transylvania has stirred to life in the post-Communist 
era as the embodiment of a culture clash between patriotic Romanians and 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanians, only recently acquainted with the Western version of Dracula, are 
spurning the caped count of Irishman Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because they fear the fictional vampire -- and his celluloid successors 
-- may taint the reputation of a real-life hero. Vlad Dracula the Impaler, a 
15th-Century monarch renowned for making human skewers of his enemies, remains 
the monster of preference in his native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his emergence here less than two years ago, the character from Stoker's 
Gothic novel has aroused strange, inhospitable emotions among the people of a 
region where the blood-drenched pages of history are more horrible than the 
wildest imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 So although howling wolves still stalk this gorge, known to Romanians as 
Birgau or Tihuta, those who come to search the wild beauty of the Carpathian 
Mountains for vampires are more likely to get a lecture than a fright. 
</P>
<P>
 Westerners, obsessed with vampire lore, may conjure up images of smirking, 
evil-eyed Bela Lugosi from the 1931 film version of "Dracula," or the campy 
depiction of blood lust released two years ago by Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tinseltown tribulations over whether actor Tom Cruise is fit to play 
Lestat in the forthcoming film version of Anne Rice's "Interview With the 
Vampire" would be lost on those who inhabit the land of Dracula's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 For modern-day Transylvanians and most of the rest of this country, the real 
Vlad Dracula -- whose savagery earned him the name Vlad Tepes (Vlad the 
Impaler) -- is admired for his skilled, bestial conduct in terrifying Ottoman 
Turks from further encroaching on Christian Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romanian history and folklore have been badly maimed," insists Nicolae 
Paduraru, president of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, founded in late 
1992 to correct any misimpression that Romania was ever ruled by a fanged 
count. "Until 1972, no one ever made serious connection between the real and 
fictional Transylvania, and nobody connected Dracula to a real person." 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes what Romanians see as a slight against their late leader to the 
publication 22 years ago of a book by two American historians who researched 
Stoker's notes and journals to conclude his vampire character was loosely based 
on the medieval prince. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of books published over the past two decades, Boston College 
professors Radu R. Florescu and Raymond T. McNally have detailed Vlad Dracula's 
proclivity for subjugating military challengers by impaling them upright on 
wooden stakes; skinning alive promiscuous women as a lesson to those who would 
abandon family values, and nailing hats to the heads of visiting dignitaries 
who failed to doff them in a proper show of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more outrageous, in the view of Romanian movie-goers, is Coppola's 
"Dracula," which unabashedly merges the real and fictional Draculas into a 
blood-besotted, time-traveling count. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a nobleman who fed on victims' blood reached here only last year, 
when Stoker's novel was published for the first time in Romanian to coincide 
with the Bucharest premiere of Coppola's movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the stunning revelation that foreigners do not share their esteem for 
the real Vlad Dracula, historians and budding capitalists have embarked on a 
campaign to set the record straight while cashing in on the Transylvanian 
mythology that was taboo during the Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian admirers of The Impaler have devised dozens of programs of corrective 
tourism to re-educate the mythologically misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing Dracula's footsteps is now one of Romania's most popular tourist 
offerings, with Paduraru's society serving as technical adviser to an array of 
state and private travel bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 But contrary to Western expectations, the tours focus on the impaling prince 
to the virtual exclusion of his fictional successor. Most start with a visit to 
the hilltop castle in the village of Bran, a spired fortress overlooking a 
valley dividing the provinces of Wallachia and Transylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The Impaler never lived there, but his father, Vlad "Dracul" (a title evolved 
from membership in the crusading Order of the Dragon), gained the castle as a 
customs outpost from which to tax Transylvanian merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlad Dracula -- or as his name translates, "son of the dragon" -- ruled the 
Wallachian province from castles in Tirgoviste and Poienari that now lie in 
ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Bran's remote association with the infamous monarch, the fortress's 
profusion of gables and outlooks feeds the fantasy of Westerners who have their 
hearts set on touring what looks like a haunted castle. Romanians see the site 
as commemorating the protector's role for which Vlad Dracula became famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Romanians, Dracula is a totally positive figure," says Cristina Dinu, a 
25-year-old computer programmer. "When he ruled, it was one of the most 
prosperous periods for Wallachia, and he succeeded in completely getting rid of 
thieves." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, The Impaler inflicted such general terror that legend contends that a 
golden cup he left at a well went untouched for years as word of the hideous 
punishment for pilferage spread throughout the province. 
</P>
<P>
 He dealt with his military enemies with unparalleled savagery, his most 
infamous feat being the "forest of the impaled" he created on the approach to 
his stronghold of Tirgoviste as Turkish troops were about to attack in the 
summer of 1462. Confronted by the sight of 20,000 corpses of slaughtered, 
invading Turks -- rotting on stakes that formed a two-mile wall of the dead -- 
the sultan's full army retreated in shame and terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, visitors to the village of Arefu, near the ruins of the castle at 
Poienari, are treated to a more flattering version of Vlad Dracula's deeds. 
Around a late-night bonfire stoked to recreate the atmosphere of a medieval war 
camp, villagers tell how their forbears were rewarded with all the land around 
them for tipping off Vlad Dracula about another attack by the sultan's forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to understand him as we do, as someone who saved Romania and 
much of Europe from conquest by the Turks," says Carmen Piciorea of the ONT 
Carpati travel bureau, which arranges overnight stays for tourists with peasant 
families in Arefu. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies also deliver clients to Vlad Dracula's birthplace of Sighisoara for 
dramatic re-enactments of the last witch trials in Transylvania, performed in 
the house where the impaling prince was born in 1431. It now hosts a beer bar 
as well as occasional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's most ambitious undertaking to clear up Vlad Dracula's reputation is 
to take place in May, when scholars, folklorists and the merely curious are 
invited to the first World Dracula Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now free from the Communist-era strictures that banned discussion of the 
vampire myths, Romanian academics have called on foreign colleagues to come and 
share their thoughts about both the crusader and the count. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Gordon Melton, a scholar on cults and religions at UC Santa Barbara, 
believes the congress will help narrow the gap between vampire enthusiasts and 
Romanian patriots that developed during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the opening of Eastern Europe, this is the first time in a long time 
there will be an opportunity for Romanian and Eastern European scholars to get 
together with Western scholars," says Melton, a professor, author and vampire 
buff. 
</P>
<P>
 Melton subscribes to the prevailing academic theory that Stoker drew on the 
life of Vlad Dracula as one of several sources for his character. And he 
predicts Romanian scholars will grow to accept this idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There actually is a variety of opinion (on the vampire Dracula's origin), but 
you have in Eastern Europe a very nationalized approach to their own background 
and history," Melton says. "There is tremendous sensitivity because of doubts 
about their own history." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlad Dracula's dreadful reputation was preserved -- some say embellished -- by 
Saxon merchants of medieval Transylvania, who chronicled his purges and 
punishments in historical tracts that survived to serve as the basis for 
today's scholarly writings on the life of The Impaler. 
</P>
<P>
 The main objective of the congress, organizers say, is to revive Vlad Dracula 
as a positive figure in Romanian history and to clearly separate him from 
vampires concocted by Stoker and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dracula societies have existed in Western countries for decades, most 
notably a London group run by Stoker's descendants, Romanians have only 
recently had any forum for pondering how history got mixed up with myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur folklore enthusiasts like Vasile Olteanu, a retired painter who sells 
vampire medallions outside Bran castle, say the inspiration for Dracula's 
blood-sucking behavior is a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytellers have likely confused The Impaler with a deranged Transylvanian 
countess born a century later, Elizabeth Bathori, who was reputed to have 
bitten the necks of servant girls and bathed her own skin in virgin's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much time has passed since the vampire theme has been open to 
interpretation, but a few fledgling attempts to exploit the expectations of 
tourists are seen at this scenic pass where Stoker set his novel. 
</P>
<P>
 A vast, forbidding hostel built during late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's reign 
was renamed Hotel Dracula last year by its employees. A bat-like crest adorns 
the mock bell tower, just below neon lights advertising "disco bar." 
</P>
<P>
 In a cellar room painted with unconvincing demons, hotel employees don capes, 
masks and what look like black satin shower caps to stage a hokey horror show 
in exchange for 200 lei -- a performance of questionable value even at the 
price of 11 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood-red Dracula vodka, Dracula wines, even a Dracula tea set are for sale at 
the inn's kiosk, and a Dracula cutlet of rolled pork steeped in an 
indiscernible red sauce is pitched as the house specialty at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 One Bucharest visitor recently on the trail of the vampire sawed determinedly 
through the leather-like entree, then contemplated the effects of the first 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, gesturing at his plate, "is the one experience here that is 
truly frightening."

SPRINT, 3 CABLE FIRMS PLAN NEW PHONE COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A consortium of three of the nation's largest cable TV operators and the 
Sprint Corp. today will unveil plans for a new telephone firm designed to 
compete head-on with local telephone companies such as Pacific Bell, executives 
familiar with the venture said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, unnamed company aims to use both cable TV lines and new wireless 
communications technology to give businesses and residences a choice in buying 
local phone service, which is now generally available only from a single, 
monopoly service provider. 
</P>
<P>
 If it succeeds, the ambitious venture could fundamentally alter the balance of 
power in the booming telecommunications industry, undermining the position of 
the huge regional Bell operating companies and opening up an immense new market 
for cable operators and long distance firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new company, whose backers include the cable firms Tele-Communications 
Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Enterprises as well as long-distance carrier 
Sprint, will have to invest billions of dollars and overcome myriad regulatory 
and technical obstacles to make its plan a reality. Analysts noted that the 
alliance was structured in a way that allows the partners to pull back 
relatively easily if things do not go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier effort by TCI to carve out a place in the telephone industry by 
merging with regional phone company Bell Atlantic Corp. collapsed, 
demonstrating the difficulties in combining two massive and culturally 
divergent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, a key priority of the new venture will be to win some of the radio 
frequencies that are to be auctioned off in early December by the Federal 
Communications Commission. The radio spectrum is to be used for a new 
generation of wireless communications services known as personal communications 
services, or PCS -- and the price for nationwide PCS licenses is expected to be 
in the billions. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, nearly all the major players in the 
telecommunications industry have been engaged in frenzied negotiations to 
secure allies for the PCS auctions in advance of a Friday deadline for 
disclosing bidding partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The PCS auctions now appear likely to pit the Sprint-cable group against AT&T 
and its newly acquired McCaw Communications subsidiary, and against a new 
consortium linking four of the regional Bell operating companies. MCI Corp., 
once expected to be a major player in the auctions, appears to be without 
allies for the moment, and has said it may settle for being a reseller of other 
companies' PCS services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts think that might be the smartest way to go. Aspiring PCS 
providers will have to spend billions for the licenses and billions more to 
build PCS networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Herschel Shostek, a wireless expert based in Maryland, calls the PCS plan "a 
wonderful cocktail for fiscal suicide." He says he would be surprised if PCS 
systems were commercially operational by 1997 -- and by then, he says, cellular 
companies will already have 40 million subscribers on reliable, 
well-established systems that can offer everything PCS does. 
</P>
<P>
 As ambitious as the Sprint-cable venture's PCS plans are, however, they pale 
in comparison to the task of building a genuine competitor in the mainstream 
local telephone business. The new company plans to offer such services by 
leasing the facilities of the cable companies and then installing costly 
telephone switches and other necessary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cable companies in the venture reach 30 million homes, about 
one-third of the nation's households. The partnership hopes to reach more 
households by offering attractive terms for leasing the facilities of other 
cable companies. The coaxial cables used by cable companies have huge 
capacities and thus can be used to carry telephone calls as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles to the plan are daunting. Only six states currently allow cable 
companies to compete in the local phone business; California is not among them. 
And a federal law that would have overridden local prohibitions died in 
Congress this year. The entrenched local telephone companies, moreover, have 
enormous amounts of cash -- and political clout -- with which to stave off 
would-be competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 And the cable companies will have to upgrade their lines so they can reliably 
carry phone services. Existing telephone wires, for example, carry their own 
power to homes so that phone services won't be disrupted in the event of a 
power outage. Cable companies that want to offer phone service will have to do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Long distance carriers such as Sprint have for years chafed under rules that 
require them to pay a large chunk of their revenues to local phone companies to 
cover the local portion of long-distance calls.

READY TO KILL, READY TO DIE, HAMAS ZEALOTS THWART PEACE; MIDEAST: BOTH PLO, 
ISRAEL ARE THREATENED AS MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUP CREATES NEW 'MARTYRS' IN DEADLY 
ATTACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cradling a Galil assault rifle, Saleh Abdel-Rahim Hassan Souwi looked straight 
at the home video camera and calmly announced his intention to kill himself -- 
and as many Israelis as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (are) left with no alternative or choice but to make the entire Jewish 
people a captive of fear and terror," Souwi said, committing himself to the 
bombing of a Tel Aviv bus last week that killed 23 people, including himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our humane demands are not met, we will continue our heroic missions, for 
there are many young men who love jihad (Islam's holy war) and would love to 
die for the sake of God." 
</P>
<P>
 His testament recorded, the 27-year-old former baker and construction worker, 
regarded by his friends as shy and quiet, headed for Tel Aviv and boarded a bus 
filled with Israelis on their way to work. On reaching the city's commercial 
center, he detonated an estimated 45 pounds of dynamite in an explosion so 
strong that it lifted the bus about five feet off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Souwi was the latest "martyr" of the Iziddin al-Qassam, the military wing of 
the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, but almost certainly not the 
last as the group fills its ranks with other zealots ready to die in the 
struggle against the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 With ready-to-kill, ready-to-die commitments, Hamas' adamant opposition to any 
Arab compromise with Israel makes it the gravest threat today to Middle East 
peacemaking. Its attacks on civilian and military targets alike raise the 
question among Israelis of whether peace with the Palestinians will bring 
security -- or whether it is even possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terrifying escalation of that struggle, Hamas' military wing has struck 
three times this month in the heart of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of Oct. 9, Hamas gunmen opened fire on cafe-goers in the heart 
of Jerusalem. That same night, other Iziddin al-Qassam guerrillas kidnaped a 
19-year-old Israeli soldier. They killed him during an Israeli rescue attempt 
five days later. On Wednesday, Souwi blew up the No. 5 bus in central Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, there will be more attacks," Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, chief of 
staff of the Israeli military, warned last week. "I don't want us to delude 
ourselves. We are in a very long struggle. The enemy is tough and persistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has ordered Israeli security forces to broaden 
their sweep of the Palestinian territories for Hamas leaders and to break up 
the support network for the Iziddin al-Qassam units. More than 60 arrests have 
already been made, Israeli sources said, and the campaign will continue until 
the guerrillas are caught or killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be fanatics, but we can be just as tenacious in hunting them down," 
a Rabin aide said Monday. "For us, they are a threat not only to our people but 
to our hopes to live in peace with our neighbors. We will not allow that, and 
we will take whatever -- I say whatever -- measures are required to eliminate 
the threat from Hamas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas vowed to retaliate against the Israeli moves, particularly a widely 
reported, although officially denied, order by Rabin to shoot the movement's 
leaders on sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin must know that Hamas loves death more than Rabin and his soldiers love 
life," Hamas declared in a statement Monday. "Rabin's threats will only push us 
into continuing our resistance and struggle."  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher backed the Israeli 
crackdown and promised U.S. efforts to cut off private American support for 
Hamas, including fund raising for its charities in the Gaza Strip and West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do everything we can -- and seek legislation where necessary -- to 
ensure that Hamas and other terrorists do not get support from inside the 
United States," Christopher said on the eve of President Clinton's trip to the 
Middle East. "If peace brings nothing but more terror, the process of 
reconciliation surely will not succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas is no less a threat to the Palestine Liberation Organization and its 
hope of proceeding from the 1993 agreement with Israel on limited 
self-government to an accord on full statehood. Not only does Hamas oppose 
autonomy as a half-measure betraying Palestinian interests, it also wants an 
Islamic state under its leadership rather than the democratic, secular state 
advocated by the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iziddin al-Qassam's answer will be to make Gaza burn," Hamas warned PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat after Palestinian police rounded up 400 of its 
supporters in an effort to halt the attacks on Israelis. "Hamas doesn't allow 
any faction to lay a finger on its followers." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been suggestions that Israel try to pull Hamas into the peace 
process and encourage the PLO to develop its political ties with Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hamas organization is an organization . . . that uses the cruelest 
terror," Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said over the weekend. "But 
within it there are certainly those who are less extreme, and if those want to 
enter into a relevant discussion with us, I am not sure it's our job to say . . 
. it's forbidden for us to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 David Kimche, president of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations and retired 
director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, went further, calling for "a 
relentless war on terrorism" but also for discussions with Hamas' political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to live in peace together with Islam," Kimche said. "Islam is a 
religion of peace -- absolutely no question about it. We live in a sea of 
Islam, and we need to come to terms with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Hamas leaders were also reaching out, differentiating between Hamas' 
community work and Iziddin al-Qassam's military actions, and suggesting that 
Israel and Hamas agree not to attack civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are happening within Hamas," Palestinian Information Minister Yasser 
Abed-Rabbo said, "and the more moderate leaders, who favor a political 
solution, perhaps are being challenged through these military operations by 
those who fear they have gone soft." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas does show signs of new divisions within its ranks -- a split between the 
political leadership, which has been considering whether to compete in 
Palestinian national elections next year, and radicals in the military wing, 
which rejects all compromises and uses the terrorist attacks in an effort to 
make them impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each military operation steels our people's will, for they see our power, our 
raw power, and understand that concessions to the Israelis are not needed," a 
Hamas journalist in the West Bank city of Hebron said in support of the 
radicals. "One man like Saleh al-Souwi carrying the war to the very center of 
Israel is like a full-division assault." 
</P>
<P>
 Souwi's motivation for one of the most devastating terrorist attacks in 
Israeli history was not hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest of nine children from a poor Palestinian family, Souwi was born the 
year Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, and 
he grew up under an occupation that fostered, rather than suppressed, 
Palestinian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A younger brother, 14-year-old Hussein, was shot in the neck and killed by 
Israeli soldiers in September, 1989, during one of the many protests against 
the occupation in Qalqiliya, a militant town in the northern West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested six times during the intifada , the rebellion begun in 1987 against 
the Israeli occupation, Saleh Souwi had been detained twice without charge for 
six months and had been on the run for nearly a year from Israeli security 
police.  
</P>
<P>
 The most important factor, however, was probably his education in a school 
affiliated with the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, which gave birth to 
Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed at the start of the intifada in December, 1987, Hamas was the 
initiative of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, a charismatic Islamic leader in the Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Muslim Brotherhood had sat on the sidelines for too long with its 
philosophy that Palestinian society had to become fully Islamic before it could 
succeed in the struggle against Israel," said Ziad abu Amr, a political 
scientist at Birzeit University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas was an effort to ensure an Islamic role in the leadership, identity and 
future of the Palestinian nation. If Hamas succeeded, the Brotherhood could 
claim it as a wing. If it failed, the Brotherhood could shrug it off. But in 
seven years, Hamas has actually eclipsed its parent." 
</P>
<P>
 In its seven years, Hamas has effectively merged the Palestinians' nationalism 
with Islamic zeal in a culture of struggle that honors a glorious death and 
rejects as sinful the compromises necessary for a peaceful resolution of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

<P>
 Although Hamas linked its recent attacks to Israel's refusal to release 5,000 
Palestinian prisoners and to the slayings by a Jewish settler of about 30 
Muslims in a West Bank mosque in February, it is committed to a broad fight 
against Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the Israeli occupation continues, resistance will and must 
continue until the Palestinian people gain their rights," Sheik Ahmed Bahar, a 
lecturer at Islamic University in the Gaza Strip and a Hamas leader, said last 
week. "The Islamic movement did not sign this agreement with Israel, and we are 
not bound by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas also has long-term goals of turning a future Palestine into an Islamic 
state that in time would supplant Israel completely and then help forge a 
single, giant, Pan-Islamic nation across the Middle East and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our struggle is not for today or even tomorrow, though we do what we can," 
said Mahmoud Zahhar, a Gaza surgeon and senior Hamas leader. "Our focus is 
really on the future of the Arab and Islamic people, and for that we are ready 
to make very great sacrifices, including our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At its outset, Hamas enjoyed a measure of Israeli support. Rabin, then defense 
minister, saw Hamas and its predecessor, the Islamic Center in Gaza City, as a 
counterweight to the PLO in the Gaza Strip, allowed the establishment of its 
network of community and charitable organizations and even met with Hamas 
leaders to ascertain their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was "very, very cordial," Zahhar recalled with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel did not act against these (organizations), did not understand that 
social Islam would by necessity become political Islam," said Raphael Israeli, 
a prominent Israeli specialist on Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 As the intifada grew, Hamas was outlawed, and Yassin was jailed on charges of 
ordering the killing of Israeli soldiers and Palestinian collaborators. His 
release is a principal Hamas demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas nevertheless stepped up its military activities, and after a series of 
deadly attacks, Rabin deported 415 supporters of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, 
another radical group, to southern Lebanon in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 That still-controversial action appears to have strengthened Hamas 
considerably. The deportees' tent camp became a strategic planning center for 
the movement and a training institute. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deportees returned, they were able both to criticize the accord that 
Israel signed with the PLO on limited self-government for the Palestinian 
territories and to enjoy the freedom that this autonomy gave them. 
</P>
<P>
 Martyrdom in the battle with Israel is popular not only among the Palestinians 
in the Gaza Strip's fetid refugee camps but also increasingly in the towns of 
the West Bank as Hamas gains popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas of Iziddin al-Qassam are lionized in songs and epic poems. 
Videos of the exploits and last testaments of the "martyrs" circulate like the 
latest Hollywood movies. Street vendors sell portraits of the young men, and 
parents name their children after the latest to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrines to the Iziddin al-Qassam dead in the mosques, schools and other 
institutions affiliated with Hamas further portray them as being highly 
religious, good students, athletes and devoted to their families and 
communities -- sons who make their mothers even prouder with their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The word Hamas itself is an acronym meaning "zeal" in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imad Akel opens his jaws to strike. The Nazi enemy is on guard," goes a song 
by the Jabaliya Martyrs Band, referring to the 24-year-old guerrilla commander 
who killed 12 Israeli soldiers before being killed himself in November. "The 
commandos kidnap (Israeli) soldiers and kill them, kill them, kill them, kill 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Young men are recruited as members of Hamas from its network of mosques, 
schools, clubs and welfare institutions in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer coach, for example, explained how his players, 10 to 15 years old, 
practice Sunday through Thursday on a Gaza City field and go to the mosque for 
religious instruction and political training Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We develop our future moujahedeen with great care," Zahhar said, "for this 
will be a long struggle, a struggle we will hand from generation to generation 
until Islam triumphs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boys who show promise are assigned a Hamas spiritual guide, known as an emir, 
who oversees their religious and political development, arranges training in 
martial arts and later in guerrilla warfare and readies them for eventual 
assignment to one of the Iziddin al-Qassam units, according to Hamas sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the best, chosen on the basis of character evaluations stressing 
discipline, discretion and dedication, are actually promoted, according to 
these sources. And only the best of these join the Iziddin al-Qassam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas certainly has no more than 200 members in its military wing, according 
to Israeli security sources, and perhaps as few as 50. Grouped in small cells 
of three to five and in a few larger units of up to 15, they operate 
independently of the main Hamas organization with instructions from a 
leadership believed to be based partly in the Gaza Strip and partly in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Hamas attack is designed to send specific messages both to Israelis and 
to Palestinians, according to Hamas members. "We want to build up our people's 
morale and will to resist as much as we want to hurt the enemy's," a Hamas 
leader said in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting Iziddin al-Qassam units are what Israeli security sources describe 
as "circles" of Hamas members willing to rent cars, find apartments, provide 
food and give money to the guerrillas while remaining outside the military 
wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a queue of recruits ready to replace any Qassam member we capture 
or kill," a senior Israeli officer said. "There is a brilliance in their 
organization because by minimizing their (military) structures they minimize 
their exposure to infiltration. When they lose someone, he is quickly replaced. 
Each death draws more recruits than they can absorb." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas' overall structure also includes branches for political work, for 
propaganda, for security and for its extensive community organizations -- 
including medical clinics, youth clubs, athletic teams, kindergartens, 
libraries and schools -- whose activities are the foundation of its popular 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leaders -- sheiks and imams, doctors and university professors, a few 
businessmen -- are widely admired for leading exemplary Muslim lives in 
contrast to what Palestinians scathingly call "our imported deluxe leadership," 
a reference to the PLO cadres who returned from exile with a taste for luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas has developed major centers not only in the Gaza Strip but also in 
Hebron, Nablus and Ramallah in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, it has representatives in Jordan, Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Sudan, 
according to Israeli military sources. It raises substantial funds -- as much 
as $30 million a month -- in Saudi Arabia, conservative Persian Gulf states, 
Jordan, Britain and the United States, as well as in the Palestinian 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some who back the agreement on Palestinian self-government and profess 
support for the secular nationalism of the PLO acknowledge their respect for 
the strength of Hamas' commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas is still there fighting for our rights, and that is important," said 
Yousef Sartawi, 44, a Gaza accountant who lives in the Jabaliya refugee camp. 
"The PLO is now the government and cannot carry on the armed struggle while 
building our state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am for peace with Israel, but for a full peace -- with the Jewish settlers 
all gone, with the Israeli army all gone and with our country fully 
independent. Only then should Qassam's men put down their guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion surveys conducted by the Palestinian Studies Center in Nablus over the 
past year show that direct support for Hamas is about 15% but reaches 20% to 
25% in the Gaza Strip. Fatah, the PLO's main component, generally gets about 
40% in the surveys. Hamas leaders put their support at 45% in Gaza and 40% 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank town of Jericho, Hamas has been gingerly enlarging its role, 
discussing the establishment of a political party and the terms under which it 
would contest elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iziddin al-Qassam's continued attacks on Israeli targets have strained 
relations with the PLO.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Islamic movement wants to ensure Palestinian unity above all else," Bahar 
said. "We will avoid anything that threatens bloodshed among our people. We 
hope that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority will do the same, but the 
latest arrests made things very difficult and have showed people that the 
authority is simply Israel's agent in continuing the occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials say they want to reach an understanding with Hamas so 
that self-rule and eventual independence are not jeopardized by its military 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no value to peace with Israel if the Palestinian people lose their 
brotherhood and peace among themselves," said Sufian abu Zaideh, a Fatah leader 
and a senior official in the authority. "But Hamas must also realize that it is 
part of the Palestinian nation and cannot put the gains of everyone at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The equation is a very tough one. Hamas needs military operations for its 
popularity, but if successful, these bring the Palestinian Authority into 
confrontation with Israel and then the authority into confrontation with Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the best approach is to extend the autonomy area throughout the 
whole West Bank and hold elections," he said, "so that we and Hamas can ask the 
people what they think of the peace agreement. We are pretty confident that 
while many people support Hamas, many more will support us. But we need 
elections to see."

NATURE STAGES COMEBACK IN FIRE-CHARRED LANDSCAPE; ECOLOGY: PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
RE-EMERGE AFTER LAST OCTOBER'S BLAZES. BUT EXPERTS SAY FULL RECOVERY IS YEARS 
OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If a symbol of hope and renewal has emerged from these fire-ravaged canyons, 
it is embodied in a modest little shrub called laurel sumac. 
</P>
<P>
 Springing from a moonscape of blackened bark and gray ash, knee-high clumps of 
emerald-green sumac are already dotting the hillsides of Laguna Beach's prized 
Laurel Canyon. Born of autumn fire, weaned on spring rain, the native shrub is 
one of the first to stage a comeback after last October's wind-whipped 
wildfires scorched about 150,000 acres of sage scrub, chaparral and woodlands 
in five Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
 From Orange County's San Joaquin Hills to the Santa Monica and San Gabriel 
mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the torched earth had barely 
cooled when tiny branches of wild sumac began sprouting like clones from the 
blackened stumps of their predecessors, which everyone but a botanist might 
assume were hopelessly dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid regeneration of laurel sumac and other native plants and animals 
without human help seems miraculous, but this is one miracle that nature 
performs routinely in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire is Mother Nature's New Year's Eve, clearing out the old and ringing in 
the new. From Thousand Oaks, Malibu and Altadena to Laguna Beach, Temecula and 
Escondido, thousands of acres of dense, decades-old shrubs and chaparral were 
incinerated last fall, only to be replaced with small, fresh sprouts and fields 
of wildflowers by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire destroys momentarily but rejuvenates in the long term," said Mickey 
Long, director of Altadena's Eaton Canyon Nature Center, which burned down and 
is yet to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the first anniversary of the beginning of the firestorms arrives 
this week, ecology experts say it will take about eight years, perhaps longer, 
for Southern California to return to the lush, healthy diversity of flora and 
fauna of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, much of Southern California's prime parkland and other 
wilderness hovers in a fragile, eerie gap between death and resurrection. 
Forlorn piles of shriveled, fried cactus and raw earth lie next to festive 
poppies and lilies that rose from the ash in bursts of color last spring. 
Gnarled, old sycamores and oaks, rendered charcoal black, are sprouting tender 
green shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wild animals have survived -- even thrived -- in the aftermath, including 
burrowing rodents that are vital to the ecosystem as prey for mountain lions, 
hawks, eagles and other predators. But the gnatcatcher, a federally protected 
songbird, has not fared as well. About 14,000 acres of some of the bird's best 
habitat was destroyed in the Laguna Canyon fire, and it could be years before 
the tiny birds return. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how quickly these animals and their natural habitats recover is almost 
completely at the mercy of natural forces. The land will fare best if blessed 
with mild winter rains and spared major fires, at least for awhile. Frequent or 
ill-timed man-made fires, instead of rejuvenating the wilderness, can 
permanently denude it of native plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, wildlife biologists and botanists are pleased with the nascent 
recovery of the wilderness, especially the return of some spectacular, 
long-dormant wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scorched valley oaks, sycamores and other trees also survived, including 
90% of 200 oaks burned at Eaton Canyon. Oldest trees fare the best, while some 
saplings have such thin trunks and bark they cannot survive flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is recovering beautifully," said Suzanne Good, a state parks associate 
resource ecologist in the Santa Monica Mountains, who oversees 40,000 acres of 
parkland, most of which burned. "There are certain areas where it is difficult 
to tell there ever was a fire, especially Malibu Lagoon, where some (native 
plants) are already shoulder high." 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon last week, a full moon rose on one side of Laguna Beach's Laurel 
Canyon as the sun set on the other, bathing the chasm in the muted shades of 
autumn. While most of the wheat-colored ridges were still naked, many were 
attired in new patches of lemonade berry, sumac and pastel flowers. Hawks and 
great horned owls, even one rare golden eagle, soared above. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks better than I thought it would," said botanist Fred Roberts of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as he toured the area for the first time since 
the first days after the October fire. "I really thought it would still look 
dead. I'm impressed we're seeing so much green." 
</P>
<P>
 Before arson-spawned flames fanned by Santa Ana winds whipped across it, this 
parkland wedged between Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Irvine had been one of 
Southern California's largest and most biologically diverse wilderness areas. 
Its thick clumps of sagebrush, lemonade berry and buckwheat attracted 
gnatcatchers, deer, rare lizards, butterflies and other creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 After the firestorms, some experts worried that the heat was so intense that 
the plant roots would be incinerated. Trish Smith, a Nature Conservancy 
biologist who manages nature reserves owned by Orange County's largest 
landowner, the Irvine Co., was relieved that the initial fears were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying it was such an intense wildfire that (vegetation) wouldn't 
come back very well, so from that perspective, this is better than I expected," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the flames ignited Oct. 27, Smith was exploring Laguna Beach's lush Boat 
Canyon, and preparing for a long-awaited grand opening of the Irvine Co.'s 
sprawling reserve the next day. Watching a giant plume of black smoke approach 
over the ridge, she evacuated. When she returned after the fires were 
extinguished, about 80% of the Irvine Co.'s 6,600-acre southern reserve had 
burned, along with 90% of adjacent Crystal Cove State Park and Orange County's 
year-old Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing but bare ground and white ash," she recalled. "I was in a 
state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months since then, the expansive area has turned into what Smith 
called a botanist's dream -- long-dormant flowers such as California fuchsia 
have sprung to life. The public opening of the Irvine Co. reserve was 
postponed, but the tours are even more popular than expected, Smith said, since 
nature lovers swarm to the area to watch the rapid changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire, flower seeds couldn't compete for the sun's rays because much 
of this land was dense with brush. Fertilizer-like nutrients in the ash, 
sunlight reaching the soil and mild spring rains combined to revive the buried 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fire-scorched areas -- especially Point Mugu State Park in Ventura 
County, Leo Carrillo State Beach near Malibu and Caspers Wilderness Park in San 
Juan Capistrano -- also attracted visitors with striking springtime shows of 
wildflowers, including many varieties that hadn't appeared for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Altadena area, where about 5,000 acres of wilderness burned, 20 
varieties of flowering plants new to the area -- including monkey flowers, 
lilies and phacelia -- and half a dozen new species of birds have appeared in 
Eaton Canyon. Only one local inhabitant -- the acorn woodpecker -- seems to 
have declined in numbers, apparently because its food supply of acorns was 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Poppies in burn areas of Leo Carrillo State Beach were more spectacular last 
spring than the famous annual display in the Antelope Valley. And after Ventura 
County's Green Meadow fire scarred 44,000 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains, 
wildflowers there bloomed in abundance, including two rare types of Mariposa 
lilies at the Circle X Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circle X was in fact the best display I've ever seen in my life," said Rick 
Burgess, a Thousand Oaks city planner and board member of a local branch of the 
California Native Plant Society. "The combination of yellow, lilac and purple 
was just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the flowering plants, dubbed fire followers, require the intense heat 
of a fire to pop open their tough seed jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm particularly fond of the cream-flowered eardrops, which will bloom 
profusely the year after a fire, then a little less in subsequent years until 
they disappear," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildflowers, while impressive to human visitors, are not vital to 
sustaining Southern California's ecosystems. Much more critical are California 
sagebrush, lemonade berry and other shrubs that native animals use to feed and 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the shrubs have begun to re-sprout, they are not nearly mature enough to 
allow creatures such as gnatcatchers, a threatened species that resides in 
Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties, to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Laguna Canyon fire, 47 pairs and nine single gnatcatchers lived on 
14,000 acres of prime sage scrub habitat between Laguna Beach and Newport 
Beach. After the blaze, none remained, according to spring, 1994, data 
accumulated by the Orange County Environmental Management Agency. Also, only 
three pairs of cactus wrens -- compared to 101 pairs before the fire -- were 
found on the burned land. 
</P>
<P>
 Gnatcatchers, just 4 1/2 inches long and feeble flyers, cannot easily flee 
flames and smoke. Most are presumed dead, although 29 pairs showed up in the 
spring on unburned scrub to the northwest, offering hope that they were 
refugees that escaped the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses to the gnatcatcher, however, were originally feared to be much 
worse; biologists had thought 100 to 200 pairs inhabited the area before the 
fire, but a review of the data now shows that the birds apparently had been 
over-counted, said Tim Neely of the environmental management agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gnatcatchers and cactus wrens also were wiped out in the firestorms that 
swept through Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gnatcatcher took a big beating," said Bill Wagner, biological resources 
coordinator at the Metropolitan Water District's Riverside County Multi-Species 
Reserve, two-thirds of which burned. "But over time, they should come back 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 While the species survived, wildlife biologists warn that it cannot take much 
more stress -- from either fire or urban development -- before slipping closer 
toward extinction. Orange County, as a result of the Laguna firestorm, is now 
reviewing its policies for managing wild land, including new policies for 
controlled burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a large amount of habitat that went up in one fell swoop," Neely said, 
"and we are very concerned about the effects of these kinds of catastrophic 
occurrences, not just on the gnatcatcher but the total biodiversity of the 
region." 
</P>
<P>
 Mice and many other rodents -- important prey for hawks, eagles, coyotes and 
other predators -- have flourished because thick, tangled brush was burned, 
leaving more hospitable and nutritious grasses and buds. 
</P>
<P>
 One endangered species, the Stephens' kangaroo rat, might even be better off 
now than before the Riverside County fire, which cleared several thousand acres 
of brush that was becoming too dense to suit the burrowing creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was probably beneficial in the long term," said John Bradley, a U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service biologist. "It opened up a lot of coastal sage scrub 
habitat, (which) gives the Stephens' kangaroo rat a chance to move into some of 
those open areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's top predator -- the mountain lion -- also seems to be 
thriving because of a healthy increase in mule deer and other prey that feed on 
tender sprouts, said state Fish and Game warden John Wilcox, who patrols the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenacious and destructive weeds, however, such as mustard and artichoke 
thistle, are invading and crowding out some native shrubs and grasses that feed 
deer, birds and other creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Undesirable red brome and wild oat have grown on slopes in southwestern 
Riverside County, where more than 25,000 acres burned. Rare grasslands in Point 
Mugu State Park's La Jolla Valley are in particularly poor shape, since mustard 
took hold there after the fires and grew nearly 12 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (mustard) gets a head start on everything else," said Milt McAuley, author 
of "Wildflowers of the Santa Monica Mountains," as he hiked through the valley. 
"This year there was no competition. It won't get quite so high next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the responsibility for the appearance of non-native grasses belongs to 
the state Department of Forestry, which sprayed hillsides with seeds to control 
erosion. Native seed was preferred by forestry officials, but it is difficult 
to obtain, so a mix containing ryegrass, which can overtake local shrubs and 
grasses, was sprayed in parts of Altadena, Thousand Oaks and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Towne, a Pasadena Glen resident involved in reseeding efforts by the 
Forest Service and the private Forest Preservation Society of Southern 
California, said cost was a key factor in choosing seed, leaving them with the 
choice of spraying ryegrass or risking mudslides in residential areas. The mix 
containing ryegrass was considerably less expensive than the native seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our choices were very pragmatic," Towne said. "The preservation of life and 
property and watershed topsoil was what led me to participate in putting 
ryegrass, a controversial procedure, on the watershed." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such unnatural intrusions, hopeful signs lie in the return of a 
vestige of wild California -- the ecologically valuable but mundane shrubs such 
as laurel sumac. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like to see is all those little green bushes all over the hills," said 
McAuley, who hikes in the Santa Monicas several times a week. "That'll be a 
nice forest in five years."

VERDICTS DUE IN S. AFRICA SLAYING OF NEWPORT WOMAN 
</P>

From Associated Press

<P>
 The judge presiding over the trial of three young men accused of killing Amy 
Biehl described the Newport Beach student's last moments in detail Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 High Court Judge Gerald Friedman summarized witness testimony as he read about 
three-quarters of his 190-page verdict. But he did not indicate whether the 
defendants would be found guilty or innocent. The verdicts are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's father, Peter, said in a phone interview at the family home in Newport 
Beach that waiting for the verdict was "a little frustrating" but he understood 
why the judge was carefully laying out all the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get a verdict, but this thing is regrettably not over -- it's far from 
over," he said earlier in the day on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America." "There's 
the sentencing phase . . . and the trial of a fourth defendant. It's kind of 
disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his wife, Linda, has gone with daughters Molly and Kimberly to South 
Africa twice to observe the trial, the couple decided to stay home during the 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about (going to South Africa), but we felt it would've been 
misleading. Our interest there is not in the verdict and the sentencing as much 
as it is being sure that the justice system was given a chance to operate in a 
non-circus atmosphere," Peter Biehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the family has been following the events by telephone with the help of 
a foreign correspondent, who promised to call the Biehls as soon as a verdict 
is reached. The court is scheduled to go back into session at about 12:30 a.m. 
PST today. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, six witnesses said they saw a mob of black youths stab and 
bludgeon to death the 26-year-old white Fulbright scholar on Aug. 25, 1993, in 
Guguletu, a township near Cape Town.  
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manqina, 22, Mzikhona Nofemela, 19, and Vusumzi Ntamo, 23, all members 
of the militant black Pan Africanist Students' Organization, have pleaded 
innocent to charges of murder, public violence and robbery in Biehl's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have charged that police forced confessions from the defendants. 
According to the statements, Nofemela told police he had thrown stones at 
Biehl's overturned car, and Ntamo said he had hit her in the head three times 
with a brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl was in South Africa to research women's rights and help with voter 
education ahead of the country's first all-race election. She was killed two 
days before she was to return home to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women who testified only after being assured their identities would be 
hidden said they saw Manqina and Nofemela stabbing Biehl as she lay on the 
grass outside a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deceased ran across the road in the direction of the service station . . 
. a female kicked her feet out from under her and she fell," Friedman said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON ACCUSES FEINSTEIN OF IMPROPER 
VOTES; AD SAYS THE SENATOR SUPPORTED BILLS BENEFITING A FIRM PARTLY OWNED BY 
HER HUSBAND. HE TERMS THE CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS.

 After months of complaining that his wife was an unfair political target, 
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington on Monday blistered Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein and her husband in a television commercial that accuses 
Feinstein of improperly voting on bills that financially benefited the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the commercial accuses the incumbent Democratic senator of 
casting four votes on appropriation bills that benefited a vocational education 
company whose largest shareholder is a company owned by her husband, investor 
Richard Blum. The ad, which began airing statewide Monday night, contends that 
Blum and the Irvine based-company, National Education Corp., have received 
"millions from taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign manager and Blum immediately attacked the commercial as 
outrageous, wrong both in fact and in its implication that Feinstein acted to 
benefit herself financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying Feinstein votes certain ways to benefit her and her husband. 
The fact is they lost money. They say the company received (more than $100 
million) since she became a senator. The facts are NEC did not receive this 
money from the federal government. . . . They are loans that go to students," 
said campaign manager Kam Kuwata. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum called the ad "a desperation attempt by a politician who, frankly, is out 
of control. And I deeply resent his taking a totally distorted shot at National 
Education Corp." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sat by for six months while both (Huffington) and, on occasion, his 
wife, have absolutely distorted everything my wife has ever stood for . . . in 
what has been absolutely the most malicious campaign I have ever seen," Blum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While it makes several accusations, the thrust of Huffington's commercial is 
that Feinstein improperly voted on federal education funding that made its way 
to NEC, a 4,000-employee corporation that operates vocational schools and 
publishes workbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Feinstein did vote on two appropriation packages totaling more than $4 
billion, the funds for student loans and other education programs did not 
include specific allocations to NEC. Instead, the funds provided for student 
loans that help fund vocational schools such as those run by NEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Senate ethics rules, Feinstein is allowed to vote on bills that affect 
her husband's finances as long as the legislation is not designed to 
specifically benefit Blum or his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign said the allegations would be aired in both 30-second 
and 60-second spots, the latter the longest negative ad aired so far by 
Huffington. The first-term congressman from Santa Barbara has spent more than 
any candidate in U.S. history, most of it on television ads, in his closely 
contested race with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feinstein," the ad concludes, "a senator who serves special interests . . . 
and her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commercial clearly suggests that Feinstein's husband is profiting 
from her government service, Ken Khachigian, Huffington's senior adviser, 
insisted that its intent is not to attack her husband but to show Feinstein's 
alleged conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Blum is not the issue. The issue here is Dianne Feinstein voting on an 
issue that directly benefits her financially," Khachigian said. "It is one 
thing for Mr. Blum to have financial interests. It is quite another for her 
(Feinstein) not to . . . know there is a conflict and decline to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But Herbert E. Alexander, director of the Citizens Research Foundation at USC, 
an organization that studies political financing and ethics, said, "If it was a 
broad-based bill on education, there should have been an inclination to vote 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, she may or may not have realized that there were (financial) 
consequences related to her husband. But even if there were, she may have had 
an overriding reason for voting for it, namely that this is an education 
program important to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander added that the commercial underscores the nastiness of the Senate 
campaign. "There is so much negative that they are really digging pretty deep 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the commercial, NEC has received more than $100 million in 
federal funds since Feinstein became a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's campaign pointed out, and Huffington's spokesman admitted, 
that NEC had taught students financed by federal student loans for many years 
before Feinstein was in the Senate. Those funds also were provided to students, 
not directly to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Blum contended that his company's investment in NEC has actually lost 
about $12 million during his wife's time in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the allegation of a conflict of interest, the commercial 
alleges that "some controversial schools are run by the National Education 
Corp., whose largest shareholder is Richard Blum's company." Later, the ad 
claims that NEC employees pleaded guilty to 23 counts of defrauding the 
government and have been "investigated nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum acknowledged that three employees at one NEC center in Houston did plead 
guilty to forging documents to receive about $300,000 in federal loans. But 
Blum said that the misdeed took place in 1988, shortly after his company 
acquired some shares in NEC, and the firm since has enjoyed a good record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffington campaign says the ad is accurate. Khachigian said, "In this 
case, I think what is clear is that Dianne Feinstein should have been all the 
more vigilant about her votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian added that Blum's business activities were fair game even though 
the Huffington campaign has bristled at questions about the congressman's wife, 
Arianna, and her involvement with a controversial Los Angeles church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objection to their mention of Arianna has always been that it relates to 
her personal beliefs and has almost nothing to do with his conflicts as a 
congressman or potential conflict as a U.S. senator," Khachigian said.

POLITICIANS PLEDGE PAROLE SYSTEM REFORM; JUSTICE: EVEN ADVERSARIES SUCH AS PETE 
WILSON AND KATHLEEN BROWN SAY THE CURRENT SYSTEM ALLOWS MANY REPEAT CRIMINALS 
TO ESCAPE PROSECUTION FOR THEIR LATEST CRIMES.

 Several politicians renewed their support Monday for measures that would 
increase administrative penalties for parole violators arrested for new crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of cost considerations, the Legislature defeated several bills 
earlier this year that would have increased the maximum one-year penalty that 
parole authorities can now impose on parolees who are arrested but not 
prosecuted for new crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and candidate Kathleen Brown favor legislation that would 
subject violators to up to five years in prison, according to their aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that scores of prison parolees recently arrested for 
felonies in Los Angeles County have slipped through a little noticed loophole 
in the "three strikes" law and avoided stiff new penalties prescribed by the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The loophole allows a parolee's new arrest -- no matter how brutal or serious 
the offense -- to be processed administratively as a parole violation outside 
the reach of the get-tough crime law signed by the governor in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum penalty parole officials can now impose is one year in prison, 
compared to a life prison term that the courts can hand down in "three strikes" 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), running for attorney general, and two 
other assemblymen as well as a state senator all introduced measures this year 
to provide harsher punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills introduced by state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Assemblyman 
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) would have enabled parole authorities to impose 
prison terms of five years or more on parole violators. The bills died in the 
Assembly Ways and Means committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We held the bills because analysts found that they would cost billions of 
dollars," said Geoff Long, a committee consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said he introduced his measure after the state's Little Hoover Commission 
recommended that parole authorities be empowered to hand down prison terms of 
more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission concluded in January that parole violators had reached 
"epidemic proportions." The report criticized prosecutors for diverting so many 
parolees away from the courts to be disciplined instead by parole authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about 20,000 parolees were returned to prison with new prison terms 
imposed by the courts. An additional 35,000 were returned to custody by parole 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson backed a bill sponsored earlier this year by Assemblyman Richard 
Rainey (R-Contra Costa) that would have empowered parole authorities to return 
parole violators to prison for up to five years, or alternatively, for the same 
length term as their most recent court conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line here is that the parole laws are ridiculously and dangerously 
lenient," said the governor's spokesman, Sean Walsh. "There are parolees who 
get out of prison early, commit new serious crimes, and then go back to prison 
for just one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, too, favors legislation "to tighten up on parolees and return violators 
to prison for five years or the balance of their previous sentence," said her 
campaign spokeswoman, Beth Miller. "It's absurd that the maximum penalty right 
now is one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Tottin, executive director of the California Assn. of District Attorneys, 
said prosecutors refer arrested parolees to parole authorities for 
administrative action only when the case "does not meet their criteria for 
filing," he said.

126 KILLED IN WWII ATTACK ARE HONORED; DEDICATION: NEW MEMORIAL IN SAN DIEGO IS 
THE FIRST AT A NATIONAL CEMETERY IN AMERICA TO HONOR THOSE WHO DIED WHEN A 
KAMIKAZE PILOT SANK A SHIP.

 Nick Nickless remembers the Japanese Zero diving directly for the flight deck 
of the St. Lo and the horror, death and bravery that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious to us he was trying to commit suicide," said Nickless, 72, of 
Manchester, Mass. "He hit us hard and the explosion knocked everybody down." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle Hoffman was hurrying to his battle station when the first explosion 
struck. "Somebody hit me from the back and the two of us slid about 20 feet 
together," said Hoffman, 69, of Sitka, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Lo's gasoline and torpedoes set off a series of fiery explosions, 
hurling huge pieces of twisted metal hundreds of feet into the air as the 
Battle for Leyte Gulf, the largest, fiercest naval battle the world has ever 
known, raged on. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 28 minutes the St. Lo had sunk, the first American warship sent to the 
bottom of the sea by an unprecedented suicidal tactic called the kamikaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony that brought tears to many of the several hundred St. Lo 
survivors and family members in attendance Monday, a memorial at Ft. Rosecrans 
National Cemetery was dedicated to the 126 men killed aboard the St. Lo. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony came 50 years to the day after the sinking of the St. Lo marked 
the beginning of an extraordinary chapter in World War II, one that pitted 
Japanese pilots fighting to die against American sailors fighting to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots had volunteered to crash their bomb-laden planes into American 
ships, inspired by the legend of the kamikaze (divine wind) that rescued Japan 
in the 13th Century from an invading Mongol emperor by destroying his fleet. 
Slow-moving, lightly defended escort carriers like the St. Lo were a favorite 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the war ended 10 months later, kamikazes had sunk 35 American ships, 
damaged another 368, killed 4,900 U.S. sailors and wounded 4,800. About 3,000 
kamikaze pilots died, many wearing their burial robes in expectation of 
achieving divine status. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ceremony was a time for remembrance of the victims of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless the heroes of the USS St. Lo," said Jerry Bowen, director of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs' national cemetery system.  
</P>
<P>
 Gus Benacka, 68, who was burned and temporarily blinded by the explosion, 
survived only because a shipmate risked his life to make sure Benacka was 
wearing a "Mae West" life preserver when the order came to abandon ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day I don't know who saved me" or whether he survived, said Benacka, 
of Phoenix. "I'm just grateful to God for what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Staring at the granite memorial inscribed with the names of the 126 dead, Lou 
Rodriguez, 73, of Monterey, Calif., pondered the imponderable question of war: 
why some men die and others survive. "You keep thinking: A lot better men than 
I went down with the ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial to the St. Lo is the first monument at any of America's 114 
national cemeteries to those who died on a ship sunk by a kamikaze. A second 
memorial to kamikaze victims aboard the Ommaney Bay, which was sunk during the 
invasion of Luzon in January, 1945, will be dedicated at Ft. Rosecrans early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a memorial in the Philippines to the St. Lo and other ships in its 
task force, but the survivors of the St. Lo decided several years ago that that 
was not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who died deserved something here in their own country," said William 
C. Brooks, 74, of Mill Valley, Calif. Funds for the memorial were raised 
privately by an association of St. Lo survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Lo was among those ships assigned to keep the larger and better-armed 
Japanese ships from advancing toward the Philippine island of Leyte, where 
American troops had established an important beachhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a miscalculation, the main American fleet, under Adm. William (Bull) 
Halsey, had gone north several hundred miles, leaving the St. Lo and other 
smaller ships, led by Rear Adm. Clifton A. F. Sprague, to encounter the 
Japanese armada. The American victory off Samar Island is considered a turning 
point in the Pacific war. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 15-volume history of the Navy in World War II, Harvard professor Samuel 
Eliot Morison writes: "In no engagement in its entire history has the U.S. Navy 
shown more gallantry, guts and gumption than in those two morning hours off 
Samar." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned in mid-1943 as the Midway, the St. Lo came through the battles 
for Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas unscathed. Its name was changed in the 
fall of 1944 by the War Department to St. Lo in honor of a breakout location 
after D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change had upset many of the sailors, who believed in an old 
superstition that it is unlucky to change the name of a ship at sea. One chief 
petty officer even tried to transfer, feeling the ship was jinxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all absolutely shocked that they would do something like that to a 
ship going into battle," Nickless said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Benacka: "It was considered as unlucky as bringing a woman aboard ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the name change, the St. Lo was sunk. The date was Oct. 24 in 
the United States; Oct. 25 in the Philippines, across the international 
dateline. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those killed when the kamikaze crashed into the St. Lo was Lt. John A. 
Palmer, whose daughter, Patsy Palmer Williams, of Milwaukee, laid a wreath at 
the foot of the memorial Monday. She was 2 years old when the St. Lo was sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your father was a great division officer," said Buddy Barnes, 73, of 
Annapolis, Md., as he tearfully embraced Williams. "We owe our lives to him," 
said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The person who sank the St. Lo was an experienced fighter pilot, unlike many 
kamikazes who were teen-agers barely able to fly. His timing was impeccable: 
The St. Lo was refueling and arming its planes, the most vulnerable time for a 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the luckiest kamikaze pilot in the fleet, and we were the unluckiest 
ship," said Benacka. Seven hundred fifty-four crewmen were rescued from the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 As they bobbed up and down in the gasoline-laden sea waiting hours to be 
rescued, St. Lo survivors took heart that the ship's flag was still flying even 
as it slipped beneath the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never surrendered," Nickless said. "We fought to the very end."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; ATTORNEY GENERAL; LUNGREN DECRIES OPPONENT'S AD ON POLLY 
KLAAS; INCUMBENT SAYS THE COMMERCIAL FOR TOM UMBERG IS MISLEADING. HE SAYS IT 
ALLEGES THAT FUNDING CUTS AFFECTED A DATABASE THAT COULD HAVE HELPED INTERCEPT 
THE GIRL'S KIDNAPER.

 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren took the unusual step Monday of denouncing his 
Democratic opponent for a campaign commercial that has yet to run, saying the 
advertisement wrongly depicts him as bearing some responsibility for the death 
of murder-kidnaping victim Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked at a news conference by more than a dozen crime victims, Lungren 
demanded that Democrat Tom Umberg "pull the plug" on the commercial before it 
airs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the people of California to know just how desperate Tom Umberg is and 
just how lacking in character and principle he is to ever concoct and air such 
an ad," Lungren said, adding that the commercial "tramples" on crime victims in 
California and will establish Umberg as "the sleaziest" politician in the 
state's history. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager, would not disclose the content of the 
television ads but said they would be "100% factual." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he learned of the advertisement, which is expected to begin 
airing today, through sources in the news media. Officials with his campaign 
said the advertisement features Joe Klaas, grandfather of the young Northern 
California girl whose kidnaping and murder attracted national attention and 
helped propel a rash of anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial, they said, echoes charges voiced repeatedly by Umberg -- that 
Lungren slashed staffing for a statewide computer database that could have 
helped officers apprehend Richard Allen Davis, the repeat felon charged with 
the girl's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was questioned briefly the night of the abduction by sheriff's deputies 
who were unaware of the kidnaping. After his arrest, Davis told law enforcement 
officials that the girl was alive when he talked with the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's campaign team said the Umberg advertisement concludes with a shot of 
Klaas in a T-shirt reading: "Remember Polly. Dump Lungren." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Klaas, reached by phone at his home in Carmel, confirmed that he 
voluntarily participated in such a commercial, which was shot at the memorial 
site established for the slain 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas, a Democrat, said in an interview that if Lungren had funded the 
computer database, "it might have made a big difference and might have saved 
Polly's life. That's inexcusable to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that besides Lungren, Gov. Pete Wilson and Republican U.S. Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington "abused Polly's memory and exploited my family" by 
using the kidnaping and slaying to push the "three strikes" anti-crime law and 
their own political careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, however, maintained that Umberg was misleading the Klaas family. He 
said that Davis' criminal history was available to the law officers who stopped 
him, but that the deputies did not have probable cause to check the system, 
which handles 4.2 million criminal-record inquiries a month. If they had, the 
record would have shown Davis' prior arrests and convictions, including one for 
kidnaping, Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Umberg's ad exploits the death of a little girl.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; BROWN VOWS TO HALT STATE TAKING OF LOCAL FUNDS; 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SAYS SHE'D SHRINK GOVERNMENT. HER GOAL IS TO AVOID GOV. 
WILSON'S PRACTICE OF SHIFTING CITY AND COUNTY REVENUES TO SACRAMENTO TO HELP 
BALANCE STATE BUDGET. 
</P>

<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown won repeated applause Monday from about 1,500 
municipal officials when she pledged to cut the size of California government 
if elected governor, rather than continue the practice of seizing local 
government revenues to balance the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "While you've been cutting and reinventing yourselves, Sacramento has been 
getting fatter and more complacent and living off your resources," Brown told 
delegates to the annual convention of the League of California Cities in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown accused Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of breaking the bond of partnership 
and trust between state and local government in California the past four years 
by repeatedly appropriating city and county property taxes to meet state budget 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the local loss was made up by a half-cent sales tax increase approved 
by voters, with Wilson's backing, in a 1993 special election. The money is 
earmarked for fire, police and other public safety functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown noted in her speech that Wilson pledged when he was first running for 
governor four years ago that "we need to change the attitude that Sacramento 
knows best." He promised an activist state administration that would free local 
government from many of the spending mandates and restrictions imposed by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality has included a $7-billion tax increase, record state borrowing and 
the usurping of local property tax revenues, Brown said. She added that she did 
not blame Wilson for the recession and the wrenching economic changes that cut 
sharply into state revenues, "but it's his response that I hold him accountable 
for and it is his response that I think is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "When things get bad, they don't worry. They turn around and cut you," Brown 
told the local officials, referring to state officials in Sacramento. "That is 
wrong and it doesn't make good economic sense either, because you are the 
engine of our economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 After her speech, Brown held a news conference with many of the 85 California 
mayors who support her candidacy. Wilson is scheduled to address the convention 
this afternoon and has arranged for his own endorsement ceremony afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 At her news conference, Brown was asked if Democrats who control the state 
Legislature shouldn't be blamed as well as Wilson for the state's fiscal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," she said. "It's a co-dependence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown added that Wilson bears the major responsibility because he is the 
state's chief executive officer who controls the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want less government," Brown added. "That's what my plan is all about, less 
government, not more government." 
</P>
<P>
 In her address, Brown also was applauded when she promised to work for a 
proposed state ballot measure to reduce the requirement for passage of local 
bond issues from the existing two-thirds vote to a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has supported the change in the case of bonds that raise money for new 
schools. Brown said it should apply to all local facilities, such as sewage 
treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said she had agreed to a pledge put to the two candidates by the 
mayors of California's 10 largest cities in a letter dated Sept. 8. The mayors 
asked them to promise "that I will not reduce or transfer property taxes, sales 
taxes, vehicle license fees or other local revenues upon which cities depend in 
order to balance the state budget." 
</P>
<P>
 "I took that pledge," Brown said to applause. "I pledge that if the cutting is 
to begin, let it finally begin in Sacramento, in the Sacramento bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wrote the letter include Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who is 
backing Wilson for reelection, and San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan, who was 
identified by the Brown campaign Monday as a Brown supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page response dated Monday, Wilson declined to take the pledge, 
saying, "Unlike Kathleen Brown, I won't make irresponsible election-year 
pledges simply to win votes. . . . None of us can ever guarantee what the 
future will bring."

GERMAN PARLIAMENT MEMBERS LINKED TO SECRET POLICE; POLITICS: COMMUNIST LEADER 
GREGOR GYSI, OTHER PARTY LAWMAKERS FROM EAST ARE ACCUSED OF BEING 
EX-INFORMANTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism, fresh from celebrating 
its triumph in last week's federal election, was under siege Monday with 
allegations that some of its recently elected members of Parliament had been 
informants for the East German secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy centered on the party's charismatic leader, Gregor Gysi, after 
two influential national magazines reported that newly discovered documents 
have revealed that, as a lawyer in East Germany, Gysi informed on his dissident 
clients and received gifts from the secret police, known as Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
 Political opponents, including former Gysi client and leftist Greens Party 
legislator Gerd Poppe, called on the PDS leader to quit his seat in Parliament 
or clear up the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gysi has long maintained his innocence when it comes to the Stasi, and a 
parliamentary committee found no proof of any secret police activities on his 
part when they investigated eastern deputies after the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he told ARD television: "I have not cooperated with the Stasi. I 
have not betrayed clients. Just the formulation of a suspicion cannot be 
sufficient for me to give up my seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Gysi aide Dieter Liemann dismissed the new charges as a tired campaign aimed 
at discrediting the reinvigorated party. The PDS won 30 seats in the 672-seat 
German Parliament on Oct. 16, in large part due to the dynamic style of Gysi, 
who was voted in for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is naturally connected with the election gains," Liemann said in 
a telephone interview. "If you want to weaken the PDS, you pounce on the most 
prominent person." 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal arises just days after the PDS pressured one of its own newly 
elected deputies, Kerstin Kaiser-Nicht, to give up her seat because of Stasi 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, the 34-year-old Kaiser-Nicht reluctantly admitted that 
she had informed on fellow German students while studying Slav languages in 
Leningrad between 1979 and 1984. Eastern voters elected her anyway, but PDS 
leaders said that she had shown no remorse for her activities and they did not 
want to work with her in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Another PDS deputy, Rolf Kutzmutz, also has admitted that he was a Stasi 
informer, but the party is not seeking his resignation because he openly 
acknowledged that he had reported on material shortages in the former East 
Germany. His campaign posters stated, "My Biography Does Not Begin in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Parliament will be sworn in on Nov. 10 in Berlin, and PDS member 
Stefan Heym is to give the opening address as the eldest member of the 
Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 The PDS presents itself as a protest party representing easterners, and many 
eastern Germans who voted for the PDS said they feel the traditional political 
parties dominated by westerners do not adequately represent their interests. 
Many easterners are disappointed with the high costs of capitalism and 
nostalgic for the social benefits of their old Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl dismisses the PDS as "red-painted fascists" and 
"Communist rabble," and many western politicians do not believe anyone 
associated with the former Communist party belongs in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some members of Parliament are asking if Gysi belongs there. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's issue of the conservative weekly magazine Focus, former dissident 
author Lutz Rathenow wrote that he recently discovered reports in his Stasi 
file with information from his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had Gregor Gysi as an attorney," Rathenow wrote, echoing the charges 
of several other dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathenow called for Gysi's law license to be revoked, while Greens legislator 
Poppe called for him to step down from Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 On television, Poppe said he also had found information in his Stasi file that 
could only have come from Gysi, who was his attorney at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly magazine Der Spiegel, meanwhile, reported that the office in charge 
of Stasi files informed the PDS last week that it had discovered receipts for 
100-mark (about $70) birthday and Christmas gifts that a Stasi officer had 
bought for Gysi, and that the receipts "harden the suspicion" that Gysi was an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 The receipts were discovered in a file on Gysi called "Sputnik." Gysi argues 
that the file reporting on him proves he was not a collaborator.

U.S. PROFESSOR SAYS SINGAPORE HARASSING HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Lingle, the latest American to run afoul of Singapore's 
government, said Monday that it is impossible for him to return to his teaching 
job at Singapore's National University after being investigated by police for 
an article he contributed to a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Americans have an instinctive acceptance of freedom of expression, 
whether it be academic freedom or freedom of the press, and I view this issue 
along those lines," Lingle said in a telephone interview from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the university confirmed Monday that Lingle, a senior fellow 
in European studies, had tendered his resignation, effective Nov. 21. Lingle 
was given a one-week compassionate leave to visit his father, who is gravely 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said in a statement that the university "is awaiting his 
return from compassionate leave to follow up on the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Lingle, 46, said he plans to return to Singapore to pack up his household 
belongings and research materials. He has been in Singapore 13 months and had 
11 months remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of circumstances, it seemed difficult to carry on my duties until 
the end of the contract," he said, explaining his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore police interrogated Lingle in his university office after an article 
appeared under his byline on the opinion page of the International Herald 
Tribune on Oct. 7. The article said regimes in the region "reveal considerable 
ingenuity in their methods of suppressing dissent."  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Lingle was being investigated for criminal defamation and 
contempt of court. The case was apparently prompted by Lingle's reference to a 
tendency of Asian governments, which he did not name, toward "relying on a 
compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the questioning, the U.S. State Department issued a statement 
condemning Singapore's move. "We are disappointed at this apparent attempt by 
Singaporean authorities to intimidate Prof. Lingle," the statement said. "We 
continue to believe that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department comment provoked an angry retort from Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong, who said the government was "thin-skinned" when it felt 
aspersions were cast on its honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody impugns the government's integrity, and it amounts to defamation, 
the government will take action," Goh told reporters while visiting 
Switzerland. "If there is any suggestion that the judiciary has been compliant, 
it is up to the people in the judiciary to decide whether it is contempt of 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Goh also denied suggestions that the Singapore government is singling out 
American citizens for harassment, an apparent reference to the Michael Fay case 
in which an American teen-ager was flogged with a rattan cane in May for 
spray-painting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. is a major trading partner, major investor. We have good relations. 
Why should we pick on individuals from America? It makes no sense," Goh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Fay case, a number of American businessmen expressed unease 
when an executive for a U.S. aerospace firm was arrested and prevented from 
leaving the country on charges of using abusive language during a series of 
traffic disputes dating back two years. He was eventually fined $1,750.

SRI LANKA PEACE EFFORT SEVERELY DAMAGED IN FATAL BLAST; ASIA: DESPITE DEATH OF 
OPPOSITION CANDIDATE IN BOMBING, NOV. 9 NATIONAL ELECTION STILL SEEMS TO BE ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Once again, a suicide bomber may have blown to pieces chances that peace can 
easily be restored to violence-racked Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and military investigators said they suspect a woman with a bomb hidden 
inside her jacket or a man on crutches wearing explosives on a belt in the 
massacre early Monday of the top opposition candidate for president, Gamini 
Dissanayake, and more than 50 officials and supporters of his party. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those suicide-bombing techniques have been used in the past in attacks 
blamed on Tamil separatists, who are also widely blamed for the latest attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast, which occurred just after midnight, sprayed people attending a 
Sunday night political rally in the capital, Colombo, with ball bearings or 
pellets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence has struck again as the nation moves toward peace and normalcy," 
said Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, of the leftist People's Alliance, 
who had faced a serious challenge from Dissanayake in her campaign for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the election little more than two weeks away, Commissioner of 
Elections R. K. Chandrananda De Silva decreed that the Nov. 9 polling should go 
forward as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with Sri Lankan law, he gave Dissanayake's United National Party 
three days to submit the name of a new candidate to replace the UNP's 
flamboyant 52-year-old standard-bearer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, De Silva said he doesn't think the act of mass 
political murder presages a general resurgence of violence that would make a 
free or fair election impossible in the island nation off India's southern tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sort of thing tends to shake up the people and make them feel the 
futility of such kinds of violence," De Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all government officials agreed, evidently. President Dingiri Banda 
Wijetunga, denouncing the deaths of his fellow UNP members as a "cowardly and 
dastardly act," reimposed an 11-year-old state of emergency that had been 
lifted only recently.  
</P>
<P>
 The government Monday also canceled a second round of peace talks with the 
Tamil rebels that were scheduled to begin that day in Jaffna, 185 miles north 
of Colombo. Officials said the talks are postponed indefinitely until an 
inquiry establishes who was behind Dissanayake's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears were widespread that outraged members of the island nation's majority 
Sinhalese community might seek vengeance on minority Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all waiting to see what happens," said Neelan Tiruchelvam, an ethnic 
Tamil, who is director of the Colombo-based International Center for Ethnic 
Studies. "The country is in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, in an ethnic war that has cost more than 30,000 lives, the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been waging a fierce struggle for a 
separate homeland in the north and east for the largely Hindu Tamils, who make 
up about 18% of the predominantly Buddhist population of 17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the capital on Monday, troops set up checkpoints and searched arriving 
vehicles. However, as night fell, no new incidents of violence were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," Information Minister Dharmsasiri Senanayake said at an 
evening briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful explosion during an election rally in a marketplace of Colombo's 
Grandpass district killed the candidate, 17 members of the presidential 
security division who had been assigned to protect him, and several top party 
officials, including UNP General Secretary Gamini Wijesekara, two former 
ministers and the party's top organizer for Colombo, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of other people suffered cuts and bruises, and 75 were hurt 
seriously, police said. The death toll was put at 52 as of Monday evening, 
though hospital officials said some bodies were so badly maimed that an exact 
count was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the explosion occurred about 10 minutes after midnight, after 
Dissanayake, conscious of the hour, jokingly concluded a campaign speech by 
saying, "Instead of saying good night, I wish you all a very good morning." He 
turned to return to his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big flash and a huge explosion; when I looked up there was no one 
on the stage," remembered a woman who escaped unhurt, but whose skirt was 
smeared with the blood of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said many of the victims were struck in their heads or upper 
bodies by flying metal pellets or shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga, whose father and husband also were assassinated, promised that 
those responsible for murdering her opponent would be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Sri Lankans, however, were certain to put some of the blame on the prime 
minister and her government for the much softer line she has taken toward the 
rebels since her People's Alliance coalition won the Aug. 16 parliamentary 
elections and ended the UNP's 17-year hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could rebound against her if she is seen as having stroked the head of 
the Tigers," a senior Sri Lankan journalist said.

THE SOUTHLAND FIRESTORM: ONE YEAR LATER; PREPARING FOR THE NEXT ONE; FIRE 
AGENCIES ADD EQUIPMENT AND STRESS SAFETY, BUT EXPERTS SAY IT WON'T BE ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A thousand pairs of fireproof pants have been delivered to the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department. Two gleaming, banana-yellow Super Scooper airplanes are 
poised for action on the Van Nuys Airport Tarmac. And hundreds of fire engines 
from Malibu to Mission Viejo are being fitted with everything from 
flame-retardant foam to swimming pool siphons. 
</P>
<P>
 A firefighting arms race of sorts has swept cities and counties from Ventura 
to San Diego since 17 fires laid siege to the region a year ago. The next time 
firefighters go to war with a merciless mix of wind and fire, they undoubtedly 
will be better armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire battleground also will be a marginally more hospitable place -- with 
some improved water systems, a few wider roads and building codes that will 
make new homes in some areas more resistant to fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But an increasing number of wild land fire experts say there will never be 
enough firefighters or sparkling new equipment to counterbalance the explosive 
potential energy that has been accumulating in the hills for several decades. 
Without clearing thousands of acres or restricting the flood of flatlanders 
into the foothills, more disastrous firestorms are inevitable, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fires are burning more intensely than they have in the past and the wild land 
fire problem is getting worse and worse," said Matt Mathes, the U.S. Forest 
Service's regional spokesman. "Suppression alone is no longer going to do the 
job of protecting people from fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of fire safety programs, exemplified by the sagebrush wisdom of Smokey 
the Bear, have left more grass, scrub brush and dead wood on the ground to burn 
when fires finally do rage. Routine flare-ups that kept coastal brushland well 
manicured for thousands of years have now given way to uncontrollable 
firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no coincidence, experts say, that the state suffered three of its most 
destructive fire seasons in just four years: the 1990 Santa Barbara, 1991 
Oakland and 1993 Southern California fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But reducing construction and removing chaparral can be both politically and 
practically hazardous. As a result, fire departments have spent much of the 
year girding for the next great fire. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles City Fire Department -- which had four men seriously burned 
in the brush above Chatsworth -- the focus has been on safety. Besides the new 
fireproof pants, which will eventually go to all 2,800 firefighters, the force 
will be fitted with new belts to carry protective foil blankets and helmet 
flaps that shield the neck. Throw in new canteens and first-aid backpacks and 
the total cost of the new gear will run $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where three blazes scorched thousands of acres, the Board of 
Supervisors has approved the purchase of two new helicopters that can dump up 
to 4,000 gallons of water an hour. Federal grants could help purchase other 
equipment -- distributors for fire-retardant foam, portable pumps and an 
improved communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department plans to install the foam sprayers on 
70% of its 170 engines and to place "eductors" -- which siphon water from pools 
and wells -- on its entire fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also helped broker a deal that brought the highly touted Super 
Scooper to Southern California for testing this summer -- an arrangement that 
officials hope to extend into next year. Unlike many other airborne 
firefighters, the plane can reload its 1,600-gallon water tank without landing. 
It was deemed "very impressive" in its first live action, helping to quickly 
knock down a tumbleweed fire last week in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements have also been made to ensure that already stockpiled equipment 
gets to fires as quickly as possible. New guidelines will ensure that giant 
C-130 National Guard planes used for firefighting can be staffed and equipped 
in 13 hours, instead of the 24 hours it took in the past, according to the 
Governor's Office of Emergency Services. And agencies will be allowed to rent 
water trucks from private firms in the next firestorm, without adhering to a 
past policy that required department officials to canvass the entire state 
first in an effort to borrow the tanker trucks from other public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in the region's water systems are more problematic -- with some 
isolated upgrades on the way but with many neighborhoods still facing the 
prospect that, when fire strikes, fire hoses could again run dry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, the City Council this year finally ended a long-running 
debate and approved construction of a 3-million gallon reservoir at the city's 
highest elevation. Many residents had problems with the aesthetics of the 
reservoir. Fire officials said that even a new reservoir would not completely 
resolve the community's water supply problems. But the loss of water a year 
ago, when 366 homes burned, turned the debate in favor of the $6-million 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu's gutted La Costa community also is expected to get an improved water 
system, paid for with a $3,250-per-parcel assessment. The new system will more 
than triple the capacity of the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such improvements are in sight for much of the rest of Malibu. The 
community's aging water system needs $100 million in improvements to reach 
minimum standards for high-fire zones -- a goal that is virtually unattainable 
on an annual capital budget of just $2 million, said David Howard, a county 
engineer who oversees Malibu water projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials are hoping that other Malibu neighborhoods will follow the 
lead of La Costa and pay for their own improvements. But they admit that no 
amount of money could have bought safety in the last firestorm. "There isn't a 
water system in the world that could have handled that fire," said Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with water in the pipes, many water agencies still cannot guarantee that 
they will have the power to pump it to fire crews in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district serving Altadena still does not have its own generators for 
power pumps, a year after a power failure left firefighters virtually without 
water to combat a fire that burned 151 structures. The Kinneloa Irrigation 
District cannot afford generators, which cost $40,000 each, on its $500,000 
annual budget. As a result, when fires come, it could take up to 10 hours to 
lease the equipment from other agencies, said Gene W. Burt, district general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 That is way too long, said Gail Crook, a Downey Fire Department battalion 
chief who was left without water in the Altadena fire. "Ten hours and there 
won't be anything there," Crook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such shortcomings have officials trying to make homes built amid the chaparral 
less susceptible to fire. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last 
month asked for preliminary drafts of a series of building code revisions for 
new construction in wild land areas, known as Fire Zone 4. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether the board will give final approval, though, to 
some proposals that came from the county's Wildfire Safety Panel. Some of the 
code changes could face opposition from property owners and the building 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the proposed code changes would require that new homes be 
built without wood roof shingles -- a rule that has already been in force in 
Malibu and the city of Los Angeles for several years. The code changes for new 
homes or major remodelings would also require double panes on exterior windows; 
curbside drainage lines for swimming pools, to allow fire crews to draw water; 
heavier construction on wood decks and patios; and interior sprinkler systems 
for homes more than six minutes or three miles from the nearest fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 Building industry representatives have already headed off some other 
proposals, including a ban on wood home siding. Instead, wood exterior walls 
will have to be backed by interior construction that is rated to withstand fire 
for one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want wood siding pretty much in custom homes up in the hills. They 
don't like the look of stucco," said Allen Gooch, the county fire captain who 
helped draw up the recommendations. "I don't feel comfortable with it, but you 
can't win 'em all." 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one area, brush clearance, Fire Department administrators said 
public cooperation has been better than in any year in recent memory. The areas 
patrolled by the Los Angeles County Fire Department exemplify the trend -- with 
less than 1% of the 27,220 wild land parcels still overgrown at the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have been working on other remedies to ensure that the trend 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has nearly doubled its inspections of vacant lots. 
Laguna Beach has used a herd of 650 goats to mow canyon grasslands. Malibu has 
set aside funds to make sure that the city's lawyers take the time to prosecute 
brush clearance violations. And in Riverside County, state and federal wildlife 
officials are on the verge of signing an agreement that will permit homeowners 
to clear brush up to 100 feet from their houses, even if they live in the midst 
of habitat for the endangered Stephens kangaroo rat. 
</P>
<P>
 This is called "fuel management," and it has become the buzz phrase of fire 
prevention in the 1990s -- the alternative to leaving 40- and 50-year-old 
tinder beds within a strong wind of people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains problematic for fire safety specialists is how to clear the vast 
tracts of public and private property that are outside of homeowners' 
individual properties. It is there that firestorms muster their energy and that 
clearing brush from rugged terrain is most difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlled burns are viewed as the most efficient method of clearing away old 
growth and dead wood, but there are only a few months of the year when 
conditions are judged to be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 And many homeowners simply do not want to see their rustic surroundings 
burned. Just five months before last year's Topanga Canyon fire, a group of 
homeowners near the top of the canyon filed a lawsuit that stopped the burning 
of 277 acres by the Los Angeles County Fire Department. And a 780-acre burn in 
Laguna Beach's Emerald Canyon, which might have served as a substantial 
firebreak, was thwarted for many years by air quality regulations, concerns 
about the endangered California gnatcatcher, and protests from homeowners who 
didn't want to put up with ashes and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met with community groups in Emerald Bay and people said they didn't want 
controlled burns because they didn't want to get ashes on their homes or their 
cars," said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young. "Some of those people don't 
have either now. That was the oddest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Such resistance has left fire management experts far short of their goals in 
reducing fuel. Richard Wilson, director of the state Department of Forestry and 
Fire Protection, said 1 million acres of wild land should be cleared a year. 
That is a distant dream, compared to the 30,000 acres that are now cut or 
burned annually. 
</P>
<P>
 A few voices are beginning to suggest that public officials have been too 
indulgent toward those who insist on living inside fire zones. Wild land 
resource scientist Klaus Radtke suggests that all but the most limited use of 
wood in hillside home construction is unsafe and that owners have become 
accustomed to being bailed out by firefighters and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public is forced to subsidize high-risk lifestyles for the 
generally more well-to-do," Radtke has said, adding that "public agencies 
depend on the cyclical emergencies to balance their budgets and upgrade 
infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Williams, president of the Pasadena Glen Improvement Assn., is 
angered by the suggestion that people such as her neighbors, who lost homes in 
the Altadena fire, are placing an expensive burden on the county Fire 
Department and other agencies. Williams said that for years the wooded enclave 
has gone without street lights, road paving and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who live up in the hillsides enjoy less of the public trough than 
anyone else, not more," Williams said. "Building up in these hills, with our 
high property taxes, we contribute quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, believes that Southern Californians could learn a lesson from the 
victims of last year's Mississippi River floods, many of whom have accepted 
buyouts from the federal government to move out of the flood plain. He argues 
that land purchased in the Southern California mountains from voluntary 
emigrants could eventually be attached to public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edmiston conceded that the tremendous trauma of the fires and sympathy for 
victims has made his proposal anathema in some circles in Malibu, where he 
lives. The longtime conservancy administrator did not receive a warm reception 
in Sacramento and Washington, either, when he raised the idea of buying out 
burned-out homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmiston: "The legislators said something to the effect of, 'That's a 
real interesting idea, Joe, and you are probably right. But I would rather have 
a root canal than introduce that bill.' "

 A year ago, on a crisp October morning near Escondido, a downed power line 
ignited a blaze. Later that afternoon, in Thousand Oaks, an arsonist set a 
second fire. By the end of the next day, vast regions of the Southern 
California landscape were ablaze. The fires consumed nearly 200,000 acres and 
caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. A year later, the region 
still struggling with the fires' emotional and financial toll.

 A judge in Pensacola ruled that the man accused of murdering a doctor and his 
security escort in July cannot defend the killings as justifiable homicide. 
Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell said Paul Hill could not defend 
himself by arguing that the action was justifiable because killing a doctor who 
performed abortions protected the lives of unborn children. Hill, 40, of 
Pensacola, is accused of shooting to death Dr. John Britton, 69, of Fernandina 
Beach and James Barrett, 74, of Pensacola.

JAILED ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST INDICTED IN 10 CLINIC ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman now in prison for the attempted murder of an abortion clinic doctor 
has been charged with 30 federal felony counts for 10 arson and acid attacks on 
clinics in California, Oregon, Nevada and Idaho in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments of Rachelle Shannon, unsealed Monday by federal grand juries 
in Sacramento and Portland, accused her of arson, interference with commerce by 
force and interstate travel in aid of racketeering but alleged no conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, 38, of Grants Pass, Ore., is serving a term of nearly 11 years at a 
Kansas state prison for the August, 1993, wounding of Dr. George Tiller, a 
Wichita, Kan., physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest charges include the use of a napalm-like substance in the Aug. 18, 
1992, arson attack on the Feminist Women's Health Center in Sacramento, which 
carries a mandatory consecutive sentence of 30 years imprisonment on 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence against clinics which provide reproductive health services 
constitutes domestic terrorism," said Charles J. Stevens, U.S. attorney in 
Sacramento. "Investigating and prosecuting such conduct is a high priority in 
this office." 
</P>
<P>
 In one two-day period, Sept. 16 and 17, 1992, Shannon was accused of arson and 
acid attacks on abortion clinics in Chico, Eugene, Ore., and Reno. She also was 
charged with fire-bombing a Reno abortion facility three hours after a similar 
attack on the Sacramento clinic. The indictments also accuse Shannon of attacks 
on clinics in Redding, Calif., Portland and Boise, Ida.  
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, expressed relief 
that the grand juries "finally" had returned indictments, but said she was 
disappointed that no others were charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly no one person could have possibly done all of these arsons by herself 
-- without the knowledge or help of others," Smeal said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials and representatives of the U.S. attorneys offices 
in Sacramento and Portland noted only that no conspiracy charges were brought 
but that the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were information that others were involved, it would constitute 
evidence at Shannon's trial, "and I can't talk about it," said Stephen F. 
Peifer, assistant U.S. attorney in Portland. "The investigation continues into 
this and a whole array of other clinic violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In two of the attacks, Shannon is charged with injecting butyric acid into 
clinic facilities. John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, said that the 
acid "smells exactly like vomit" and is so long-lasting that "you have to tear 
down walls to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Shannon faces the possibility of substantial prison terms. The 
maximum sentence for each of the six arson counts, for example, is 10 years in 
prison. But in one of them, a firefighter was injured, which boosts the maximum 
possible penalty to 20 years imprisonment. The other counts carry maximum 
sentences ranging from five to 20 years in prison.

 A group of Cuban-American lawyers sued the United States government seeking an 
end to detention of Cuban refugees at Guantanamo Bay and Panama. About 32,000 
Cubans, all of them refugees picked up at sea this summer, are being held. 
Though the Clinton Administration has announced plans to allow some children 
and elderly Cuban refugees to enter the United States, the others must remain 
at the U.S. bases indefinitely or return to Cuba to apply for some of the 
20,000 visas per year available to Cubans.

 After days of flood and fire, traffic moved through the Houston Ship Channel 
and crews said they were ahead of schedule in their efforts to clean up 200,000 
gallons of spilled fuel and oil. The channel was closed last week because of 
flooding caused by torrential rains. It has been reopened since waters began 
receding and a sunken tugboat was removed from near the mouth of the San 
Jacinto River.

N.Y.C. MAYOR CROSSES PARTY LINE TO ENDORSE GOV. CUOMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani broke Republican ranks Monday and endorsed 
Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for a fourth term in office. Giuliani said he 
will campaign and appear in commercials for Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 While the move might boost the governor's uphill campaign, it certainly will 
earn Giuliani the enmity of both the Republican gubernatorial nominee, state 
Sen. George Pataki, and Pataki's principal patron, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the right thing for the city," Giuliani said. "I think most people in 
the city will respect me for my independence and honesty, and some people will 
disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Pataki responded in a frosty single-sentence statement. "I will do a great job 
as governor of New York State and Rudy Giuliani is doing a great job as mayor 
of New York City." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo said: "He (Giuliani) knows the importance of his political position to 
himself and to his party. He also knows what comes first is his ability to help 
the people he is sworn to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani is known to have a strained relationship with D'Amato but is friendly 
with Cuomo. Even before formally offering his support, Giuliani signaled that 
friendship by marching in the city's Columbus Day parade with Cuomo instead of 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani said he had previously announced he would support Democrats if he 
thought they were better for the city and that in the current campaign he had 
supported mostly Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor earlier in the day had said he planned to talk with New Yorkers 
about sacrifices necessary to close the city's budget gap, estimated at $1 
billion. Instead, he turned to politics, striking at Pataki's tax cut promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something strange here," Giuliani said. "The Pataki campaign wants 
to increase spending and decrease taxes as well, and that is a risky 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show Cuomo trailing Pataki but still within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high not only for Pataki but also for D'Amato, who picked 
Pataki to run for the GOP nomination and has lent him key staff members. A 
victory would enable D'Amato to emerge as the clear leader of New York State's 
fractious Republican Party and the power behind the state's chief executive.

PRESIDENT DEMANDS CREDIT FOR CUTTING FEDERAL DEFICIT; ECONOMY: CLINTON CITES 
$87-BILLION DROP IN TWO YEARS TO $203 BILLION AS STEEPEST IN THE NATION'S 
HISTORY AND PROOF THAT ECONOMIC PLAN IS WORKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Election Day looming, President Clinton on Monday seized on news of a 
further drop in the federal deficit to demand that his Administration receive 
more credit for its economic record. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that preliminary estimates for fiscal 1994 show the deficit 
shrinking to $203 billion, down from $290.4 billion in 1992, and headed for a 
projected $167.1 billion in the next fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. The 
decline is the largest two-year drop in U.S. history, Clinton said, contending 
that it proves critics' predictions about the dangers of his Administration's 
economic course have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 When his five-year budget was enacted in 1993, critics predicted that "the 
economy will collapse, the deficit will explode, middle-class taxpayers will be 
bankrupt -- this will be the end of the world," Clinton said in a speech to the 
City Club of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he contended, the economy's growth and the deficit's decline show 
that "we are on the right course, and we should continue in this direction." 
</P>
<P>
 But his upbeat economic message was detoured during a partisan exchange with 
Rep. Martin R. Hoke (R-Ohio). Clinton took questions from club members who had 
been chosen by lottery from the audience. By chance, the first one came from 
Hoke, who demanded to know how Clinton could jokingly describe the Republicans' 
election-year platform, called a "contract with America" as a "contract on 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a joke, Hoke said, made light of violence at a time when crime is a 
growing concern to all Americans. Bristling, he said Clinton's implication 
"that I would take out a contract on my constituents is a suggestion I take 
very, very personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tried to quiet the crowd long enough to allow Hoke to be heard. But 
Clinton then ran through his objections to the Republican program of tax cuts, 
government cutbacks and military spending hikes, before closing by saying that 
although he appreciated Hoke's concern about violence, "I wish you hadn't voted 
against the Brady Bill (which provides for a waiting period for the purchase of 
handguns) and the crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's supporters in the audience answered with thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit news offers Clinton a useful opportunity to assert again that much 
of his economic record has been overlooked. But it also points to the dilemma 
Clinton is facing as federal agencies consider the Administration's fiscal 
course for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of deficit reduction could encourage some citizens to ask for 
further reductions but the increasing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other 
entitlement spending would make that more difficult. Yet, the election year has 
demonstrated there is also growing pressure for tax cuts -- including the kind 
of middle-class tax decrease that Clinton made a key plank early in his 1992 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also wants to increase domestic spending -- what he calls investment 
-- in programs that were largely ignored by Congress in the President's first 
year. The White House in particular would like to increase spending for 
education and training, including the Head Start programs and other efforts for 
poor children, as well as increased spending to build roads and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of pressure from all directions and I just don't 
know how he's going to resolve it," said Gary Bass, a budget specialist at OMB 
Watch, a liberal publication that focuses on the budget, in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing importance of this issue was apparent over the weekend, with 
disclosure of a memo written by Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, that pointed out the possibilities of cuts in Medicare 
and Social Security spending. Administration officials hastened to play down 
the memo, arguing that it represented a catalogue of possibilities that are not 
necessarily under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there are clearly many within the Administration who believe that 
the expected growth in entitlement spending needs to be headed off before it 
causes the deficit to climb again at the end of the century. Not only Rivlin, 
but Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, whose influence has been rising, are 
hard-line deficit hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outside analysts believe that Administration officials will take a keen 
look at broad-based consumption taxes or limits on how much Americans with 
upper incomes can receive in entitlement programs. Bass said Clinton might find 
it politically appealing to propose that Congress pass a middle-class tax 
reduction twinned with cuts in tax breaks affecting corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Republicans have lost no opportunity to suggest that the 
Democrats will respond to new demands for federal spending by raising taxes. 
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House minority whip, told an NBC interviewer 
that Clinton has not ruled out a "massive tax increase," or, for example, 
capping the home mortgage deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration aides said the federal deficit reductions under Clinton are 
attributable to a combination of increased taxes (including a Clinton-proposed 
tax on wealthier taxpayers), the overall improvement in the economy and the 
effects of federal spending caps. They said that while the reductions had been 
in view for some time, it was important to talk about them because of the 
public's understandable skepticism about claims that the deficit is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 But working against smaller deficits are steadily rising federal health care 
costs -- including Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' health programs -- which 
are forecast to increase by about 10% a year for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending his economic record, Clinton called it remarkable that the 
Administration not only had cut the deficit and helped spur the economy but 
that at the same time "we have actually been able to increase our investment in 
education and training and technology." He pointed to the Head Start and high 
school apprenticeship programs, the expanded college loan program and efforts 
to find new functions for companies that have manufactured weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also took credit for a recent optimistic economic sign -- growth in 
the number of better-paying jobs. He said that more than half the new jobs 
created this year are above the average wage and that these exceed the number 
of better-paying jobs created in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview earlier Monday with WWWE radio in Cleveland, Clinton tried to 
dampen expectations of what he may accomplish on his five-day Middle East trip 
that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect a dramatic breakthrough" in talks with Syria's leader, Hafez 
Assad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio, Clinton also appeared at fund-raisers for Lee Fisher, the Democratic 
candidate for attorney general, and for Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer (D-Ohio).

RAUL JULIA; ACTOR PORTRAYED A WIDE ARRAY OF CHARACTERS ON STAGE, SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Raul Julia, whose brooding, passionate features and multifarious talents 
enabled him to portray characters ranging from the ghoulish patriarch of "The 
Addams Family" to the persecuted political prisoner in "Kiss of the Spider 
Woman," died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puerto Rican-born actor -- famous in his early years for his Shakespearean 
characterizations -- was 54 and died at North Shore University Hospital in the 
Long Island community of Manhasset, N.Y., where he was taken after a stroke a 
week ago. He slipped into a coma Thursday and never regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been in good health, said his agent, Jeff Hunter, adding that the 
stroke "was totally unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his U.S. stage and film career (he came to the mainland from Puerto 
Rico in 1964) the urbane actor with the shrouded gray eyes and resonant voice 
remained a striking presence. 
</P>
<P>
 He starred in the New York Shakespeare Festival's "Macbeth" (1966) and 
"Othello" (1979) and opposite Meryl Streep in "The Taming of the Shrew" (1978). 
</P>
<P>
 He also starred with Harrison Ford in the film thriller "Presumed Innocent" as 
attorney Sandy Stern and opposite Faye Dunaway in "The Eyes of Laura Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his last appearances -- a Home Box Office TV movie that was shown in 
September -- Julia was the martyred Brazilian rain forest activist Chico 
Mendes. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was Don Quixote singing "The Impossible Dream" in a 1991 stage revival 
of "Man of La Mancha." He was nominated for four Tony Awards ("The Two 
Gentlemen of Verona," "The Threepenny Opera" -- as Mack the Knife -- "Where's 
Charley" and "Nine") and was the widely heralded Marxist revolutionary Valentin 
in Hector Babenco's film version of "Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The last was the major breakthrough in a film career that began with minor 
parts in "The Organization Man" and "Panic in Needle Park," both in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Gomez Addams, a role that Julia brought to film after John 
Astin played the part in a highly successful two-year TV series of the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Addams Family" was about a macabre but tightly knit clan headed by Gomez, 
the evil-eyed husband and father with the murderous mentality. His wife was the 
beautifully ominous Morticia (Anjelica Huston in the film) and with butler 
Lurch and befuddled brother Fester they existed in a cartoon-celluloid world 
first created by Charles Addams in the New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Their motto was "We gladly feast on those who would subdue us." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 film produced a sequel -- "Addams Family Values" -- in 1993. In that 
picture Morticia bears a son, Pubert, who emerges complete with Gomez's 
mustache. Many found it funnier than its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia's friends were as diverse as his characters. 
</P>
<P>
 They ranged from comedian Orson Bean to Joseph Papp, the innovative 
producer-director of the New York Shakespeare pageants with which Julia had a 
16-year association, to Werner Erhard, founder of the mind-bending, 
self-improvement group est. 
</P>
<P>
 Papp, who died in 1991, once said of Julia: "He was always outrageous in his 
acting choices. He's larger than life all the time when he's on the stage. He 
doesn't mind falling flat on his face doing something dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia credited Bean, a stage actor later more closely associated with TV game 
shows, with sparking his interest in the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
 (Julia's first stage exposure -- as the devil in a first-grade play -- had 
been the start of his intrigue with acting.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in college appearing in a variety show and Orson was in Puerto Rico on 
vacation," Julia said. "He saw me and liked my performance. I told him that 
once I graduated I wanted to make acting my career and I was going to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead Bean invited Julia, at 6 feet, 2 inches an imposing presence, to New 
York, where he saw his first Broadway plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought," Julia said in a 1991 interview, " 'My God, you can actually make 
a living. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Julia's interests were also widespread. Foremost among them for the past 15 
years had been the Hunger Project, a charity that grew out of his experiences 
with est. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's goal is to eradicate hunger by the year 2000, and Julia insisted 
that statements in its behalf be inserted into the programs that accompanied 
his stage performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia said his interest in the underfed needy began in Puerto Rico when his 
successful father -- a restaurateur who reportedly introduced pizza to the 
island -- and mother would take stray children into their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out in 1977 that we have the technology to end hunger on the 
planet, I had to get involved," he told the Washington Post in 1992. "As Don 
Quixote says in the play, 'Maddest of all is to see things as they are, not as 
they ought to be.' " Julia's other offstage efforts included the Hispanic 
Organization of Latin Actors, which works to develop theater in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Spider Woman," the actor was able to partially cast off the hesitancy 
some producers and directors displayed in casting a Latino in a non-Latino 
role. Although the Latin influence was evident in "Moon Over Parador," "Tequila 
Sunrise" and "Havana," Julia was given the starring role of Cottard in a film 
version of Albert Camus' "The Plague" that went straight to video. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia also was Jane Fonda's sinister ex-husband in "The Morning After," the 
smooth-talking waiter in "One From the Heart" and the lovelorn goatherd in 
"Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 On television he was featured in several miniseries, among them "Richest Man 
in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis," "Mussolini: The Untold Story" 
and a 1974 special of "King Lear," in which he played Edmund. In a lighter 
mode, the actor was a one-season regular on "Sesame Street" as Rafael the Fixit 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia considered his portrayal of the martyred Salvadoran archbishop Oscar 
Romero in the 1989 film "Romero" one of his most important accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that generally he preferred the stage to motion pictures and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the theater is like standing on top of the mountain and shouting your 
confession," he said in a 1990 interview. "And film is like being in the 
confessional whispering, 'I have done this, I have done this. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Julia will be given a state funeral in San Juan, and memorial services will be 
held in New York and Los Angeles, said Susan Wright, his personal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia's survivors include his wife, dancer Merel Poloway; two sons, Raul 
Sigmund and Benjamin Rafael; his mother, Olga Arcelay of Puerto Rico, and two 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 * AN APPRECIATION: Raul Julia was one of the first Puerto Ricans to star on 
the Broadway stage, but his talent was such that he was hardly ever typecast.

MERTEN WON'T KICK HIMSELF OVER WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Merten is an engineer who spent his Navy time working on nuclear 
submarines and tends to reduce things to numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking is solving a equation: wind plus distance plus grass or artificial 
turf plus weather plus holder plus snapper plus shoes plus time of the game 
plus fatigue plus protection equal field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue is a football coach who also tends to reduce things to numbers. 
Success by Richard Merten's son, Bjorn, means points, producing momentum and 
maybe a UCLA victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of success contributes to the Bruins' present plight: six consecutive 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorn Merten understands both, and he also understands it's assumed that, when 
he trots onto the field, the scoreboard will change. When it doesn't, he is a 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's something he's had to get used to. 
</P>
<P>
 As an All-American as a redshirt freshman last season, when he was successful 
on 21 of 26 kicks, Westwood was his. As a sophomore, successful on nine of 17 
kicks for a 2-6 team, he doesn't go out at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a learning experience," he said. "I've definitely become a better 
person for it. I've learned that you can't let football, no matter how 
important it is, affect the other aspects of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 It had. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-key, shy person, Merten doesn't yell or throw things in times of stress. 
Instead, he becomes withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just real quiet, real closed and really on edge," he said. "I was in a 
bad mood and a little thing would put me in a worse mood. I guess my friends 
and family had to walk on eggshells around me. They couldn't tell me their 
problems because I was having problems. They have problems just as well as I 
do, but I didn't want to hear their problems because I have big problems of my 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Merten family, or Bjorn's girlfriend, has problems, they aren't 
played out before 40,000 in a stadium and a television audience. They aren't 
expected to be perfect, and their imperfections aren't criticized by fans who 
paid $22 a ticket not to be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism isn't returned in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fair," Merten said. "It's why I'm out on the field -- to kick field 
goals when the offense doesn't put it in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Who saw it coming? He made four of five tries against Tennessee in the season 
opener, and one of two against Southern Methodist. But he missed a kick against 
Nebraska and another against Washington State, both games UCLA losses, and a 
trend had developed. He was booed off the Rose Bowl field. 
</P>
<P>
 His plight worsened at Seattle, where he made one of four tries against 
Washington. The last, from 47 yards, hit the upright at the end of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 He had missed seven tries in his first five games, and, although six of them 
were from 40 or more yards, his confidence was shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Donahue's. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't call for Merten in a 26-7 loss at California, and in the second 
quarter of a scoreless game the next week, the Bruins were on the Oregon State 
29, fourth and three. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no hesitation. Daron Washington was sent into the line. He was 
stopped for no gain and the ball went over to the Beavers, who won, 23-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Was a 46-yard field goal contemplated? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it anticipated? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Merten. "I thought we would go for one, but that was a coach's 
decision. . . . I've learned to put things behind you and get back to the 
basics of why you are playing this sport: for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lot more fun a year ago. UCLA was winning, and when Merten, who won 
the job from Jason Lesley during the last week of preseason practice, was 
called upon, it was because the offense had stalled closer to the goal line 
than it has been this year. He kicked only five times from 40 or more yards 
last season, making three. 
</P>
<P>
 He became one of only four players to make All-American as a freshman. The 
others? Tony Dorsett, Herschel Walker and Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the winter and spring, he was still an All-American, and in summer he 
went to Phoenix to pose with Playboy bunnies as part of the magazine's 
preseason All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people are lucky enough to receive the recognition I got last year, 
particularly as young as I was, as a freshman," Merten said. "It was national. 
It was new and it was exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight weeks after the season started, he was kicking for his job in Tucson. As 
he warmed up Saturday to play against Arizona, walk-on Greg Andrasick was ready 
to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely knew if I didn't warm up well, I could lose the job," Merten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He warmed up well, then kicked a 19-yard field goal to cut Arizona's lead to 
14-10 as the first half ended. The Bruins came out to take a 17-14 lead in the 
third quarter, their first advantage since the losing streak began last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Merten had kicked 21- and 22-yard field goals against Oregon State, and 
had missed from 32. A pattern had been formed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bjorn Merten, Lord knows, has had a rough go of it, and it's affected us," 
Donahue said. "I really thought before the game I would go with Bjorn. . . . 
He's upset. We're upset. But I still think he's the best kicker we have, and 
we're going to stay with him until he gets out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But one of the things we're going to make sure of is not to put him in a 
position where he's going to have any extra pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 That means, when it's fourth down and a long field goal is indicated . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're going to go for (the first down)," Donahue said. "But at 
some point, we're going to have to get him to kick the field goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches aren't kickers. They only know three points or no points. There is 
little a coach can do about it except to decide whether he has the confidence 
to try the kicker again. 
</P>
<P>
 Merten spent last Thursday with a kicking coach, Ismael Ordonez, in Carson. 
Ordonez found that Merten's body was well ahead of his leg at impact, with his 
foot pushing the ball to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge helped on Saturday. Will it help when the ball is farther out? 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? But there is one thing Merten does know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good kicker, but I've been going through some rough times," he said. 
"I'm three of my last four, so I think I'm on my way." Kicks Keep Getting 
Harder to Make

FOR THIRD TIME IN A ROW, MADDUX WINS CY YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Maddux, the Atlanta Brave right-hander who lost $999,960 in salary during 
the 52-day player strike, recouped a large chunk of it Monday when he won the 
National League's Cy Young Award in voting by a committee of the Baseball 
Writers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 A unanimous selection, Maddux became the first pitcher in either league to win 
the award three consecutive years and the sixth to win it three times, a total 
exceeded only by Steve Carlton's four. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was worth $750,000 to Maddux, who was 16-6 with a 1.56 earned-run 
average, the third lowest in the last 75 years and 2.65 below the league 
average, the largest differential in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year, $28-million contract Maddux signed as a free agent with Atlanta 
after winning his first Cy Young with the Chicago Cubs in 1992 calls for an 
annual bonus of $250,000 for winning the award and a $500,000 bonus on top of 
that for winning it twice during the life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta General Manager John Schuerholz recently said that he questioned 
whether bonuses should be honored in a strike-abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, Schuerholz said that Maddux had turned in another 
spectacular season and was deserving of the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put that clause in, we were hoping he would do it," Schuerholz said. 
"If a guy wins the Cy Young, his team normally wins a pennant, but this wasn't 
a normal year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves were six games behind the Montreal Expos in the National League 
East when the season was canceled. Maddux said he can understand any 
controversy about the bonus in light of the shorter season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see both sides," he said in a conference call. "Two years ago, when I 
signed my contract, the Braves knew I was taking less to come to Atlanta, so 
they were more generous on the incentive side." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the shorter season diminished the impact of the award, Maddux said 
his goal is to pitch in a World Series and he was frustrated by that lost 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't sour (the award) for me at all," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone basically started the same number of games. It's like when you're 
rained out. The winners are happy and the losers say, 'We needed just two more 
innings.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hill, who was 16-5 with a 3.32 ERA for the Expos, was second in the 
voting. Bret Saberhagen of the New York Mets was third. He had a 14-4 mark with 
a 2.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux called it his best season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even imagine an ERA under two," he said. "My goal is to keep it under 
three. If someone had told me at the start of the season that I'd have a 1.56 
ERA, I would have laughed and tried to make a bet with them. I think that when 
you exceed your own expectations, it's much more gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers was a unanimous winner of the Cy Young in 1963, 
'65 and '66, but was deprived of four in a row when Dean Chance of the Angels 
received the 1964 award. At the time, there was only one award. It was not 
until 1967 that one was presented in each league. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux said he does not consider himself in the class of Koufax, Carlton, Bob 
Gibson, Tom Seaver or Jim Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll evaluate my career when I retire, but I don't think you can be 
considered one of the best after just three or four years," he said. "Maybe if 
I can do it for another three or four. But the only thing I'm thinking about 
and trying to do right now is find ways I can improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Improve? Teammate Tom Glavine, the last National League pitcher to win the Cy 
Young before Maddux started his streak, wondered if he will get a chance to win 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like just when you think he's had a career year, he comes back and 
has a better one," Glavine said of Maddux. "Maybe he'll leave some room for the 
rest of us to win one some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Bobby Cox: "I've managed two machines since I've been managing in 
the major leagues, Glavine in 1991 and now this guy. He's pinpoint with 
everything he throws." Cy Young Winners

BEING OUT OF LINE SKEWS RAMS' SPECIAL TEAMS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyrone Hughes celebrated his two NFL kick return records by going dancing at a 
New Orleans nightclub Sunday night, leaving the Rams to ponder their special 
teams gaffes on a long charter flight home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes returned kickoffs 92 and 98 yards for touchdowns and broke a 
44-year-old league record with 304 yards in seven kick returns in the Saints' 
37-34 victory at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time in my years in coaching that two kicks have been 
returned for touchdowns against us in one game," said Ram Coach Chuck Knox, who 
is in his 22nd season as an NFL head coach. "But it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' returns dropped the Rams to 27th in the NFL in kick coverage (25.5 
yards per return) ahead of only Arizona (25.8 yards per return). The Rams are 
tied with Philadelphia at 26th in the league in punt coverage, giving up 12.8 
yards per return. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to the Rams' younger, faster, revamped special teams? Didn't 
Knox, disgusted with the Rams' special teams circus last season, start 
rebuilding after last year? 
</P>
<P>
 In the off-season, Knox released special teams coach Howard Tippett from his 
contract and replaced him with Wayne Sevier, who coached in two Super Bowls 
with the Washington Redskins. Knox also drafted Toby Wright and Keith Lyle and 
traded for Marquez Pope -- all speedy, hard-hitting safeties who could cover on 
kicks and punts. 
</P>
<P>
 The special teams got off to a decent start. Punter Sean Landeta has been 
among the league leaders and is tied for the NFC lead with a 44.7-yard average. 
Johnny Bailey is averaging 21.4 yards on kick returns and 8.9 yards on punt 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 And through the first five games, the coverage teams had not given up the big 
plays they did a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 All was well, until Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave a glimpse of the special teams disaster to come when Green Bay's 
Robert Brooks blew through their punt coverage for an 85-yard touchdown in the 
third quarter, sparking the Packers to a 24-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Hughes, a Pro Bowl selection last year, had a career day 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 On his 92-yard return in the second quarter, Hughes burst up the middle of the 
field, cut outside and outran Todd Lyght and Darryl Henley to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght had an angle on Hughes but was knocked down at the 14 by James Williams. 
Henley missed on a desperation dive at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a question of players not maintaining the proper alignment (on 
coverage)," Knox said. "We had a missed tackle on the second return (the 
98-yarder at the end of the third quarter). We had a clear shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hughes' first return for a touchdown, why did the Rams continue to kick 
the ball to him? Wouldn't it have made more sense to kick away from him or kick 
it short? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say you kick it out of bounds," Knox said. "Then they get the ball at 
their 40. You certainly hope you can cover the second time better than you did 
the first time. And if you try to squib kick it down there, they're going to 
get the ball right back in good field position." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries to two key special teams players also were a factor, Knox said. David 
Lang, the Rams' top coverage player, missed the game with a deep thigh bruise 
and is expected to return next week. Henderson was out because of a groin pull 
he suffered in the Giants' game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has hurt us," Knox said. "Teams have to double-team Lang, and that frees 
up everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injuries and missed tackles on coverages, the Rams did get one 
heads-up play on special teams. Robert Bailey returned a punt an NFL-record 103 
yards in the fourth quarter to cut the Rams' deficit to 37-34 with 4 minutes 8 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Barnhardt's punt landed in the end zone, but the Saints never downed it. 
Live ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Saints began walking off the field, Bailey alertly grabbed the 
ball and took off running. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picking that up in the end zone is something that our people talk about all 
the time," Knox said. "It has been done before in the NFL. That was a heads-up 
play by Bailey."

SHELL-HOSTETLER ARGUMENT WON'T GO AWAY FOR RAIDERS; ANALYSIS: HEAD COACH 
DISPUTES REPORTED RACIAL REMARK TO QUARTERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight days have passed since the Meltdown in Miami, the now all-too-infamous 
Art Shell-Jeff Hostetler confrontation. But the fallout continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Raiders won Sunday, they seem to be at a loss as to how to 
cool the heat from the nationally televised coach-player sideline argument a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it go," quarterback Jeff Hostetler yelled to reporters on Sunday, after 
leading the Raiders past the Atlanta Falcons, 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of going away, things took a new turn over the weekend with the 
subject of racism introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN reported Sunday that Shell, in the heat of battle along those sidelines 
in Miami, directed a racial remark at Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Monday, three independent sources said Shell derisively compared 
Hostetler to former Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder. The versions of what was 
said varied only slightly, and generally had Shell calling Hostetler "another 
white quarterback, just like Schroeder." Some versions had the statement 
sprinkled with expletives. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, asked about it at a news conference, vehemently denied the racial 
remark. Hostetler's agent, Marvin Demoff, when contacted Monday night, said 
Hostetler did not mention any racial remark to him in a series of conversations 
the two had in the 24 hours after the incident a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, questioned specifically about the racial remark after Shell's news 
conference and denial, said, "It's been hashed and rehashed. I want to put it 
behind me." Told that only he could put an end to the speculation over the 
racial remark, Hostetler replied, "I just don't have any more to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell's response in his news conference was both heated and emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said I said that and it's a total lie," he said. "All the people that 
were standing around listening to what was going on know I would never even 
think in those terms. But again, sometimes in this investigative media, some of 
them grab things and throw it out there for whatever reason, try to 
sensationalize things. But no, I would never say anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the charge hurt him, Shell said, "Sure it did. Sure it did. But then 
you've got to understand this society. I don't know where we are going with 
this thing . . . It's not everybody, but (with) some people in the media, (it) 
becomes character assassination. They're trying to tear you down. If I'm a bad 
coach, then say I'm a bad coach. . . . (If you think) I can't do the job, say I 
can't do the job. But to throw something out like that, that's just totally 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "But again, this team knows me. If anybody said, if anybody said that I said 
that, they're liars and I'll say that to their face. I know people that were 
standing around me that were shocked at how anybody could say something like 
that when it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconscionable I would do something like that. In front of my team I 
would do that? Just think about that. Think about how stupid that would be on 
my part if that was on my brain at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell added that nothing that is said in the heat of an argument over football 
strategy should be taken as anything more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing personal about what any coach does in having a discussion 
with a player," Shell said. "There's nothing personal. We're all trying to do 
one thing. We're all trying to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Hostetler's arguments are not so much with Shell, but with the 
play calling of offensive coordinator Tom Walsh. Raider sources say that Shell 
and Hostetler have come to terms with the incident, that Hostetler took Shell's 
remarks not as a racial slur of any kind but as something that did, indeed, 
happen in the heat of battle. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after Hostetler changed two runs called from the press box by Walsh in 
the Miami game to passes that he and Shell argued on the sidelines, in full 
view of a national television audience. Shell yanked off his headset and 
ordered backup Vince Evans into the game in Hostetler's place for the final two 
series of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raiders lost in overtime to the Dolphins, Hostetler talked to Demoff 
by phone several times that Sunday night and again Monday morning. He was still 
so angry Monday, that he was thinking of skipping practice to cool down. 
Instead, he showed up and then watched part of "Monday Night Football" that 
evening with Demoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "His frustrations had only to do with the football situation and his being 
benched and did not have anything to do with anything personal," Demoff said. 
"I talked to Jeff several times on Sunday and Monday and the only thing he 
discussed with me was his anger at being benched regarding his changing of the 
plays. There was no mention of race." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has never had any hints of racial bias in his past.  
</P>
<P>
 Demoff denied speculation that Hostetler was so angry he was looking for a way 
out of his Raider contract, which still has an additional year to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never asked to leave," Demoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Hostetler and Shell can indeed work together, things are not that 
simple in an organization like the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh has a great deal of power in terms of calling the plays. Part of the 
peace conference between Shell and Hostetler involved a discussion of what had 
been perceived as communication problems between Walsh and Shell and the 
offensive unit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report on the Fox network, assistant coach Fred Biletnikoff has 
been designated to attend offensive meetings to smooth over those communication 
problems. Translation: Biletnikoff will serve as a liaison between Shell and 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 So the big issue for the Raiders is not so much an alleged remark made in the 
heat of battle as much as the rift that appears to remain on a team showing 
much success and even more potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Shell said to Hostetler appears to be a symptom of a more serious 
team disease.

REFUNDS WILL BE MINIMAL AS THE NHL CANCELS GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five days and 134 missed games into a labor dispute that shows no signs 
of a resolution, the NHL on Monday canceled four games on the schedule of each 
of its 26 teams. That means many clubs will be obligated to refund only minimal 
amounts of money immediately to ticket holders, while holding money paid for 
future games. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tersely worded news release, the league said the two home games and two 
road games to be lost by each team will not be announced until a starting date 
for the season can be determined. But a starting date cannot be determined 
until the league and its players come closer to agreeing on a new contract, and 
there is no indication that will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the players' 
association, had a surprise meeting Monday in Chicago -- their first of any 
substance in two weeks -- but they made no progress toward an agreement. It was 
learned that each delegation consisted of only four or five people, 
significantly smaller groups than attended previous sessions. Club owners, 
whose criticism of Goodenow fueled acrimony in recent talks, were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesman for the NHL Players Assn., Goodenow said the meeting 
was a general discussion that mentioned future talks but made no commitment to 
convene again. 
</P>
<P>
 The lockout, which has already cost players one paycheck, has begun to hit 
home with front-office employees as well. The Calgary Flames will lay off 11 
full-time staff members on Nov. 1, and all remaining full-time employees face 
20% pay cuts effective that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Those to be laid off are employed principally in concessions and maintenance, 
including the operators of the Olympic Saddledome sound system and score clock. 
The Flames are the first club to take such drastic measures. The Winnipeg Jets 
previously laid off a secretary-receptionist and one of their trainers. Other 
clubs are expected to cut back as well. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL spokesman Arthur Pincus would not say when further cancellations might be 
announced. Most NHL clubs have issued refund policies, which include returning 
money to holders of single-game tickets and crediting season-ticket accounts 
for canceled or rescheduled games and applying that credit to future tickets. 
Spokesmen for the Kings and Mighty Ducks said their previously announced 
policies had not been changed by Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL said it could not specify which games will be canceled because when 
the season begins, the schedule will be redrawn to accommodate divisional and 
conference play. Some games might be rescheduled, rather than canceled, to 
create a balanced schedule. Under normal circumstances, each home game would 
net $250,000-$750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the league and the union are busy talking, but not to one another. 
The NHL is to meet today with off-ice officials, who are entitled to be paid 
through the first 45 days of a work stoppage. The union has called a meeting 
with player agents Thursday in Toronto.

JIM MURRAY: HEISMAN NO CURSE TO BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the winter of 1987, a terrible thing happened to Tim Brown, the football 
player. He won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ordinarily, this is an honor of great magnitude for an athlete. It is 
recognition of a college career spent at its highest level. It is, collegiately 
speaking, the most prestigious award a player can get. It follows you through 
life. It will always identify you. It will be in your obituary, on your 
epitaph. It means that for one brief shining moment, you were the best there 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that was the way it was back in the days when the award was 
instituted, when it went to the likes of Jay Berwanger, Larry Kelley and Clint 
Frank. They accepted their trophy and then went on to careers in business or 
medicine or politics or teaching and wore the Heisman identity like a Phi Beta 
Kappa key. 
</P>
<P>
 But along about that time, pro football had a growth spurt. All of a sudden, 
the Heisman was merely a kind of steppingstone. You hadn't really proved 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days, Heisman winners never went into the pros. First of all, it 
was a $100-a-game lark dabbled in not only by college boys but by ruffians of 
all stripes, some of whom had never been to college, a few of whom had never 
even been to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the pro game proliferated, the college career became prologue. I mean, 
when you think of Joe Montana, do you think of Notre Dame, or of the San 
Francisco 49ers? And, by the way, don't look for Montana on any old Heisman 
ballot. Even in his senior year, he didn't make the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to fathom when the pro career began to be a subtle postscript to the 
Heisman. Nobody noticed, for example, that in 1936, the year Larry Kelley of 
Yale won, a guy named Sammy Baugh was fourth in the voting. Or two years later 
that a guy named Sid Luckman was third. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, it got noticeable. Dick Kazmaier of Princeton won one year. But 
a guy named Hugh McElhenny of Washington finished eighth. And a back named 
Ollie Matson was ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 A guy named Jim Brown got as high as fifth one year. The year John Huarte won 
it, Joe Namath was 11th. But that's nothing. Gale Sayers was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway was no better than second. Eric Dickerson was third. Dan Marino was 
ninth one year. The winner last year is playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman, of course, is what it is: a salute to excellence at the college 
level. But the public usually expects and wants a carry-over. The record shows 
that Heisman winners Doug Flutie, Vinny Testaverde, Gino Torretta, Ty Detmer 
and Andre Ware struggled manfully but never really lived up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Tim Brown came in, the league was in a typical show-me mood. First of 
all, they wondered what he was. At Notre Dame, he caught passes, he returned 
punts and kickoffs, he even carried the ball on some plays. That kind of 
non-specialization long since had gone out of vogue in the pros as impractical. 
It's tough enough to excel at one discipline there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Al Davis ignored the doomsayers. He usually does. He is a big fan 
of the Heisman. After all, he got Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson and Jim Plunkett 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has Brown. Brown found the NFL no harder to beat than Purdue. He got 
open, he ran back kicks, he ran the occasional reverse. He pioneered in making 
the Heisman a bull market again. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was a winner from his first start. The Raiders not only drafted him No. 
1, they fought to keep him last winter when Denver offered him everything this 
side of the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew what they were doing. Brown more or less saved the season for the 
Raiders on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was this: The Raiders, down 2-4 over the season, found 
themselves down, 10-0, in the first quarter of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't even get their hands on the ball until there was only a little 
more than two minutes to play in the first period. If ever there was a time to 
put their paws in the air or to go to desperation, panic-driven, 
finger-pointing moves, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was having none of it. The crowd was growing restive. Boos rent the air 
when quarterback Jeff Hostetler threw an incomplete pass to James Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hostetler threw to Brown. Brown, as usual, caught it in a crowd. Plucked 
it out of the ear of a cornerback. It was good for 15 yards and it moved L.A. 
into Atlanta Falcon territory for the first time. It turned the boos to cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than that, it was a morale builder, a wake-up call. A few plays 
later, L.A. had a touchdown and had turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
 About a minute and a half later, the Raiders got the ball on a half-blocked 
punt. Three plays later, Hostetler threw to -- guess who -- for a touchdown. 
The ubiquitous Mr. Brown. L.A. took the lead for the first time, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders never relinquished it. In the third quarter, Hostetler threw to 
Brown again for 31 yards and a touchdown, which put the game up where the 
Falcons could never reach it. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Brown caught eight passes for 130 yards and two touchdowns. That's a 
pretty typical day for the Raider wide receiver who last year caught 80 passes 
for 1,180 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons had been caught in a Brown-out. That first catch was more than 
just a completion, it was a declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown stood in the locker room, dressing swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weren't you beginning to wonder when the score was 0-10?" he was asked. 
"Weren't you pressing just a bit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown laughed. "Not with 46 minutes left in the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 46 seconds, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first catch put the flicker of hope back in the Raiders' playbook. The 
other seven simply kept the Falcons locked in the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Brown have a yardstick by which he measured a successful game? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown smiled and said, "I just tell the coaches, 'Get me seven catches a game 
and I'll get you two touchdowns.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's a happy ratio. Delivering the football to Brown is the surest path to 
victory. The road to the Super Bowl for the Raiders goes through Brown. Go to 
No. 81 and turn left. 
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble is, if he gets any better, they might ask him to send that 
Heisman Trophy back. He is giving it a good name.

EXPANDED WORLD CUP TOPS FIFA AGENDA; SOCCER: WORLD GOVERNING BODY TO FOCUS ON 
1998 TOURNAMENT, '96 OLYMPICS AND PLANNED PROFESSIONAL LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is decision week for FIFA, and possibly for Major League Soccer, Alan 
Rothenberg's touted but so far unrealized professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of FIFA, the sport's international governing body, are in New York 
for three days of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the agenda is deciding how to allocate eight more places for the 1998 
World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled is a briefing from Olympic officials on the soccer competition 
in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, when both men's and women's tournaments will be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is the possibility that MLS will make the long-awaited 
announcement on its future: Will the league start next spring as promised or 
will it be postponed a year? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, a decision is expected on whether former Argentine star Diego 
Maradona is violating terms of his 15-month drug-related banishment from the 
sport by serving as an unpaid coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But France '98 is the key matter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1980, when the field for the 1982 World Cup in Spain 
was increased from 16 teams to 24, FIFA is having to grapple with demands from 
all six of its member confederations for extra places in the finals.  
</P>
<P>
 When FIFA President Joao Havelange of Brazil announced last year that the 1998 
World Cup would be contested by 32 teams, it set off a flurry of backstage 
maneuvering and politicking that continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe, for example, has demanded 15 places, plus host France, an automatic 
qualifier. That would mean 16 European teams, or half the field. The argument 
is that Europe is where the best soccer is played, as evidenced by the fact 
that seven of the eight World Cup '94 quarterfinalists were European. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe had 13 teams in World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 South America, too, is asking for greater representation. Having had four 
teams in USA '94, it wants five places in France '98, including Brazil, which 
qualifies automatically as the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Americans also have suggested that each of the five major 
confederations (ignoring Oceania) be given one additional place, with the other 
three places being awarded to the first-, second- and third-place finishers in 
1994 -- namely, Brazil, Italy and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa and Asia, meanwhile, are demanding two additional berths each in the 
finals. Africa currently has three, Asia two. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does this leave FIFA? 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, its World Cup Organizing Committee will meet here to decide what 
recommendation it will make to the Executive Committee. On Thursday, the 
Executive Committee will announce its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, Europe will be given three additional places; Asia, Africa, South 
America and CONCACAF (the North and Central American and Caribbean region) will 
each get one, and the eighth will be up for grabs, possibly going to the winner 
of a playoff between teams from Asia and Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Olympic soccer tournaments have generated little controversy, FIFA 
and the International Olympic Committee -- of which Havelange is a member -- 
having earlier agreed that the 16 men's teams each will be allowed to field 
three "over-age" players in what would otherwise be an under-23 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 That opens the way for a limited number of World Cup stars to play, something 
the IOC wanted. In return, the IOC added women's soccer as a medal sport. There 
are no age restrictions on the women's teams and the defending world champion 
United States is the early gold-medal favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Maradona, FIFA seems likely to turn a blind eye to his coaching 
duties at Deportivo Mandiyu, a modest Argentine team headed nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Argentine soccer federation rules, Maradona cannot become a professional 
coach until he completes a two-year coaching course. In the meantime, he is 
serving as an unpaid, albeit outspoken, "assistant" for Deportivo Mandiyu. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA handed Maradona his second 15-month ban after he failed a postgame drug 
test during last summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 As for MLS, Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and head of 
the proposed new league, said an announcement could be made this week, possibly 
during the FIFA meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS has been struggling to get off the ground, with investors showing only 
lukewarm interest. Its fate could hinge on a USSF Board of Directors meeting 
scheduled for Sunday in Los Angeles.

PRO ACTION GOES ON IN COURTS

 The promise of a refund and "Kings dollars" doesn't console you during the NHL 
lockout? Still angry about the baseball strike, even after watching Ken Burns' 
"Baseball" epic? 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans aren't taking these affronts sitting down anymore. They have headed 
for an attorney's office, where they have begun legal action against those who 
have deprived them of their favorite sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Philip Aidikoff, a native Brooklynite who boasts of 
having attended the 1955 World Series, said Monday he had filed a class-action 
lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of Dodger season-ticket holder 
William Schellbach and all other season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed last Thursday, asks for refunds -- plus interest -- for all 
games and for parking fees this season, claiming the Dodgers did not provide 
fans a "meaningful season that culminated in playoffs and the World Series. . . 
. What they got was a season of exhibition games because there were no playoffs 
and no World Series and the (acting) commissioner (Bud Selig) declared for 
record-keeping purposes, there were no National or American League champions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Toronto, Maple Leaf season-ticket holder Alvin Singer filed a suit in 
Ontario Court asking a judge to order the NHL and the NHL Players Assn. back to 
the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist is that Singer didn't ask for damages. The Toronto Star reported 
that Singer simply wanted to force the principals to resume negotiations. He 
said neither side has bargained in good faith because, "negotiating-bargaining 
sessions between the defendants have become briefer and briefer, and the pauses 
have become lengthier and lengthier." 
</P>
<P>
 A league spokesman said he was aware of the suit, but noted that Commissioner 
Gary Bettman had met Monday with Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger spokesman Jay Lucas said he had heard of Aidikoff's suit but said the 
club had not been served with legal papers. Aidikoff said he expected them to 
be served shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Aidikoff, a civil litigator with the firm of Aidikoff and Kesluk, said he was 
asked by friends to file the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fans had a contract with the owners and the owners breached that contract," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody S. Warren, a fan of the Kansas City Royals, filed a similar suit 
against the club last Thursday.

IHL ACQUIRES ITS FIRST NHL PLAYER; HOCKEY: SENATORS' YASHIN SIGNS WITH LAS 
VEGAS THUNDER, EXODUS TO EUROPE CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Alexei Yashin, who led the Ottawa Senators in scoring last season and 
was the runner-up in rookie-of-the-year voting, became the first player under 
NHL contract to sign with an International Hockey League club on Monday when he 
agreed to a one-year deal with the Las Vegas Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 His contract, which includes a clause allowing him to return to Ottawa when 
the NHL season begins, is believed to be worth more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of players heading for Europe also continued. Two Pittsburgh 
Penguins, right wing Jaromir Jagr and center Martin Straka, returned home to 
the Czech Republic to play for Kladno and Skoda Plzen, respectively. King 
center Robert Lang was also said to be seeking a place on a Czech team. Forward 
Dan Quinn of the Kings made his debut Sunday with Zug, of the Swiss Elite 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like most of the players returning to their European teams, it hasn't been 
for the sake of the economic benefits, it's for the opportunity to train under 
game conditions as opposed to sitting and waiting for the labor dispute to 
end," said Michael Barnett, Jagr's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri of the Kings has been in his native Finland since last week, 
playing for the Helsinki-based Jokerit team, and Penguin forward Shawn 
McEachern on Saturday became the first North American-born player to play in 
Europe during the lockout when he played for Kiekko-Espoo in Finland. Boston 
Bruin forward Ted Donato has reportedly agreed to play for TPS Turku in 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also confirmed that center Patrik Carnback of the Mighty Ducks agreed 
to spend the entire season with Frolunda of the Swedish League after that 
league voted not to accept NHL players who intend to return to North America 
when the lockout ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, he has a chance to play hockey and make a very nice living 
and I just don't think the NHL and the NHLPA are about to kiss and make up," 
said Neil Abbott, who represents Carnback. 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful that Yashin's contract will trigger a rush to the IHL, which 
continues to caution its clubs against signing locked-out NHL players. Las 
Vegas, which several weeks ago signed top NHL draft pick Radek Bonk away from 
Ottawa, is an independent club and has more financial resources than its 
rivals. IHL payrolls total about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL players jumping to other leagues must also pay steep insurance costs or 
ask their new clubs to bear that burden. Toronto Maple Leaf defenseman Dave 
Ellett is said to be negotiating with Wichita of the Central Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our teams have indicated they will not be pursuing those players," 
IHL spokesman Tim Bryant said.

CS NORTHRIDGE LINEMAN'S BAIL REDUCTION REQUEST DENIED; JURISPRUDENCE: 
BEAUREGARD, 22, REMAINS IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA JAIL ON A CHARGE OF ATTEMPTED 
MURDER IN SHOOTING. 
</P>

<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard, the Cal State Northridge football player charged with two 
counts of attempted murder, remained in jail after a judge denied his 
attorney's request for lower bail Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned with the defendant getting out," Judge Donald E. Van Luven said 
at the hearing in San Bernardino."It's very scary because he's extremely 
impulsive. . . . We could have a double homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a two-year starter at offensive guard for the Matadors, was booked 
Aug. 29 on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. He was released within 
hours after posting $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County District Attorney's office later increased the 
charge to attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 At his arraignment last week, Beauregard, 22, pleaded not guilty and his bail 
was increased by $100,000 because $15,000 was deemed too low for the new 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's attorney, Grover L. Porter, asked Monday that the judge reduce 
bail to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like bail to be set at a reasonable amount," Porter said. 
"(Beauregard) resides in this area and attends school at Cal State Northridge, 
where he is on a football scholarship."  
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, who has been in custody at the West Valley Detention Center in 
Rancho Cucamonga since his Oct. 19 arraignment, listened from an adjacent glass 
structure. Clad in an orange jail uniform, he walked out slowly with his head 
down after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is charged with shooting his former girlfriend and mother of his 
child, Dunyella Darshell Smith, and her male acquaintance, Von Eric Thompson, 
outside a San Bernardino bar. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled Nov. 4.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; COWBOY LINEMAN HURT IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy Pro Bowl offensive lineman Erik Williams was injured in a car 
accident and probably will be sidelined until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll have the opportunity to play again but I doubt it'll be this year," 
Dallas Coach Barry Switzer said after visiting Williams in the hospital on 
Monday. "In my opinion he's going to need reconstruction of the right knee. 
Thank God he's alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams suffered a sprained right knee in the early morning accident, as well 
as a broken rib, torn ligaments in his left thumb and facial cuts that required 
plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Public Safety said alcohol wasn't a factor in the crash, but 
speed and fatigue were. The department said Williams was driving more than 75 
m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone, and he might be cited for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Larry Allen will replace Williams at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6 foot 6 and 325 pounds, was spared further injury because of the 
air bag in his Mercedes. Williams' car hit a guardrail as he was heading onto 
the tollway from Interstate 635, officials said. He was heading home from a 
dance club, where several players had gone after returning to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate incident, first-round draft pick Shante Carver's truck was found 
overturned on northbound Central Expressway at the exit ramp for westbound 
I-635. Police said the truck hit a guardrail and flipped onto its hood, but the 
driver fled. Authorities don't know whether the defensive end was involved in 
the wreck. Someone identifying himself as Carver called police from a bar at 4 
a.m. reporting his automobile had been stolen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, Troy Aikman, who suffered a concussion in the first 
quarter of a 28-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, said he will play on 
Sunday against Cincinnati. Aikman underwent an MRI that was negative. . . . 
Tight end Jay Novacek probably will sit out the Bengal game because of a 
possibly torn abdominal muscle. . . . Cowboy owner Jerry Jones is pushing a 
plan to expand Texas Stadium to 104,000 seats by 1999, adding a retractable 
roof and replacing the artificial turf with grass. The project would cost $130 
million to $140 million, Jones said. Officials said Jones also wants to build 
an NFL theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bengal Coach Dave Shula said third-stringer Jeff Blake probably will start at 
quarterback against the Cowboys. Starter David Klingler has a sprained ligament 
in his right knee and his status was listed as doubtful. Backup Don Hollas has 
a separated shoulder and will be sidelined at least two weeks. Four free agent 
quarterbacks, including former Bengals Todd Philcox and Erik Wilhelm, will have 
tryouts today. Blake, a third-year player out of East Carolina, has never 
started an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Coach Norv Turner said rookie Gus Frerotte will start at 
quarterback for the second week in a row Sunday against the Eagles, instead of 
rookie Heath Shuler. . . . Dave Brown will keep his job as the Giant starting 
quarterback because his play isn't the only reason the team is riding a 
four-game losing streak, Coach Dan Reeves said. . . . Brown quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde, a day after a concussion forced him to sit out most of the second 
half of a 37-13 victory over Cincinnati, said he will play Sunday at Denver. . 
. . Craig Erickson will start at quarterback for the Buccaneers Sunday against 
the Vikings, Coach Sam Wyche said. Erickson started the first six games of the 
season for the 2-5 Buccaneers, but Wyche started rookie Trent Dilfer in a 41-16 
loss at San Francisco on Sunday. . . . 49er wide receiver John Taylor is 
scheduled to have exploratory arthroscopic surgery today on his right knee. 
Coach George Seifert said the soreness might be related to arthritis, and that 
Taylor could be back within 10 days. With the 49ers on a bye week, that means 
Taylor could play in the team's next game Nov. 6 at Washington or, more 
probably, Nov. 13 against Dallas. . . . Falcon wide receiver Andre Rison told 
The Atlanta Constitution he missed the team bus to the Raider game Sunday 
because Coach June Jones changed its departure time. Jones made him sit out the 
first quarter and said Rison would be fined. . . . Bear running back Tim 
Worley, who missed Saturday's team flight and didn't play in Sunday's 21-16 
loss to the Lions, met with Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt. Worley is a two-time 
offender of the NFL's substance-abuse policy. "This is a little bit more than 
just missing an airplane. (When) it gets resolved, hopefully in the next day or 
two, then I'll comment further." Wannstedt said. The Bears said a broken leg 
will sideline tight end Chris Gedney for the season and that Erik Kramer will 
start next Monday night's game against Green Bay at quarterback if his sprained 
ankle heals. If he isn't 100%, Wannstedt said, Steve Walsh will start.

NOTHING IS SPECIAL ABOUT RAMS' SPECIAL TEAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY RANK NEAR THE 
BOTTOM OF NFL AFTER KICKOFF RETURNS BY SAINTS' HUGHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyrone Hughes celebrated his two NFL kick return records by going dancing at a 
New Orleans nightclub Sunday night, leaving the Rams to ponder their special 
teams gaffes on a long charter flight home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes returned kickoffs 92 and 98 yards for touchdowns and broke a 
44-year-old league record with 304 yards in seven kick returns in the New 
Orleans Saints' 37-34 victory at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time in my years in coaching that two kicks have been 
returned for touchdowns against us in one game," said Ram Coach Chuck Knox, 
who's in his 22nd season as an NFL head coach. "But it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' returns dropped the Rams to 27th in the NFL in kick coverage (25.5 
yards a return) ahead of only the Arizona Cardinals (25.8 yards a return). The 
Rams are tied with the Philadelphia Eagles at 26th in the league in punt 
coverage, giving up 12.8 yards a return.  
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to the Rams' younger, faster, revamped special teams? Didn't 
Knox, disgusted with the Rams' special teams circus last season, start 
rebuilding after last year? 
</P>
<P>
 In the off-season, Knox released special teams coach Howard Tippett from his 
contract and replaced him with Wayne Sevier, who coached in two Super Bowls 
with the Washington Redskins. Knox also drafted Toby Wright and Keith Lyle and 
traded for Marquez Pope -- all speedy, hard-hitting safeties who could cover on 
kicks and punts. 
</P>
<P>
 The special teams got off to a decent start. Punter Sean Landeta has been 
among the league leaders and is tied for the NFC lead with a 44.7-yard average. 
Johnny Bailey is averaging 21.4 yards on kick returns and 8.9 yards on punt 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 And through the first five games, the coverage teams had not given up the big 
plays they did a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 All was well, until Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave a glimpse of the special teams disaster to come when Green Bay's 
Robert Brooks blew through their punt coverage for an 85-yard touchdown return 
in the third quarter, sparking the Packers to a 24-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Hughes, a Pro Bowl selection last season, had a career day 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 On his 92-yard return in the second quarter, Hughes burst up the middle of the 
field, cut outside and outran Todd Lyght and Darryl Henley to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght had an angle on Hughes but was knocked down at the 14 by James Williams. 
Henley missed on a desperation dive at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a question of players not maintaining the proper alignment (on 
coverage)," Knox said. "We had a missed tackle on the second return (the 
98-yarder at the end of the third quarter). We had a clear shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hughes' first return for a touchdown, why did the Rams continue to kick 
the ball to him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say you kick it out of bounds," Knox said. "Then they get the ball at 
their 40. You certainly hope you can cover the second time better than you did 
the first time."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER OUT OF HOSPITAL, APPEARS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller was released from a New Orleans hospital after at CAT 
scan revealed no serious damage from a concussion he suffered in the first 
quarter of the Rams' 37-34 loss to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Miller will undergo an MRI today as a precautionary 
measure in case the CAT scan missed anything. The team has a bye this week, and 
Miller and the rest of the Rams are off until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered the concussion when, after throwing a pass to Howard Griffith, 
he was tackled by linebacker Ernest Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Miler played the rest of the half, throwing a touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce, 
but couldn't remember plays during halftime discussions and had trouble 
handling the noise in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed fine after the play," Knox said. "We talked with him on the 
sidelines. Otherwise, we would have make a change at quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had company in the hospital for a while Sunday -- offensive line coach 
Jim Erkenbeck. Erkenbeck also suffered a concussion, when he was accidentally 
knocked down on the sideline by Saint safety J.J. McCleskey. Erkenbeck was 
released Sunday night and returned home with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Miller) and I shared a CAT scan," Erkenbeck said. "We had a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 Erkenbeck, 61, suffered a sightly separated shoulder, but reported for work 
Monday and said he felt fine, except for a sore leg. "He's a tough ex-Marine, " 
Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erkenbeck said he had trouble remembering what happened Sunday -- riding in 
the ambulance, talking to doctors -- as well as some of what happened before 
the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleskey was forced out of bounds on a return play by the Rams' Steve Israel 
and ran into an unsuspecting Erkenbeck, who went down hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking out to see maybe where we would get the ball, " Erkenbeck said. 
"I wasn't paying attention and not being smart about things. The two players 
who got me were hidden, and I never saw them at all. I didn't even have a 
verbal warning as to what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Tom Newberry and offensive tackle Jackie Slater, who's out because of a 
torn triceps muscle, coached the offensive line in Erkenbeck's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might just go up in the press box (from now on)," Erkenbeck said. "I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game officials ejected Ram receiver Todd Kinchen and Saint safety Vince Buck 
for fighting in the fourth quarter, a call that angered New Orleans Coach Jim 
Mora and didn't please Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a big thing," Knox said. "I think the officials should 
have gone over there and stopped it. I think that (call) was a reaction to what 
happened in the slugfest last week." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Atlanta's Rison and San Francisco's Deion Sanders had remained 
in the game after trading punches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the Rams need the bye week because of injuries, adding that there's 
a chance defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, out two games because of sore 
shoulders, could come back after next week. Slater, cornerback Darryl Henley 
(groin pull) and special teams standout David Lang (deep thigh bruise) also are 
expected back. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bern Brostek could get the cast off his broken right leg as soon as 
today, but Knox said he will be out at least two or three more weeks... MRI 
tests on linebacker Shane Conlan's neck were negative, and doctors prescribed 
rest. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER OUT OF HOSPITAL, APPEARS OK 
</P>

 Quarterback Chris Miller was released from a New Orleans hospital after at CAT 
scan revealed no serious damage from a concussion he suffered in the first 
quarter of the Rams' 37-34 loss to the Saints on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Miller will undergo an MRI today as a precautionary 
measure in case the CAT scan missed anything.The team has a bye this week, and 
Miller and the rest of the Rams are off until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered the concussion when, after throwing a pass to Howard Griffith, 
he was tackled by linebacker Ernest Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had company in the hospital for a while Sunday -- offensive line coach 
Jim Erkenbeck. Erkenbeck also suffered a concussion, when he was accidentally 
knocked down on the sideline by Saint safety J.J. McCleskey. Erkenbeck was 
released Sunday night and returned home with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Miller) and I shared a CAT scan," Erkenbeck said. "We had a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 Erkenbeck reported for work Monday and said he felt fine, except for a sore 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game officials ejected Ram receiver Todd Kinchen and Saint safety Vince Buck 
for fighting in the fourth quarter, a call that angered New Orleans Coach Jim 
Mora and didn't please Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a big thing," Knox said. "I think the officials should 
have gone over there and stopped it. I think that (call) was a reaction to what 
happened in the slugfest last week." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Atlanta's Rison and San Francisco's Deion Sanders had remained 
in the game after trading punches. MIKE REILLEY

UPON FURTHER REVIEW, CHATMAN HAD 414 YARDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a second look, Costa Mesa running back Charles Chatman's attack on the 
Orange County rushing record fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman gained between 408 and 415 yards, according to various newspaper 
accounts, Friday in Costa Mesa's 28-7 victory over Aliso Niguel.The single-game 
rushing record was set by Dana Hills' Jim Gleed, who rushed for 418 in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa coaches reviewed the videotape over the weekend, and Coach Myron 
Miller said they had figured Chatman for 420 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Monday, Miller allowed a media representative to review the videotape 
and come up with Chatman's official total: 43 carries for 414 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure is second in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 One statistic that might have doomed Chatman's record attempt was fumbles -- 
he had three. MARTIN HENDERSON

BEST PAL SUPPLEMENTED TO BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm naive, or even half-stupid," owner John Mabee said Monday after 
paying $120,000 of the $360,000 that is needed to make his 6-year-old gelding, 
Best Pal, eligible for the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs 
on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time, Mabee is paying a supplementary fee to get Best Pal into a 
Breeders' Cup race. He put up $120,000 in 1990, when Best Pal ran sixth in the 
Juvenile and earned $10,000. Last year, after a $360,000 payment was made, Best 
Pal earned nothing for his 10th-place finish in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The $240,000 balance on this year's payment is due Nov. 2, when entries will 
be drawn for the seven Breeders' Cup races. Breeders' Cup supplementary fees 
are 12% of a race's purse and are required of horses that weren't nominated for 
$500 during the year in which they were foaled. 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the Classic is worth $1.56 million. Best Pal, who has earned 
slightly more than $5 million, could move closer to the first two horses on the 
money list by winning. Alysheba, who won the Classic at Churchill Downs in 
1988, is No. 1 with $6.6 million and John Henry is next at $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving the horse a shot (at the record) has always been a factor," Mabee 
said. "He's training well and deserves a chance. Last year, he didn't come up 
to the Classic just right, and there was a lot of thought about scratching him 
a couple of days before the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal has won one of five starts this year, and finished third in his last 
race, the Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park on Sept. 24. Best Pal will be 
making his first start at Churchill Downs since his second-place finish behind 
Strike The Gold in the 1991 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mabee's understanding Chris McCarron would accept the assignment in the 
Breeders' Cup.

KEATING AIDE GETS PROBATION, $3-MILLION FINE; SAVING & LOAN; COURTS: JUDY 
WISCHER'S LENIENT SENTENCE IS THE RESULT OF HER COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES IN 
THE INVESTIGATION OF THE COLLAPSE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS & LOAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy J. Wischer, once the top aide to former Lincoln Savings & Loan operator 
Charles H. Keating Jr., was put on probation Monday for three years and ordered 
to pay $3.5 million in restitution for her role in the 1989 collapse of the 
Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer's sentencing -- lenient because of her cooperation with authorities -- 
ends the long investigation and the trial court proceedings against those 
responsible for the thrift industry's most notorious failure. Lincoln's 
collapse is expected to cost taxpayers $3.4 billion, making it the nation's 
second-biggest savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bankruptcy of the S&L's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. in Phoenix, wiped out nearly 22,000 investors, most of them elderly 
Southern Californians. The investors lost a total of more than $285 million, 
though they eventually recovered about 70% of that by filing civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement Monday to U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, 
Wischer apologized for hurting others, particularly the small investors who 
bought risky American Continental bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I'd like to say I'm very sorry," she said, her voice trembling. "I 
regret the losses, especially to the bondholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer praised Wischer for cooperating with federal prosecutors and the FBI 
and said that her testimony at Keating's federal trial two years ago was 
crucial to convicting the former Arizona businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think the case could have been prosecuted without you," said 
Pfaelzer, who presided over the trial. "I thought that when I was listening to 
the testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer not only cooperated with federal prosecutors, she helped regulatory 
agencies in their effort to seek recoveries from others at American Continental 
and at thrifts in Colorado and Texas that did business with Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with liquidating failed 
thrifts, told Pfaelzer in a letter that Wischer's cooperation was a 
"substantial factor" in recovering $80 million from lawyers, accountants and 
other professional who helped Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she provided information on Lincoln's deals with thrifts in 
Arizona, Colorado and Texas. Besides helping the RTC, she also traveled to 
Washington to help the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in various investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael C. Manning, a Phoenix lawyer who headed the RTC's recovery efforts, 
said he had thought when Wischer, Keating and others were first indicted three 
years ago that Wischer had helped to design the frauds. But as he delved 
further into documents, he said, he realized that she did not plan any of the 
scams. It was a family fraud, Manning told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Keating's family worked at the company. His son and another family 
member also were convicted on related charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Assistant U.S. Atty. Alice C. Hill and defense attorney Donald C. 
Randolph had asked the court to put Wischer on probation. She had faced up to 
15 years in prison for her 1992 guilty plea to two bank fraud charges and a 
securities fraud charge. As part of a plea bargain, she agreed to testify 
against Keating and to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting information from Wischer took a long time because there were so many 
deals and because she didn't realize herself what information was important, 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were involved with so much that downloading information couldn't be done 
efficiently," said one lawyer involved with the process. "She didn't even know 
she had such interesting and useful information. New matters would come to 
light, not because she had been withholding information but because nobody ever 
asked her about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer, though, was no help to state prosecutors. She did not plead to six 
counts of state securities fraud until after Keating was convicted in state 
court. Under her state plea bargain, she will be given an identical probation 
term to be served concurrently with her federal term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer, 46, who lives in Phoenix with her two daughters, would not talk 
publicly after the brief court hearing. Randolph said later that she was 
"pleased and relieved" about her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, 70, whose arrogance and outspokenness made him the national symbol 
for greed and excess in the thrift industry, is serving concurrent sentences 
totaling 12 years, seven months for his racketeering, conspiracy and fraud 
convictions in state and federal courts.

RISE FROM ASHES IN LAGUNA PAINFUL; REBUILDING: DETERMINED EFFORT BRINGS HOME OF 
TWO FIRE VICTIMS NEAR COMPLETION WHILE MOST OWNERS STILL STRUGGLE THROUGH 
PERMIT PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Homeowner Christopher Tower is on the prowl by 7:30 on most weekday mornings 
as crews work on the custom-designed house that will replace the home he lost 
last year when a firestorm roared up a canyon and into his Mystic Hills 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old accountant says he has a great contractor and that the crews 
are doing a wonderful job. But that's his house being built on Pacific Avenue, 
and Tower wants it to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 So he spoke out when they forgot to pour a concrete step linking the kitchen 
and utility room. He raised a protest when carpenters inadvertently framed part 
of a bedroom wall that was supposed to remain open. "No one," Tower said, "is 
as intimate with the project as I am. It's as if I'm doing this job. I know 
these plans inside and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower's 2,000-square-foot home is one of dozens now under construction in 
Mystic Hills, a neighborhood that was decimated by wildfire last Oct. 27. With 
his new home's foundation poured and framing nearly completed, Tower and 
companion Randy Hupp hope to move back into their home on March 31 -- months 
before most other homeowners will even clear the complex municipal permit 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower, whom friends describe as a man constantly in motion, complains that the 
rebuilding process is achingly slow. Last spring, he grudgingly abandoned a 
pledge to be back in his own home within a year of the fire, which would be by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the home takes shape, Tower and Hupp, 42, are spending more and more time 
at the site. "Watching it go up is addictive," Tower said. "It's been a 
yearlong process and we've lived it every day. But now I'm really comfortable 
with what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they did was agree to let a reporter chronicle major steps of 
rebuilding the house. They also discovered the need to balance the 
time-consuming tasks against the demands of their personal and professional 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Those demands prompted Tower to change his work habits -- he has cut back the 
time he spends on the job. Hupp, who owns a rehabilitation company, was forced 
to lay off a third of his employees after the Northridge earthquake destroyed 
one of the convalescent homes where it provided physical therapy. Causing 
further stress, Hupp had to start chemotherapy treatment for a recently 
diagnosed cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower, ever the optimist, acknowledged the pressures. "Sometimes," he said, "I 
wonder when does it all get to be too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Hupp remains upbeat: "I'm physically and emotionally strong. . . . I'm 
positive that (the cancer) will be in remission by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower was all smiles as he toured the new home on a recent Saturday morning. 
Standing in what will be the kitchen when construction is complete, a hole in a 
wall that will eventually be a window showcases a postcard-perfect view of the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually very positive, very happy," he said. "I know that we're going to 
end up with a new house, a better house, the house of our dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower's hard-charging style has helped speed up his rebuilding project in a 
neighborhood still marked with scorched slabs, vacant lots and empty dreams. 
But such progress doesn't surprise the accountant's family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach general contractor Brock Lyster, who is coordinating the building 
of the house, has dubbed Tower "the grinder."  
</P>
<P>
 "He can be very aggressive," said Laguna Beach resident Jill Sloan, who has 
known Tower for four years. "I consider him to be a very good friend, but 
sometimes, and he knows it, he can be brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower used the force of his personality last Oct. 27 to persuade Sloan to 
rescue his two cocker spaniels locked in his back yard. When Tower reached 
Sloan on her car phone, she figured the accountant was overreacting; news 
reports indicated the fire wasn't a major threat. But Sloan gathered the dogs 
and even briefly considered the idea of carting some of Tower's other 
belongings to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sloan walked out of Tower's front door to head back down the hill to her 
own home, all hell broke loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house across the street was on fire, the house next door was on fire, 
there was incredibly thick smoke," Sloan said. Visibility was so poor that she 
could only drive 10 m.p.h. down Skyline Drive with the headlights on and the 
windshield wipers going. Flames surrounded her car. 
</P>
<P>
 The terror-filled trip to the bottom of Skyline Drive ended as Sloan's car 
bumped into the back of a firetruck. Moments later Sloan, who is comptroller at 
Citation Builders in Tustin, used her car phone to tell Tower that his home had 
been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire crews fought throughout the night to contain the blaze, but reality hit 
hard when a television crew broadcasting from the Mystic Hills neighborhood 
showed an eerie landscape punctuated by chimneys, water heaters and burned-out 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the panic subsided," Tower said, "we called the insurance agent and told 
him we saw it on TV, burning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower set the tone for his rebuilding plan at a Bullocks department store in 
Newport Beach that weekend. With charge card in hand, he promptly replaced his 
entire wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting over wasn't as easy for Hupp, who, friends said, prefers to move at a 
more deliberate pace. While Tower viewed the fire as a "chance to build a dream 
house," Hupp fretted that there wasn't enough time to plan properly for a new 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Designing a new home "is something you'd give your eyeteeth for if you had the 
time," said Hupp, who has carefully searched for duplicates of his favorite 
ties, sweaters, suits and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Their personality difference served the two men well as they assembled a small 
army of insurance agents, contractors, geologists, bureaucrats, architects and 
designers. Tower has pressed forward at every turn while Hupp has generally 
moved more cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been interesting to see how different individuals handle the stress," 
said Sloan, whose own house wasn't damaged. She has watched several Laguna 
Beach fire victims attempt to put their lives back together. "Chris has a 
higher level of survival skills than just about anyone I know. If anyone comes 
out of this OK, it will be Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fire hasn't dulled Tower's sharp sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for directions to the Pacific Avenue home, just days after the fire, 
Tower responded: "It's the fifth home, make that lot, on the left." He later 
observed that the blaze "has opened up the ocean view considerably, and you now 
get cellular telephone coverage throughout Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower and Hupp had little to smile about, though, on the day after the fire 
when they made their way past curious onlookers, television cameras and police 
checkpoints to inspect the remains of the home they purchased in 1987 for 
$289,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hupp picked through the ruins and salvaged a charred page from a Chopin piano 
score from Tower's sheet music collection. Tower uncovered the broken remains 
of an Eskimo carving that he had given Hupp as a birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
 Little remained of the 2,000-square-foot home other than the front foyer. A 
brass light fixture escaped unharmed but the fire consumed art lithographs, a 
grand piano, an extensive sheet music collection and all of their financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The old house was, at heart, a tract home that Tower and Hupp had renovated 
and redecorated in recent years. Like most homes in the neighborhood, it 
enjoyed tremendous views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The new house began to take shape several months later on Laguna Beach 
architect Morris Skenderian's drawing board. At the outset, however, Skenderian 
was not sure whether Tower and Hupp could come to agreement on a design. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher and Randy had two different perspectives," Skenderian said. 
"Christopher wanted something more contemporary while Randy wanted the more 
traditional Mediterranean style. I think what we ended up with is a nice 
blend." 
</P>
<P>
 Skenderian listened patiently for two hours during an initial meeting last 
November. After Tower and Hupp described their visions of a dream house, 
Skenderian rolled up an old blueprint of the house that had been destroyed and 
gently asked if he could "take the liberty" of providing Hupp and Tower with 
some new design ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most clients are not as involved as Christopher and Randy," said Skenderian, 
who is designing homes for about 17 fire victims. "We've tried our best to work 
with all of them, to help them make decisions that they've never had to make 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 One such decision was where to live while their new home was being designed 
and built. Unlike some who were forced to rent in neighboring cities, Tower and 
Hupp relocated to a small bungalow on Brooks Street, less than two miles from 
their Mystic Hills lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebuilding process can take a toll of even the most optimistic person. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a hellish day," Tower said on Nov. 5, 1993, after a string of 
fire-related meetings. "I got a lot accomplished but I didn't get back to work 
until 3:30 this afternoon." Two days later, after another lengthy meeting, 
Tower complained that "I'm pretty stressed. There's too much going on." 
</P>
<P>
 More worries were ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rain in early November created mudslides throughout Laguna Beach, 
sparking fears of yet another disaster. Homeowners also were stunned to learn 
that geologists had found evidence of an ancient landslide sitting beneath one 
part of Mystic Hills. Tower's lot wasn't affected by the suspected slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still walking around in a daze," Tower said earlier this year as 
homeowners began accumulating permits required for rebuilding. "They're not 
used to all this confrontation. But the fact is, there is daily confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower said he relied upon a strong network of family, friends and business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
 A commercial builder recommended Lyster, a general contractor known for 
building quality homes in Laguna Beach. A college friend who had worked as an 
insurance adjuster briefed Tower on insurance company disaster guidelines. A 
relative of Tower tutored them on how to monitor general contractors and a 
friend introduced them to Skenderian. 
</P>
<P>
 To decipher arcane financial documents generated by his insurance company, 
Tower turned to his accounting skills: "I don't know how someone without my 
background would deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower turned to his mother and father, a psychologist and psychiatrist, 
respectively, for help in managing personal relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said to pick one or two people to help you . . . that you can't have 
dozens of people trying to help out," Tower said late last year. "We've had so 
many calls from people wanting to help. Last night, we got a card from a friend 
who was hurt because we hadn't allowed him to help." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tower also has benefited from a bit of serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most homeowners, Tower had had taken few photographs to document the 
nearly $100,000 in improvements that were made to the 30-year-old tract home. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who cleaned the house surprised Tower several weeks after the fire 
by volunteering a packet of recent photographs that she had taken to show her 
family the beautiful home where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came over very meekly one day and asked if we wanted these pictures," 
Tower said. "The way she took them turned out to be as if they were for 
Architectural Digest." 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs served Tower and Hupp well during meetings with insurance 
company representatives. "It's all a memory game," Tower said. "They want to 
know everything that was in the house. You have to remember every little nook 
and cranny . . . did you have Art Deco triple crown molding!or single crown?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the homes that burned in Mystic Hills were tract houses that had been 
renovated or expanded over the years. But the fire erased that heritage and 
those homeowners who decided to rebuild are creating an eclectic blend of 
modern and traditional homes. Most won't be dramatically bigger because the 
lots are relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really neat," Skenderian said. "It's gone from a simple tract 
development to custom homes that have a lot of different things to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one resident made it clear that the radically different designs 
aren't entirely welcome. One morning, the words "ugly house" were scrawled on a 
sign in front of a distinctive home now going up on Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to avoid that kind of animosity, Tower and Hupp said they carefully 
negotiated with neighbors, who also were proposing new designs. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor lodged "a violent complaint" about the new home's design, arguing 
that it would wreck his view, Tower said. "I thought there was no way they'd 
ever approve it with that kind of a protest . . . but I was very pleasantly 
surprised when they did." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Tower and Hupp are awaiting the day when they can move in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we rose to the occasion," Hupp said. "Christopher is the kind of 
person who'll be able to live with the little mistakes we've made. He's not 
going to worry about a misplaced window or some slight imperfection."

T-BOND YIELDS ABOVE 8% SEND STOCKS TUMBLING; ECONOMY: THE RATE FOLLOWS WEEKS OF 
BEARISHNESS. WORRIES PERSIST ABOUT INFLATION, SUPPLY OF NEW BONDS AND WEAK 
DOLLAR.

<P>
 Treasury bond yields surged above 8% for the first time in 2 1/2 years Monday, 
sending stocks tumbling amid persistent concern about inflation, an upcoming 
supply of new bonds and a weak dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's push through the psychologically key 8% yield follows weeks of 
bearishness in the Treasury market. Worried about the timing of the Federal 
Reserve Board's next rate hike, most investors and traders have had little 
appetite for buying bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield ended the day at 8.04%, up from Friday's 7.97%. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, closed down 23/32 point, or $7.19 
per $1,000 in face value. The last time the bond yield was that high was on 
April 29, 1992, when it closed at 8.06%. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising interest rates wiped out gains from an early buying spree sparked 
by surprisingly strong third-quarter profits by Caterpillar Inc. leaving the 
Dow Jones industrial average down 36.0 points at 3,855.30. The day's slide 
brought the blue-chip indicator's three-day losses to 81 points. The broader 
market also fell sharply with declining issues outnumbering advances by about 
13 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 After jumping more than half a percentage point in the last seven weeks, the 
market attempted to push bond yields above 8% several times in the past week. 
But the yield closed just below that level as reluctant traders and investors 
shied away at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 But about midmorning Monday, the yield shot above 8% in a flurry of heavy 
selling, according to Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson 
Financial Services in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury market's skittishness follows recent reports that economic 
strength continues unabated. A robust economy raises the likelihood that the 
Fed will raise interest rates again to quell inflation, which tends to spiral 
upward when the economy expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders are concerned that word of the economy's strength will be 
underlined this week by data, including September consumer confidence, durable 
goods and third-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 If the reports show more strength, traders believe, a rate hike is likely by 
the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making panel in mid-November. Higher rates 
depress the value of bonds already in circulation, so the prospect gives 
traders little reason to buy Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices dropped in tandem with a sharp decline in the dollar's value 
against the German mark, reinforcing a recent trend of parallel movements in 
the Treasury and foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, bond investors feared that a weak dollar would aggravate 
inflation by driving up the price of imports into the United States. In 
addition, a lower dollar tends to discourage foreign investors from buying 
dollar-denominated investments such as Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished in New York at 1.494 German marks, down from 1.499 on 
Friday. It also fell against the Japanese yen, closing at 97.13 yen, down from 
97.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the dollar's weakness alone is not likely to force the Fed to 
raise short-term interest rates, but it caused added concern among investors 
already jittery over inflation, since imports would cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks moved higher early in the session, encouraged by strong 
corporate earnings reports from Caterpillar, Black & Decker, U.S. Healthcare 
and others. But as interest rates pushed sharply upward, stocks also tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week the market stared 4,000 (on the Dow) in the eye and blinked. Now 
it's coming back down," said Walter Revis, market analyst at Principal 
Financial Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one more thing for them to be a little more nervous about," said 
Thomas Kirkenmeier, vice president at Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 With interest rates rising, investors are wondering if the economic recovery 
may have peaked and corporate earnings forecasts for 1995 will have to be 
revised lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index fell 2.09 points to 253.50. The Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index fell 4.06 points to 460.83 and the Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller companies fell 4.17 to 761.21. At the American Stock Exchange, 
the market value index lost 2.63 to 453.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the day's losers. American 
International Group fell 1 1/4 to 90 1/4 and Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
lost 1 7/8 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar earnings were a better-than-expected $1.20 a share and the stock 
rose 1 7/8 to 58 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Black & Decker earnings were 31 cents a share compared to an estimate by 
private economists of 28 cents. The stock rose 5/8 to 23 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings for U.S. Healthcare, listed on the Nasdaq market, were 63 cents a 
share, compared to an estimate of 59 cents. The stock rose 1 3/4 to 47. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airborne Freight dropped 6 3/8 to 19 1/8 after its third-quarter earnings of 
38 cents a share fell under Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stratus Computer jumped 1 3/4 to 36 1/4 after it posted a sharp rise in 
third-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer rose 5/8 to 73 7/8 after telling analysts it will have six drugs in 
Phase III clinical trials by the end of the year and expects to have a company 
record of 14 new chemical entities in advanced Phase III trials next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed in overseas trading. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average 
ended down 46.71 points at 19,852.37. Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average rose 
3.16 points to close at 2,025.38, while London's Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 3.7 to 3,029.1. Mexico City's Bolsa index closed 53.24 points 
lower at 2,633.62.

PLATINUM SOFTWARE OFFERS GOOD NEWS AFTER 2 BAD YEARS; RECOVERY: THE 
IRVINE-BASED FIRM'S COMMON STOCK RISES AFTER A QUARTERLY PROFIT. THREE NEW 
BOARD MEMBERS ARE ANNOUNCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. said Monday that income from a delayed $3-million 
order enabled it to post earnings of $51,000 for its latest fiscal quarter -- 
its first profit after two years of multimillion-dollar losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old accounting software maker also announced the appointment of 
three new directors, enlarging its board to eight members as part of a 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum has been striving to recover from the resignations of its founder and 
three top officers earlier this year in conjunction with the revelation that 
the company overstated its revenue by $10 million for a 15-month period in its 
fiscal 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stock analysts dropped their coverage of the company earlier this year 
because of its problems. Many of those reached Monday would not comment on the 
new developments, citing unfamiliarity with the company's condition now. 
</P>
<P>
 But J. Neil Weintraut, an analyst with San Francisco high-technology 
investment specialists Hambrecht & Quist, called Monday's announcements "a 
milestone for the company. It is getting back on track with a clear mission and 
operating structure that matches its size and a committed and highly skilled 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors also greeted Monday's news enthusiastically, trading 462,600 shares 
of the Irvine-based software company's common stock -- nearly twice the daily 
average of the past month. The price was up as much as 75 cents a share before 
retreating a bit to close at $13.875, up 39 cents, in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a profit for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 30, 
Platinum reported revenue of $14.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 
from $11.4 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also reported that its operating expenses dropped significantly, 
to $9.8 million from $11.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had posted a $59 million loss for its fiscal 1994 and a $17 
million loss in its fiscal 1993. For its first quarter last year, Platinum had 
a loss of $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 New directors elected in an Oct. 17 board meeting were C. Vincent Prothro, 
chairman and chief executive of Dallas Semiconductor Co. in Dallas; Waldo (Jay) 
J. Richards, senior vice president of product operations for Mentor Graphics in 
Portland, Ore., and Richard C. Goeglein, a founder of Gaming Associates, the 
Napa Valley casino management company. 
</P>
<P>
 Goeglein also serves as a director of Boomtown Hotels and Casinos, San 
Francisco-based Hornblower Dining Yachts Inc. and AST Research Inc. AST, an 
Irvine computer maker, recently revealed troubles of its own when it announced 
that it expects a $40-million quarterly loss and will close its Fountain Valley 
manufacturing plant and lay off 440 workers there as part of a worldwide staff 
reduction of 700 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The three new directors will be nominated for reelection to full terms at the 
company's annual meeting Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, the turnaround specialist installed as Platinum's chairman 
and chief executive officer after the April resignations of founder Gerald R. 
Blackie and other top officers, said in a statement Monday that the three new 
directors are longtime associates. Platinum Software's First Quarter 
</P>
<P>
 Profit for the first quarter of fiscal 1995, ended Sept. 30, totaled $51,000, 
contrasted with a restated net loss of nearly $4 million for the year-earlier 
quarter. Figures in thousands of dollars, except per-share data: 04,21,09,09,10

DISNEY YIELDS TO UNION ON SUBCONTRACTING FOOD WORK; LABOR: BUT THE THEME PARK 
MANAGEMENT SAYS IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REPLACE EMPLOYEES WITH OUTSIDE 
COMPANIES IN THE FUTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Relenting to union pressure as it enters the final week of contract 
negotiations, Disneyland has withdrawn its previous plan to subcontract 
cafeteria-service work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim amusement park's management pulled back after Hotel and Restaurant 
Employees Union Local 681 waged a publicity campaign that began during the 
summer and threatened a boycott, saying the subcontracting would cost its 
members 100 good-paying jobs to a food vendor bringing its own crew of 
minimum-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the union food-service employees make $9.15 to $11.05 an hour, with 
some earning as much as $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous victory" for the union, said Angela Keefe, president of 
Santa Ana-based Local 681, which represents more than 700 food-service workers 
at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park, whose contract with the union expires Sunday, previously 
denied that it had any firm plans to farm out such work. But in a letter to the 
union late last week, Disney Vice President David Cox said the company decided 
against subcontracting "because this issue is not currently ripe for further 
management consideration and because you seem to believe it is an obstacle to 
successful conclusion of our current negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who was unavailable for comment Monday, nonetheless maintained in his 
letter that the company has the right to subcontract out any work and may do so 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 681 has contested that right in a complaint filed with the National 
Labor Relations Board, and the union is now trying to obtain contract language 
that would prevent Disneyland from making such a move.  
</P>
<P>
 But the issue still remains on the table during the contract talks, which 
began in early September. The two sides are meeting daily this week in lengthy 
sessions that are scheduled to culminate with union workers voting Sunday on 
Disneyland's final offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unresolved are the company's proposal for a two-tier wage structure and 
changes in tip credits and benefits for certain temporary employees, according 
to a flyer passed out to union members at Disneyland over the weekend. The 
union said it has reached a tentative agreement with management on overtime, 
split shifts and seniority rights, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland spokesman John McClintock would not comment Monday about 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, Orange County's largest private employer, has long employed union 
workers, and there has not been a major strike at the park in a decade. But 
subcontracting has recently come between management and some unions at the 
park, and that has put workers on guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 681 members are scheduled to vote through the day Sunday at the Grand 
Hotel, across the street from Disneyland. Union Talks at Disneyland 
</P>
<P>
 The Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681, which represents 700 
food-service workers at Disneyland, is in the final week of contract 
negotiations with the theme park. Issues in the talks: 
</P>
<P>

MANUFACTURERS GETTING BUSIER, REPORT FINDS ; ECONOMY: STUDY OF 80 PURCHASING 
MANAGERS INDICATES GREATER CONFIDENCE IN ECONOMIC CLIMATE, DESPITE RECENT BAD 
NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Manufacturers in Orange County had one of their best post-recession quarters 
in the July-September period with increased productivity and a decline in 
layoffs, according to a report issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, from Chapman University's quarterly purchasing manager survey, 
comes at a time when a number of negative economic signals have sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment for September rose slightly to 6% from 5.9% in August, largely 
because of computer manufacturing declines, and two major companies -- 
GM-Hughes Electronics and AST Research -- have said they will shutter Orange 
County facilities over the next year. Closures of Hughes' Fullerton research 
and manufacturing campus and AST's Fountain Valley computer factory will remove 
more than 6,000 jobs from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those somber notes, manufacturing industry executives who participated 
in the Chapman University survey said that they think the climate for 
manufacturing over the next six months and beyond is fairly positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I saw in the written comments, they expect things to be just as 
good in the next two quarters," said Raymond Sfeir, the Chapman economist who 
designed and conducts the survey for the private school's Center for Economic 
Research. "I don't think the AST and Hughes situations can turn things back in 
the county or the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Sfeir's index of the Orange County manufacturing industry's confidence in the 
economy is based on responses from purchasing managers at 80 companies that 
make computer and electronics equipment, industrial machinery, medical 
equipment and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing managers are questioned because they are on the front line, 
responsible for knowing where the economy is heading, ordering the factories' 
materials and planning production levels to meet rising or shrinking demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey measures changes in local manufacturing production, inventories, 
new orders and the purchases and prices of raw materials, as well as the speed 
with which suppliers deliver raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Readings above 50 show degrees of growth while those below 50 measure 
contraction in the industry during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third quarter, Sfeir reported an index of 61.2, up from 58.6 in the 
second quarter. It is only the fourth time since the survey began in 1988 -- 
and the second time since the recession of 1990-91 -- that the index has topped 
61. Most recently, Sfeir reported a 61.9 measurement for the fourth quarter of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rating has bounced up and down since the recession began in July, 
1990, Sfeir said that he is heartened because the index has not dipped below 50 
for four consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 That manufacturers reported much slower delivery of raw materials in the third 
quarter was a major factor in the index growth for that period, Sfeir said. 
</P>
<P>
 It usually is good news for the economy when such deliveries slow down, 
because it means the suppliers are busy and can't respond as quickly as when 
the economy is weaker and their trucks are idle due to a lack of orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter survey showed that 35.8% of the respondents reported slower 
deliveries, up from 29% in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 One other significant factor in the third-quarter growth, Sfeir said, was 
rising commodity prices. Almost 59% of the purchasing managers said they had to 
pay more for raw material than in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means demand is up," Sfeir said. On the negative side, it also means 
that prices of finished goods are likely to rise to help cover the higher 
prices of raw materials, and that feeds inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing managers also said that inventories of raw materials were shrinking 
as production levels firmed up -- only 20.9% reported production dropping while 
27.8% said it stayed the same and 51.3% said levels grew. In the second 
quarter, 22.3% said production shrank and 20.4% said levels were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 As new orders rose and inventories dropped, 46.2% of Orange County's 
manufacturers stepped up purchases of raw materials, compared to 43.5% in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this year, Sfeir has been charting employment changes at 
manufacturing companies and for the third quarter said that 19.8% of the 
companies reported declining employment, compared with 25.7% in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The employment statistics are not being used yet to help compile the overall 
index of economic confidence, because at least a full year of comparison is 
needed, Sfeir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment continued to fall in the high-technology industries surveyed, 
particularly those affected by federal defense spending cuts, and price wars 
and supply shortages in the computer industry, Sfeir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, employment levels largely remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Employment Development Department reported last week that Orange 
County manufacturing businesses employed 206,100 workers in September, down 
less than 1% from 207,900 in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1990, a month after the recession began, manufacturers in Orange 
County employed 257,300 workers -- and that was down from 259,400 the previous 
year. Better Business 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's manufacturing industries as a whole showed marked gains in 
Chapman University's Purchasing managers Composite Index. The index gauges 
industry activity and managers' confidence in the economy. A level of 50 or 
more indicates growth; less than 50, decline. Third-quarter figures: 1994 61.2.

BREIFCASE: TOURISM AND TRAVEL; O.C. WESTIN HOTEL SONS GET THEIR CRACK AT GOING 
TO PARENTS' JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 30 boys learned Monday how difficult it can be to operate a major hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were spending a day with their parents for "Take Our Sons to Work 
Day" at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, learning everything from how to 
fill out a job application to pitching the perfect pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the idea from 'Take Our Daughters to Work Day,"' a national event that 
celebrated its second anniversary earlier this year, said Wayne Bodington, the 
hotel's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he brought his 9-year-old daughter to work then, and found out his 
11-year-old son wished he could go, too. So he created the special day for 
boys. "It's exciting for them and it's exciting for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys started the day with the director of human resources, learning how to 
apply for a job. They split into two groups and went on thorough tours of the 
hotels, both the public and work areas. Then they joined the pastry chef in 
making pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, the group broke up and the boys joined their parent, or 
another worker, as they went about their regular tasks at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing sons to work isn't the only innovation being tried by Bodington. He 
has also introduced ethnic days, in which hotel workers bring foods and 
artifacts that celebrate their national origins. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the hotel has decorated the employee cafeteria for days celebrating 
Mexico, the Philippines and Eastern Europe. Next will be Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to recognize the cultural and ethnic differences" among the 
hotel's 300 full- and part-time workers, Bodington said.

 Disneyland Woos Latinos: Disneyland has been continually working to capture a 
larger share of Southern California's large and growing Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
 To further that goal, the park today is going to be the site of a private 
taping of a Christmas television special featuring well-known Latino 
artists.The special is slated to be shown next month on the Univision 
Spanish-language television network. 
</P>
<P>
 The taping, scheduled after the park's normal business hours, will feature 
artists like percussionist Tito Puente and singer Jose Feliciano. It will also 
include soap star Ricky Martin, Chayanne and Luis Enrique. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have a receptive audience: a group of about 300 was selected in 
advance to watch the taping from those who won tickets through radio station 
promotions.

 Hotels Try Discounts: Major local hotels are discounting rooms to leisure 
travelers for fall, but using different gimmicks to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott is offering weekend packages through Dec. 31 as low as $69 a night, 
including breakfast for two, at 14 Southland hotels including six in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests who charge their stay with a Visa card can earn credits that entitle 
them to $20 off on a two-night stay, or $40 on a three-night stay. Or the 
credits can be banked for use at other vacation destinations, from Holland 
America cruises to American Airlines vacation packages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hilton, by contrast, is offering its own weekend deal at $89 a 
night, which also includes breakfast for two. The hook: romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hilton's national Romance Survey results show that couples believe going away 
together for a weekend is one of the best ways to keep romance alive," said 
Glenn Hale, general manager. And he couldn't help but plug the place across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disneyland is especially nice this time of year because the park has a less 
crowded, leisurely feel about it," he said.

LOSSES CONTINUE AT O.C.'S COMMUNITY BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's community banks, still staggering from continued loan losses 
and the cash they must set aside in reserve for future problems, lost a 
combined $16.2 million for the first six months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 25 banks were stung last year with an aggregate loss of $50.1 
million. For the first and second quarters this year, they recorded red ink of 
$7 million and $9.2 million, respectively, according to Sheshunoff Information 
Services Inc. in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Community banks generally have been loath to recognize the effect of the 
recession on their loans, especially those backed by real estate, said J.B. 
Crowell, chairman of Eldorado Bank in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major banks have recognized their bad loans and took their hits a year or 
so ago," Crowell said, by writing down the value of their loans and putting 
money in reserve to cover potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many community banks still are not providing sufficient reserves," 
Crowell said. In addition, he said, the value of commercial and industrial 
properties, which back many loans, is "still scraping along the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 The community banks, which typically cater to local areas and small 
businesses, also were hurt somewhat by rising interest rates, he said. 
Investment portfolios are fetching less income at previously lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen county banks lost money for the six-month period, while 13 posted 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the profitable banks was Eldorado, which earned $1.2 million for the 
first six months. Landmark Bank in La Habra and Grand National Bank in Santa 
Ana recorded profits of $617,000 and $605,000, respectively, for the first six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The money-losers were led by two banks that have since failed: Bank of Newport 
and Commerce-Bank, both in Newport Beach. They lost $9.8 million and $4.5 
million, respectively, for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Following were Pacific Inland Bank in Anaheim, with red ink totaling $1.3 
million, and Sunwest Bank in Tustin, with a loss of $1.2 million for the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 All the banks, according to Sheshunoff, are adequately or well capitalized, 
which means they have enough investor money set aside as their final reserve 
against any losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the county's eight thrift and loans -- hybrids of banks and finance 
companies -- earned $4.3 million for the six-month period. Half of that profit 
came from Fremont Investment & Loan in Orange, which earned $2.2 million for 
the period. Freedom Financial Thrift & Loan in Lake Forest was the only 
money-losing thrift and loan, posting a loss of $34,000.

O.C. BRIEFLY: HTP ANNOUNCES CHANGER SYSTEM HOLDING 120 CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HTP International said Monday that it has unveiled a 120-compact disc changer 
system.A 90-disc expansion system will be available by January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Paul Safronchik said his company's new CD changer sets a standard in 
the industry. Currently, several competitors have components that allow 
consumers to store and choose as many as 100 CD titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the system recognizes the name of the artist, title of the CD, 
and song titles without requiring the owner to input that information for each 
CD. 
</P>
<P>
 During a limited introduction phase, the changer will sell for $1,000 to 
$2,000. Safronchik said the price will drop to well below $1,000 once it is 
available in consumer electronics outlets.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four out of five of the nation's colleges and universities are connected to 
the Internet, allowing students, faculty and administrators to talk to each 
other and share resources worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools now automatically give students an electronic mail account when 
they register. 
</P>
<P>
 Some go much further by providing computers, accepting applications and class 
registration electronically or even holding "paperless" classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples, gathered chiefly through e-mail conversations with students, 
faculty and administrators across the country: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cedarville College, Cedarville, Ohio: Wes Baker, a communications professor at 
this private 2,300-student school, teaches a class in person for a few weeks, 
then over the campus e-mail network and then by video conferencing. His 
discovery: "Students who don't feel comfortable particularly in class are much 
more likely to make comments during the e-mail sessions." But those who are 
most outgoing in person don't like the e-mail and video conferencing as much. 
That could be a sign of how people will choose their favorite communication 
method in the future. "You go with whatever fits your personality," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.: Widely acknowledged as a pioneer in the move 
by colleges toward pervasive use of electronic communication. Student 
organizations paid to put computers in dining halls and other public locations 
so messages can be accessed nearly everywhere. "It's part of the culture here," 
said Larry Levine, director of computing. For three years, Dartmouth has 
required first-year students to own a personal computer. The machine of choice: 
the Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drew University, Madison, N.J.: In 1984, Drew began issuing personal 
computers, printers and software to incoming students. The school prorates the 
cost into its tuition so students can take the machines with them at 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, N.Y.: More than 750 of the 
school's residence hall rooms have computer network connections and the 
remaining 1,000 will be wired during the next year. The campus network has 
become a key tool for 2,700 students in 120 "distance learning" courses. A 
popular feature of the system is a discussion area where students and faculty 
debate topics such as media coverage of O.J. Simpson or the U.S. role in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.: Home to a key computer on the 
Internet, Michigan also has one of the largest networks for students and 
faculty, used by about 50,000 people. About one-third of school's residence 
hall rooms and apartments have networking connections. Its system also supports 
video signals that are compressed to fit through normal phone lines. Officials 
believe phone calls to the university's main information number are declining 
because more of the information that people seek, including how to reach 
students and faculty, is available on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 University of Minnesota-Crookston, Crookston, Minn.: The 850-student school 
got the nickname "ThinkPad U" after it began providing each student with an IBM 
laptop computer last year. The school bought more advanced models for this 
year's students and, in 12 of its classrooms, has equipped each desk with a 
network connection.

COMPUTER NETWORKING ALTERS COLLEGE LIFE; TECHNOLOGY: THE INSTITUTIONS ARE THE 
FIRST TO EXPERIENCE THE PROMISE OF THE DIGITAL AGE IN SOCIAL AS WELL AS 
PRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR AND FIRST TO TACKLE ITS PROBLEMS.

 Ryan LaSalle learned how to use electronic mail on his first day at Princeton 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Caryn Siegel waited until her second year after realizing it let her easily 
communicate with a friend at another college. 
</P>
<P>
 The PC in LaSalle's dorm room checks with Princeton's main computer every five 
minutes for new messages. Siegel logs in once or twice a day on public machines 
in academic buildings or one at the Student Volunteer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "All over the campus, no matter where you go, you can always get E-mail," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Princeton, most colleges have become wired societies, already transformed 
by computer-assisted communication in ways that will take the nation as a whole 
years to achieve. They are the first to experience the promise of the digital 
age in social as well as productive behavior and the first to tackle its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ahead of the curve," said William Graves, associate provost for 
information technology at the University of North Carolina. "We have a lot of 
experience with this. It would certainly be a shame if the nation didn't take 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the nation's colleges, universities and junior colleges are 
linked to the Internet, the network of computer networks formed in the late 
1960s to join collegiate researchers with the government and military 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those schools provide every student with a computer account that is an 
address on the Internet, a practice that became common about five years ago as 
more students brought PCs to campus. Many have also linked their residence 
halls and academic buildings with high-capacity fiber optic lines. The Wired 
Life 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, students in most colleges think nothing of accessing the school 
library's index or one at another college from their own dorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools foster a sense of community by creating topical discussion areas 
on the campus network similar to those on the Internet or commercial on-line 
systems like CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also use computers to distribute campuswide notices. Princeton, for 
instance, sends its newsletter on outdoor activities and trips via E-mail, 
saving more than $5,000 in printing. 
</P>
<P>
 And a small but growing number of professors require students to download 
assignments or turn in homework through the campus computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Skandera-Trombley, a professor of English at the State University of New 
York-Potsdam, has her composition students submit their "papers" via E-mail. 
Her software automatically duplicates the work so she can change one copy while 
the original remains for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, students want to print off things because they are used to 
the hard copy," she said. "They do that less and less as the semester goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Professors have become more accessible to students, without having to be in 
the office more, because of E-mail. That's especially helpful to part-time 
students and those who don't live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling among the faculty is we have a little less face-to-face contact 
with our students," said Wes Baker, a communications professor at Cedarville 
College in Ohio. "However, the perception among students is that contact with 
teachers has risen because they can zip off a question." 
</P>
<P>
 Students of economics at the University of Missouri-Rolla, seeing how much 
free information is available on the Internet, have started to create databases 
to share with others, said Professor Linda Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts students in a completely different role, to be information 
providers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, personal communication is more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors of the school newspaper at North Carolina State University stay in 
touch with E-mail and also with voice messaging and pagers. LaSalle at 
Princeton said he gets friends together for basketball games with E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several people I know have used it to keep long-distance relationships 
going," said Scott Fritchie, a computer systems administrator at St. Olaf 
College in Minnesota. "They're still dating their high school sweetheart 
electronically." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hickey, a Princeton student who arrived on campus early this fall, said 
he was disappointed when his account wasn't activated for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to just getting comfy and sending E-mail to my friends," said 
Hickey, who is in touch with more than a dozen friends around the country. "I 
can't imagine any instance where I would need to write a letter to any of my 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of a college's progress in the digital world is whether mail in 
the campus post office has been reduced. Grinnell College in Iowa has seen a 
reduction, but chiefly in all-school notices or advertisements. Other schools 
say the paper glut continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Habits are hard to break in that regard," Jeff Hanna, spokesman for the 
College of Wooster in Ohio, said via E-mail. "And the habit is to tell students 
as many times as possible in as many different ways as possible to make certain 
they get the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, like many companies, colleges are learning the ease of computer 
messages sometimes yields greater volume but reduced effectiveness. Spotting 
Problems 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are now confusing transmitting data with communicating," said 
David Davenport, president of Pepperdine University in Malibu. "I think you can 
really communicate via E-mail. But I think a lot of people are not 
communicating." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his computer is routinely filled with messages for which he is not the 
primary recipient, but one of many. 
</P>
<P>
 Other digital-age problems colleges are facing include how to provide 
copyrights and appropriate credit for electronic information, prevent 
harassment on computer networks and provide everyone with access to up-to-date 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Several large groups of colleges are working on statements of electronic 
rights. A model has emerged from American University, and the American Assn. 
for Higher Education that says a person has a right to free speech in the 
electronic world but also a responsibility to behave ethically. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent example of where the two clashed, Santa Rosa Junior College in 
California last month agreed to pay two female students $15,000 because of 
derogatory remarks made about them on a men-only discussion group on the campus 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are old issues. The technology has opened up new windows on them," said 
Graves, the North Carolina administrator and director of the Institute for 
Academic Technology, a resource group partly funded by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most thorny is making sure students can get the right computers and 
software. Dartmouth College requires students to own a PC. Princeton rejected 
that idea several years ago, although more than two-thirds of its students own 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Public schools have more trouble with such a requirement since they are 
generally larger, serve a more diverse economic base of students and have 
government bureaucracies to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch of the University of Minnesota in Crookston, in the state's far 
northwest corner, incorporates $750 into its fees to provide every student with 
a laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But three branches of California State University ran into criticism last 
month when they declared an intent to require students own PCs. Just Another 
Tool 
</P>
<P>
 For all the hype given to video-on-demand and home shopping, the experience on 
college campuses makes it clear that better communication is the end most 
people seek in the digital future. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Princeton students said, technology won't run a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an information tool," Ryan LaSalle said. "It's not the information 
tool."

 Caryn Siegel said she continues to write letters, make phone calls and trudge 
through resources at the library. Comparing computers and E-mail to the 
automated teller machine, she said, "You need to still go into the bank once in 
awhile."

AFTER SIX WEEKS AND 2,400 MILES, IT FEELS SO NATURAL; LIFE IS EITHER A DARING 
ADVENTURE, OR NOTHING. -- HELEN KELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 I slipped over the Continental Divide without a whimper and pedaled for miles 
along the rooftop of North America, snow-dusted buttes to my right and left, 
the raw mountain wind racing me through the passes and into the valley below. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, high-tailing it down from the summit, I found an old friend -- Route 
66 -- and my bicycle and I followed it westward toward Gallup, N.M. Ahead I 
watched an eastbound Sante Fe freight train come rumbling toward me. The 
engineer leaned from his window and waved, saluting with three whistle blasts 
that rolled across the silent plain. Seldom have I felt more alone or more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 When I left my home in Virginia six weeks and 2,400 miles ago, headed for 
Santa Monica, I had planned to travel roads far north of 66. But after finally 
escaping the Oklahoma Panhandle, where for miles and miles you see only miles 
and miles, winter was closing in. I looked at the orange line drawn across the 
top of New Mexico and Arizona on my map and saw nothing but high mountains and 
emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, I wouldn't take my rig up there this time of year, let alone a 
bicycle," a trucker in Boise City, Okla., said. I have come to trust what 
truckers, oil drillers and highway patrolmen tell me about the road ahead, and 
I paid attention to his instructions: Drop south through Texas on Highway 54, 
then head over to Tucumcari, N.M., where the Mother Road, as John Steinbeck 
called Route 66, ambles west through the mythology of our travel lore. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of cowboys in Stetsons, jeans and boots eyed me the next day in a 
Dalhart, Tex., cafe as I leaned my bike against the glass window and walked in, 
feeling quite out of place with my short pants, helmet and sweat-stained 
jersey. I ordered coffee and a grilled cheese sandwich and, leaving my wallet 
and glasses on the table, went back outside to buy a newspaper. "That's a 
pretty good way to get your money stole, wouldn't you say?" one of them drawled 
when I returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in Washington, D.C., it is," I said, "but I figured in West Texas it's 
safe." They beamed and I knew I had won them over. "Well, glad to hear you 
Easterners know we're different in Texas," the man said. "You'll find decent, 
honest people out here." Later, as I tried to pay for lunch, the waitress said 
the cowboys had taken care of my tab. 
</P>
<P>
 This is handsome, open country I am passing through, and I like it and am 
comfortable in it. Yet I still feel great unease every morning leaving the 
security of a motel room with zero miles on my odometer. I get numbed by the 
solitude of my days and nights, and I worry about the weather and the hills and 
the distance between towns, and I hear the echo of friends' voices telling me 
it is dangerous to venture alone where one does not belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in a few miles the voices fade and I hear only the reassuring hum of my 
tires over the pavement, reminding me that I have never been so aware of my 
surroundings. I study the sway of sagebrush to judge the wind's intensity. The 
croak of katydids tells me the day will warm. In the road ahead my eye can now 
spot a glass shard at 30 yards. I can hear an 18-wheeler coming up behind me 
even before it is visible in my rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Although my journey has turned me into a functional illiterate -- I have not 
read anything but maps and historical markers for weeks -- the open road has 
provided ample nourishment. It has carried me through towns with such names as 
Slapout and Ft. Supply and Brady's Corner -- places where John Wayne portraits 
stare down from the wall of every cafe -- and taught me much about an America 
that, like Route 66, still seems a mirror of the '50s and simpler, more 
trusting times. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I went down to Tyler, Tex., the other weekend for a holiday," 
a woman in Elmwood, Okla. (population six), told me. "They had 27,000 people 
there. Twenty-seven thousand ! I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her if she didn't sometimes yearn for a little more activity than 
Elmwood offered, and she said: "No way at all. The way it is here, I know 
everybody. You need a hand, anyone will extend it. You get into a big place 
like Tyler, and that's just not going to happen." Off and Pedaling

OLD GERMS, NEW ENEMIES: BATTLING THE 'SERIAL KILLERS'; BOOKS: DIPHTHERIA. 
CHOLERA. PLAGUE. WITH SO MANY DISEASES WE THOUGHT VANQUISHED MAKING NEWS, WE 
NEED TO RETHINK OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH VIRUSES, SAYS AUTHOR LAURIE GARRETT.

<P>
 Every day the index of misery grows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, a diphtheria outbreak has reached epidemic proportions. In Rwanda, 
the drug-resistant cholera that blazed through refugee camps this summer 
remains a killer. In the United States, once-vanquished diseases such as 
tuberculosis and measles have returned like avenging conquerors to ravage poor, 
urban areas. And the latest entry from the "killer germ" front is a sobering 
reminder of ancient times: a plague outbreak in Western India that has killed 
dozens of people and caused hundreds of thousands to flee the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a new historical phase," says Laurie Garrett, author of the 
soon-to-be published, "The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World 
Out of Balance" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relationship with microbes is different than ever before," she says. "I 
don't think it's Fantasy X, apocalyptic thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett's book is an exhaustively researched, often-gripping tome -- covering 
everything from African viruses to toxic shock syndrome and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 At 730 pages, the book is a collection of "disease detective" stories as well 
as an ambitious history of mutant viruses and bacteria over the course of this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek magazine calls it a "brilliant downer (that) is must reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the book's impact is its timeliness. Recent cover stories by 
Newsweek and Time magazines have sounded the alarm on the failure of 
antibiotics to defeat new generations of bacteria and the overall virulence of 
killer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hot Zone" -- a book about the 1989 outbreak of Ebola virus in Virginia -- 
is on the bestseller list, and a movie about a deadly virus gone awry -- set to 
star Dustin Hoffman -- is also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, last June's appearance of the so-called flesh-eating bacteria -- 
reports of which were endlessly replayed on TV news -- remains fresh on many 
people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett's interest in infection, however, is the product of a much longer 
gestation. A former science correspondent for National Public Radio and fellow 
at the Harvard Public School of Health, Garrett wrote "The Coming Plague" in 17 
months after several years of observing phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa, 
Central America and the Middle East, which challenged her assumptions that the 
defeat of disease by science was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I traveled more and more in developing countries, I found diseases that I 
had grown up with and thought were quite common were killers, and that diseases 
I had never heard of were killing tens of thousands of people and taking 
millions of lives every year," recalls Garrett, a health and science writer at 
New York Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the overall picture didn't come into focus for her until a 1987 
gathering of scientists and researchers in Washington, D.C. There, for the 
first time, Garrett says, she heard experts voice grave concerns about 
medicine's inability to cope with the burgeoning number of virulent contagions 
that had suddenly manifested -- fears that, in essence, validated her anecdotal 
experiences. That started her hunt, she says, "and by the time I had 12 file 
boxes (of research), I said, 'It's time for a book contract.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Coming Plague," the litany of blame for the new onslaught of global 
infection is a long and complex one. Indeed, Garrett, who has an advanced 
degree in immunology, points out that few of the often-lethal contagions facing 
the world -- such as hantavirus and Legionnaires' disease -- are new. Many have 
existed either in less virulent states or in local environments for years, 
perhaps centuries. But in the past 20 years or so, social and environmental 
factors have intruded to amplify the quality and quantity of their 
destructiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, in the case of bacteria-induced diseases, Garrett says, it has 
been the very antibiotics that successfully treated scourges such as gonorrhea, 
tuberculosis and malaria that provided the mechanism for their hardier strains 
to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Because modern medicine was unable to completely rid the world of such 
diseases, the surviving bacteria either mutated or transformed themselves into 
antibiotic-resistant strains, even as scientists blithely declared the battle 
over and moved on. "We called the game but the microbes didn't stop playing," 
Garrett says. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in the case of viruses, Garrett says, similar amplifications of old 
contagions, along with man-made factors, created the new and deadly specimens 
that have seemingly appeared from nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, by testing old blood supplies, scientists have found the presence 
of the human immunodeficiency virus in samples dating to the 1970s, at which 
point the virus was spreading very slowly in Central Africa and the United 
States. Yet it was in 1975, say researchers, that "something happened" and HIV 
exploded in both areas of the world, an event that would not be detected until 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett and other researchers now theorize that factors such as rising 
intravenous drug use and the increase in gay sex in North America, and war, 
refugee migration and famine in Africa likely spurred the beginnings of the 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't divorce our social problems from diseases of population," says Dr. 
Richard Wenzel, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at the 
University of Iowa. "For an epidemic to get rolling, it has to have susceptible 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Given this, the immediate outlook is not a hopeful one, says Garrett, adding 
that estimates show that by the next century, there will be an increasing 
number of megacities -- those with populations of more than 10 million -- in 
developing, economically disadvantaged countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The new megacities, which will likely be filled with former rural dwellers 
living with below-standard levels of sanitation and nutrition, may become 
veritable caldrons of new plagues -- with the host nations unable to pay for 
the costs of disease prevention or containment. Even today, faced with 
epidemics of malaria or AIDS, some impoverished countries can afford to spend 
only $2 to $3 yearly per person for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, who coincidentally was in India during the recent pneumonic plague 
outbreak, says that despite the deaths and widespread panic, the scenario could 
have been much worse. "If this had been an airborne virus, it would have spread 
globally," she says. "The masses were on the move." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of most industrialized nations, which provide the most research 
on disease and the best medical care, have little cause for comfort. Not only 
is vaccine development "in a state of crisis" and "every aspect of public 
health . . . in a state of chaos," Garrett says, but in light of the 
ever-increasing mobility of the world's population, new viruses and diseases 
can travel with unprecedented rapidity and impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 One incident recounted in "The Coming Plague" tells of an undetected microbe 
that, thanks to the convenience of jet travel, spread through four continents 
and infected hundreds of people within a week's time in 1989 before officials 
were even aware of its existence. Fortunately, the virus -- known as the Ebola 
Reston and found in monkeys -- didn't prove harmful to humans, unlike its more 
destructive African Ebola counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the message the virus left in its wake is harrowing, and depending upon 
people's response -- or lack of it -- a potentially lethal one. Garrett is 
mindful that as long as social, economic and environmental conditions 
deteriorate worldwide, and as populations continue to grow, the microbes will 
have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time it takes for humans to evolve is on the scale of centuries," she 
says. "But the time it takes for a bacteria or virus to evolve is on the scale 
of minutes. That's their advantage."

 In 1990, Natalie Carlson was preparing to die. The 55-year-old Costa Mesa 
woman, who had bone marrow cancer, had stopped her chemotherapy even though 
doctors told her that if she did so, she would only have six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemotherapy was making me so sick I couldn't walk from the living room 
to the kitchen without getting out of breath," she recalls. "I was totally sick 
at least three weeks out of the month. I couldn't go anywhere or do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson says she sat home and felt sorry for herself for a long time. Then she 
heard about a new cancer support network, the Wellness Community of Orange 
County, and screwed up her courage to attend some workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 What she really wanted, she says, was a way to help her die.

 "I was looking for something to help me get through my final days," she said. 
"Going there and listening, eventually I began to feel better. A lot of the 
girls had such an up attitude. They had things worse than what I had, but most 
of them were laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, having defied predictions of death and still without her regimen of 
chemotherapy, Carlson continues to socialize with fellow patients she met at 
the Wellness Community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Wellness Community, cancer patients meet to discuss life-and-death 
issues, to cry, to laugh. They learn all they can about cancer's effects on 
them -- and their attitudes' effect on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In workshops and guest lectures, they learn about nutrition, household 
budgeting and exercise techniques. The regular participant groups target the 
patients' psychological needs and are designed to supplement, not replace, 
medical treatment, says Barbara A. McKone, program director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Community represents a new sensibility in cancer treatment, 
health professionals say. Where once the disease alone was the all-consuming 
focus of doctors and other health care providers, now the patient's overall 
morale and quality of life are increasingly seen as key to reducing the 
disease's morbidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the patient's psychosocial, as opposed to just medical, needs is 
critical, says Steven Armentrout, a UCI Medical Center oncologist and president 
of the Wellness Community's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge amount of evidence showing that patients who are active 
participants in support groups . . . have (better) tolerance of the 
side-effects of therapy. And a number of studies suggest their longevity is 
better as well," Armentrout says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their full-time staff and daily operation, large programs such as 
the Wellness Community are able to provide a range of services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Community employs four full-time people and three part-time 
trained facilitators. There are 40 active volunteers. Its yearly operating 
budget of $400,000 is raised from private sources; there is no government 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety and flexibility are key to the success of the support groups, says 
Cary Presant, an oncologist and former president of the American Cancer Society 
in California. At his facility, the California Cancer Medical Center in West 
Covina, Presant recently began offering a support group open only to breast 
cancer patients whose chemotherapy has caused them to gain weight. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Community of Orange County, which recently celebrated its fourth 
anniversary, is one of 13 Wellness Communities nationwide. Founded in 1982 in 
Santa Monica, the nonprofit, privately funded centers have helped about 14,000 
cancer patients at no charge, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Cummings is one such patient. After her surgery for a brain tumor four 
years ago, Cummings, 32, of Dana Point, didn't blame her friends for thinking 
she was back to normal. After all, she returned to work full time as a Los 
Angeles Fire Department paramedic just five weeks later, and occasional 
headaches were her only symptom. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'Oh, she's great. She looks fine,' " Cummings recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knew better. During the 12 1/2-hour surgery, doctors had found the 
tumor to be an anaplastic astrocytoma, which can be highly malignant. They also 
discovered it was inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 While her doctor took a wait-and-see stance, Cummings began to struggle with 
the life-and-death issues that descend on cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 She headed to the Wellness Community, where she joined other patients in 
weekly discussions of recovery strategies and took workshops on journal 
writing, social adjustment and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the surgery . . . I had the normal reactions that people have when they 
find out they have cancer," Cummings said. "But trying to talk to friends my 
age was difficult, because no one in their late 20s wants to talk about 
mortality issues." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Wellness Community, she says, "we talked about the things people don't 
feel comfortable talking about with their families. It's not that families 
don't want to; sometimes they just can't." 
</P>
<P>
 After eight months, Cummings was able to move on, to "graduate" from the group 
with a better attitude and understanding of the disease and her relationship to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving a true community of patients is at the heart of the philosophy at 
the Wellness Community. Participants are encouraged to avoid isolation and get 
to know others who have already benefited from coping techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana facility, in a light-industrial area off the Costa Mesa 
Freeway, about 100 participants comprise eight weekly support groups that meet 
in rooms decorated to resemble living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients' primary at-home care providers, usually spouses, discuss their 
own issues in three other groups, McKone says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at cancer as a family affair," she says. "Everyone has different 
coping skills, and some family members minimize (cancer in the family), put it 
on the back burner, so the workshops focus on caring and coping skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears are common at the Wellness Community, but so is laughter, participants 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laughed more than we cried. It was just incredible laughing," said 
Cummings, who added that her group remained upbeat even though two of its 
members died. "If people heard the amount of laughing going on, and then found 
out we were cancer patients, they'd think we were nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Often participants become conduits for spreading news of breakthroughs in 
cancer care. One patient recently asked his doctor for literature on a new 
anti-nausea drug he had received along with his regular chemotherapy, McKone 
said. He shared it with his group, and, within a few weeks, half the group had 
started on the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Such networking can also educate professional care providers. Some physicians 
have told McKone that their patients sometimes bring them information on new 
therapies even before they read about them in their journals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members tend to become patient-active instead of just passive people who 
go to their doctor and say, 'OK, fix me,' " McKone says. "Here we encourage 
them to be in dialogue and combine the skill of the doctor with the will of the 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Support group members often continue their relationships outside the Wellness 
Community. Some of the 50 volunteers are former participants, says Shirley A. 
Lorenz, executive director. Two such volunteers, Marlene Gavelin and Jack Dwan, 
conduct weekly introductory meetings for potential new members. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because the Wellness Community is not affiliated with any hospital or 
care group, patients are referred from a variety of sources, including UCI 
Medical Center in Anaheim, the City of Hope, UCLA and USC. Participation has 
increased about 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These care providers need options for when their patient leaves the 
hospital," McKone says. "It makes them feel better if they know the patients 
have somewhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients' frames of mind vary widely when they enter the program, but they 
often make a transition "from victim to victor," in Lorenz's words, as they 
progress in their groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For patients like Carlson, the program helped renew a sense of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wellness Community is the reason I've done so well," Carlson says. "I 
used to think of death all the time. Now I don't think of it at all."

A GRAVE INTEREST; CALL THEM MORBID. BUT MEMBERS OF THE PHANTOM COACHES HEARSE 
CLUB WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD WITHOUT THEIR CREEPY CARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Mark Villarino leaps from the driver's seat, as though suddenly scared half to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one final detail -- the last nail in the coffin, as it were, before 
the procession begins. "Oh!" says the 29-year-old chemist. "I almost forgot the 
funeral flags. Look at these things! A guy I know ordered them from a real 
undertaker's catalogue. They're totally cool." 
</P>
<P>
 But Villarino is not preparing for a funeral march. Dressed in tails, he 
slides back behind the wheel of his slate-gray hearse -- the point car of 
another Sunday afternoon outing of the Phantom Coaches Hearse Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring a dozen coaches in all, most festooned with the flapping purple 
funeral flags, all with headlights on, the procession pulls slowly out of 
Clover Park in Santa Monica, headed for -- where else? -- a nearby cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The ponytailed Villarino, donning a pair of ominous black sunglasses, is 
beside himself with excitement. He can't keep his eyes from his rearview 
mirror, cooing at the majestic-looking vehicles creeping slowly along behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He notices the stupefied onlookers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch those cars stop for us," he says. "See that guy scratching his head at 
the sight of a dozen old hearses passing by his house? This is so great." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, being truly different is often a monumental task. 
Unless, of course, you own a secondhand hearse. There are three hearse clubs in 
the region, not to mention a San Francisco Bay Area group called Grim Rides. 
</P>
<P>
 As Halloween approaches, clubs like the Phantom Coaches are on the road, in 
demand at haunted houses, Halloween supply stores and car shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaying their black funeral garb and even blacker humor, many hearses carry 
used caskets and have horns that sound a funeral dirge. Phantom Coach drivers 
cruise the Los Angeles area, edging past children who would no sooner cross 
their path than they would a mangy black cat's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like people are afraid of what's inside, of what the hearse represents," 
says Cecilia Smith, a 34-year-old Murietta bank officer and the club's 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they drive their coaches year-round, October is the time of year 
that owners have been, ahem, re- hearsing for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," Villarino says. "Nowadays, I get thumbs-up signs from people 
saying, 'Dude, cool car for Halloween!' But the rest of the year you just get 
grief for driving a hearse. People yell, 'What are you, sick?' 'Are you a 
Satan-lover?' 'Get a life!' I guess it just comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning heads in the procession out of the park are the purple 1955 Pontiac 
end-loader, the 1962 Cadillac Superior and the elongated 1967 Cadillac 
Miller-Meteor three-way -- meaning, in funeral terminology, that it features 
three doors through which a casket can be loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the baddest big-daddy coach of them all, the sleek black 1959 
Cadillac Superior, the one driven by redheaded actor Bud Cort in the 
cult-classic film "Harold and Maude," now owned by Long Beach mortician and 
club member Ronnie Grubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The members just like the look of the vehicles that have carried thousands of 
dead bodies between them: the long, high-arcing fins, velvet curtains and 
bullet-shaped brake lights -- each hearse displaying that elegant, formal look 
in a spooky sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
 What they like even more, though, is observing public reaction to the 
cavernous-looking cars: The way traffic screeches to a halt and passersby gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you enjoy attention, this is the car to drive," Villarino says. "I don't 
have to own a $75,000 Jaguar, just this old hearse. For the amount of attention 
you get per dollar, it's the best buy in town!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lounging on the grass of the crowded city park -- talking of Wes Craven horror 
flicks and twisted Far Side cartoons -- they look like a resurrected 1960s rock 
band in their black T-shirts and jeans, tattoos and body piercing: nose rings, 
lip rings, even tongue rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Their diverse ranks include the hippest urban loners and couples from the dark 
heart of suburbia -- such as the single mother with a 7-year-old daughter whose 
hearse is her only mode of transportation and the Murietta couple who got 
married in a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Riverside family that travels with a 14-year-old daughter who 
likes hearses "because they scare people." And the furniture-maker with the 
shaved head who drives a funeral coach for one simple, Beavis and 
Butthead-esque reason: "Being morbid is cool." 
</P>
<P>
 They're all drawn together by the love of owning creepy, put-out-to-pasture 
vehicles costing anywhere from $500 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're great for moving large pieces of furniture and to amaze your 
friends," Smith says. "Most of all, though, they're unique, well-cared-for cars 
that for the most part have really low mileage -- driven just to and from the 
cemetery is all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, drawbacks to owning your own used hearse: Other than 
being flipped off by the occasional unamused motorist, there are the old ladies 
who shake their fist from the sidewalk, telling you to "get closer to God." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "We don't stray too far from gas stations -- most hearses get only about 
10 miles per gallon," says Lonnie Sutter, a 33-year-old film editor and club 
president, or chairman of the morgue. "While they're really easy to spot in the 
mall parking lot, they're hard to park. You try finding a space for a 
23-foot-long hearse." 
</P>
<P>
 But coach owners like the white-as-a-ghost reactions of passengers who can't 
appreciate the aesthetics of a secondhand hearse replete with its own once-used 
casket. "Once I took my godmother for a ride," Rene Ochoa says. "All she just 
kept saying was, 'I can't believe I'm riding in a hearse. But at least I'm up 
here in the front seat and not back there .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Villarino has used his hearse to bury his former nursery-school teacher, an 
elderly man who fell in love with his vehicle. "His wife thought it would be 
nice if I drove him to the cemetery," he recalls. "Now, I'm wearing his old 
tuxedo." 
</P>
<P>
 Grubbs' hearse is a moving piece of movie memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortician, who sells refurbished hearses for reuse in countries including 
Russia, France and South Africa, recently stumbled onto the coach used in the 
1972 film "Harold and Maude," a black comedy based on the romance between a 
79-year-old flower child played by Ruth Gordon and a 20-year-old, 
hearse-driving loner who's obsessed with death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the movie with my sister in 1978 and remember telling her that one day 
I was going to own a hearse like that," Grubbs recalls. "I never dreamed I'd 
ever own the real thing!" 
</P>
<P>
 He bought the hearse for $3,000 from members of a now-defunct Orange County 
rock band called "The Die Hards," who for five years used the coach as an 
equipment mover. Grubbs says that he has since met several members of the 
"Harold and Maude" film crew and that they have confirmed the hearse's 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 As he talks, a group of schoolgirls approaches Grubbs' hearse, laughing as 
they peer in the windows, noses pressed against the glass, asking, "Do you have 
a real dead body in there?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there's dissension in the ranks: Janis Dority of Corona shakes her head 
over her husband, Bob, dressed in a black top hat and boxer shorts with a 
skull-and-crossbones design. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's his oversized play toy, a hearse featuring purple running lights, 
a strobe-lighted casket and a horn that cries "Please help me!" 
</P>
<P>
 "They need attention, that's their problem," she sighs about club members. 
"They're exhibitionists, legal flashers." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the hearse procession -- bearing license plates such as "Da Herse," 
"I Morbid" and "Bldngor" -- makes its way toward its first stop -- nearby 
Woodlawn cemetery -- where members stand among the grave sites, absorbing the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a moment of tension when two park rangers pull up alongside the group 
-- past processions have been harassed by police, club members say -- until 
officers begin asking gee-whiz questions about the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 One lights his flashers and whoops his siren for Dority, who carries a video 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead," somebody says. "Wake the dead." 
</P>
<P>
 At another lot, as group members line up their hearses, people gather to 
watch: "You gotta be kind of bent," says Jeni Claunch of the owners before 
snapping a few photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxing down his hearse, baldheaded Brian Demski says he's not afraid to be 
morbid. 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses before answering the question he's heard a thousand times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I own this thing because it fits my image. They say that in L.A., you are 
what you drive. Well, I drive a hearse. You figure it out."

BODY WATCH; RUNNING AFTER THE PERFECT SHOE; YOU KNOW IT'S TIME TO BUY NEW 
FOOTWEAR WHEN THE SOLES ARE AS THIN AS BOLOGNA. BUT WHAT A TASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a few years now since I endured the ordeal of buying a new car, but 
the horror such a major purchase entails is still fresh in my mind. It was also 
something I figured I'd never have to go through again, at least until I wanted 
to buy a house. But then I had to get running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarities were uncanny. Do I go for something sporty or practical? What 
does Consumer Reports recommend as the best buy? How can I make the purchase 
with minimum contact with a pushy salesperson? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd bought running shoes a few times before, but the last purchase was four 
years ago. As I embarked on the buying process, I was shocked at how 
complicated it has all become. 
</P>
<P>
 The search actually began the same way my car search began. My old used car 
had sort of blown up on the freeway, and my mechanic told me it was time to get 
something new. My old running shoes had finally been worn down to the point 
where the soles had the depth and consistency of a piece of bologna. I'd 
developed an inflamed joint in my left foot as a result, and my doctor ordered 
me to find a new pair immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't quite sure how to begin the search. I think it's a gender thing. Men 
just don't carry the shoe-buying chromosome. For example, my old running shoes 
came to me four years ago when my mom asked me what I wanted as a Christmas 
gift. I told her running shoes and gave her my size. And that was it. The last 
time I actually bought some myself had probably been at least four years before 
that, so I was completely out of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe world had certainly changed since then. I remember being able to walk 
into a store, choosing between the blue pair and the white pair and I was on my 
way. These days, there is Air this and Max that. You can get cross-trainers for 
more than one type of exercise. (What's next? Cross-socks for those days when 
you decide to run and do sit-ups?) 
</P>
<P>
 You can get shoes that pump, shoes filled with air and shoes that light up. 
There's even a shoe with a squishy layer of gel inside, like a jelly doughnut 
for your feet. All the new running shoes are capable of just about everything 
except actually doing the running for you while you stay home and watch pro 
wrestling on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 With all these technological advances, naturally, comes increased cost. Since 
I needed a top-of-the-line model to protect my feet, the pairs I looked at 
weren't priced much less than the down payment on my first car. Because the car 
cost so much, I never wanted to take it out of the garage out of fear that it 
would be stolen. Likewise, I worried about wearing new footwear in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I was going to have to part with a big chunk of cash, I just wanted to 
get the whole thing over with quickly. I checked out a couple of those discount 
stores, but they offered great deals on special items that turned out to be 
cut-rate prices on stuff that even the Salvation Army would pass on. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I went to a store for runners only. 
</P>
<P>
 When I explained to the guy who came over to help me that it had been four 
years since I'd gotten new running shoes, he gave me that 
what-kind-of-moron-are-you-exactly? look. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who runs five times a week the way I do, he told me, shoes tend to 
wear out once a year. At first, I thought this was a sucker pitch, a way of 
bilking novices like me. (Later I learned it's true.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I had no choice. I needed shoes, the best in the house. The salesman 
lead me through 20 minutes of explanation: the necessity of proper arch 
support, the thickness of various heels and proper lacing technique. 
</P>
<P>
 I went for the coolest-looking pair, a set of Nikes with a nifty purple, black 
and gray color combination and a heel complete with a see-through bubble. OK, 
so the price was more than $100, but these were the runner's equivalent of a 
new Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 I experienced that brief buyer's high you get from the purchase of any 
big-ticket item (though I'm thankful there is no such thing as a "new shoe 
smell"), and it would have faded except for an unforeseen complication. I went 
running in my new shoes, and darn if they weren't amazing! No more wincing with 
every step. I wondered why I'd waited so long to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than the comfort of having a new shoe was the real thrill of 
bringing a new, different, exciting addition into my life. Which reminds me. My 
car has started to look a little old lately. . . .

<P>
 Of constitutions some are well or ill adapted to summer, others are well or 
ill adapted to winter. -- Hippocrates 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago when Army psychiatrist Dr. Matthew E. Levine was transferred 
to the northern Alaska outpost at Ft. Wainwright, he noticed a common complaint 
among his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 During the long nights of winter, many of those who sought his help were 
suffering from severe depression. And when winter finally gave way to summer, 
with more than 20 hours of sunlight, the depression disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 His patients all had similar complaints: They ate too much, had little energy, 
were irritable and had almost no interest in sex. In many cases, they had one 
other common symptom: a growing dependence on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine teamed up with scientists at the University of Alaska's Institute of 
Arctic Biology and carried out key research into a phenomenon that has been 
recognized only in recent years as a serious medical problem. Seasonal 
affective disorder -- SAD, for short -- is an extreme case of the winter blues, 
and it strikes people of all age groups, especially women. 
</P>
<P>
 SAD is different from other forms of depression in that it strikes only in the 
winter, or late fall, and it clears up in the spring. And it affects people who 
have no previous record of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Levine's work particularly significant is that it was carried out 
in the extreme north, near the tip of the North American continent. SAD is a 
far more serious problem at more northern latitudes than it is farther south, 
although it can strike even in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Alaska chemist Lawrence K. Duffy, who headed the university's 
part of the research, studied soldiers and their dependents at Ft. Wainwright, 
as well as native Alaskan residents of northern villages. The results reveal 
that melatonin, a chemical produced by the body's pineal gland and known as the 
"hormone of darkness," probably plays a key role in bringing about winter 
depression. The findings may also have important implications for another 
malady plaguing Alaska: alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that melatonin levels are intimately involved" in SAD, and possibly 
alcoholism, Duffy said. "What we see up here is a broadening of the melatonin 
level because of the reduced amount of light. You just have higher levels" at 
more northern latitudes, apparently because of the deprivation of light. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is the melatonin -- or simply the lack of light -- that causes the 
depression remains to be proved, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine and Duffy believe that their results confirm the earlier pioneering 
research of Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal, a psychiatrist with the National Institute 
of Mental Health, which suggested that simply exposing patients to bright light 
each day for about a week is the best treatment. Light lowers the level of 
melatonin. 
</P>
<P>
 Many psychiatrists favor mood-elevating drugs, but Levine said his work showed 
that light worked at least as well, and it was a lot cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many psychiatrists are more comfortable using medication," Levine said. "They 
use it for everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a patient sit down in front of a fluorescent light box for an hour or 
two each day is "just too simple of a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he found an even simpler treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you really have to do is get out for a half hour to an hour in the middle 
of the day, even if it's not a sunny day," he said. That will provide ample 
light to clear the winter blues. 
</P>
<P>
 But in places like the far north, people are less inclined to do that because 
daylight lasts only about three hours in the winter, and it is very cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you go out and take a walk for half an hour you won't freeze to death 
if you bundle up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its now widespread use to treat SAD, light-box therapy is now 
increasingly used to help shift workers change their circadian rhythms so they 
can sleep in the daytime; it is also used to assist travelers in overcoming jet 
lag. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics suggest that SAD affects women more than men by a ratio of about 3 
to 1, a fact that has puzzled some researchers. It could be that more women are 
inclined to stay inside during the winter months, particularly in the 
tradition-bound villages of the north, but Levine sees another reason as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are more sensitive to biorhythms than men," and the production of 
melatonin, which occurs when the body adjusts to the nighttime, is part of that 
biorhythm process, he said. "Women's bodily rhythms are very pronounced over a 
month's time. . . . The light seems to disrupt the female reproductive rhythms 
more than it does in men." 
</P>
<P>
 That is known to be the case among females of one species, but Levine said he 
hesitated to bring it up because some women might find it offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poultry farmers put the lights on in the chicken coop," he said. The light 
"increases the number of eggs that the hen lays. So it's well known that light 
has a very strong effect on female physiology, at least for hens." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's research also suggests that melatonin might play a significant role 
in alcoholism. The hormone reduces sleep, leading to fatigue, two factors that 
seem to contribute to alcohol abuse. Studies involving the homeless in 
Fairbanks, Alaska, for example, showed that more than two-thirds drank at 
"either a highly intoxicated level or at a severely intoxicated level," and 
many suffered from symptoms consistent with SAD. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is especially serious for the Alaskan natives who live in remote 
villages of the far north. Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and 
the Hershey Medical Center found last year that the suicide rate for Alaskan 
natives was twice the national average. The most common psychiatric disorder 
among the victims was alcohol abuse, leading the researchers to conclude that 
alcoholism was "the most important antecedent of suicide" among those studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy is planning other research projects into the reduction of melatonin -- 
and possibly light treatment -- as an aide in treating alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the Alaskan natives who live on the northern edge of the state 
have developed no immunity to SAD, despite the fact that they have had to deal 
with the long nights for many, many generations. Yet research carried out by 
scientists from the National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, shows 
that Icelanders appear to have developed such immunity -- recent generations 
are far less likely to suffer from the affliction than others living at similar 
latitudes in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Research in other northern-latitude settings has further expanded the 
understanding of SAD. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists in The Netherlands found that giving light treatment at the first 
signs of the winter blues appears to prevent it from developing into a 
full-blown depression. The researchers reported last year that "not a single 
patient from a group of 16 treated this way became severely depressed during 
the remaining part of the winter season," whereas five of 11 who were not 
treated came down with SAD. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same researchers tried to nail down the time of day when the treatment 
works best, and they came up with another surprise: It made no difference if 
the light treatment was given in the morning or in the evening. Other 
researchers have found similar results. A team from Switzerland concluded that 
"time of day is not crucial" for the light treatment to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Most researchers, including the Alaskan team, favor the use of bright lights 
consisting of several fluorescent tubes, but researchers at the University of 
Toronto found no significant difference "in antidepressant efficacy" of lights 
ranging from mild to intense. 
</P>
<P>
 The color of the light does seem to make a difference, however. Researchers at 
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia found that green light did not work 
as well as white light, leading them to conclude that "broad band white light 
(sometimes called full spectrum) may be optimal for maximizing therapeutic 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be no debate over whether that light treatment does in fact 
work for SAD. A survey of 159 research papers from around the world found not a 
single challenge to that finding. But there is no evidence it works for any 
other form of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be determined is why it works for SAD. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is because the absence of light increases the level of melatonin, as 
Duffy believes, and melatonin causes the depression, then researchers may have 
found a tool that could be helpful in the treatment of afflictions ranging from 
SAD to alcoholism.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; MODELS PARADE A MARDI GRAS ATTITUDE; THE CANCER LEAGUE 
ENLIVENS ITS FASHION SHOW AND AUCTION WITH THE COLORS, FOOD AND FUN THAT CAN BE 
FOUND IN NEW ORLEANS' FRENCH QUARTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Although they were a long way from New Orleans, members of the Huntington 
Harbour Cancer League captured the flavor and spirit of the city's famed French 
Quarter for their "Mardi Gras" Debut XIV fashion show and auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion show, which culminated in an explosion of confetti and a parade of 
models in masks, drew a crowd of 400 to the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim on 
Saturday. The $125-per-person gala was expected to net more than $180,000 for 
the Orange County Unit of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 On Parade 
</P>
<P>
 For the show, event organizers turned the hotel's grand ballroom into a Mardi 
Gras street fair. Miniature palm trees in metallic green, purple and gold -- 
Mardi Gras colors -- stood atop each table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought a Mardi Gras theme would be really fun and light . . . open up all 
sorts of possibilities," said Fae Rosen, event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 They livened up their silent auction -- ordinarily rather sedate affairs -- by 
having a parade march through the ballroom to Dixieland music. Mimes, unicycle 
riders, clowns and costumed characters -- 18 of them league members who served 
as models in the fashion show -- worked the room throwing coins and beads to 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the league members took to the runway and modeled the latest styles 
from Saks Fifth Avenue at South Coast Plaza. For the finale, they sported 
evening wear and masks and threw more goodies to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Model Ted Cohen, who was joined on the runway by his wife, Linda, in a 
matching harlequin costume, was relieved that his turn on the runway didn't end 
in catastrophe: 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't give the guys any lessons on how to walk. We're just happy we 
don't fall off the stage," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 French Quarter Fare 
</P>
<P>
 While the festivities held up dinner until 9 p.m., guests found the wait was 
worth it. They enjoyed a French Quarter feast that featured cream of artichoke 
soup en croute, breast of chicken New Orleans, filet of salmon won ton, and for 
dessert bananas and strawberries flambe. After dinner they danced away the 
hours to the J. Sterling Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the gala will go to cancer research, education and patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those require money," said Robert Dillman, director of the Hoag Cancer 
Center and past president of the Orange County Unit of the American Cancer 
Society. "Cancer, by the turn of the century, will be the No. 1 cause of death 
in the country, and we still don't have the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the crowd got involved with the league because they have family 
members and friends who have battled cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of friends who have died of cancer -- that's why I'm 
involved," said Dale Skerik, president of the Huntington Harbour Cancer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were: Debbie Berry and Eva Kilgore, auction 
co-chairwomen; Bob Garretson; Ellen Goodwin; Bernie Jones; Phil Lupton; Jerry 
and Beverly Urner; Sally Fenton; Sher Lyckman; Tina Grossman; Bob and Linda 
Axel; Jenny Huntsinger; Churee Kakimoto; Jeannie Celeketic; John and Myra 
Stillman, and Dolores Olivarez.KATHRYN BOLD

CHRIS FOSTER; CRYING WULFE IN A CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seconds left. Everything is riding on this shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods has the ball. He putts, it's in! Oh what a play! The crowd is 
surging forward. They're carrying Woods off the course, shouting, "We're No. 
1." 
</P>
<P>
 You see, it just doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 When this A-to-Z thing was brought up, I made one demand. Troy's Mark 
Wulfemeyer had to be on the list, no ifs, ands or putts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the powers that be -- all golfers I might add -- insist that Tiger Woods 
is the greatest high school athlete in Orange County history. Guys, no one 
cares about golf, except the fanatics who play it. It's a cult, not a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so they number in the millions. Big deal. So do the Shriners. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks, Tiger Woods? Nice guy. Great golfer. Going to make a pocket full of 
cash someday. But it's golf. Golf. Gerald Ford plays golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, the golf team is what you join if the chess club is full. 
</P>
<P>
 Wulfemeyer, now there was an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have been a tremendous option quarterback, but his limbs were far too 
valuable. He was an overpowering pitcher, when he found the plate. He even 
signed with the Angels. But don't hold that against him. 
</P>
<P>
 What made him a legend, though, was basketball. No one played it better, 
before or since. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Tom Lewis just wheeze? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry Tom, Wulfemeyer still holds the county career scoring record (2,608 
points). Lewis couldn't catch him even with three fun-filled, run-up-the-score 
years at Mater Dei. Lewis had it made. He had Division I talent all around him. 
Wulfemeyer had the sixth period P.E. class. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders were draped all over him and still he scored. Why, he hit his first 
seven shots in his first varsity game, as a freshman. He scored 27 that night, 
a prelude. 
</P>
<P>
 Wulfemeyer averaged 27 points for his career. As a senior, he averaged 36. 
</P>
<P>
 One night against Kennedy, Wulfemeyer pumped in 55 points. Those in attendance 
say he would have had 70 if there had been a three-point line in those days. 
He, not nature, dictated range. Why, legend has it, he sank eight half-court 
shots as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Wulfemeyer stories are plentiful, most are true. You enjoy telling them. It's 
hard to imagine years from now someone getting teary-eyed saying to his 
grandson, "I remember the day Tiger Woods had that birdie." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles? Birdies? What is this, ornithology? The only "bogey" I care about wore 
a trench coat. Besides, how can "below par" be a good thing in sports? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Tiger is destined for greatness. You'll see him lining up a putt someday 
on TV. You'll catch a glimpse as you channel hop in search of a basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 And sure, Wulfemeyer never did much after high school. But that's what legends 
are about. No one remembers the acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his flop was a half-court blunder. Tarkanian wanted him, badly. Gee, a 
run-and-gun player at a run-and-gun school? Frightening. Epic. Instead, he 
tried to play for Mr. Pass-and-Pick at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A sportswriter, the story goes, approached Trojan Coach Bob Boyd one day and 
asked about Wulfemeyer. It went something like . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "How's he doing, Bob?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, he doesn't seem to be fitting in. He keeps shooting those 
25-footers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they going in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yeah. But that's not our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . 'nuff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wulfemeyer was gone. He finished at Marymount College, a little NAIA school in 
Kansas. Yeah, he was a supernova. He went hot and quick, but he glowed. 
</P>
<P>
 So, go ahead you Philistines, make a golfer a false idol. I'll take 
Wulfemeyer. He was stratospheres above par.

ORANGE COUNTY LEGENDS FROM ... A TO Z; LETTER BY LETTER, A LIST OF AREA MOVERS, 
SHAKERS AND GAME BREAKERS WHO HAVE LEFT MORE THAN THEIR MARKS OF DISTINCTION ON 
HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN O.C. -- AND BEYOND

<P>
 Get ready to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 You can call it entertainment, you can call it enlightenment, or you can call 
us idiots for trying to put something like this together, but we're feeling 
like Tarzan and want to climb out on a limb. We just had to put it together: 
Orange County's prep legends from A to Z. 
</P>
<P>
 Not an easy task, but our staff is a talented group -- or at least an aged one 
-- with more than 200 years of collective experience. We put our heads together 
and came up with a list that was as comprehensive as we could make it. How 
comprehensive was it? There were more than 150 wrestlers. No one can accuse us 
of not considering all the options. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we whittled it down, one legendary graduate for each letter of the 
alphabet. Still, we couldn't find a true X. But that was the least of our 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Our criteria? We were looking for the intangible stuff of legend: those high 
school athletes who will be remembered years from now for their role in the 
evolution of sports in Orange County. We looked at what they did in high school 
and beyond, and the legacy they left. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it was easy, and sometimes it created heated discussion in the 
newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The names that don't make the list are sure to cause a stir, maybe even a 
nasty letter or two. But we don't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, the starting quarterback at USC, isn't on the list. Well, because 
the Js are heavy and Rob joins that impressive J list that includes his brother 
Bret, Alison Johnsen, Randy Jones, Dan Jorgensen and Amy Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Playmaker Nicole Erickson's legend is well known, having led Brea-Olinda to 
four consecutive State girls' basketball titles and a 130-5 record, but she's 
not on the list, either. If only her last name was Smith or Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Mark Wulfemeyer set an Orange County career scoring record in basketball 
at Troy. Tim Wallach was an all-star third baseman. Tes Whitlock scored 68 
points in a basketball game. Myron White is one of the greatest rushers in 
county history. Mike Witt went on to pitch a perfect game for the Angels. Santa 
Ana diver Bob Webster won Olympic platform gold medals in 1960 and '64. Todd 
White held the national high school mile record (4:20.0) for one week in 1955. 
But they didn't make the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there will be some discontent here. Tony Gonzalez isn't the best G-man 
you've ever seen on a football field and basketball court? Of course he is. And 
what about Brian Goodell, the Mission Viejo senior named world swimmer of the 
year in 1977? Well, Goodell also is a no-show. They were aced out by one of the 
best softball pitchers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a comparison of apples and oranges. We aren't saying this is the 
definitive list. But it's our list. And if you can do better, well, bring it 
on. 
</P>

 A. Rick Aberegg was a 5-foot-10 point guard at Katella who averaged 27.5 
points his senior season in 1970. A year earlier, concentrating on assists 
rather than scoring, Aberegg helped the Knights reach the Southern Section 2-A 
title game; Katella lost, 90-87, to Los Angeles Verbum Dei as the two teams set 
a record for most points in a championship game that stood until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 B. Shirley Babashoff first won Southern Section championships for Fountain 
Valley in 1972 and '73 when Title IX created athletic opportunities for high 
school girls. Babashoff anchored gold medal-winning 400-meter freestyle relay 
teams in the 1972 and '76 Olympics and finished with six silver medals culled 
from the 100, 200, 400 and 800 freestyle events. At a time when the sport was 
dominated by East Germans, Babashoff was the best female swimmer in the world 
not on steroids. 
</P>

 C. Gary Carter didn't specialize in any sport at Sunny Hills, but excelled in 
three -- and received college scholarship offers for football, in which he was 
a high school All-American, basketball and baseball. He was going to play 
quarterback and catcher at UCLA, but decided to pursue professional baseball 
because of an earlier knee injury. He signed with Montreal after his 1972 
graduation; three years later, he was an Expo starter. He played 19 years, was 
an all-star 11 times and won three Gold Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 D. When the subject is female distance runners, 1976 Orange High graduate Mary 
Decker immediately comes to mind. She was competing at the international level 
while in high school and eventually set the U.S. record in the mile. But her 
legacy is one of Olympic disappointment and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 E. It must have been some piece of work, the Janet Evans essay, "What I did 
over my summer vacation." She already had won consecutive 200-yard individual 
medley and three consecutive 500 freestyle Southern Section swimming titles for 
El Dorado, but those were strictly small potatoes on her grand scale. The 
summer before her senior year, she went to Seoul and won three Olympic gold 
medals in 1988. East German competitor Heike Friedrich said, "Janet Evans is a 
different dimension." At one point, Evans held three world records. She 
returned to school and competed her senior season, setting national high school 
records in the 200 IM (1:59.96) and 500 free (4:37.30). Millions of dollars in 
endorsement offers came her way. She turned them all down so she could maintain 
her NCAA eligibility and swim at Stanford. "I'm 17," she said. "I want to be a 
kid awhile longer."

 F. Mickey Flynn's life was a Hollywood B movie, the one that takes place in 
the 1950s and everyone in town knows the local football hero. Flynn, who scored 
55 touchdowns for Anaheim from 1954 to '56, could enter any restaurant and his 
meal would be taken care of. The first big prep star in Orange County history, 
he was called "The Ghost of La Palma Park" because the lights were so bad at 
Glover Stadium, Flynn would disappear into the night on his long runs, such as 
the 95-yarder the first time he carried a football. He averaged 13.8 yards per 
carry in a three-year career that reached its zenith in front of 41,383 in a 
13-13 championship game against Downey and Flynn's so-called "Touchdown Twin," 
Randy Meadows; Flynn rushed 17 times for 134 yards and two touchdowns. The two 
rivals were in the same backfield a few months later at the Shrine All-Star 
game -- and 85,931 came out to watch it.

 G. Michele Granger's 75 m.p.h. fastball helped make her the world's best 
pitcher while still in high school; because of her dominance, coaches changed 
the way they taught hitting and the slap bunt became an everyday weapon. The 
left-hander was the U.S. Olympic Committee's softball player of the year in 
1986 and '87 while still at Valencia; she graduated in 1988 with national prep 
records for strikeouts in a career (1,687) and season (509), consecutive 
strikeouts (21), career no-hitters (37), perfect games (11) and victories (71). 
Her year-round pitching in high school, age-group, women's open and 
international competition led to a wrist injury from overuse her freshman year 
at California; although she was never the same after the injury, she set NCAA 
records for strikeouts (1,640), shutouts (94) and victories (94), among others.

 H. John Huarte's legend grew first as a Mater Dei quarterback who led the 
Monarchs to the 1960 Southern Section championship -- as expected. At Notre 
Dame, he led the Irish to a 9-1 season after the team had been 2-7 the year 
before -- and won the 1964 Heisman Trophy.

 I. Keith Iwanaga often took on bigger opponents who were cutting weight, but 
Iwanaga was a natural 123-pounder who won 1976 and '77 Southern Section titles 
for El Dorado's wrestling powerhouse. Iwanaga won with finesse, quickness and 
strength, and was the first of five wrestling brothers who followed him: Kevin, 
Kerry, Kent and Kyle.

 J. This letter is loaded with outstanding candidates, but Walter Johnson's 
fastball was loaded with high octane. The "Big Train" pitched for the 
Washington Senators from 1907 to 1927, set the standard for strikeout pitchers 
for the next 60 years, won 419 games and was an inaugural inductee into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. But long before he stood beside Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and 
Honus Wagner at the induction ceremonies, Johnson was playing hardball for 
Fullerton High. Even after he became a professional, Johnson called a 
15-inning, 0-0 tie in which he struck out 27 against Santa Ana his greatest 
game. Dr. Garland C. Ross played for Santa Ana that day in 1905 and recalled 
Johnson's fastball: "It came up to the plate like a pea shot out of a cannon. 
For the most part, we just went up to the plate, took three swings and walked 
back to the bench." Five years later, Johnson was baseball's dominant pitcher, 
winning 264 games over the next 10 years.

 K. Few dominated an event the way Fullerton's Natalie Kaaiawahia dominated the 
shotput. She is the only athlete, male or female, to win four State titles in 
the same event. Kaaiawahia, over the course of 1980-83 at Fullerton, put the 
top 10 girls' marks of all time, including a national prep record 53 feet 7 3/4 
inches in 1983 that still stands. She also won two State titles in the discus, 
including a county-record throw of 174-9.

 L. Rick Leach led Laguna Beach to two Southern Section titles, was a Southern 
Section singles finalist in 1981 and the champion in 1983. He went on to win 
NCAA individual doubles titles at USC and nearly $2 million in prize money and 
27 doubles titles as a professional, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. He 
also played on the U.S. Davis Cup team.

 M. Ann Meyers brought national attention to women's basketball. After 
receiving varsity letters in seven sports (field hockey, badminton, tennis, 
softball, volleyball, track, basketball) and graduating from Sonora in 1974, 
she became the first high school player to make the U.S. national team, became 
a four-time All-American at UCLA, led the U.S. team to a silver medal in the 
1976 Olympics and became the first woman to sign an NBA contract when she went 
to training camp with the Indiana Pacers. Meyers, the MVP her only year in the 
defunct Women's Basketball League, landed in the Basketball Hall of Fame; with 
her husband, the late Don Drysdale, they are the only husband-wife team in 
halls of fame.

 N. Phil Nevin, Baseball America's collegiate player of the year in 1992, was 
the first player selected, by the Houston Astros, in the June 1992 amateur 
baseball draft. But Nevin, who first excelled at El Dorado and Cal State 
Fullerton, also left his mark in the Orange County football record book. He 
holds the county record for longest field goal, making one from 57 yards in a 
game against Esperanza his senior season in 1988. He was the kicker for the 
Titan football team from 1989-91 and also led Fullerton to the 1992 College 
World Series.

where he has helped the Blue Devils reach the national championship game twice 
and win it once. In his senior year at Marina in 1991, the 6-11 center scored 
30 points -- 16 of them on dunks -- and blocked five shots to help the Vikings 
defeat top-ranked Mater Dei in the semifinals of the Division I-A playoffs, 
64-55, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 5,000 in the Bren Events

 Q. The most amazing thing about Dan Quisenberry is that he was so average at 
Costa Mesa, from where he graduated in 1971. Long before he became one of the 
best relief pitchers in baseball history as a submariner, Quisenberry went over 
the top with three-quarter tendencies, and met marginal success; he was a .500 
pitcher at Costa Mesa. "I was just a skinny kid that threw a lot of strikes," 
he said. "The only reason I was a prep legend is because I became good in the 
big leagues." Very good; his 277 saves, including 238 with the Kansas City 
Royals, put him in the top 10.

 T. Garry Templeton was a standout baseball and football star for Santa Ana 
Valley. He had already signed to play football at Arizona State when he became 
the 13th baseball player drafted in 1974. Claude Gilbert, the San Diego State 
coach when Templeton was a senior in high school, said: "He was a great 
cornerback talent; he could have been one hell of a football player, but the 
baseball draft settled his career." That career as a major league shortstop 
covered more than 15 years; he had a .271 career batting average and in 1979, 
he became the first of only two switch-hitters to get 100 hits from each side 
of the plate.

season, when he averaged 22 points and 14 rebounds. Though he had a 
fourth-grade reading level when he arrived, by his senior year, Usevitch was 
taking college prep courses. He averaged 15 points and seven rebounds at BYU,

SUPERVISORS FAVOR 3-YEAR EXTENSION FOR AHMANSON; SIMI HILLS: THREE BOARD 
MEMBERS DON'T FAULT DEVELOPER FOR ONGOING DELAYS. APPROVAL IN A VOTE TODAY 
WOULD EXTEND THE CONTRACT THROUGH 1998. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A majority of the Board of Supervisors apparently favors Ahmanson Land Co.'s 
request for a three-year extension of its deal to build a mini-city in the Simi 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to blame the developer for delays in turning over thousands of acres 
of public parkland, three of five supervisors said they tend to support 
Ahmanson's request today for a grace period that would extend its county 
contract through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, there is no controversy here," said Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, whose 
district includes Ahmanson Ranch. "The county routinely extends developments 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard also said she continues to support the Ahmanson 
project. And Supervisor John K. Flynn said he probably will vote for the 
contract extension after a 1:30 p.m. hearing at the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not changing anything, other than just the time frame," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing agreement calls for Ahmanson to acquire entertainer Bob Hope's 
Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon properties by December, 1995, and to sign over 
the 4,700 acres to state and federal park agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 If the company fails to deliver the parkland, the county will automatically 
revoke the developer's permits to build 3,050 dwellings, a town center, two 
golf courses and a 300-room hotel on rolling hills at the Los Angeles County 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamstrung by lawsuits that have stalled the project for two years, Ahmanson 
wants the deadline for acquiring Hope's properties extended to December, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups and nearby cities have joined Los Angeles County in 
legally challenging the project, arguing that it would clog area freeways with 
37,500 vehicle trips a day, and worsen San Fernando Valley smog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson's agreement with Ventura County requires that 10,000 acres of 
mountain ranch property be turned into public parks. But only part is now owned 
by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In gaining approval for its new community in late 1991, the company agreed to 
sell four Hope ranches totaling about 7,300 acres -- Jordan, Runkle, Corral 
Canyon and Liberty Canyon -- to park agencies for $29.5 million. Park officials 
considered that price far below market value. The company also agreed to donate 
2,600 acres of Ahmanson Ranch as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the lawsuits dragged on, park agencies decided to spend $26.7 million 
to buy just two of Hope's ranches, Jordan and Liberty Canyon. Still, as the 
deal is currently constructed, the park agencies would pay no more than $29.5 
million because of side agreements between the developer and park officials, 
they have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson's request for more time to turn over the 10,000 acres was rejected 
last month by county planning commissioners, who decided that the company knew 
lawsuits were inevitable when it agreed to the original deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and VanderKolk said that Ahmanson had no way of knowing how long the 
litigation would take, and should not be penalized for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 But park officials who helped negotiate the original deal are concerned that 
it may eventually fall apart, even with the new 1998 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Their main fear is that Ahmanson may one day offer to decrease the size of its 
project and offer cash incentives to the county, instead of delivering the 
promised parkland, said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that Ahmanson adheres to its agreement, Edmiston wants county 
officials to require the developer to do a costly new environmental study if 
any changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get that in writing," he said. "It should be etched in stone." 
</P>
<P>
 But VanderKolk and Howard said the Ahmanson deal is already airtight. The 
company must turn over the parkland before building a single structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in 1998, if they can't do it for whatever reason, they know they have no 
project," said VanderKolk, an architect of a compromise that increased parkland 
in the deal to 10,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Camp, Ahmanson's lead attorney on the project, declined Monday to 
comment on the company's request. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an earlier interview, Camp hinted that the developer may have trouble 
following through with the plan. He said Ahmanson had no idea how much Hope's 
properties would cost or even whether Hope still intends to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospect of acquiring the open space is uncertain," Camp said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 He said if Hope's ranches prove to be too expensive, the developer may ask the 
county for help in acquiring the property, possibly through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were to happen, he said, a court would decide on a price, and Ahmanson 
would then reimburse the county for its purchase.

 Hidden Valley resident Robert D. Nesen, former ambassador to Australia, will 
be honored as a "world citizen" by the Ventura County World Affairs Council, a 
council official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle and Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook are scheduled 
to present the award to Nesen during the "Passport to Tomorrow" conference 
Thursday at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 James R. Wilburn, former dean of Pepperdine University's School of Business 
and Management, will also be honored as a world citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Affairs Council's board of directors selected the two for their 
"significant contributions to international relations," council Executive 
Director Cynthia Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesen served as ambassador to Australia and to the tiny island country of 
Nauru during the Reagan Administration. He is chairman of Nesen Motor Car Co. 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilburn, a Malibu resident, was dean from 1982 until August, 1994. He has been

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY PANEL DECRIES GAS TAX INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A statewide ballot measure that would boost local funding for buses, trains 
and roads by more than $9 million a year is facing opposition from Ventura 
County leaders, who say the measure is confusing and restrictive.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 would increase the sales tax on gas by 4%, raising about $700 
million a year for transportation projects throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura County Transportation Commission is opposing the measure, 
saying it would force cities to spend money on public transit that is now used 
for streets and roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that's going to bring in more money for transportation sounds good," 
said Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis, who also serves on the transportation 
commission.  
</P>
<P>
 "But when you look at the small print, you see that this could take control 
away from the cities and the county and most likely create more bureaucracy in 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
 James Knox, campaign director for Yes on 185, said concerns over losing local 
control of funds are unfounded and that 75% of the money raised through the 
measure would be disbursed by transportation commissions like the one in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 As for concerns that cities would be forced to pay for buses and trains with 
money now used to fix potholes and install traffic signals, Knox said revenue 
generated by the new tax would more than make up for the loss.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is penny-wise and pound-foolish to make that argument," Knox said. "There 
would be plenty of new funds to make up the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's transportation planners remain unconvinced.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is too rigid and too far-reaching," said Carlos Hernandez, who analyzes 
legislation for the commission. "We do need more revenue, but we don't want to 
create more problems trying to get it." SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MEMORY LANE FOR LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You never know what's going to happen during an election debate. Just ask 
members of the League of Women Voters in Ventura County, who have been 
organizing candidate forums for the past 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll tell you about the city council candidate who didn't know anything 
about his city. Or the candidate for Congress who threatened to sue the 
nonprofit group unless it scheduled a forum to fit her calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most outrageous incident, league organizers say, was the time a 
process server interrupted a debate in Ojai to serve legal papers on a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caused a real brouhaha," recalled longtime league member Jean Harris. "The 
moderator from the League of Women Voters told the process server it was an 
inappropriate thing and got rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Such aplomb in the face of controversy has served the league well in the 35 
years since the county chapter was established in 1959, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan group, with 260 members countywide, is known for its ability 
to sponsor forums with no taint of favoritism, said Bruce Bradley, the county's 
election division chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they weren't here, who else would do it?" Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sponsoring candidate forums, the league's mission is to educate people 
about the democratic process and to issue position papers on topics of 
interest, said Dorothy Engel, president of the local chapter.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people opting out of elections nowadays," she said. "They 
distrust government. Yet they are the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1959, the local chapter has organized dozens of election debates, Engel 
said. On Thursday, it sponsored a forum involving 16 candidates running for the 
City Council in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the forums that stand out in Harris' mind occurred in past election 
seasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, a woman whom Harris declined to identify was running for 
Congress. She told the league she would file a lawsuit against it unless it 
scheduled a forum for a day when she was free. But every time a league 
organizer came up with a new time, the candidate turned it down, saying she 
wasn't available, Harris recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly every electoral cycle brings a candidate "who knows absolutely 
nothing" about the area he or she is seeking to represent, Harris said. KAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; ZOO FOR ENDANGERED ANIMALS IS PROPOSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A stretch of rolling hills between Simi Valley and Moorpark could become a zoo 
for endangered species under a proposal from a Los Angeles-based group, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zoological Society of Southern California is attempting to put together a 
deal to build the zoo on 115 acres at Oak Park, a county-owned park off Los 
Angeles Avenue, parks official Robert Amore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is asking the county for a guaranteed lease-option on the property 
for the next four years, while it attempts to secure financing and get approval 
for its plans from Ventura County, Amore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lease-option just reserves the site for them," he said. "It will help 
them when they go out to look for investors."  
</P>
<P>
 The park is used for overnight camping and day hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 The size and cost of the proposed zoo facility has yet to be determined, Amore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is scheduled to make a presentation with more specific information 
to the Moorpark City Council on Nov. 2 and to the county Parks and Harbor 
Commission on Nov. 16, Amore said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group will then take its proposal to the County Board of Supervisors for 
approval. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FIRM DONATES PHONES TO COMMUNITY PATROL

<P>
 A cellular telephone company has donated $10,000 in phones, voice mail boxes 
and phone service to Oxnard's Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular One's Ventura County office has agreed to give Neighborhood Watch 
members 25 telephones, allowing them immediate access to other watch members, 
police and emergency personnel.The phones will be carried by patrol leaders in 
each of the city's Neighborhood Watch areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they need to call police or an ambulance immediately but have no 
place to call from," said Sylvia Schnopp, marketing manager for Cellular One in 
Camarillo. "It takes them a couple of minutes, and those minutes can be 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the new program, titled "Cellular Community Watch," the 
Neighborhood Watch members will also receive voice mailboxes to leave messages 
for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was the brainchild of Gary London, an Oxnard Neighborhood Watch 
member and engineer with Cellular One. London asked the company to donate one 
or two phones and said he was surprised when they agreed to donate 25, along 
with free service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that they had quite a bit of Neighborhood Watch programs, and we 
wanted to provide enough for all of them," Schnopp said. "We realized that 
cellular service would be a great tool for them." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old Oxnard man, whose license is suspended because of a 
drunk-driving conviction, was being held in Ventura County Jail on Monday after 
allegedly slamming into a pickup truck in east Ventura and injuring the driver, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Victor Manuel Manrique about 11 p.m. Sunday, after spotting 
his car in El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found several empty containers of alcoholic beverages inside 
Manrique's car, police said. He was booked into jail on suspicion of felony 
drunk driving and hit-and-run, and was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Manrique plowed into the rear of a truck driven by Ruben 
Gaeta, 35, of Santa Paula while Gaeta was stopped at a red light on Wells Road 
in east Ventura. Gaeta suffered minor injuries in the accident, which occurred 
just before 9 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manrique hesitated, then sped away from the scene, according to a witness who 
scribbled down the suspect's license plate and a description of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 After police traced the vehicle registration to El Rio and arrested Manrique, 
the suspect admitted to being involved in a second hit-and-run accident earlier 
Sunday in Santa Paula.  
</P>
<P>
 Manrique is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on 
Wednesday. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; HARBOR REVENUES UP $1 MILLION LAST 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operating revenues at the deep-water Port of Hueneme increased about $1 
million last year to $6.1 million -- their highest total ever, a study has 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 A record number of commercial vessels -- 278 -- passed through the port in the 
fiscal year ending June 30, and workers handled 790,000 tons of cargo, a jump 
of about 26%, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases were largely due to new business, said Raymond E. Fosse, 
president of the Oxnard Harbor District's Board of Commissioners, which manages 
the port.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it verified what we had anticipated, looking at the business that we 
had brought in and what we had before," Fosse said of the study. "We knew it 
had to be going up." 
</P>
<P>
 The first comprehensive study on the harbor since 1989, conducted by the 
consulting firm of Leeper, Cambridge and Campbell, also found that the harbor 
currently generates about 2,500 jobs in the county and brings in $275 million 
in economic benefits. That is an increase of $75 million and 500 jobs compared 
to five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the Oxnard Harbor District has attracted Cool Carriers and its 
customer Sunkist Growers. Other firms that have started using the port include 
Land Rover/Range Rover and Mitsubishi Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bananas accounted for 23.9% of the port's cargo, and other fresh fruit 
accounts for 22.6%, while automobiles make up 13.9% of shipments. MIGUEL 
BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON PARKLAND PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council is scheduled to vote tonight on a proposal to buy an 
acre of land to be converted to a park at the city's western entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of the land is tied to a move by the Bronk Vreeland Ojai Ford 
dealership, which plans to buy the other two-thirds of the parcel as a new home 
for the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific Lines has owned the three-acre plot, which once included a 
railroad depot, since 1898. The land sits at the southwest corner of the 
junction of California 33 and 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing the park will allow the city to preserve several oak trees on the 
site and build a small parking lot to serve users of the Ojai bike trail, City 
Manager Andrew Belknap said. JULIE FIELDS

OXNARD SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, 1 CRITICALLY WOUNDED; CRIME: POLICE SAY THEY ARE 
SEARCHING FOR A SUSPECT WHO FLED THE APARTMENT AND WAS KNOWN BY THE VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A shooting in a south Oxnard apartment left one man dead and another 
critically wounded Monday afternoon, as police searched for at least one 
suspect who fled the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard firefighters found Jerome Hurst, 25, of Oxnard dead on the living room 
floor of the apartment in the 1400 block of Friedrich Lane shortly before 2 
p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon Hunter, 27, who lives at the apartment with his girlfriend and two 
children, was found outside lying on a neighbor's doorstep bleeding from 
multiple gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter underwent surgery at St. John's Regional Medical Center and was listed 
in critical condition Monday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to calls from neighbors who heard gunshots and Hunter's cries for 
help, firefighters first found Hunter and then discovered Hurst's body inside 
the apartment after asking neighbors where Hunter lived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst, who worked at Furr's Cafeteria on Channel Islands Boulevard, was shot 
multiple times in his upper body, police said. He was dead by the time 
firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no vital signs," Oxnard Fire Capt. George Todd said. "We connected 
him to a heart monitor and it was flat-lined." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter was also shot multiple times. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd said it appeared Hunter had been shot three times, twice in the back and 
once on the side of the neck. One of the bullets passed through Hunter's body 
and exited through his chest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the wounds, Hunter managed to get out of the apartment. "He staggered 
outside to a neighbor's door and banged on the door," Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was able to tell authorities about the shooting, Police Sgt. Charles 
Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was not gang- or drug-related, Dunham said. Police also said 
neither Hunter nor Hurst had been robbed. But the victims knew the person who 
shot them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person showed up and shot them," Dunham said. But, first, "there was an 
exchange" of words. "We're still trying to identify the person we're looking 
for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham also said police believe they know the motive behind the shooting, 
although he refused to disclose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Hunter, his girlfriend and her young son and daughter had moved 
to the apartment complex about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The children often played outside with neighbors' youngsters. And residents 
said they saw Hunter, who friends said is currently unemployed, working on his 
car in the back alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very good neighbors," Maria Garibay said. "We've never had problems 
with them."

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; ANONYMOUS DEATH THREATS ARE REPORTED BY 
CANDIDATE; CAMPAIGN: MICHAEL FRIEDMAN SAYS HIS TIRES WERE SLASHED SUNDAY. THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council candidate Michael Friedman, who has built his 
long-shot campaign around denouncing incumbent Elois Zeanah, said Monday that 
he has received three anonymous death threats and had his truck tires slashed 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies are investigating both the death threats -- 
left on Friedman's answering machine in a raspy, menacing voice -- and the 
tire-slashing incident, which occurred late Sunday night outside his home in 
the Wildwood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just pretend it's nothing," Police Cmdr. Kathy Kemp said. "You 
can't just say, 'Oh, that's what happens to candidates,' and blow it off. We 
need to try to do some follow-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had not read the police report on the tire-slashing, Kemp said 
she was concerned that the culprits had apparently tracked Friedman's red Isuzu 
Rodeo truck after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the fact that someone knows where he lives and has taken an act of 
vandalism against him . . . (shows) that this has become a lot more personal," 
Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he believes the attacks have come from Zeanah's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Zeanah condemned the threats and vandalism as unfortunate and 
said her camp had nothing to do with the incidents. "I don't know where it 
could be coming from," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27-year-old financial services manager, Friedman launched his campaign in 
July by focusing primarily on family issues. He emphasized that he was born and 
raised in Thousand Oaks, and he called for more library reading programs and 
expanded crossing-guard service. 
</P>
<P>
 But after receiving a $13,000 contribution from car dealers at the Thousand 
Oaks Auto Mall last month, Friedman went on the offensive. A staunch business 
advocate, he has fired barbs at Zeanah in campaign forums, newspaper ads and 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman has accused Zeanah of trying to block business expansion by voting 
against new sign programs in The Oaks and Janss malls. He also has criticized 
her for opposing the Redevelopment Agency created to spruce up Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 And his new-found aggression, combined with his much-publicized boost from the 
auto mall association, has apparently attracted attention, Friedman speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must be getting my message across to someone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the death threats, Friedman said he has hired a private 
security firm to drive past both his home and his office three times a day. 
Plus, he said wryly, "I've learned never to buy brand-new tires before a 
political campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies plan to question Wildwood residents about any suspicious 
activity they may have seen Sunday night, when someone punctured all four of 
the tires on Friedman's truck shortly after the candidate returned home from 
checking on his campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of have to take this seriously because it's gone from Step 1 to Step 
2," Sgt. David Paige said. "Thousands of people get (threatening) phone calls. 
Now someone's taken it a step further and punctured this guy's tires." 
</P>
<P>
 Paige cautioned, however, that Friedman's enemies could be targeting him for 
any number of reasons -- not just his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he do it because (Friedman) is a political figure, or because . . . he 
doesn't like the way his dog barks?" Paige said. "We don't know, but we don't 
wish to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Paige said he had not heard about threats against any of the 15 other 
candidates vying for three open council seats. Seven of those candidates on 
Monday confirmed that they have received no unusual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the crazies calling at all hours in the morning to talk politics," 
candidate David Hare said, "but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Dixon, a retired businessman who has lambasted Zeanah, said he has 
received little flak for his public pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't stepped on anyone's toes," Dixon said. "At least, not too badly."

AHMANSON DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors hold a public hearing today to consider a request 
by Ahmanson Land Co. for a three-year extension to their development agreement. 
That Ahmanson even has the nerve to ask proves once again how well the public 
has been misinformed regarding their project. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ventura County supervisors approved Ahmanson Ranch, they insisted 
Ahmanson "cause to be transferred" to the public four properties belonging to 
Bob Hope before the new city could be built (coincidentally on open space). The 
development agreement between Ahmanson and Ventura County had a very specific 
drop-dead clause -- if for any reason at all this was not done within three 
years, no project. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years later, Ahmanson officials are back asking for another 
three years to meet their obligations. They cite nine lawsuits delaying them, 
but fail to mention the extensive clauses they wrote into their development 
agreement protecting themselves with more time from expected lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project dies, what happens? Supervisor Maria VanderKolk has protected 
Jordan Ranch and Liberty Canyon -- bought by the public not because of 
Ahmanson, but in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Ranch reverts back to open space, at an acquisition price Ahmanson 
would gladly take to get off the hook. The price of Bob Hope's last parcels 
(Runkle and Corral) to the public will drop dramatically once nobody is 
fighting over it as a precondition anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson knew the deal and risks up front. Ahmanson deserves no extensions of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 JANICE LEE 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The much-ballyhooed Ahmanson deal is quite different than originally promoted. 
The much-touted public benefits are sloughing off, leaving only the development 
with all the damage it will do and its grab for the public purse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Conservancy committed $29.5 million of public funds toward 
the purchase of four canyons which, once in public ownership, gives Ahmanson 
the go-ahead. Why should the conservancy, an agency charged with protecting the 
natural values of our mountains, use public money to help Ahmanson build its 
environmentally destructive mini-city polluting Malibu Creek all the way to 
Santa Monica Bay? 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon owners, not having signed the agreement, set their own price. With 
only two of the four canyons purchased, the money is gone. Ahmanson's lawyers 
state it, too, is probably unable to purchase the remaining canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is likely to buy Ahmanson's promised "donation" of 2,600 acres as 
well. Turns out this was not a "donation" but a "dedication" the public may 
have to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelioration of the gridlock on this part of the Ventura Freeway (over 18,000 
additional daily trips at Las Virgenes Road) will come from public funds as 
well, not Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ahmanson has the nerve to ask Ventura County supervisors for more time. 
The Ahmanson project is out of control. Stop using public money to promote this 
fiasco.

MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a survivor of continual and indiscriminate DDT spraying of the Central 
Valley in the '40s and '50s, I am aghast that our local politicians lead us 
like sheep to the long incremental slaughter by degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 DDT has now been linked to increased estrogen production in humans, inducing a 
cancer-promoting environment and male infertility.Increases in breast and 
prostate cancer are possibly linked to the coast-to-coast spraying of cities 
and farms to eradicate mosquitoes. At that time the experts said, "It is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are still saying poisons are safe. Do we continue to be led into 
benign suicide? As a taxpayer do I become a participant in the poisoning of my 
fellow citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, citizens of Ventura County. The clock is ticking.

 I wonder if public officials realize the feelings of powerlessness and 
frustrations that they are causing in citizens they are supposed to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 In its own "Health Risk Assessment of Aerial Application of Malathion Bait" by 
the California state Department of Health Services, Ken Kizer, director, stated 
in February, 1991: "CDHS recommends that aerial application in urban areas be 
reconsidered and that (the state Department of Food and Agriculture) develop, 
and when possible, utilize non-pesticide or select pesticide alternatives to 
aerial application of malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers have their own organizations and they are evident in the Medfly and 
malathion issue. The average citizens, who are being aerial-sprayed for six 
months, have no representation in this matter so crucial to them.

 I own a lemon orchard near the epicenter of the recent Medfly eruption in 
Ventura County. My only hope is that some environmentalist does not identify 
this pest as an endangered species.

PROBST LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your recent articles made it sound like the Thousand Oaks City Council 
shamefully abandoned all of its principles when it recently approved the appeal 
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Probst to landscape their hillside on Westlake 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 What the articles did not make clear was that the Planning Commission's own 
staff approved the project, that the homeowners association gave its blessing 
to the landscaping (but not the related storage facility), that the Probst's 
property is not contiguous to any existing dedicated open space (and is located 
amid other fully landscaped, residential properties) and that the proposed 
park-like project is fully supported by the great majority of the area's 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is to be commended for its wise decision and Westlake 
Village/Thousand Oaks will be even more visually attractive as a consequence.

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA

<P>
 Such a pretentious piece by Josef Woodard in Ventura County Life for Oct. 13, 
on the architecture of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Most American prisons have more outward appeal. But, of course, the Thousand 
Oaks City Council could have gotten a prefab design for $29.95. You have to 
spend the real dough to create an abortion.

FREEWAY SPEEDING

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a comment about the speed on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 People are driving at 80-90 m.p.h. and tailgating, and nobody uses their turn 
signals. They go from the fast lane up to the next off-ramp and almost collide 
into you. I think people should slow down or they should use their signals and 
be more courteous. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gas crunch comes and gas is $3 a gallon, these people in their Ford 
Explorers and big 4x4 trucks are going to be sorry.

AGE OF THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your front-page story about "two independent teams of distinguished 
astronomers" announcing that "the universe may be only about half as old as the 
oldest stars and galaxies it contains," makes these star-searchers sound as 
though their elevators don't run all the way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Try this on for size: If there ever was a time when there was absolutely 
nothing, there would still be absolutely nothing.Maybe these "distinguished" 
astronomers haven't realized that you can't make something out of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, I found that out in the seventh grade when I turned in my Algebra I term 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 There never was a beginning to the universe and there can be no end. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything that exists has always existed. 
</P>
<P>
 All known space and matter are without age. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an end to space, what's there? A wall? There's no such thing as a 
one-sided wall, you know, so what's on the other side of that wall? More space? 
If there's no wall, what marks the end of space? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this universe suspended in another larger universe? Describe that 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Please tell these "teams of distinguished astronomers" that they better try to 
figure out this conundrum: If you get a doctor to your home at night, and keep 
him there till daylight, does it then become a day call?

ELECTIONS / MOORPARK SCHOOL BOARD; BUDGET PROBLEMS CALLED TOP ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four contenders for two seats on the Moorpark school board are all talking 
about money -- or the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A projected $1-million annual deficit and protracted salary negotiations with 
angry teachers have two incumbents and two challengers all playing up their 
abilities to manage Moorpark's $23-million budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Pam Castro and Gary Cabriales are competing for new four-year terms 
against longtime school district activists Ted Green and David Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the rest of the field, Castro, a 42-year-old director of a Moorpark 
preschool, said the financial woes of the nine-school district are impossible 
for the candidates to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is elected will have to have the temperament and understanding to 
deal with the financial constraints we are now under," she said. "Really anyone 
running for a school board in California is going to have to deal with 
declining revenue from the state and federal government."  
</P>
<P>
 Just how they will deal with money matters is where the candidates start to 
part company. Castro cites her five years of school board experience, saying 
that she knows where to look to make cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales, 38, who has served on the board since a special election last year, 
points to his leadership experience. A former Air Force captain and now an 
airline pilot, he said he would keep the board focused on solving the 
district's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he can find compromises during the difficult budget process and during 
negotiations with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's rift with teachers has become a particularly sensitive local 
issue since the school year started with teachers on the picket line, demanding 
a contract and a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've been diverted from focusing on the real issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales' comments were a subtle swipe at conservative challenger Ted Green, 
47, an auditor for the IRS who has repeatedly attacked the board for allowing 
what he calls racist and sexually explicit books on student reading lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who was recently endorsed by the local chapter of the California 
Republican Assembly, said that while he still decries books he finds offensive, 
his number one priority would be to improve the district's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the race is David Pollock, 33, a corporate planner for Rockwell 
International. Pollock, who along with Cabriales was endorsed by the Moorpark 
teachers union, said he plans on pushing for better long-range planning to deal 
with budget woes.

HALLOWEEN PARADE ON PROWL FOR ENTRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanted: ghouls, ghosts, gremlins and other terrifying creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the call being put out by organizers of the Calabasas Days Halloween 
Parade to be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries will be accepted until Thursday, organizers say. All it takes to 
qualify is to bring costumes that show lots of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the parade to be known as the biggest Halloween parade in the West," 
said Laura Marcinik, the parade's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday night, there were 40 entrants -- or about 600 marchers of all 
ages -- said Marcinik. Those who want to enter can contact Marcinik, (818) 
591-9153, Ext. 243. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade begins at 4 p.m. and will last about an hour, Marcinik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will proceed down Calabasas Road through Old Town to Park Centre, 
where it will turn left and disband at Park Sorrento.

CLIPPER UPDATE; AN UNTIMELY COURT DATE FOR ROBERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper center Stanley Roberts, who began working out with the team last 
Friday after reporting to camp overweight, will skip the final two days of 
two-a-day workouts because he had to fly to Raleigh, N.C., Monday morning for 
an appearance today in traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who got a speeding ticket while he was at the Duke Diet and Fitness 
Center last summer, was ordered to appear after failing to appear at the 
original hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper officials were not happy about Roberts' absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch said Roberts did extra work at Sunday night's practice and 
was given a conditioning program to follow while he is away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him an extra dose when the rest of the guys were taking naps," Fitch 
said. "But he'll miss the scrimmage part. He'll miss two conditioning 
(workouts), but we've been double hard on him. He's got a routine he has to do 
while he's on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch also thinks he might have cured Roberts of speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing him speed out of the parking lot after a Clipper practice, Fitch 
ordered Roberts to run extra laps as punishment. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Harold Ellis sprained his right ankle when he landed awkwardly when he 
tried to block a shot in a scrimmage Monday night. The severity of the injury 
was not immediately known, but Ellis was taken to an emergency room for X-rays, 
which were negative. Ellis, who had never sprained an ankle before, was in 
considerable pain. He thinks the injury might have occurred because he was 
wearing new shoes that offered no ankle support. . . . Rookie forward Lamond 
Murray, who signed a $13.5-million, five-year contract Friday, is expected to 
make his NBA debut in Wednesday night's exhibition against the Atlanta Hawks at 
the Sports Arena. . . . Terry Dehere, who was drafted as a shooting guard last 
season, was used at point guard in Saturday's 114-109 exhibition victory over 
the Sacramento Kings.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; POLOWSKI WONDERING WHERE SOCCER WILL TAKE HIM 
NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If he played basketball, P.J. Polowski would be looking forward to a salary 
cap he could wear like a platinum crown. The signing bonus alone would be 
equivalent to winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he just kicked footballs, he probably would be looking forward to 
making almost $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Polowski is making his mark in collegiate soccer. He is the No. 2 goal 
scorer in the nation, putting the ball into the net 18 times in 16 games. In 
two seasons since transferring from Orange Coast College, he has equaled UC 
Irvine's all-time scoring record with 70 points. This week, he probably will 
break it during one of the Anteaters' final three games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the burning question: Where to now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I really have no idea," he said. "I hope it doesn't end. It is 
kind of weird. What do you do with a hot streak when the last game ends?" 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Derek Lawther has some suggestions, if not all the answers. And he is 
sure of one thing: Polowski should do anything he can to extend the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to do something right away," Lawther said. "He's got to keep this 
momentum and try to maintain the flair he's got going right now." 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't a lot of options at the moment. Lawther believes Polowski has a 
good chance to play professional indoor soccer -- "He's tall, but he turns very 
quickly with the ball and that's what you need in that league," he says -- but 
the Continental Indoor Soccer League doesn't start until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played indoor for fun and I love it," Polowski said. "I never really 
thought about playing it professionally, but a lot of the guys I know who are 
playing say it's not really such a big jump as you might think. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different. It's a lot quicker. It's not who's fast, it's who can get 
five yards the quickest. There are some recreational indoor leagues around the 
county and I'm going to jump into those fun leagues just to keep in touch with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawther plans to talk to Salsa General Manager/Coach Rick Davis, who once 
played for Lawther on a club team, but Polowski would probably do more sitting 
than playing for the first year or two at the American Professional Soccer 
League level. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Major League Soccer -- a new pro league in the forming 
stages -- but nobody is paying or playing yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Polowski definitely will play for a Costa Mesa club team, but that pace is a 
level below collegiate and he needs to make a step up, not down. He's keen on 
the idea of going to Europe to play soccer, a year-round addiction in that part 
of the world, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get him fixed up in Europe for a few months if that's what's needed," 
Lawther said, "but I'd like to see him play here if possible, everyone's 
beginning to know him and to talk about him around here and it'd be nice to 
springboard off of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, over there, anywhere would be the cat's pajamas for P.J. So Polowski 
will work to stay fit and confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys say that when the season's over, that's it for them," 
Polowski said, "but I really hope it's not for me. Getting paid to play soccer 
would be incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to go overseas and play, even in the lower divisions. You're still 
playing the game you love and getting paid for it. Can you imagine waking up in 
the morning, going to a couple of practices or playing a game and then going 
home and saying you did your job? 
</P>
<P>
 "People always say, 'Get into an occupation you'll enjoy.' Well, for me, 
that's the ultimate description of having a job you love." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How does he do that? After scoring 11 goals last season, Polowski figured to 
be a well-marked man this year. The double-teams have done little to stop the 
scoring spree, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I got more (scoring) chances last year, but this season, I'm making 
the most of the opportunities," Polowski said. "And there are different players 
around me this year. I'm getting more one-on-one situations because Rich Breza 
is in the middle and he's marked by two or three guys because he's winning 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, I'm the type of player who manages to be in the right place at the 
right time a lot. I'm able to anticipate plays before they happen. I see how 
things can go wrong and I'm prepared to capitalize." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No fun run: The Big West Conference cross-country championships are scheduled 
this weekend at Utah State, a pretty little campus set in the Wasatch 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 5,000 feet in the Wasatch Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not going to go up there and spend weeks adjusting, you just go in 
and race," Coach Vince O'Boyle said. "If you're not in shape, you'll feel the 
oxygen debt. But with the shape we're in right now, studies show that you're 
not going to be affected that much if you're there for a short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to change your race strategy a little, but it shouldn't be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy to say when you're not the one gasping for air. But O'Boyle has 
reason to feel good about the conference races. The Irvine women's team is one 
of the favorites to win and the men's team, almost a nonentity two years ago 
because of budget cuts, is back and pushing the conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the women's side, it should be between UC Santa Barbara and us," O'Boyle 
said. "Santa Barbara runs really well as a pack. I've been holding (sophomore 
Laura) Monson back, but I think we'll let her go out and do her thing and then 
the rest will try to match up and break them up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteater women are talented but not very experienced. Three of their seven 
competitors are freshmen. Only one is a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can break down to a bunch of one-on-one races," O'Boyle said. "The girls 
all know each other and who they have to beat, but we're going to try and focus 
on ourselves. We'll do what we do and if we're with Santa Barbara, fine. If 
we're ahead, great. If we're behind, don't panic, just start to go after some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara and host Utah State are co-favorites in the men's race, but a 
second- or even third-place finish would be special for O'Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these guys race the way they work out, it would surprise me but it 
wouldn't shock me if they won it," O'Boyle said. "They have worked incredibly 
hard to prove this program is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a program that has no scholarships and beating any program that does 
will be fun in itself. But with these guys, who are out here because they want 
to be and for no other reason, it will be very satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking guys to this conference meet who have never been recruited in 
their lives. We gave them a uniform and a pair of shoes and they've run with 
them." Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Myron McNamara, who was head tennis coach at Irvine from 1966-79 and guided 
the Anteaters to six Division II titles, has rejoined the staff as an assistant 
to Steve Clark. "It wasn't a hard decision," McNamara said. "I love tennis. I 
love working with young people. And this is what I do." . . . The men's and 
women's basketball teams will make their public debut Sunday between 3 and 6 
p.m. during blue-and-gold scrimmages in the Bren Center. Admission is free.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; COACH MCDONALD HOPES THE 49ERS CAN 
BOUNCE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened to the 49er women's basketball program is as common in big-time 
college basketball as turnovers and buzzer-beaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The story goes like this: longtime successful coach leaves for greener 
pastures, coach's chief assistant takes over team, new coach works to put 
his/her stamp on program and team hits rock bottom -- in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ending? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that remains to be seen. But Coach Glenn McDonald sure expects happier 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I really believe," McDonald said. "The players believe they're 
going to have a very, very good year, and that helps a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are really anxious about this season. The returners saw games last 
season they should have won that they didn't pull out at the end. I think 
that's going to change. That should be a big change." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, does McDonald hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a perennial power, the 49ers have spent the last two seasons looking up 
at teams they used to stomp with regularity. Long Beach hasn't exactly been the 
Big West Conference's doormat, but teams don't recoil in the 49ers' presence 
nearly as much as they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three seasons since McDonald succeeded former Coach Joan Bonvicini, who 
left to take control of Arizona's program, the team is a very un- 49er like 
41-44, including 20-34 the last two seasons. Long Beach was 21-10 in McDonald's 
first season, but then the road became rocky. Last season, the team finished 
11-17 and tied for seventh in the conference at 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald was one of Bonvicini's aides from 1986-91, during which time the 
49ers won four conference titles and made two appearances in the Final Four. 
Since it first fielded a women's team in 1962-63, Long Beach has won 21 
conference titles. Moreover, Long Beach has compiled a record of 575-188 
(75.4%), the most women's basketball victories of any NCAA school. 
</P>
<P>
 Glorious history is great for waxing nostalgic at alumni parties, but it won't 
help you break a full-court press. McDonald spent more time than he cared to 
over the last three seasons trying to persuade his charges to focus on the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, (the players) felt that when they stepped on the floor they were 
going to win games," he said. "They didn't realize that (teams) really wanted 
to jump on Long Beach State because of past experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think the players understand what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of McDonald's optimism is based on the fact that eight players return 
from last season, including talented senior center Melissa Gower. Gower (6 feet 
2) was selected second-team all-conference as a junior after averaging 15.8 
points and 9.6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald also expects big contributions from senior guard Michelle Miller (4.6 
points), junior guard Akia Hardy (4.4) and junior forward Kim Barfield (5.4, 
4.2 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody now on this team is my player," McDonald said. "There are no more 
leftovers, and I think that makes a big difference. I had to get rid of some 
people who were disrupting the team, and some people who didn't want to go to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got rid of those people, and the ones who are here now are students opposed 
to just basketball players, but they're also focused and committed to winning." 
</P>
<P>
 And with a little luck, McDonald believes, this story might wind up with a 
happy ending for the 49ers after all. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Denied: The NCAA last week denied a university appeal to overturn the 
ineligibility of three water polo players stemming from a misinterpretation of 
rules by Long Beach officials, said Mary Ann Tripodi, Long Beach director of 
compliance and student services. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Terry Romine and Trevor Wiens, and sophomore Adam Lee cannot play for 
the 49ers again this season because they failed to make satisfactory progress 
toward degrees, the NCAA Eligibility Committee ruled. The students, however, 
are in fact making solid progress toward their degrees, Coach Ken Lindgren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, the team's starting goalkeeper, has not played since Sept. 29. Romine and 
Wiens have been out of the lineup since Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindgren said university officials wrongly advised the students about 
selecting the proper courses for their majors in order to remain eligible under 
NCAA guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely frustrating because they were following directions on what 
to do," Lindgren said. "They all thought they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just following the path they were told to take, but I don't think 
you can point the finger at any one person on campus. It was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has two years of eligibility remaining. Tripodi said the university plans 
to file another appeal to request Romine and Wiens be granted another year of 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to get this year back," she said. "Basically, we're going 
to try to get their clocks extended." 
</P>
<P>
 Tripodi said the NCAA often grants fifth years of eligibility for extenuating 
circumstances but declined to comment on this latest appeal's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just another headache for Lindgren, whose team has been hit hard by 
injuries. Long Beach is 4-13, 0-6 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having them back would obviously help our team, but my main concern is them 
losing a year," Lindgren said. "I feel terrible about that." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West Conference named senior middle blocker Traci Dahl player of the 
week (Oct. 17-23), the second consecutive week a 49er has won the award. Dahl 
led the 49ers, ranked 10th in the nation by the American Volleyball Coaches 
Assn. and Volleyball Monthly magazine, to road victories over Nevada (16-18, 
15-1, 15-8, 15-0) and New Mexico State (15-7, 15-3, 15-5). She totaled 36 kills 
in the two matches, including a career-high 23 kills against Nevada. Senior 
outside hitter Nichelle Burton received the distinction last week (Oct. 10-16). 
. . . Long Beach and Santa Barbara, ranked No. 8, meet in a conference 
volleyball showdown Friday at The Gold Mine. The 49ers (15-3, 10-1 in 
conference) trail conference-leading Hawaii by one-half game. Santa Barbara 
(19-2, 8-1) is third. The 49ers lost an intense match to the Gauchos on Oct. 1 
at Santa Barbara, 11-15, 15-10, 15-12, 6-15, 15-8. . . . The men's 
cross-country team finished fourth in the Bronco Invitational at Pomona. Pat 
Bendzick finished second with a time of 25 minutes 32 seconds for eight 
kilometers.

PREP NOTEBOOK: BUENA PARK COACH SAYS TEAM HURT BY 'BLOOD RULE,' SEEKS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buena Park football Coach Bob Rau says he speaks for several coaches who 
believe there needs to be a change in the "blood rule," which calls for the 
immediate removal from the field of a bleeding player and keeps him out until 
the wound is covered. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 28-14 loss Friday to Sonora, Rau's Coyotes were driving inside the 
Sonora 20 with about six minutes left when quarterback David Barrios was forced 
to the sideline with a cut elbow. Buena Park had to run two plays without him; 
the plays did not work, and the Coyotes did not score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we would have won the game," Rau said. "But if we score there, 
the game does change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule is supposed to be applied evenly, but instead it creates unfairness. 
A team wearing a dark jersey, you'll never know if they're bleeding. But a team 
wearing white, like we were, is dead meat. At least you're going to see blood 
on white a lot quicker than on the dark jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what the answer is. It's a National Federation rule and they are 
hard to change. But I'm going to bring the issue up again at the Southern 
California Interscholastic Football Coaches meeting after the season. Something 
has to be done. Sooner or later every coach is going to have his game affected 
because of this. The games should be won or lost on an equity basis." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last week's projection on Reuben Droughns' career rushing total came under 
scrutiny and, after using much more sound mathematics, has been revised. The 
Anaheim tailback, before Thursday's 120-yard performance, had averaged 167.5 
yards per game. Assuming he plays another 15 games -- this season, next season 
and two playoff games -- Droughns will finish with 5,615 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing at that pace, if Anaheim reaches the second round of the playoffs 
this year and next (18 games), the projection rises to 6,031 yards -- far 
surpassing Ray Pallares' Orange County record of 5,396. 
</P>

 Five of Orange County's top 10 water polo teams -- No. 1 Corona del Mar, No. 3 
Foothill, No. 5 El Toro, No. 6 Esperanza and No. 9 Newport Harbor -- will play 
in the California State Invitational Friday and Saturday at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar is the defending champion; the tournament features eight teams 
each from southern and northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best cross-country matchups this week take place in girls' competition. 
The biggest dual meet is on Thursday in the Sea View League, where 
eighth-ranked Corona del Mar (3-0) and Santa Margarita (2-1) are at 
second-ranked El Toro (2-1). Also Thursday in the Sunset League, third-ranked 
Esperanza (4-0) runs at Los Alamitos (3-1).

 Irvine's 26-0 football victory over Woodbridge ended the Vaqueros' four-game 
losing streak and, on the surface, appeared to be quite an upset over the 
Warriors (5-2). But Irvine's four losses -- to Anaheim, Moreno Valley Canyon 
Springs, Mater Dei and Newport Harbor -- are to teams that currently have a 
combined 25-2-1 record.
