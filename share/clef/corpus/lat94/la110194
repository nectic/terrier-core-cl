THEATER REVIEW; HOW TO SUCCEED IN REVIVAL 'BUSINESS'; LA JOLLA PRODUCTION, EN 
ROUTE TO BROADWAY, IS A VISUAL TREAT AND SHOWCASE FOR COMPANY TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're going to revive a 1961 musical with a song called "A Secretary Is 
Not a Toy," you'd better do it all the way -- brash and smart and unabashed. 
From the thrilling opening notes of its overture, "How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying" announces it is all that, and more. Director Des McAnuff 
has the visual daring and sheer chutzpah to deliver the goods, and he does, in 
this, his farewell production as artistic director at the La Jolla Playhouse, a 
theater he has made into one of the most exciting in the country. His legacy to 
successor Michael Greif is an old theatrical one: a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of which, how about trying to follow the unforgettable Robert Morse 
in the role of Finch, the impossibly lovable amoral window-washer who climbs to 
the true top of the huge World Wide Wicket Company in a matter of weeks with 
the help of a little book and the woman who loves him? Matthew Broderick uses 
his famous tentativeness to create a comic timing and a Finch all his own, one 
whose back-stabbing is a complete pleasure to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance works best when Finch himself is tentative, such as in the 
number that shows off his boyish flirting, "Been a Long Day," and especially in 
the hilarious "Grand Old Ivy," when he pretends to know the college song of the 
firm's firm-voiced president, J. B. Biggley (Robert Mandan). But in the title 
song, an ode to ambition, his Finch is nowhere near "burning hot with 
front-office fever," as one jealous executive puts it. Broderick sticks close 
to the song's meter and likewise to Wayne Cilento's simple but elegant 
choreography for him throughout the show. He never really lets himself go, 
although he may become more comfortable in time. Still, his performance points 
up how difficult it is for actors who work primarily in film to embrace that 
high voltage, take-the-stage-or-die Broadway musical style that Morse embodied. 
</P>
<P>
 That fabulous aesthetic, though, is far from dead. Witness Jonathan Freeman as 
the unctuous personnel manager Bratt, and Broadway lives again. Taking his 
place alongside such physical-comedy greats as Jackie Gleason and Nathan Lane, 
Freeman is brilliantly hammy as the middle management executive who can turn 
from imperious to a toadying clown with the ring of a phone. In "A Secretary Is 
Not a Toy," he sternly lectures the men in the company, but, confronted with 
the hips of Hedy La Rue (Luba Mason), the "bubble-headed tomato" who Biggley is 
forcing him to hire, his jowls and shoulders dance unwittingly, conveying a 
different message entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McAnuff revives and reinvigorates the old style razzle-dazzle 
with amazing visual treats (thanks in large part to computerized images) as fun 
and animated as those in a Disney musical, with the sophistication of classic 
Manhattan deco thrown in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With music and lyrics by the master Frank Loesser and an Abe Burrows/Jack 
Weinstock/Willie Gilbert book that is as cunning and likable as its hero, "How 
to Succeed" offers an environment in which a secretary may at any moment be 
pinched, but where it is also permissible to smack an executive's face. The 
male executive/ female secretary division is externally imposed; it clearly has 
no relation to intelligence whatsoever. As for the original all-white office, 
it has been integrated, no explanation necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Set designer John Arnone and video designers Batwin-Robin Productions have 
cast the Manhattan skyscraper as a leading role in the production. The great 
office walls are grids of light and color, a la Piet Mondrian's "Broadway 
Boogie Woogie" but with pastels merrily offsetting the painter's primary 
palette. The walls whirl and blink at exciting events such as the descent of an 
elevator, and the skyline in the background also shifts radically for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting designer Howell Binkley bathes these walls in rich tones, most 
memorably in a brilliant amber for a sentimental love song between two expert 
connivers, Biggley and La Rue.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more fun, the Manhattan skyline in the background takes a turn whenever a 
character striding down a corridor does. And when Rosemary dreams of her 
marriage to Finch in "Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm," the computer takes us, as 
if by helicopter, zooming over the George Washington Bridge to encircle her 
suburban dream house, and descends right down to her peach-rimmed, 
periwinkle-blue front door with the little love-bird knockers. Visually, this 
production is a complete trip. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rosemary, Megan Mullally is a nasal, fast-thinking, wisecracking doll, a 
kind of Barbara Stanwyck with Marlo Thomas "That Girl" hair. She is gracefully 
gamin, both siren and wholesome in her below-the-knee pleated skirt and crimson 
pumps. All of Susan Hilferty's mod costumes are bright and amusing, and Luba 
Mason's Hedy, wearing what appears to be the precursor to the Miracle Bra under 
a gold dress, looks particularly swell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is terrific and is obviously having fun. Jeff Blumenkrantz 
reprises Charles Nelson Reilly's fey brat as Bud Frump (why not; it still 
works), and in smaller roles, Kristi Lynes and the shameless scenery chewer 
Randl Ask stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Another treat is the additional lyric that McAnuff and Judy Minor wrote for 
the top of Act Two, when the women in the company formulate their own version 
of the title song (it replaces the more politically incorrect "Cinderella, 
Darling"). 
</P>
<P>
 For "How to Succeed," Loesser wrote an 11 o'clock number to rival "Sit Down, 
You're Rocking the Boat" from "Guys and Dolls." Thanks to Lillias White as Miss 
Jones, whose glorious voice is kept under careful wraps until that moment, 
"Brotherhood of Man" raises the roof off of the World Wide Wicket Company as 
surely as any of McAnuff's soaring imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Succeed" ends here on Dec. 4 and then will go to the Kennedy Center 
and to Broadway. Here's a new title to ponder, and it's bound to be a tough 
one: "How to Succeed in Getting Tickets Without Really Knowing Someone." Good 
luck to you.

ACCENT ON STYLE IN BENITEZ FLAMENCO PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flamenco dancers seem to offer a simple three-step prescription for anyone who 
needs a formula for surviving a wearying world: Stare life down, rage a little 
and lament a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 With the five dancers of Santa Fe-based Maria Benitez Teatro Flamenco, this 
prescription was offered with a lot of style on Saturday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre.In several styles, actually, some of which stretched the form ably in 
alegrias, seguidillas, tientos and bulerias . 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez herself dwelt in the land of smoldering gesture. For "Aires de 
Silencio," hauntingly lit by Cecilio Benitez, she gathered despair in around 
her with languid or almost jerky sweeps of her arms. In her terre a terre 
dancing, there is a sense of hardship and weighted stillness -- qualities also 
found, more frenetically, in the style of Alejandro Granados. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Ramona Garduno and Sara de la Pena used their torsos more 
freely, whether shifting curved arms on which circling hands became exotic 
birds, or accomplishing quick, shuffling stomps during which all darting limbs 
seemed to extend and return to grasp their ruffled skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most stirring extension of flamenco form (literally) came with 
Alfonso Simo Rodriguez's solo, simply called "Serranas." Less of a slave to 
traditional quick changes of temper, he extended stretched limbs poetically and 
sustained a melancholy mood. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had astonishing mastery of flitting feet and placid torso; one pass 
across the stage was so percussively intense, yet so hummingbird light, it 
brought the chills that come with admiring disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing various moods were singer Manolo Segura, sparingly but effectively 
used, and guitarists Chuscales and Arcadio Marin.

 Santa vs. Santa: Disney was far from amused by a prank that 20th Century Fox 
pulled during Disney's press junket for one of its big upcoming holiday 
releases. Dozens of entertainment journalists from all over the world were 
brought in for an advance look at Disney's new movie, "The Santa Clause," and 
interviews with star Tim Allen and others. But while the scribes were out 
watching the movie on Friday night, it seems elves from Fox were busy at work. 
Journalists returned to their rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel after seeing the 
movie to find not only the cookies and milk courtesy of the Disney folks, but 
gingerbread cookies and turtleneck shirts emblazoned with "Miracle on 34th 
Street" with a card atop the box signed "Kriss Kringle -- the real Santa 
Claus." Sources said that hotel officials obviously cooperated with Fox's 
publicity department in facilitating the action, which according to those close 
to the situation has Disney up in arms. "This really crossed the line," said a 
source. Disney's movie opens Nov. 11 and Fox's a week later on Nov. 18. On Nov. 
6, Fox plans to hold a junket for the John Hughes' adaptation of "Miracle," in 
which Richard Attenborough plays Santa, at the Four Seasons. Officials from 
both studios issued no comment. A spokesman for the hotel also declined 
comment.

 Screenwriter Presumed Dead: Kingston, Jamaica, police said Sunday that they 
feared the body of missing Chicago screenwriter Terrence Runte, 34, an apparent 
murder victim, had been eaten by sharks and would never be found. Runte, 34, 
disappeared Oct. 17, just one day after he arrived on the island to research a 
movie. A suspect, who has not been identified, led investigators to an area 
known as Shark Rock, east of Port Antonio, where the writer's clothes were 
found tied to a blood-stained concrete pillar. The suspect is expected to be 
charged shortly, police said. Runte, who co-wrote "Mystery Date" and "Super 
Mario Bros.," vanished after night-clubbing. TELEVISION

 Noyes & Son, News Producers: Veteran broadcast news producer Pete Noyes was 
hired at KCBS-TV Channel 2 on Monday, only three days after his son Jack landed 
a job in the same newsroom. The elder Noyes, who had spent more than 17 years 
at KNBC-TV Channel 4 and NBC, was named contributing investigative producer. 
His son will work as an assignment editor, a job he has performed at KCAL-TV 
Channel 9 and at KNBC. ART

 Yoko Ono's Display: Yoko Ono, widow of murdered Beatles star John Lennon, has 
plastered the small German town of Langenhagen with backsides. The New 
York-based artist has put up hundreds of posters depicting an unidentified 
bottom in the small town near Hanover as part of an art project, Der Spiegel 
news magazine reported Monday. The posters, entitled "A Celebration of Being 
Human," have taken the little town by storm. They are being reprinted on 
shopping bags and post cards and pasted on walls. "Faces can lie. Backsides 
can't," Ono, 61, told the magazine. "People's faces deceive through makeup, 
mimicry and false smiles." Ono said she was not aiming to make money through 
the public exhibition, but hoped to be provocative. "People talk about my 
pictures. . . . So long as they continue talking about butts, they will not be 
killing each other." POP/ROCK

to the evening's star-studded Field of Dreams awards at the Beverly Hilton 
Hotel. It all benefits charities for women and children sponsored by Bolton and 
Bonds. Ticket info for the game and black-tie dinner: (310) 289-6381. No 
tickets will be sold at the stadium. Among those expected to toss the chubby 
ball: Bonds, Jeff Bagwell of the Houston Astros, Bobby Bonilla of the New York

ART REVIEW; KUNISHIMA'S POINTS ARE DULLY NOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seiji Kunishima seems to have been around forever, quietly making sculptures 
that approvingly are called "timeless" and "meditative." A group of his small 
pieces and painted screens from the past decade are at the Fine Arts Gallery at 
Golden West College through Nov. 11. Frankly, though, it's hard to get excited 
about this work. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a feeling as brash as excitement is not what Kunishima, a Japanese 
artist now in his late 50s, attempts to convey in his work. His simple stone 
forms have been viewed as evocative of natural forces, of the dualities of the 
universe (space and void, flow and stasis, natural and man-made) and of the 
pleasures of tactile and visual senses working in concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintessential Kunishima piece involves two forms that mirror and 
sometimes support one another. In "Nestled Forms '87-22," for example, two 
similar-looking chunks of Japanese black granite with polished tops fit loosely 
together. Each clearly rests on its own weight, yet each also "accepts" the 
intrusion of the neighboring stone, reflecting both the independence and 
interdependence of natural phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunishima's sculptures have the highly ordered, slightly cryptic quality of 
objects in a Japanese garden: A smooth, flat piece of Indian black granite 
resting on two grooved lengths of American white granite evokes a "suspended 
pool"; a bronze "twig" rests lightly across two smoothly swelling identical 
mounds of African black granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted the works' lack of tension, which Western viewers tend to expect from 
art, something else is missing that cannot easily be ascribed to differing 
cultural perceptions. Although the viewer's thoughts are necessary to complete 
the piece (as in most worthy contemporary sculpture), each piece seems to pose 
the same question and to require the same answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A style that seemed a fresh way of reinterpreting an age-old view of the world 
several decades ago has hardened into mannerism. Serenity has turned into 
blandness; balance and harmony have dissipated into dullness. There is 
something too obvious, too premeditated in this work. What's missing is the 
element of surprise that gives even a Zen koan its wise edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunishima's screens reiterate basic natural elements -- rocks, land and water 
-- with primary and metallic colors and a simplified system of arcs and 
straight lines. Pleasant enough as elements of interior design, these works 
suffer from being flat designs on paper that cannot show off the artist's feel 
for three-dimensional shape and palpable surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition also includes a slide show of large scale sculptures made for 
specific sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunishima's commissioned works in Southern California include "Stonework '82" 
on the lawn of the Security Pacific Bank in Brea (on Valencia Avenue between 
Birch and Nasa streets). The piece, part of the city's Art in Public Places 
program, consists of a black boulder bridging two 10-foot-high white granite 
wedges. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; HOLMAN ORCHESTRA, BRUBECK CONCLUDE WEST COAST FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a fitting aesthetic climax to Jazz West Coast, Bill Holman's Orchestra 
looked at both then and now in a stunning show Sunday afternoon in the Grand 
Ballroom of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel in Redondo Beach, the four-day 
affair's main venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Before more than a thousand listeners, the master composer and arranger 
delivered a 40-minute commissioned piece entitled "The '40s: Swing to Bebop," 
an enthralling patchwork of both classic and arcane tunes stitched together by 
intriguing interludes. In his idiosyncratic, instrumentally colorful way, 
Holman made this melange as contemporary as a Quentin Tarantino look at a cheap 
crime novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra played portions of such favorites as "Ornithology," "A Night in 
Tunisia" and " 'Round Midnight," as well as lesser-known pieces such as "Mop 
Mop" and "The Chase." These melodies often emerged surprisingly, some coming 
out of grand orchestral swells, one out of an ethereal passage played 
deliciously sotto voce by trombonist Bob McChesney and bassist Paul Morin. 
Throughout, there was the fine soloing of Ron Stout and Bob Summers (trumpets), 
Pete Christlieb, Lanny Morgan and Bob Efford (saxes) and Rich Eames (piano), 
among others, and the bubbling bombast provided by drummer Bob Leatherbarrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Holman's set also included a regal version of Jimmy Rowles' poignant "The 
Peacocks," where Efford's bass clarinet purred and croaked, often surrounded by 
brass figures that shimmered like sunlight on a Monet pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival concluded Sunday evening with solid performances by pianist Dave 
Brubeck's quartet and the Oxnard-based Estrada Brothers in a concert at the 
Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center. Brubeck, looking gaunt but vital at 73, 
played melodically and with economy and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 His lovely evergreen, "The Duke," segued into an Ellington medley where he 
dispatched the punchy, two-hand chordal statements that are his improvisational 
forte. Another highlight was the creeping "River, Stay 'Way From My Door," 
where Brubeck offered chattering, rhythmic lines, and clarinetist Bill Smith 
and bassist Jack Six both played meaty solos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estradas' set -- a tribute to Cal Tjader -- spotlighted the zesty, ringing 
vibes of Reuben Estrada. Centered by a cooking rhythm section, the underrated 
band played vibrant interpretations of "Soul Sauce," "Cuban Fantasy" and 
others.

THEATER REVIEW; SCI-FI, MUSICALS CARRY ON A DOOMED 'ROMANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to get an idea how desperate the musical form has become, hie thee 
to Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse where the Alan Menken-David Spencer-Alan Brennert 
science-fiction musical "Weird Romance" is rearing its extremely odd head. 
</P>
<P>
 Two extremely odd heads, actually, since "Weird Romance" consists of two 
distinct stories: the first about how the good soul of a homeless woman is 
zapped into a beautiful female body and turned into a star in the year 2061; 
the second about a hologram scientist who finds his lab visited by a woman come 
back from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it as two variations on the notion of the ghost in the machine. It 
sounds interesting, and you can sense the makers' wheels spinning as they try 
to bring the musical into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the similarly twinned two-act musical, "Romance/Romance," Menken (the 
late composer of "Little Mermaid"/"Beauty and the Beast"/"Aladdin" fame) and 
lyricists-book writers Brennert and Spencer fail to link the two tales 
meaningfully. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar high-tech surface isn't enough, and the theme that people in the 
future will fall in love just like we do isn't enough either. Indeed, the 
pairing only points out each act's individual thinness. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, "Her Pilgrim Soul" (based on a Brennert short story and set on 
"the day after tomorrow") is by far the most cohesive, even with the emotional 
goo we must wade through. Kevin (Bil Barratt) is so absorbed by his hologram 
research that he leaves his wife Carol (Rosemary DeYoe) floundering at home. 
(Why she's floundering without a real life of her own is another, unexplored 
matter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin's loyal assistant, Daniel (Bradley Miller) first notices the uninvited 
appearance of Nola (Tisha BellantuoniQ) on the hologram screen, and Kevin 
eventually realizes that she has come from the dead to teach him about love's 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a time-traveling romance in the lab, with some timeouts for an amusing 
tune by Daniel (Miller puts his heart and voice into "Need to Know") and some 
time-consuming subplots. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunes blend a gentle warmth with Sondheim-influenced adult concerns of 
life passing by (especially "Pressing Onward, Moving Forward"), and though 
Barratt tends to freeze up in the big emotional moments ("You Remember"), 
Bellantuoni carries the tale with terrific conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially terrific when you consider that Bellantuoni must stay within a 
booth and behind a scrim meant to simulate a hologram screen (uneasily designed 
by Shawn Fidler). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, it's a very different story in Act I, titled "The Girl Who Was Plugged 
In" (based on James Tiptree Jr.'s short fiction). Because director John Massey 
Jr.'s staging is so threadbare, Fidler's white set so ugly and Massey's cast so 
incapable of singing the rocking tunes, there's no fair way to judge Menken's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 What is for sure is that Brennert's and Spencer's book is poorly warmed-over 
Orwell and Mary Shelley, depicting a homeless woman (DeYoe) charming the 
scientist (Miller, again as the lovable techie) at the lab of big, bad GTX 
Corp. What GTX does, exactly, is never clear, except that it seems to promote 
pop stars, with Mr. Isham (Barratt) at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 DeYoe's kind soul, hot-wired into the body of Glory Dei Gray as pop star 
Delphi, sets the stage for a silly "Frankenstein" variation. Isham's bitter 
son, Paul (Ron McCoy), falls for Delphi, who inexplicably is electrically 
punished for returning his love. 
</P>
<P>
 As hackneyed as the plot becomes, Spencer's lyrics are worse, definitively 
proving that you can't rhyme demographics and not sound kitschy. The cast is 
instructed to ignore the kitsch, and play things seriously -- which only adds 
to the kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 The singing, when it's not flat, is drowned out by the backstage band and Todd 
Perry's pounding drums. The story's intended high-tech look is given Vegas 
gloss on a limited budget by costumer Laurie Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 The future (of musicals) is not looking bright.

MUSIC REVIEW; GOTHONI IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to his biography, Ralf Gothoni, the 48-year old Finnish musician who 
took the 1994 Gilmore Award -- a potentially career-making, 
cash-and-engagements prize worth "in the neighborhood of $500,000," its 
sponsors say -- is a solo pianist, a conductor, a composer, a chamber musician, 
a "lieder pianist" and a festival director. 
</P>
<P>
 How the reserved, young-looking Gothoni carries off his other musical 
endeavors, one can only guess. In his debut piano recital Sunday night in 
Schoenberg Hall Auditorium at UCLA, the observant listener could admire 
Gothoni's undoubted versatility, his clear perspective and his effortless, if 
not comprehensive, technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, this event was not an occasion for rejoicing. Gothoni may get 
around the keyboard with ease, but the sounds of the sensible music he 
regularly makes often prove unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Above mezzo-forte , in the dynamic area where most of his playing takes place, 
he abuses the instrument and his listeners' ears consistently. The tone he 
makes at that level is metallic and ugly. Spending 90 minutes in his pianistic 
presence is not necessarily a treat. 
</P>
<P>
 The more rewarding half of this event involved Schubert's monumental B-flat 
Sonata, one quarter of which Gothoni played with deep concentration and a 
mostly becalmed sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Many if not all of the beauties in the seraphic opening movement emerged 
persuasive and contexted -- even, on occasion, legato . His rhetoric proved 
convincing -- he gives good pause -- and he took, surprisingly and admirably, 
the repeat of the exposition. This was cherishable piano-playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the sonata fell short of these ideals. The Andante sostenuto 
lacked color and nuance, and too often became glib. The quickish Scherzo failed 
of clarity and eschewed the composer's asked-for delicatezza entirely. The 
finale, raw and over-exuberant, asked the musical question: How can a 48-year 
old professional pianist play with so little polish? 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the recital used a charming Aria by Domenico Zipoli as 
prelude to Liszt's exposing B-minor Sonata. Though laid out cannily and with 
strong understanding, Gothoni's playing of the sonata told us nothing new about 
it, and too much about his hit-and-run approach to the piano.

FAMILY; MUPPETIZED FAIRY TALES STAR THE BIGGEST PIG OF THEM ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The miller, hoping to win favor with the king, claims that his daughter can 
spin straw into gold. The fair young maiden's response: "Are you out of your 
cotton-pickin' mind?" 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar fairy tales are given a characteristically salty Muppet twist in 
"Muppet Classic Theater," a new Jim Henson Video in which Kermit, Miss Piggy, 
Gonzo, Rizzo and other polished Muppet thespians take the stage in playlet 
versions of "The Three Little Pigs," "Rumpelstiltskin," "King Midas," "The 
Emperor's New Clothes," "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" and "The Elves and the 
Shoemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all goes smoothly. Miss Piggy gets heckled from the audience: "You call 
that a little pig?" It's guaranteed that "break a leg" will be taken literally, 
and because Rizzo the Rat misreads a story title, Elvis and blue suede shoes 
suddenly figure into the Shoemaker's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 There are important lessons to be learned, however, beyond those in each 
sketch's mostly unmemorable songs. King Midas' wife (the versatile Miss Piggy) 
finds that gold isn't as valuable as a good "slice-o-matic." The Shoemaker 
(Kermit) develops fashion sense and the Elvis elves realize they can take their 
act to Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang does its usual professional job, despite some curtain trouble, script 
squabbles and the sheep's unsuccessful attempt to end their play before the 
wolf's arrival. Miss Piggy, however, is the indisputable star who gives this 
"Muppet Show" revisited most of its best moments, still aided and abetted, 
thankfully, by comic genius Frank Oz.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BLACK VOICES PENETRATE EMOTIONAL DEPTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the crafted din and amplified clutter of modern pop, it's easy to forget 
that unaided, unadorned human voices are capable of creating powerful music. A 
substantial reminder was served on Sunday at Wadsworth Theater as Britain's 
five-woman a cappella group Black Voices sang their way through an inspiring 
international mix of blues, pop reggae, African, and Afro-Caribbean music. 
</P>
<P>
 With graceful, intricate harmonies, and with voices sometimes used for 
percussive effects, the group was able to explore the sweet tunefulness and 
emotional depth of such disparate works as Louis Jordan's "Early Morning 
Blues," Desmond Dekker's "Israelites" and the traditional "Sloop John B." A 
Swahili version of the Lord's Prayer was particularly pretty, and the group's 
gorgeous tones turned Dion's "Abraham, Martin, and John" into a passionate 
lament.  
</P>
<P>
 Black Voices' influences are wide-ranging, but almost all their material 
demonstrates the process by which pain and sorrow can be turned to release and 
uplift through song. Leader Carol Pemberton served as a good-natured guide 
through the evening's program, keeping the mood light but also explaining the 
painful roots of more solemn songs. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

TV REVIEW; 'FRONTLINE' FOCUSES ON OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tax loopholes are the classic case of "if you provide it, they will come." And 
come they have to the tax havens of the Caribbean islands from the Caymans to 
the Virgins. 
</P>
<P>
 But as tonight's "Frontline" report "Hot Money" indicates, the offshore 
islands have sheltered more than accounts meant to elude the tax man. For 
years, especially in the boom time of the 1980s, scores of banks in these 
British protectorates wittingly or unwittingly served as conduits for 
money-laundering operations crucial to the global drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite supposed crackdowns on phony paper companies set up for the 
laundering, the number of companies registered in the British Virgin Islands 
alone has jumped from 5,000 to 120,000 in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't the offshore haven merely a nice perk of making money? Yes, but it 
permits a brazen flouting of U.S. laws by U.S. citizens. When $300 billion due 
in U.S. tax revenues is redirected to the island banks, or when insurance 
company customers discover that their carrier is a paper company without real 
assets, or when criminals have such a safe spot for their cash, then it's time 
for the law to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FBI cannot simply swoop down on the islands and nail the bad guys. The 
law in the protectorates, overseen by British authorities, enforces complete 
secrecy in financial transactions. The law not only created the offshore 
business industry, it also brought wealth to the islands. According to Shaun 
Murphy, who once administered a large money-laundering operation, the island 
governments have no interest in snooping into the banks or firms that set up 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some U.S. pressure has caused a little reform movement by 
British overseers, and the FBI and Scotland Yard have begun a joint 
investigation. The joint powers of the BBC and "Frontline" also manage to 
expose the schemes of John Matthewson, founder of Guardian Bank on Grand Cayman 
Island, who is recorded explaining how to launder cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report suggests that any further reforms to completely wipe out the 
account-secrecy laws are likely to be sunk by British political stubbornness. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hot Money" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28, and at 8 on KVCR-TV 
Channel 24.

 Never let it be said the city of Pasadena can't get no satisfaction:  
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones violated wild-and-crazy Pasadena's midnight curfew one 
night at the Rose Bowl, and they'll have to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick and the boys played late into the night -- well, until 12:03 a.m., 
actually -- and, so, they've received a $6,000 bill (at $2,000 per minute).  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to concerts, the Rose Bowl people are real clock-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a military operation," said Dave Jacobs, the stadium's 
general manager. "We synchronize watches with the promoter beforehand."  
</P>
<P>
 Then, about three minutes before midnight, Jacobs checks the correct time by 
telephone. "And we keep the phone open so we know the exact time (the concert 
ends)," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought the Rolling Stones would require such monitoring? Those 
old-timers shouldn't be up that late anyway.

 Hanging 2-4-5-7-9-11-13, etc.: We know that surfers have oceanic rivalries 
with swimmers, Boogie Boarders (whom they call "spongers"), fishermen, 
motorized water skiers and kayakers and other surfers (long boarders vs. short 
boarders). 
</P>
<P>
 But we never knew they had a beef with couch potatoes until we saw the latest 
issue of Surfer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter writer strenuously objects to "the use of the phrase 'channel 
surfing.' Now what does changing channels on a television have to do with 
surfing?"  
</P>
<P>
 The writer adds: "It's not too late to fight back. Don't let the outside world 
take away the last few words we use to describe what we are and what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine headlined the letter, "Maybe 'Channel Roller-Blading' would be 
better."

 The best we could say is we owned a Bug once: Allan Mandell of San Diego saw 
nothing unusual about the parking lot receipt that we mentioned the other day 
-- the one that warns the driver to "Lock Your Cat." But then Mandel drives a 
Jaguar. miscelLAny "All aboard for Anaheim, Azusa and Kook-a-mon-ga" -- the cry 
of the train conductor on the old Jack Benny Show -- still has some relevance. 
A Metrolink station is opening in Rancho Kook-a-mon-ga today. Passengers 
boarding at that station may obtain free tickets through Friday. Anaheim 
already has a station. Still no word from Azusa, though.

 * It seems that the initiative process in California is being used for purely 
demonstrative purpose. While the initiative process has always had the 
characteristics of a popularity poll, Propositions 184 and 187 have all the 
earmarks of advisory plebiscites. 
</P>
<P>
 While some may think that is just fine, it seems to me that the mischief that 
can be done by passing laws as a form of expressing frustration with the status 
quo could be quite bad. Unintended consequences, as the conservatives are fond 
of saying, are certainly waiting in the wings when such laws are passed.

NOW MAYBE A LITTLE JAIL TIME; SETTLEMENT IN HUGE INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE DOES NOT 
GO FAR ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering the enormous sums lost, the thousands of victims involved and its 
admitted wrongdoing, Prudential Securities got too good a deal when the U.S. 
attorney's office in Manhattan agreed to allow the brokerage to settle criminal 
charges related to its $8-billion limited partnership investment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential admitted last week, after three years of denials, that it had 
committed what is believed to be the largest fraud ever by a single brokerage 
against small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential admitted it knowingly made "false and misleading" statements to 
investors about the safety of the investments and agreed to three years of 
probation and to pay an additional $330 million into an existing restitution 
fund for investors. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed not to press 
charges if the company strictly lives up to the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, Prudential will pay a record $700 million in government fines and 
penalties. Until last week's settlement, Prudential had fiercely denied in 
civil lawsuits and arbitration cases that it had broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual "deferred prosecution" agreement was based on the fear that an 
indictment could put the firm's 18,000 employees out of work and further harm 
investors. Prudential had said privately that an indictment probably would put 
it out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal investigations are continuing against some former executives, and 
charges could eventually be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over more than a decade, in excess of 600,000 investors nationwide put money 
into Prudential's approximately 700 limited partnerships. Their losses are 
believed to have totaled over $2 billion. The criminal charges focused on the 
Energy Income Funds, which were the subject of a 1993 investigation series in 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage, although it fessed up, did so only late in the game. The 
white-collar crimes committed against its small investors are unconscionable. 
Federal prosecutors should seek stronger punishment, such as jail time, for any 
individuals found guilty in this massive fraud.

RIGHTS WATCH; UNPURGED SHAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fines imposed against the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel, the site of the Navy's 
infamous Tailhook convention, are strong rebukes to the abuse suffered by 
then-Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin and scores of other women. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury has ordered Hilton Hotel Corp. to pay Coughlin $5 million in 
punitive damages, plus $1.7 million in compensatory damages, for the Las Vegas 
Hilton's failure to provide adequate security at the 1991 event, during which 
more than 80 women were subjected to sexual harassment; for some that included 
being forced through a hallway lined with drunken, groping male aviators. 
</P>
<P>
 A troubling irony remains. Few if any of the military men accused of 
misconduct at the convention have been held accountable by the Navy or the 
Marines. True, H. Lawrence Garrett III resigned as Navy secretary and Adm. 
Frank B. Kelso, who was accused of witnessing the assaults, stepped down as 
chief of naval operations. (Kelso was able to keep his full rank and pension.) 
However, although about 140 Navy and Marine Corps officers were referred for 
criminal investigation by the Defense Department's inspector general, only a 
few dozen received any form of administrative discipline. There were no 
court-martials. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as a dozen women are pressing claims in state or federal courts, and 
some of these, too, may receive a measure of justice. But it's worth 
remembering that although the hotel has been penalized for its laxity at the 
Tailhook gathering, the actual perpetrators have thus far escaped, to the great 
shame of America's military.

GETTING BEYOND PARTISAN POLITICS; MAYOR RIORDAN IS LATEST TO JOIN FEINSTEIN 
CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following an example set by New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a fellow 
Republican, Richard Riordan has wisely put partisanship aside: On Sunday Los 
Angeles' mayor endorsed a Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, in a hotly contested race 
for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan called the incumbent senator a pragmatic leader who has worked well 
with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. We know that the mayor surely 
is politician enough to have won some specific promises from Feinstein to help 
Los Angeles recover from its multiple wounds. Good. 
</P>
<P>
 In endorsing the senator's reelection bid, Riordan joins Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block and numerous other Republicans. It could be seen as both 
a practical choice -- latest polls show Feinstein gaining strength -- and a 
smart choice because the Democrat is the clearly superior candidate. 
Nevertheless, Republican Riordan's regard for the right choice over the right 
party line is refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course Rep. Mike Huffington's remarks of the past few days may have made 
Riordan's choice of his rival that much easier. The Huffington campaign has 
been shaken by last week's disclosure that he employed an illegal Mexican 
immigrant as a nanny for five years. That was one week after he endorsed the 
divisive and dangerous Proposition 187, which would deny public services to 
illegal aliens and turn health and school officials into immigration cops. 
Feinstein opposes 187, as does The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and his wife, Arianna, say the nanny was beloved and needed by 
their children; yet 187 would close school doors to the illegal immigrant 
children of many such nannies and would deny them medical care. Asked Sunday in 
a national TV interview what will happen to illegal immigrant children if 187 
passes, he said they could go to private schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The public knows that hypocrisy and demagoguery run deep in American politics 
and are the monopoly of no one party and no one candidate. But when Huffington 
endorsed 187 he complained that too many people "cut corners, looked the other 
way" in hiring illegal aliens. Little did we know then that he was talking 
about the Huffington situation.

PRESIDENTIAL SAFETY: WHAT'S ENOUGH?; ACCESS-VERSUS-SECURITY ISSUE IN WAKE OF 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In more innocent times few barriers stood between Presidents and the people 
they were elected to serve. The nation's chief executives would routinely 
mingle with the public, sometimes shaking hands with thousands in a single day 
at White House receptions or regularly riding in open carriages or cars along 
spectator-filled streets or strolling through crowds to be seen and spoken to. 
It was what Presidents chose to do, and it was what was expected of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Innocence ended in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then the ring of protection around the President has grown steadily 
tighter. We can expect it to tighten still more as a result of last Saturday's 
shooting at the White House. The need, as always, will be to assure the fullest 
protection to the President and those closest to him without imposing on him an 
unhealthy isolation or subjecting the public to costly and disruptive 
inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping security measures already seek to shield the President from harm, 
both in Washington and when he travels. Even the shortest presidential trip is 
preceded by elaborate security planning and measures, sometimes involving 
thousands of security personnel. At home a 10-foot-high fence surrounds the 
White House and patrolling guards, motion sensors and TV cameras monitor its 
grounds. Bulletproof glass protects the main mansion, though not the press 
briefing room, which was struck by some shots. Bomb-sniffing dogs inspect every 
vehicle entering the grounds, and barriers aim to thwart suicide car bombers. 
Marksmen are on constant duty on the White House roof. In all, it is the best 
protection that technology and planning can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 And none of it prevented Francisco Martin Duran from walking up Pennsylvania 
Avenue last Saturday afternoon, poking his Chinese-made assault rifle through 
the White House fence and emptying a full magazine at the West Wing. Duran was 
apparently trying to reload when he was subdued by passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service, charged with the President's protection, has long wanted 
to close Pennsylvania Avenue, fearing just the kind of attack that has now 
taken place. But the street is a main traffic thoroughfare as well as the prime 
vantage point for tourists who want a view of what President Clinton rightly 
calls the people's house. Blocking off the street is no answer. A constant and 
heavy police presence on the sidewalks is probably a much better approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's shooting exposed a weak point in the White House's defenses. What's 
required is to fix it with the least disruption to civic life.

PROPOSITION 181 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's uncharacteristic for The Times to convey bad advice to its readers, but 
it's spectacularly ill-advised of you to recommend that voters reject 
Proposition 181 (Oct. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 181 is one part of the five transportation bills enacted by the 
Legislature and then-Gov.George Deukmejian in June 1989 to alleviate traffic 
congestion problems resulting from ever-increasing motor vehicle registration 
(there are now over 26,000,000 registered vehicles in California), the paucity 
of money in the state highway fund (California's gasoline tax in 1989 was the 
46th lowest in the nation) and few incentives to use public rail transit. While 
the 1992 rail transit bond issue (Proposition 156) did narrowly fail, the 1990 
issue was approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Proposition 181 will create funds for expanding rail transit 
systems throughout California, from San Diego to Los Angeles to Sacramento to 
the Bay Area. The benefits are inordinate. Proposition 181 reduces traffic 
congestion, improves air quality, creates jobs -- all without a tax increase! 
It's the only state bond issue on the November ballot, representing the 
considered judgment of the governor and Legislature respecting its virtues. In 
this instance, I, uncharacteristically, disagree with The Times and urge its 
readers to vote for Proposition 181.

CLINTON RATINGS, ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Voters Reluctant to Credit Clinton for Recovery," Oct. 24: 
</P>
<P>
 What's the surprise? Companies have been downsizing, making up for the '80s 
policies of implementing shortsighted goals to increase quarterly reports, our 
standard of living has gone down, we have less services, few people have the 
security of lifetime jobs, and for 18 months the press has barraged the public 
with President Clinton's failures, even when they were successes. This may also 
explain the truly bizarre phenomenon of your story regarding people rejecting 
GOP policy, but inclined to vote GOP ("Voters Shift to GOP but Reject Party's 
Policies," Oct. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 The joke currently making the rounds demonstrates this perfectly; President 
Clinton and the Pope are in a boat, the Pope's hat flies away, President 
Clinton walks on water to retrieve the hat, walks on water back to give it the 
Pope. What is the headline? "Clinton Can't Swim."

<P>
 * Your recent poll indicating that Republican strength in the current election 
does not indicate a support for Republican ideology missed the mark. Rather 
than asking if voters favor a return to the policies of the Reagan 
Administration, which have been widely vilified in the press, ask them if they 
favor a smaller role for government in American life. Ask if they favor less 
regulation, less federal mandates upon local governments and business, less 
ineffectual social programs and less taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in race after race, voters have a choice between candidates who 
favor an activist government and those who seek to reduce the size of 
government. The rejection of Democrats will occur because voters do not like 
their policies.

 * If President Clinton is wondering why he isn't receiving credit for the

the reasons that President Bush was let go: "take-home pay" and "character" -- 
the lack of both.

 * Working together to solve the problems of the country should be the goal of

to undermine President Clinton are not in the best interest of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Too few members vote their conscience. Instead they are motivated by the need 
to be reelected and are influenced by opinion polls and special interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If both parties worked together important legislation, such as the Social 
Security Act and the Civil Rights Bill, would result. Then the elected

complaining that he promised too much and has succeeded too little, might I 
remind them that he has accomplished more good in his short time to date than 
Ronnie and George did in 12 years. Besides, Republicans do fear his growing 
list of accomplishments or they wouldn't have tried so hard at the end of this 
Congress to stop whatever they could.

 * "After a Run of Good Luck, It's Time to Discuss Foreign Policy" by Gaddis 
Smith (Opinion, Oct. 16) is an article which is a perfect example of why our 
President is held in such low esteem. Clinton gets blamed when things don't go 
well -- when they do -- he had good luck! 
</P>

<P>
 * For months, The Times and the rest of the liberal media have been whining 
that Clinton isn't getting the credit he deserves for his supposed 
achievements. On the contrary, I claim that he is. He was elected by 43% of the 
electorate. The American people don't like being lied to; policy differences 
are one thing, categorical and deliberate lies are quite another. Clinton was 
elected in large part by claiming to be some sort of "New Democrat" rather than 
the socialist type rejected in most recent presidential elections. His policies 
have proved that his entire campaign was just one big lie. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his personal dishonesty and untrustworthiness, his 
Administration has been riddled with corruption, deceit and ethical lapses. He 
not only failed to deliver on his principal promise (health care reform), but 
appointed his spectacularly arrogant wife to form a secret task force to devise 
the plan. Since she and her pals came up with a scheme that was too much Marx 
and not enough AMA and was roundly rejected by the overwhelming majority of the 
public once its details were uncovered, his attempted power grab has probably 
killed any meaningful health care legislation for a decade. If it weren't for 
the fact that the stagflation his economic policies will inevitably cause is 
just beginning, and for his moderate foreign policy successes, his approval 
rating would be about 25-30% (i.e., his core constituency of people who 
mindlessly support the party label regardless of who wears it).

PERSPECTIVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S RACE; READ HER BOOK; LOOK AT HIS RECORD; KATHLEEN 
BROWN'S 62-PAGE ECONOMIC PROGRAM LEADS TO JUST ONE CONCLUSION: STEALTH TAXES 
ARE HEADING CALIFORNIA'S WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE P. SHULT; MARTIN ANDERSON, ; MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, George P. Shultz is a 
former secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and budget director. 
Martin Anderson is a former presidential domestic and economic policy adviser. 
Michael J. Boskin is former chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. They are currently senior fellows at the Hoover Institution, Stanford

<TEXT>
<P>
 California is often the nation's bellwether, foreshadowing national change 
from lifestyle to tax revolt. In addition to the direct importance of the 
California gubernatorial election this year, and its potential effect on 
President Clinton's fortunes in the state in 1996, the race between Gov. Pete 
Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown may well be a harbinger of things to come 
in other state and national races. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown for Governor campaign is heralding its fourth economic plan for 
California, claiming it would rebuild California and create 1 million new jobs 
over the next four years (embarrassingly, this is about 25% less than private 
forecasters predict without her program). Gov. Wilson aptly decries the plan as 
more government involvement in private business affairs, more bureaucracy, more 
spending and a hidden tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Brown asks California to read her plan. So, unlike some who have 
endorsed her candidacy and her program, we actually did so. It reminds us of 
Michael Dukakis' and Bill Clinton's programs: much invective, lots of new 
government programs, public/private partnerships (without private-sector 
consent) and shell-game arithmetic. This government micromanagement of capital 
markets, industry and the labor force is an approach that has failed miserably 
from Moscow to Massachusetts. If enacted, it would seriously damage 
California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most explosive issue is taxes. Brown, disingenuously, blasts Wilson for 
agreeing to tax increases in his first year, which he did in order to get 
large, permanent reductions in spending in the face of a dramatic and 
unexpected $15 billion deficit that he inherited. Those reductions in spending 
amounted to about $3 for every $1 of tax increases. Wilson has kept the 
Legislature under pressure and state general-fund spending has been flat for 
three years. It has not even increased for inflation. No other governor in the 
country has come close to matching that record. And if Wilson had not held the 
line so forcefully on spending? The independent Commission on State Finances 
forecast back in 1990 that state spending would be $60 billion today, compared 
to the roughly $40 billion actually being spent. In short, spending, and the 
taxes required to finance it, could well be 50% higher than today. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to the details of the Brown plan. In a recent debate, Brown called for $5 
billion in spending cuts but specified only $3 million of the possible cuts, 
less than one-tenth of 1% of her goal. Where is the other 99.9%? The plan 
itself talks about saving $411 million a year by cutting education spending. 
(Cut education first?) That's only 8.5% of the spending cuts she claims she 
will make. There is no hint where the other 91.5%, or $4.6 billion, is going to 
come from. She does say that state government must "cut waste," and that it is 
"imperative that we examine the assumptions underlying each and every 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 A careful reading of Brown's entire 62-page economic program reveals that its 
bottom line is a stealth tax plan, craftily devised and disingenuously 
presented to finance her version of government industrial micromanagement of 
California. There are no billions of dollars of spending cuts. But there are 
lots of new programs and government bureaucracies. The spending cuts are 
rhetoric, but the new programs are real. If Brown were elected and had her 
programs passed into law by a Democratic-controlled Legislature, clearly taxes 
in California would go up -- a lot. The pressure to have these new programs 
grow -- along with the taxes to finance them -- would be intense. Simple 
arithmetic says that just to raise the missing $4.6 billion a year, you would 
have to raise the 1995 income tax of Californians by a whopping 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's look at some of the new state government programs Treasurer Brown 
would like to start and pay for with taxpayers' money. There is a community 
reinvestment fund to "foster new lending to disadvantaged regions." The state 
is to contribute $20 million of the $100 million fund. Where is the other $80 
million to come from? Another "New Democrat" private-public partnership. But 
the financial junior partner here is going to call the shots and force the 
private sector, the banks and pension funds with fiduciary responsibilities, to 
pony up the other $80 million. Shades of Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bill 
Clinton in 1992 (and his labor department today). A similar pattern is repeated 
in a "seed capital" fund, an "environmental loan-guarantee fund," "a 
capital-access fund," on and on. It seems under Brown, capital will be accessed 
in Sacramento, not at local financial institutions. This is stunning in the 
state that is the home of venture capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claims she won't raise taxes in her first year in office, but her plan 
calls for many new taxes and extensions of old ones. Add to this the billions 
that will be necessary when the new spending programs wind up, as usual with 
government, costing far more than projected. Brown seems to think that 
everything will pay for itself. Switching 43,000 state cars to alternative 
fuels, adding more state OSHA inspectors, piling state programs on top of 
federal programs and myriad other proposals, whatever their other pros and 
cons, somehow remarkably incur no new net costs. It's as if Brown's formula for 
saving money is spending it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown's economic plan is put in place, there is no chance whatsoever for 
tax relief for the rest of this century. What we'll have is higher taxes that 
will worsen California's competitiveness as well as depress family incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, she repeatedly told the audience that Gov. Wilson was a 
liar and cried: "Don't read his lips, read my book." You don't need to read 
Pete Wilson's lips, just take a look at his record. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for reading Kathleen Brown's book, good idea. Every Californian should 
read her 62-page economic program. But they may not like what they find. They 
may be terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 An opposing view from the Brown campaign will be published later this week.

COLUMN RIGHT/ VIRGINIA POSTREL: VOTERS TO GOVERNMENT: BACK OFF!; THE INTRUSION 
OF REGULATIONS INTO PRIVATE LIFE AND BUSINESS IS WHAT REALLY DISGUSTS 
AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Americans are very angry at government. That is a truism this election year. 
Democrats, and sympathetic pundits, would like to think that the public is mad 
at gridlock. Congress is, in their minds, a factory whose productivity is 
measured by how many laws it passes. The last Congress was "unproductive," and 
so, they assure us, the public is angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, for their part, want to believe that the public is mad at Bill 
Clinton and Democrats in Congress. In their "contract," the Republicans 
emphasize attacking politicians through term limits and cuts in congressional 
staffs. And, as always, they promise to cut taxes, reminding the public that 
Clinton raised them. 
</P>
<P>
 Both analyses miss the point. Yes, the public despises politicians who snipe 
at each other on C-Span, then vote themselves pay hikes. And yes, a lot of 
people think Bill Clinton is a smarmy liar who raised their taxes. But the 
analysts, absorbed in the culture of Washington, miss the personal side of 
politics. Americans are sick and tired of being bossed around. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, according to Times Mirror survey data, the number of people who 
say that the federal government controls too much of our daily lives has jumped 
from 58% to 69%. And the number who say that business regulations usually do 
more harm than good has jumped from 55% to 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 Resentment is building, particularly among the entrepreneurs on whom future 
prosperity depends. In its 1994 survey of the 500 fastest-growing private 
companies, Inc. magazine reports that "regulation was most often identified as 
the No. 1 enemy. . . . Jittery about health-care reform, feeling bound and 
nearly gagged by red tape, these entrepreneurs bemoaned the burdens of 
complying with local, state and federal mandates that often conflict with one 
another and that always cost money." 
</P>
<P>
 Inc.'s report is gentle compared to the study by the New Economy Project of 
Los Angeles County. In this survey of local businesses, mainly privately held 
companies, respondents listed regulation as their number one problem: "Many 
firms simply wrote in capital letters, 'GOVERNMENT HARASSMENT!' . . . or 
'REGULATIONS!!!' . . . In interviews, company executives were frequently so 
angry about their relations with the government that they would vent their 
frustration on the project staff for several minutes before apologizing and 
more calmly responding to questions." 
</P>
<P>
 I can sympathize. As a homeowner, I saw the city delay a simple bathroom 
remodeling job by weeks -- disrupting my work, my husband's work and the work 
of two contractors. As a manager at a cash-strapped nonprofit, I saw a $1,100 
project to divide two offices balloon by $5,000 thanks to a requirement of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act: A new fire-alarm system was needed so that if 
there is a fire (unlikely) and if we have a deaf employee or visitor (unlikely) 
and if there is no hearing person to alert the deaf person (extremely 
unlikely), blinking lights will flash a warning. In other words, we were forced 
to spend $5,000 on a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Rampant regulation is no longer the problem of General Motors. It has invaded 
family businesses and family homes. And it's infuriating to have government 
snatch control of your time, money and decision-making power. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started this business 15 years ago, I spent 95% of my time out front 
with customers," says Michigan restaurateur David Gillie. "Now I spend 95% of 
my time in back doing paperwork" to fend off regulators. Every day, throughout 
America, millions of David Gillies grow a little angrier at the government 
enforcers who are constantly inventing new ways to order them around. 
</P>
<P>
 The property-rights movement, with its attacks on environmental regulations 
that victimize land owners, is the first expression of the grass-roots 
regulation revolt. The outcry from religious business owners against the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission's proposed "religious harassment" guidelines, 
which led Congress to force the EEOC to back off, was a second sign. Another 
was the popular revulsion at the Clinton health-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, no one in Washington has identified the pattern. No one has 
declared that regulation is a tax burden that never gets lightened, which 
Republicans and Democrats alike add to with impunity. No one has figured out 
that angry voters want a lot more than a contract, an end to "gridlock" or even 
more tax cuts. They want their lives back.

NASD CONSIDERS PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF SETTLEMENTS; SECURITIES: THE CHANGE WOULD 
AFFECT AGREEMENTS THAT CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS REACH OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers announced Monday that it is 
considering disclosing to the public the settlements between brokers and their 
customers in securities arbitration cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes in response to pressure from the House subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance, which has found shortcomings in the NASD's 
efforts to disclose brokers' disciplinary histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the NASD, a self-regulatory organization that oversees brokers and 
their employers, discloses awards made by arbitrators but doesn't tell the 
public about settlements that brokers and customers reach on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization says disclosing such settlements could make brokerage firms 
less willing to settle. There may be business reasons to settle a dispute even 
when it isn't clear that a broker has done something wrong, the NASD says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a week ago, the NASD's membership committee asked its regulatory 
subcommittee to review the NASD's disclosure policy. An Oct. 28 Securities and 
Exchange Commission staff memo says the SEC will continue to discuss the issue 
with the NASD while the organization performs its own review. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Sept. 28 letter to the General Accounting Office, Rep. Edward Markey 
(D-Mass.), chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, noted 
that the NASD's toll-free number set up for the public to receive disciplinary 
information on brokers failed to mention 13 financial settlements against Grand 
Rapids, Mich., broker Thomas Bandyk. Those settlements of arbitration 
complaints totaled almost $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bandyk case is especially disturbing because of the large number of 
settled disputes and the amounts of money involved," said Jay Cummings, 
director of the membership department at the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD staff is gathering information on the issue from the SEC and state 
securities regulators, said Jim O'Donnell, an executive vice president at the 
organization. The staff will present this information to the NASD's membership 
committee in January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey also found that the NASD records failed to mention that a federal court 
had granted a request by the SEC that Bandyk be permanently barred from further 
violations of federal securities laws. The NASD says it relies on the SEC to 
notify it of such actions. In this instance, the SEC said, a "technical defect" 
in the court's order caused a delay in the issuance of this notification. 
</P>
<P>
 The district court's action against Bandyk, which took place Aug. 1, was 
announced by the SEC on Monday, a full 91 days later. The SEC's complaint 
alleges that Bandyk conducted "excessive, unsuitable and unauthorized trading" 
in his customers' accounts while working as a broker for Prudential Bache 
Securities Inc. in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD's action follows the release in September of a GAO report that found 
shortcomings in regulators' efforts to detect and discipline stockbrokers who 
violate securities laws. The GAO concluded that the full number of unscrupulous 
brokers active in the securities industry is unknown because informal 
disciplinary actions aren't currently required to be reported and because there 
are flaws in the system used for reporting disciplinary actions regulators 
take.

'94 SHAPES UP AS PROFITABLE FOR AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trade group representing the world's major airlines said Monday that the 
industry is poised to start making money again after four years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Jeanniot, director general of the International Air Transport Assn., 
however, told the annual meeting of the organization that a profit of $1 
billion expected for 1994 is no cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would represent a new beginning and give (airlines some) breathing 
space, as the painful process of restructuring continues," Jeanniot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the organization's 222 member airlines, which make up 95% 
of the world's scheduled air carriers, attended the gathering in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanniot said net losses on international scheduled flights totaled $4.1 
billion in 1993 alone, but total traffic was up 9.3% in the first eight months 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry, he said, is a long way from regaining a secure financial footing 
after net losses by member carriers of $15.6 billion on international scheduled 
services between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The years of losses have left airlines strapped for cash to modernize their 
fleets, Jeanniot said.

PRINCE DROPS IN FOR A 5-DAY VISIT; ROYALTY: CHARLES, HEIR TO BRITISH THRONE, 
PLANS TOURS OF EDUCATION AND YOUTH CENTERS IN L.A. HE CHARMS GUESTS DURING A 
RECEPTION AT THE CONSULATE AFTER HIS ARRIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, arrived in Los Angeles on a balmy 
Halloween afternoon, his first visit here in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits royalty in a democratic society, the prince of Wales traveled on a 
routine British Airways flight -- though he and his entourage of 11 did take up 
all of the first-class section. But unlike the reception for the other 260 
passengers, waiting for him was a red carpet flanked by Mayor Richard Riordan, 
British Ambassador Sir Robin Renwick, and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, plus a motorcade of shiny black Jaguars to whisk him to a reception at 
the British Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Not among that entourage -- his estranged wife, Diana, the princess of Wales. 
As Charles set off on a five-day visit -- mainly of education and youth centers 
in South-Central and other parts of Los Angeles -- he leaves behind a flurry of 
publicity as London papers present the latest details of his crumbled marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one glance at a newsstand from his motorcade will tell him that the 
headlines have followed him here. But given the other news distractions in Los 
Angeles, Charles may find the city a relatively safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very relaxed," said Riordan, who could be seen laughing as they 
chatted on the Tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport. As for the tabloid 
headlines, the mayor said: "I think he's capable of putting all that aside." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Charles did just that as he sped from the airport to the Hancock 
Park residence of British Consul General Merrick Baker-Bates for a reception 
for 200 -- who included community activists, local business leaders, a 
smattering of politicians, and one famous actress, British-born Angela 
Lansbury. 
</P>
<P>
 As most guests waited in the spacious garden behind the consul general's 
house, a receiving line of nearly a dozen people stood in the drawing room, 
chatting giddily and smoothing their hair into place in anticipation of the 
prince's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles glided into the drawing room, a phalanx of aides behind him, a flash 
of camera lights in front. He sported a double-breasted, dark-blue suit, and 
the back of his neck was ruddy from the sun. "He's been spending quite a lot of 
time outdoors the last couple of weeks in Scotland," said his press secretary, 
Allan Percival. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles moved along the line, his mellifluous voice so low that barely anyone 
other than the person to whom he talked could hear. He seemed a master at 
working a room -- for every person, he had something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked Shirley Allen, executive director of the Compton office of Cities in 
Schools, if she stayed in touch with another Cities in Schools coordinator in 
Wales. She proffered a gift of a pen and pencil set and paperweight -- 
emblazoned with the seal of the city of Compton -- and Charles thanked her 
before deftly handing it to an aide behind him who handed it to yet another 
aide behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 From Vic Wallis, the head of trade for the British Consulate, and his wife, 
Jaki, the prince wanted to know how they had fared during their move to Los 
Angeles two days after the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do they take extra time when they build houses here?" Charles asked them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour of the receiving line completed, the prince declared to the room: 
"Let's have a drink!" The group laughed, and Charles, who had just spent 10 1/2 
hours on a plane, mused, "It must be 6 o'clock in the world somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a dry reception -- orange juice, tonic and Evian water were 
lined up on tables. But Charles was too busy working the garden of guests to 
drink much of anything.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has a great sense of humor," said Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky as he left the party. "I reminded him that he and I had met 17 
years ago at City Hall and he said, 'Well, you still don't have a gray hair on 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden said he told the prince that he had once run in the 
London Marathon. "He invited me to come back and run it again," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Holden and Yaroslavsky, Los Angeles City Council President John 
Ferraro also made it to the reception. All the members of the council were 
invited. Deane Dana also made it from the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 After the garden party, Charles on behalf of his mother, the queen, conferred 
honorary British orders on two guests. Lansbury was appointed Commander of the 
British Empire. Arco Chairman Lod Cook, who has been involved in several of the 
prince's charities, was made the Honorary Knight Commander of the Most 
Excellent Order of the British Empire. Only in Britain are there titles like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I liked his ring and I wanted to get one," said Thomas Ferguson of 
Inner City Ministries, who admired the prince's gold signet ring. The prince 
told him the insignia dated back to the 1400s. "He said I couldn't get one," 
laughed Ferguson.

FLEISS TRIAL BEGINS WITH LITTLE FANFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an event that was supposed to be the sexiest trial of the year, 
exposing the bedroom antics of Tinseltown power mongers and a slew of 
wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a town where celebrity can be instant and its loss can occur in half 
that time, alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has clearly lost much of her 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid subdued fanfare and much security, jury selection began Downtown on 
Monday in the criminal case against Fleiss, who has pleaded not guilty to 
charges of pandering and possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heidi who ?" quipped John North, the Channel 7 correspondent covering the 
real news in town, the double-homicide trial of football hall of famer O.J. 
Simpson two doors away in the Downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Simpson. It's not Michael Jackson. It's not even Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not meritorious of our coverage," sniffed Kristin Jeannette-Meyers, an 
anchor for Court TV. "I mean, what is it really? It's just sleazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 28, faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted. She was arrested more 
than a year ago after she allegedly provided cocaine and four prostitutes to a 
Japanese businessman who turned out to be an undercover Beverly Hills police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Touted as the alleged "madam to the stars," profiled in the New Yorker, the 
green-eyed brunette was catapulted into the spotlight. Interest only heightened 
with speculation that Fleiss might eventually open her "black book," disclosing 
names of clients who allegedly included entertainment industry executives, 
producers and jet-set glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story of a football idol accused of killing his wife and her friend 
eclipsed the tale of the alleged Hollywood madam. To some, Fleiss became less 
exotic this summer when she -- along with her father -- was charged with the 
everyday sins of money laundering and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex and murder are not comparable to sex and income tax evasion -- it's not 
nearly as dramatic or compelling," said Melanie Lomax, a civil rights attorney 
not connected with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss and her father, Paul Fleiss, 60, a pediatrician, were arrested in 
August on federal charges of tax evasion and money laundering -- hiding 
hundreds of thousands of dollars made by the daughter's prostitution ring, 
prosecutors alleged. In September, Fleiss was arrested and admitted to a drug 
rehabilitation program after tests indicated that she used stimulants and 
depressants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she went into drug rehab, it took her down a peg," said Harlan Braun, a 
well-known defense attorney who is not involved in Fleiss' case. "It turns out 
she's probably just a dope addict as opposed to a daughter of a prominent 
pediatrician. Then the pediatrician was indicted along with her, so it sounds 
like a much less exotic story. Now it turns out she's a dope addict, daughter 
of an indicted pediatrician." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Department 105 in Superior Court on Monday, Fleiss' case was handled 
with all the trimmings of a quasi-high-profile event. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the courtroom was severely restricted. A court-issued press packet 
was distributed to a few waiting reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the courtroom of Judge Judith L. Champagne, a bespectacled Fleiss 
entered clad in a conservative blue suit. As she walked in, one prospective 
juror was overheard whispering to another, "Yup, that's her . Check her out." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to select a jury for Fleiss' trial, a 15-page questionnaire was 
handed out to 65 prospective jurors, and court was adjourned until next week so 
lawyers could review the responses. (In Simpson's case, 1,000 prospective 
jurors were summoned; about a third of them were asked to fill out 79-page 
questionnaires.) 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was a quiet day in Department 105. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went smoothly this morning," said Fleiss' attorney Donald Marks, 
who said the absence of a media circus made the day easier on his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Simpson case, after the court proceedings attorneys held no news 
conferences. The biggest excitement was the unexpected appearance of 
miniskirted Norma Jean Almodovar, a former LAPD civilian traffic controller 
arrested for pandering 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Almodovar stepped in front of the cameras to explain that she had attended 
Fleiss' proceeding to show support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consensual sex, it's nobody's business," said Almodovar, author of the 
book "Cop to Call Girl." "I'm here to make sure she gets a fair trial. . . . In 
California, there's a tremendous prejudice against people in the sex industry."

SCHOOL LETTER ON PROP. 187 DRAWS FIRE; EDUCATION: ANTONOVICH SAYS ACTION 
VIOLATES SPIRIT OF LAW BARRING PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM USING FUNDS FOR POLITICAL 
PURPOSES. OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAD DUTY TO REPORT EFFECTS OF THE LAW. 
</P>

<P>
 A Los Angeles Unified School District mailing about Proposition 187 has drawn 
the ire of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who says that, although legal, it 
"violates the spirit of the law" that prohibits public agencies from using 
taxpayer funds for political campaign purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, however, said they had a right and a duty to circulate 
information about how the anti-illegal immigration proposition would affect the 
district. They said the letters, sent to parents and political and community 
leaders, include only factual information and do not tell people how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich was one of the earliest supporters of the measure and its 
provisions for denying public services, including public education, to illegal 
immigrants. The Los Angeles Unified School District opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's "Dear Friend" letter, sent to about 2,000 leaders late last 
week and signed by the superintendent of schools and the school board 
president, states that the measure's passage would strip the district of $628 
million in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that you will agree that such a loss would cause a significant 
impact on the economy of our community, one that supersedes the magnitude of 
the aerospace losses suffered in recent times," it continues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the multilingual version mailed by individual schools to parents Monday, 
the district attempted to dispel rumors that schools already were reporting 
illegal students to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Board 
President Mark Slavkin said district officials had received several reports of 
fearful parents keeping their children home. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich maintains that estimates of lost jobs and federal funding are not 
facts but inaccurate propaganda based on the assumption that the federal 
government will withhold funding because the proposition would violate federal 
privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the possibility of that happening is nil because of Mr. Clinton's 
need to get reelected," said Steven Herbert, Antonovich's spokesman. "He would 
not snub this state and its electoral votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, efforts continued Monday to keep students in class in the wake of 
Friday's particularly rowdy protests in the San Fernando Valley, which drew 
thousands of students into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference at district headquarters, Supt. Sid Thompson warned 
that if students are arrested off campus for vandalism or other crimes, that 
record could haunt them the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also cautioned that teachers and administrators would face strong 
penalties -- up to and including firing -- if they encouraged students to walk 
out. Instead, Thompson has sent a letter to school principals asking them to 
consider organizing on-campus forums about the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We leave it open to the school and the school community to decide what to do 
and how to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, a group of Los Angeles-area high school student leaders 
suggested Monday that students walk precincts instead of walking out of class. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven leaders from schools in Los Angeles and Pasadena spoke out at the 
noon news conference, arranged by Taxpayers Against 187, a coalition of 
statewide education, health and law enforcement agencies seeking to defeat the 
get-tough measure. 
</P>
<P>
 They also released a Top 10 list of ways that students can help defeat 
Proposition 187, including putting "No on 187" messages on their backpacks, 
leading class discussions on the ballot measure, working at a phone bank or 
organizing a carwash or other type of fund-raiser to help pay for radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, a different approach was taken at a junior high school that had 
been closed Friday by a wild anti-Proposition 187 demonstration: Six San Diego 
police officers greeted students when they arrived Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen parents also had volunteered to help restore order at the school, 
which is 85% Latino, and teachers spent the day discussing the ballot measure 
with students. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we're through, our kids are going to understand 187 better than 
their parents," said Ronald Williams, principal at Southwest Junior High 
School.

ROBBERY SUSPECT SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City police shot and killed an armed robbery suspect Monday afternoon 
after he fled from the Fox Hills Mall to an area near Slauson Avenue and the 
Marina Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, an unidentified man about 30 years old, was wielding a sawed-off 
rifle and was believed to have robbed two stores in the area, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first robbery occurred at 12:40 .m. at a Wherehouse record store at 5577 
Sepulveda Blvd. An hour later, the J.C. Penney store in the Fox Hills Mall also 
was robbed and security guards chased the suspect from the store. Authorities 
said the man stole music cassettes from the Wherehouse and clothing from J.C. 
Penney. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the man fled, two Culver City police officers found him hiding the 
bushes along the Marina Freeway. 
</P>
<P>

killing him.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FAIRFAX AREA; RABBI 
GETS 5 YEARS IN MONEY-LAUNDERING SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles rabbi who agreed to launder drug money through a "holy network" 
of charities and nonprofit organizations was sentenced Monday to five years in 
federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Low, 44, rabbi at the ultra-Orthodox Mogen Abraham synagogue in the 
Fairfax area, was convicted April 7 of conspiring to commit money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi waived payment of any fines Low faced 
because he has no money to pay them, and he ordered the rabbi to surrender to 
authorities Nov. 21.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge denied a defense request to send Low to a halfway house so he would 
not be deprived of his religious requirements, which include specially prepared 
food and at least nine other men with whom to pray.  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said the Bureau of Prisons, in a letter to the court, pledged to 
abide by Low's religious requests, providing food supervised and certified by 
the Central Rabbinical Congress and sending him to a prison where there are 
other Jewish inmates.  
</P>
<P>
 Low said he was not "asking for freedom," adding: "I cannot and will not 
change my diet."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TOP LAPD OFFICIALS 
CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF MODERNIZATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials studying the Los Angeles Police Department's shortage of 
up-to-date crime-fighting tools criticized top police brass Monday for failing 
to develop a long-term plan for modernizing the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police administrators acknowledged the need for a modernization plan but said 
they are hesitant to propose it because such efforts have always been rejected 
for lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, police 
used videotapes and charts to show how outmoded equipment and turn-of-the 
century filing systems have hampered their ability to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the information superhighway, we are on a dirt road," said Police Sgt. 
Mike Moore, who testified about the need for modern radios and portable 
computers for beat officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the presentation, Councilman Marvin Braude, who chairs the 
panel, criticized police officials, saying he would fight to fund the 
department's modernization plan if only police officials would submit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are we going to see what the plan is?" he asked police officials. "The 
problems are overwhelming. We need answers now." 
</P>
<P>
 Police agreed that a comprehensive plan is needed and vowed to work on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple fact of the matter is, we don't have a comprehensive plan," said 
William F. Russell, commanding officer of the LAPD's support services bureau. 
"We have bits and pieces of plans that have been developed over the past 15 and 
20 years, but nothing has been brought forward to update all those plans, to 
bring them all together and to focus them as a long-term strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, a vocal supporter of the modernization effort, 
suggested that the city form a police task force, headed by a private 
consultant, to develop a modernization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Braude tabled the item for two weeks, saying he wanted to discuss the 
matter further with top LAPD brass. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, police said they have not proposed a modernization plan 
because they feared the City Council would reject it for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said a modified plan that was proposed about five years ago was killed 
because the city could not afford it.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to Danny Staggs, head of the police union, has been 
that the City Council does not want to be put in the politically embarrassing 
position of rejecting a modernization plan for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to take responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staggs and Russell agreed that the council is now more inclined to invest 
in the Police Department because of the election of pro-police Mayor Richard 
Riordan and four new council members, including Chick.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 19 
ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON ALLEGED GAMBLING RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen people were arrested when detectives moved in on what they 
characterized as one of the largest horse and sports gambling rings in the Los 
Angeles area, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal betting operation operated in several Southland communities and 
did millions of dollars in business weekly, said Los Angeles Police Department 
spokesman Rigo Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives culminated the 14-week investigation Sunday when they served 
warrants at 15 locations in Los Angeles, Inglewood, El Segundo, Downey, Anaheim 
Hills, Monterey Park, Arcadia, San Gabriel and Palm Desert, Romero said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was the largest horse and bookmaking operation that Administrative Vice 
Division detectives have encountered in many years," Romero said.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives estimated that the operation handled bets for more than 400 
gamblers, "doing a gross betting volume of several million dollars per week," 
he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYWOOD; MOTHER OF 
OFFICER'S KILLER ASKS JURY TO SPARE HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking softly in Spanish, the mother of a man convicted of killing a Maywood 
policeman urged a Los Angeles jury on Monday to send her son to prison "until 
God asks for him."  
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Contreras, wearing a white floral print dress that her son Jose gave 
her for Mother's Day, pleaded with the panel not to give her son the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honduran woman, who had never been in the United States until she was 
asked to testify on her son's behalf, seldom glanced at the 22-year-old, who 
wiped away tears from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked the panel to "let his punishment be (prison), until God asks for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, Edgardo Fuentes and Hector Reyna were found guilty last Thursday of 
the May 29, 1992, slaying of Officer John Hoglund, who was shot as he responded 
to a silent alarm at a Maywood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund, 46, was the first law enforcement officer in the community's 69-year 
history to be killed in the line of duty.  
</P>
<P>
 All three of the men are subject to the death penalty because the jury found 
that the crime included the special circumstances of murder of a police officer 
and murder in the course of a robbery and attempting to avoid arrest.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LITTLE TOKYO; DEVELOPER 
SEEKS $30 MILLION AFTER CITY CANCELS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles developer who was hired nearly six years ago to build a massive 
complex in Little Tokyo is seeking more than $30 million in damages in the wake 
of the City Council's decision last month to scrap the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker Pacific Group filed a claim against the city Friday seeking 
compensation for the millions of dollars it has invested in the development, 
known as 1st Street North. 
</P>
<P>
 "We acted in good faith,' said Michael D. Barker, the managing director for 
Barker Pacific. "To kill a project at the last minute is beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
 The project was to have included a municipal office tower, a hotel and an 
apartment complex and shopping center on 11 acres of city-owned property 
bounded by 1st, Alameda, San Pedro and Temple streets. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, however, said that they could no longer justify building 
the $151-million complex at a time when the city is reducing its staff and 
expenses.

DISAPPEARANCE OF 2 SALESMEN IN TORRANCE BAFFLES AUTHORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Kovach has made phone calls, sent faxes and flown across the country from 
his New Jersey home to help find his 26-year-old son, one of two Redondo Beach 
men who disappeared mysteriously last week from a Torrance cellular phone 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to tell him that we love him and we're praying dearly for him and we 
want to get to the bottom of this," said Kovach, 49, who flew to Los Angeles on 
Saturday to help search for his son.  
</P>
<P>
 The case has authorities baffled. Peter Kovach, 26, and Ted Gould, 29, were 
last seen Wednesday evening working at Galleria Telecom, a small phone and 
beeper shop along busy Hawthorne Boulevard. The two disappeared that night. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of Gould told authorities he stopped by the shop about 8 p.m. and 
found the door unlocked, the lights on but both men missing. No cash, 
merchandise or furniture were found missing from the shop, said Torrance Police 
Lt. Wally Murker. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner R.J. Panah believes the two were probably kidnaped. A dummy 
security camera that normally points toward the front door was facing the back 
of the office when he arrived. He said the men were model employees who worked 
weekdays and usually closed the store about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah drove by the shop and noticed the lights still on at 11 p.m. Wednesday, 
so he stopped in. Panah said he found Gould's friend, Paul Poduska, standing in 
the doorway waiting for the men. The missing men's car keys were on their 
desks, and their cars were parked nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ted's prescription sunglasses were still on the table," he said. "He never 
goes anywhere without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a $1,200 cellular phone owned by Kovach was still in the shop. Kovach 
never left without the phone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities consider the two men "missing under unusual circumstances," Murker 
said. Police contacted the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to aid in the 
investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've mobilized authorities on both coasts," John Kovach said. "We're using 
all the techniques we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovach is 6 feet and 215 pounds. Gould is 5 feet, 8 inches and 160 pounds. 
Both are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call Torrance detectives at (310) 618-5571 
during business hours, or (310) 618-5737 after hours.

PROGRAM FOR MENTALLY DISABLED FACES EVICTION; SOCIAL SERVICES: JOB TRAINING 
GROUP CONTENDS THAT BUREAUCRATIC SNAFU CAUSED ITS PROPERTY TO BE SOLD TO 
DEVELOPER. IT WILL SEEK TO BLOCK ACTION IN COURT TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit job training program for the mentally disabled is facing eviction 
from a Compton building where it has provided occupational training for a 
quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the program, the Mid-Cities Assn. for Retarded Citizens, will go 
to court today in an attempt to block the eviction by a real estate investor. 
Frank Prior purchased the association's property for a fraction of its worth at 
a county auction in February after the building fell into default on property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's lawyers say even if they succeed in stalling the eviction, they 
may have to pay rent to the new owner -- a burden the small program says it 
cannot afford. It counsels and trains about 200 disabled clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The association contends that it would have paid all its taxes if the county 
tax assessor's office had given it proper notice. The problem, according to 
program manager Betsog Jugo, is that the county billed the program for only one 
of the two buildings it owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jugo said the program's executive director, John Wagoner, made a special trip 
to the assessor's office to pay the taxes after receiving a notice that taxes 
were due. Jugo said the assessor's office gave Wagoner a bill for one of the 
two buildings on the lot on South Alameda Street. Wagoner was assured that the 
$10,000 he paid covered everything, Jugo said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until the county auctioned off the building -- on which another 
$19,000 in taxes was owed -- that the group became aware of the mix-up, Jugo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior bought the building for $38,000 -- far less than the building's actual 
value of $450,000, according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the group's attorneys, William Finer, said Prior refused an offer to 
buy the property back with interest and significant tax breaks. Prior then 
obtained the eviction order.  
</P>
<P>
 Prior could not be reached for comment. His attorneys said there had been no 
improprieties in his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Romero, a lawyer with the county counsel's office, said the county 
"complied with all notice requirements," and legally auctioned the property 
after the group failed for five years to pay a "direct assessment" tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's lawyers say they are hopeful that a Compton Municipal Court 
judge today will block the eviction. However, they say it will take a Superior 
Court trial, set for next March, to resolve the issue of ownership. No matter 
what the outcome, they say the program, which receives funding from state and 
private sources, could be forced to pay months of rent.

 Lyle and Erik Menendez will go back to trial March 13, the judge in the 
brothers' murder case said Friday, adding that he was inclined to hold a single 
retrial before one jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg said a March date struck a 
balance between the prosecution's request to start in December and a protest by 
Lyle Menendez's lawyers that they would not be ready until August. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg conceded that there was a "substantial amount of material" to absorb 
from the first seven-month trial, which ended in a mistrial in January. But a 
year, he said, was enough time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, will again face first-degree murder 
charges for the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, who remain in County Jail without bail, testified that they 
killed their parents in fear after years of abuse. Prosecutors, who are seeking 
the death penalty, contend that the brothers lashed out in hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, separate juries deadlocked between murder and lesser 
manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weisberg last week ruled out separate juries for the retrial, saying that 
arrangement presented too many logistic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Monday that it was his "expectation" that the case would proceed 
before a single jury. But he stressed that he had not yet ruled out trying the 
brothers separately, one after the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, he said, that ruling depends on what defense attorneys tell him about 
witnesses whose testimony might help one brother, but hurt the other, creating 
a potential conflict between the defense camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be decided is whether the new trial will be in Van Nuys, as was the 
first, or Downtown. Prosecutors said last week that they prefer Downtown. So 
did Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lawyer. Lyle Menendez's defense team did 
not yet have an opinion on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major lingering question is whether Jill Lansing, who was Lyle 
Menendez's lead lawyer at the first trial, will be coming back to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing resigned after the first trial, saying she wanted to spend more time 
with a young daughter. The public defender's office then took over the older 
brother's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lansing filed court papers last month saying that Lyle Menendez wants her 
back because he wants to go back to trial sooner than the public defenders can 
be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg said in court Monday that he was unsure if he had the legal authority 
to appoint Lansing when the public defender's office was available. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stressed that her appointment carries a complication -- the chance 
that she could be called as a witness against Lyle Menendez. That possibility 
led Monday to a two-hour closed-door hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first trial, Lyle Menendez admitted that he offered to bribe an 
ex-girlfriend to give false testimony, and prosecutors have said they might 
seek to call Lansing to testify about the episode. Weisberg made it clear 
Monday that he would like to avoid having an attorney become a witness, and 
added: "There has never been any indication Miss Lansing did anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 5.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / 38TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; HALLS OF ACADEMIA PRODUCE A KEEN 
POLITICAL RIVALRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Steve Horn used longtime connections crafted as an 
administrator and professor at Cal State Long Beach to buck a Democratic tide, 
sailing into the House of Representatives as one of a handful of Republican 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Republicans talking optimistically about making major gains in the 
November election, the tide is running the other way. But ironically, Horn 
faces a stiff challenge in the 38th Congressional District from Democrat Peter 
Mathews, who is vying to be one of a handful of Democrats to beat a Republican 
incumbent in a widely proclaimed GOP year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mathews victory also would make him the first American of East Indian 
descent in Congress since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts still predict Horn will prevail. Charles E. Cook Jr., the 
Washington-based editor of the Cook Political Report, acknowledges that 
Mathews' success in raising money means "he's a guy who's credible." 
</P>
<P>
 But noting the general trend bolstering Republicans this fall, Cook adds of 
Mathews' chances: "There's a phrase I keep finding myself plugging in here: 'In 
any other year . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, a 41-year-old political science professor at Cypress College who has 
taken a leave of absence to concentrate on his campaign, remains optimistic. 
"I'd say we're on the road to victory," he said recently in a Lakewood 
television studio, where he was to debate Horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 63, a former president of Cal State Long Beach, is taking nothing for 
granted. "We've been getting nothing but a good reception," he said. "But you 
should always run scared." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers should be enough to scare a GOP congressman. Horn represents a 
district in which 51% of the registered voters are Democrats, and only 36% are 
Republicans. But Horn's brand of moderate Republicanism, combined with a lot of 
attention to such local issues as keeping the Long Beach Naval Shipyard open, 
has struck a chord in the district, political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's "careful attention to detail . . . in the district" should enable him 
to withstand Mathews' challenge, contends local political consultant Jeff 
Adler. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes Long Beach, Signal Hill, Lakewood, Bellflower, 
Paramount, Downey and parts of San Pedro and Wilmington. It is an area hard hit 
by aerospace and defense cutbacks. The district's major employer, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long Beach, has laid off 30,000 workers 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first term, Horn has been a leader not only in efforts to keep the Navy 
shipyard off a federal list of facilities targeted for closing, but also to 
block cutbacks in Defense Department orders for McDonnell Douglas' C-17 
military cargo jets. 
</P>
<P>
 So effective has Horn been on these issues, supporters say, that a number of 
prominent Democrats are staying neutral in the race. And some, such as former 
Lakewood Mayor Jacqueline Rynerson and former Long Beach Assemblyman Fred W. 
Chel, have endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the campaign was what might be expected from a pair of 
academicians -- civilized and high-toned, with tame discussions about the 
relative merits of various national health care proposals. But as Election Day 
nears, the two candidates are increasingly contentious, with plenty of 
finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, who speaks in a rolling baritone, has accused his challenger of 
deliberately misrepresenting Horn's fund-raising practices. "That's a lie and 
you know it," Horn growled at Mathews during one debate, responding to a charge 
that he had taken money from political action committees despite a pledge not 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who has previously lost bids in congressional and assembly races, 
charged Horn with spreading bigotry by suggesting that he would be beholden to 
his East Indian contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, a youthful-looking man who drives a vintage Plymouth Valiant, has 
raised more than $100,000 by appealing to a national network of East Indian 
professionals, most of them physicians. Referring to those fund-raising 
efforts, Horn charged, "When Peter goes around the U.S., he says, 'If you elect 
me, I'll have a dual allegiance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews responded: "I'm surprised that you would stoop so low as to talk about 
ethnic slurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger concedes that he would try to make Washington more sensitive to 
"the complexities of Indian politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong with that?" he asks. "(Democratic Sen. Edward M.) Kennedy (of 
Massachusetts) represents the Irish." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews also has been attacking Horn's record at Cal State Long Beach, where 
during his 17 years as president he was twice censured by the Academic Senate 
for trying to dismiss tenured faculty members. Horn was forced to resign from 
the presidency in 1988 after a management review team criticized his management 
skills -- a finding which Horn dismisses as "political." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite heated differences in debate, Horn and Mathews are often not that far 
apart on the issues. Horn has crossed party lines to vote for such measures as 
the Clinton Administration's crime bill. Mathews voices some 
Republican-sounding positions, such as support for a balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and Peace and Freedom 
candidate Richard K. Green.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; PROFIT TAKERS SEND THE DOW SKIDDING 22.54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Blue-chip stocks tumbled Monday as investors sold issues that ran up in 
Friday's session, but technology stocks bucked the trend, ending the day with 
some gains. 
</P>
<P>
 After soaring more than 55 points Friday following a sharp advance in the bond 
market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.54 points Monday to close at 
3,908.12. In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 
about 9 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks traded only slightly lower until near the session's close, when 
computer-guided program trading intensified the Dow's decline, said James 
Melcher, president of Balestra Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the decline to significant division of opinion among stock 
analysts about the strength of the economy, inflation and the direction of 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all facts providing conflicting information, it is easy to justify any 
emotional decision, thus the market swings back and forth," Melcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research Corp., said much of 
Monday's stock market activity involved investors selling stocks that had 
gained in value Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were also hurt by a rise in long-term Treasury bond yields, which edged 
back toward 8% as some traders took profits in the aftermath of Friday's sharp 
price run-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year bond yield closed at 7.97%, up from Friday's 7.95%, 
pushing prices down 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Yields rise 
when prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors often look to the bond market for direction because higher 
rates make shares less attractive and increase the cost of money to companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were also looking ahead to key economic reports due out this week, 
Melcher said. Particular attention will be paid to today's report from the 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management and Friday's October employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors worry that signs of strong growth will push the Federal Reserve 
Board to nudge short-term interest rates higher for the sixth time this year. 
They fear that could slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also fell broadly in foreign exchange trading Monday, retreating 
from Friday's rally on new fears that inflation will haunt the economy and 
undermine the U.S. currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 96.85 Japanese yen, down from 97.28 on 
Friday. The dollar fell to 1.504 German marks, down from 1.515. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes were mixed, with the NYSE's composite index falling 
0.24 point to 258.69, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.42 
points to 472.35. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.34 points to 777.49 and, on 
the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.41 point to 458.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume came to 302.82 million shares, down from 381.58 million on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks sensitive to economic cycles, such as paper, transport and heavy 
equipment, fell. Deere lost 1 5/8 to 71 5/8, while International Paper tumbled 
2 1/8 to 74 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * In contrast, technology stocks fared well. Novell jumped 1 1/8 to 18 1/2 and 
Apple Computer was up 1 1/16 to 43 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense among some traders, Melcher said, is that what America does best is 
technology and that is where investment money ought to go. In addition, smaller 
stocks were hit hard in the spring and some are now relatively inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * RJR Nabisco Holdings ended up 1/8 at 6 7/8 after saying it plans to offer a 
19% stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp. in an initial public offering. RJR also 
said it is dropping plans to buy a 20% stake in Borden Inc. Borden fell 1/4 to 
13 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris sank 2 7/8 to 61 1/8 on news of a decision by a Florida judge 
Friday to certify a class-action lawsuit against major tobacco makers. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors fell 7/8 to 39 1/2 on speculation that the auto maker will 
cut up to 60,000 vehicles from its fourth-quarter production plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug companies rallied on bargain hunting and carry-over from strong 
third-quarter results. Schering-Plough rose 1 to 71 1/4 and Pfizer gained 3/4 
to 74 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly higher abroad. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed at 
2,071.63, up 31.31 points, while Tokyo's Nikkei average gained 184.44 points to 
19,989.60. In London, the Financial Times 100-share average added 13.6 points 
to close at 3,097.4. Mexico City's Bolsa index dropped 19.44 points to 
2,552.08.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF THE WALL; COMMUNIST 
EUROPE COLLAPSED IN A FEW MONTHS. BUT REBUILDING THE LIVES OF ITS PEOPLE IS A 
PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 November 9, 1989, the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever. 
Not even the most astute saw it coming. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989, Gyula Horn gave the 
order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run 
around the Berlin Wall, a move now seen as the beginning of the end for 
hard-line communism in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't realized that such historical change would come after that," Horn 
now says. 
</P>
<P>
 Far to the east in his Moscow office, former Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev looks back at might-have-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process could have gone in a different way if East Germany had changed, 
had opened up to the world," he claims, recalling how he urged that country's 
leadership to steer a reform course. "(Communist Party leader Erich) Honecker 
rejected it. So did most of his entourage. And they lost." 
</P>
<P>
 And how they lost.  
</P>
<P>
 The breathtaking speed of East Germany's demise, the sudden opening of the 
Berlin Wall and the rapid-fire collapse of similar regimes in Czechoslovakia, 
Bulgaria and Romania, all within a period of six weeks, left Europeans on both 
sides of the ideological divide euphoric, dizzy and woefully unprepared for the 
challenges of a post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, half a Continent has won its freedom, the military doctrine of 
mutually assured destruction belongs to history and few would turn the clock 
back if they could. Yet no one believed it could all be so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended visits by Times correspondents to five communities in four nations 
paint a new, often troubling picture of post-Cold War Europe as it struggles 
for a new direction. What they found is a patchwork of hope, success, worry, 
fear and a few pockets of total despair.  
</P>
<P>
 They found that with socialism's barriers to wealth and its protection from 
poverty stripped away, communities -- and nations -- in the formerly Communist 
east are gradually separating into winners, losers and those just trying to 
hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Polish industrial town of Plock, five years of freedom have brought 
the first millionaire, the first homeless shelter and a simple, hard truth 
about life without communism: No job is secure. " If you are not good at your 
job, you will lose it," said 20-year-old factory worker Teresa Bonatowska. "And 
even if you are good at your job, you may lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 Western cash injections running at $100 billion a year have generated economic 
liftoff for eastern Germany, but the weight of history still divides Germans in 
other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pick my countrymen, but I have more in common with Belgians and Dutch 
(than with eastern Germans)," notes Rainer Scherer, a technical school employee 
in the west German city of Pforzheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In parts of southeastern Europe, such as the onetime Romanian industrial 
stronghold of Vaslui, the end of communism has only made untenable conditions 
worse. There, official unemployment is 37%, and the quest for a better life 
remains mired in a rut of mistrust, manipulation and defeatism. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Romania's western border, the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the 
horrors of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina have destroyed more than a nation and 
its people. They have shaken the Continent's belief in itself and ended the 
myth that Europe had moved beyond such barbarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever their experience since 1989, one truth is agreed upon by all 
Europeans: Putting the Old World back together again will take far longer than 
anyone initially could have imagined.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be very impatient," recalls Vaclav Havel, the Czech revolutionary 
who is now his country's president. "Everything seemed to be moving slowly, but 
in the end, I have ... come to understand that everything needs its time."

 The walls of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's office are eerily bare, as though he does 
not plan to stay there long. 
</P>
<P>
 On one wall hangs a color photograph of Mt. Fuji, a gift from Japanese 
environmentalists, and in a corner stands a grandfather clock presented to 
Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, by a group of visiting South 
Korean legislators a few weeks ago. His tidy desk has a small lamp with a green 
shade, a modern version of the green glass lamp that graced the desk of the 
first Soviet leader, V.I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no photographs of Gorbachev with other world leaders, no holy relics 
of the history he helped reshape, no personal memorabilia, no sign that he was 
the central figure in Europe's drama of five years ago. At 63, he looks fitter 
than his old rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, full of energy and anxious to end what 
amounts to an internal political exile in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say he is an unreformed workaholic whose days routinely end at 2 a.m. In 
addition to running the Gorbachev Foundation, a combination think tank and 
presidential library with about 120 employees, Gorbachev is also president of 
the Green Cross, the Russian branch of an international environmental group. 
Recently, he completed a 1,000-page, two-volume memoir that will be published 
in five languages next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After his fall from power, Gorbachev was allowed to move back into the dacha 
in the western suburbs of Moscow that he occupied when he first came to the 
city in 1978 as Central Committee secretary for agriculture, aides said. There 
he takes a long daily walk with his wife, Raisa. She has slowly regained her 
health, which was damaged during the failed coup of August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations with Yeltsin remain poor. Gorbachev, who abhorred violence, 
denounced Yeltsin for resorting to shelling the Russian Parliament building 
last year to quash a hard-line revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Yeltsin has stripped Gorbachev of most of his office space, 
almost all of his perks, and according to Gorbachev's aides, much of his access 
to the media. Television correspondents tape interviews with the former Soviet 
leader that mysteriously never air. Aides blame an increasingly tame media for 
complying with an unofficial ban by the Yeltsin government on giving Gorbachev 
too much press. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev won't say whether he will run for elected office in Russia. But he 
has called for the formation of a centrist coalition of social democrats to 
provide a reformist alternative to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Times correspondent Sonni Efron, Gorbachev recalled the 
events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. What were you thinking as it became clear that Eastern Europe was 
falling away from the Soviet Union, and how do you see those events now? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. This was a time when our rejection of the Brezhnev doctrine (which 
declared Moscow's right to intervene militarily to rescue a Communist regime 
under threat) was already being tested most severely. It began in the first 
days when I was organizing (Konstantin U.) Chernenko's funeral (in March, 
1985), and immediately after I became the general secretary of the Communist 
Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 I called for a meeting. It was not reported to the news media. We discussed -- 
I told them -- that we would make a statement firmly supporting the position 
that we had declared more than once before: equality, independence and 
non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. Every (Communist) 
party is responsible for what it does in its own country. 
</P>
<P>
 I think my colleagues were not paying proper attention to these words. Perhaps 
it was because at that time there had been so many similar statements and 
everything had remained as before: strictly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 From that time on, this was our policy. Yes, of course we interacted. We took 
the initiative on many issues, especially on disarmament. But at the same time, 
we supported proposals from the other Warsaw Pact countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this was a novelty. Until then, usually initiatives had come from 
the Soviet Union. Well, except for an occasional eccentric move by (Romanian 
President Nicolae) Ceausescu. Sometimes, in order to demonstrate his 
independence, he would make some moves, as you remember. Yes, he made some 
proposals, but this was rather an exception, eccentric behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, everything was canonized and directed by the Soviet Union. Not 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was the beginning, the recognition of freedom of choice for every 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The other element of the new thinking was not to meddle. That a nation, 
whether it be the United States, the Soviet Union, China or any other country, 
should not impose its will, its interests, its model, on other nations, but 
should seek a balance and harmonization of interests, however difficult or 
complex that might be. 
</P>
<P>
 These are two elements of new thinking: recognition of freedom of choice for 
every nation and a balance of interests. This was the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, people said it was a revolution. This opened the way for 
people to make use of their natural rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was a very difficult choice, and people accepted this. They were 
influenced by perestroika (restructuring of Soviet society) and influenced by 
the changing situation in the world, and most of all, by the mutual 
understanding and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The most critical moment was when, in Poland, the government had problems with 
Solidarity. I should say this was not a command, an order, or instructions from 
me to (the Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech) Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
 We were, by the way, great friends. We were friends, and we remain friends. 
Very great friends. I have a very high opinion of the general. I think the 
Poles were very lucky that he headed their government at that decisive, 
difficult moment. He was a real Pole, but at the same time he was a man of a 
new background, with new views. For that reason, he did not use force (against 
Solidarity) and did not even introduce martial law. He tried to defuse the 
situation quickly and then open the road to democracy and changes and reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a testing ground for perestroika.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Was Jaruzelski surprised when you told him he had to come to terms with 
Solidarity? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. It came most of all from him. He understood that he had to find common 
ground. How else could he resolve the conflict with Solidarity? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if one of their political leaders irritates you or displeases you, still, 
this is the working class! These are the narod , the people! Jaruzelski 
understood this maybe even before I did. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a real discussion. We talked. We didn't need translators, he speaks 
wonderful Russian, and we didn't waste time. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other cases . . . I could not order East Germany to do exactly what 
we did. Do perestroika ! They needed it, I'm sure. But they did not accept 
perestroika . (East German leader Erich) Honecker rejected it, and so did most 
of his close entourage. And they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The process could have gone a different way if the GDR (East Germany) had 
changed, had opened up to the world, and allowed free contacts (with other 
nations). Then the process of rapprochement with West Germany also would have 
been different. But that's water under the bridge now. 
</P>
<P>
 But I remember how they resisted reform even though we did not demand anything 
of them. This was the very nature of perestroika , that we should teach them by 
our example, the example of perestroika . I did tell them that, in politics, 
latecomers lose. And I cited my own experience, of how we failed in the course 
of perestroika when we acted too late. 
</P>
<P>
 I said this after I was at a candlelight march, when I saw young East German 
men demonstrating against the regime. As for the fact that you noted, referring 
to (then-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula) Horn, he's an old friend of mine. 
The issue was not that Horn had to consult with me. These contacts were 
conducted between our two foreign ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 But nevertheless, we discussed the situation all the time. We were in constant 
contact, not only with the Hungarians but with East Germany and others as well. 
We were all worried about how to untie the knot. 
</P>
<P>
 So many people were gathering, they demanded resolution of the conflict. What, 
should we kick them out with force? We continued to be involved with the 
problem, but it caused a lot of tension in Hungary itself. And it put the 
Hungarian leadership in a peculiar position, as if it were dependent, not 
sovereign, as if it could not make its own decisions on its own soil. This 
problem had to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 So at a certain moment, they decided to open their borders to the Germans. 
Yes, they did not consult with us. The situation had already changed. 
</P>
<P>
 They probably thought about it and decided not to put us in a very difficult 
spot, not to trap themselves in a situation where they consulted us and 
suddenly we might be against it (opening the borders), and then they would 
still have to find a way to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nothing dramatic. There were no sudden misunderstandings or any such 
thing. No, life had already changed. New winds were blowing and new flags were 
flying. This was the political context. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing was our loyalty to our ideals. To the very end, we 
were faithful (to our ideals.) We did not interfere in their domestic affairs. 
We discussed the situation, we exchanged opinions, but we did not give anyone 
any ultimatums. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the Czechs. The only thing we told the Czechs was that they should 
find a political solution and reject any use of force. But that was not a 
demand. It was friendly advice. We told them that any other policy would not 
have been accepted in Czechoslovakia or in the rest of the world.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; LIFE WHERE THE CURTAIN PARTED; AT BORDER OF AUSTRIA 
AND HUNGARY WHERE EAST-WEST BARRIER WAS FIRST BREACHED, DREAMS ARE PANNING OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For much of Europe, the collapse of the Iron Curtain has been a mixed blessing 
-- a paradoxical blend of soaring hope and crushing disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so here. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Austrian-Hungarian frontier that once separated the Communist, 
totalitarian East from the democratic, free-market West, there is little 
argument: Life is decidedly better. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in this small Hungarian town and the Austrian farming village of 
Nickelsdorf three miles west across a mix of corn and potato fields, dreams are 
panning out. 
</P>
<P>
 The two communities, which for 40 years existed as isolated outposts in their 
respective political worlds, today find themselves at the center of a new 
Europe -- much as their respective mayors had predicted in interviews during 
the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiffs of change were in the air back then, but no one went so far as to talk 
of revolution, and no one thought of communism's imminent demise. Not even when 
the media converged on the area briefly to watch Hungarian soldiers tear out 
the first small section of the Iron Curtain did predictions go that far. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Solidarity's stunning election victory in Poland was still a month 
away, the collapse of the Berlin Wall merely a vague hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that, within 2 1/2 years, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
then the Soviet Union itself would disappear, was simply inconceivable in those 
first days of the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, life along the old East-West divide thrives in a very different world 
-- a world where a dangerous but stable superpower rivalry has gone, where only 
the United States exercises a genuine global role and where a new Russia 
struggles to define its place and its interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't developed as much in our entire history as we have in the past 
five years," noted Hegyeshalom's mayor, Zoltan Vincze. 
</P>
<P>
 He reeled off a list of accomplishments that began with a new indoor sports 
hall and leisure center and ran through the extension to the water system, new 
gas connections, a cable TV system, improved street lighting, a doubling of the 
number of telephones, renovation of the dentist's office and the arrival of a 
second doctor in this town of about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we have a pediatrician here," he said, pausing briefly 
for effect. "Things have really turned out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the town's state-owned land has been privatized, 10 new grocery 
stores have opened, unemployment is steady at 4% to 5%, several homes have been 
repainted, the church has a new roof and when Vincze makes his rounds, he no 
longer drives a Russian-made Lada but a Peugeot 305. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the frontier in Nickelsdorf, it's also been a good five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of '89, as Europe edged toward the brink, Mayor Gerhard Jocham 
saw the political liberalization in Hungary and Poland as a chance to breathe 
new life into his isolated village.  
</P>
<P>
 With luck, he said then, the exodus of young people that had drained the 
community of nearly half its population during the Cold War years might even be 
stemmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Nickelsdorf's population has not only stabilized, it's beginning to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Just off the village square in a tiny office crammed with official keepsakes 
and souvenirs, Jocham lists the prospects: 18 jobs at two filling stations 
about to open up on the new four-lane highway connecting Vienna and Budapest, a 
number of other jobs at a rest-stop hotel and still more at a 27-acre 
commercial park that will be built nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to have 2,000 people living here by the turn of the century," he 
said. Such a figure would be a 20% jump over 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 With Austria set to join the European Union in January and Hungary having 
already formally applied, the border region's future seems brighter still. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Hungary comes in, we'll be in the middle of the world's richest market," 
he said. "Then, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Much progress is already visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the final Austrian section of the Vienna-Budapest highway was 
opened to traffic, and work on the Hungarian side is scheduled for completion 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of Nickelsdorf are also under construction, ripped open for the 
upgraded sewage system needed to accommodate the new hotel and commercial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials expect work to start soon on new low-cost housing and upgraded 
shopping facilities, including a supermarket, drugstore and furniture outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, people are going to commute, but we want to give them a chance to 
live here too," Jocham said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, life hasn't been all smooth sailing along this old Cold War 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungarian skilled laborers willing to work illegally for a quarter the salary 
of their Austrian counterparts have eased unemployment in Hungary and lowered 
construction costs in eastern Austria, but they have also angered local workers 
and their union executives. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 A shopping arcade on the Hungarian side just off the Vienna-Budapest highway 
that was once seen as a key money-earner for Hegyeshalom has been plagued with 
problems. Its original developers went broke last year, and with capital 
extremely short in Hungary, the venture was sold to a group of Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners talk of expanding the arcade, adding stores and paving the dirt 
parking lot, but local officials still aren't happy. They have a hunch the 
Libyans are using the arcade only as a money-laundering operation for more 
dubious business activities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials also worry about the social costs of restructuring the town's 
economy away from the stone quarry and railway that sustained it through the 
Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like someone threw a light on after living 40 years in the dark," 
Vincze said. "It's been blinding. We've suddenly moved into a new age of 
technology, and the semi-skilled workers over 40 simply can't deal with it. We 
thought we'd get more help, but we didn't. We've learned that you have to help 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincze, whose years as mayor span Hungary's transition to a multi-party 
democracy, also laments a gap of individual initiative between Hungarians and 
Austrians. "You've heard about the differences between East and West Germans?" 
he asked. "Well, here it's worse. It's the generations grown under communism. 
You've got to push, push and push some more." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the coming years bring for the two communities, it will be tough to 
top the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 For both communities, the changes really began during the spring of 1989, when 
tens of thousands of Hungarians armed with special visas and enough hard 
currency to do some serious buying crossed into Austria and bought just about 
every television set, video recorder and microwave oven east of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the reformist Hungarian Communist government decided the 
Iron Curtain was out of date. It ordered troops in to roll up the barbed wire, 
dismantle the watchtowers and end the armed patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be summer before the first East Germans vacationing in Hungary 
realized that they could reach the West by simply walking through these open 
fields, but once they did, the Berlin Wall would quickly fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In that hectic summer, Nickelsdorf became a boom town of sorts. With a 
population of 1,650, it sported no fewer than 28 stores catering to Hungarian 
day-trippers, selling consumer durables from TV sets to washing machines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Two for us, 26 for the Hungarians," Jocham joked at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with the Hungarian demand satiated and money tight, three such shops 
remain. "We get some Hungarians in here, but the big rush is gone," said an 
assistant at one of the stores on Lower Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Weiss grocery store a few doors down, customers still recall the 
out-of-towners who came in that summer to open large electronics stores along 
the main drag. "One of 'em spent 5 million schillings ($500,000) for a place 
down there on the corner, but he was too late," an elderly customer named 
Schmidt recalled. "He missed the wave and went broke within a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Few in Nickelsdorf seem to lament the passing of the boom. Even fewer miss the 
traffic that tied the village in knots. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is as if the Iron Curtain had never been. There is no monument, no 
reminder, no real trace of Europe's great scar. Just two mundane border stakes 
and a roughly cut strip of brown grass mark the line of the infamous barrier 
that divided the world into opposing armed camps for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a twist of history as well as a sign of new times that a watchtower 
recently sprung up on the Austrian side to help Austrian army patrols spot 
immigrants trying to slip into the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 But little stirs here, and amid the quiet of a mid-autumn afternoon, only one 
sound rises from the distance: the sound of heavy trucks moving east and west 
along the nearby highway. Eastern European Economies 
</P>
<P>
 One way to measure economic reform in Eastern Europe is by the percentage of 
gross national product (GNP) contributed by private enterprise. Figures shown 
are estimates.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a wet, dreary morning, and the sulfurous belches from Poland's largest 
petroleum refinery had this medieval town stinking like a rotten egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazimierz Matuszewski's mood was just as foul. He was neatly dressed in 
pressed trousers and a matching knit shirt, but the unending line at the 
unemployment office had deposited him outside the front door. By the time he 
worked his way inside and got the bad news, he was soggy and ornery. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, no jobs. At least not for a 56-year-old former office worker who has 
been unemployed for more than a year. Matuszewski had heard it so many times 
before that he wondered aloud why he even bothered anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under communism, we all had a good life," he said wistfully, mopping 
raindrops from his bushy brow. "Everyone had security, everyone was granted a 
job. Even medicine was free. Now Poland is like America. You need a lot of 
money to get anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Just off the main road a short distance away, Stanislaw Tucholski was sifting 
through a stack of invoices in the musty garage of his red-brick house. Tens of 
thousands of dollars in electronic and machine parts extended into the rafters. 
His Volkswagen had been long ago relegated to the pothole-ridden street. 
</P>
<P>
 The converted garage is a retail shop and showroom for Tucholski's thriving 
metal works company, started in the late 1980s as a one-man operation hammering 
steel in the same cramped quarters. Tucholski now has 20 people working for 
him. His wife, Janina, helps run the business, and he is expanding into a 
cathedral-sized blacksmith's shop just outside of town. His $60,000 in monthly 
orders come from as far away as Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people complain that things were better the old way," said 
Tucholski, 45, who went to work for himself as a means of survival after being 
fired from his state construction job because of his Solidarity trade union 
activities. "That is nonsense. I dreamed all my life of having something of my 
own, and this would have been impossible until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucholski is bullish on Poland's future; Matuszewski longs for its past. 
Together they reflect the seesaw struggle for the nation's heart and soul being 
carried out every day in towns and villages from the Baltic Sea to the Tatra 
Mountains, places much like this former riverfront capital 75 miles northwest 
of Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the post-Communist experiment in Poland, as in much of Eastern 
Europe, is being debated by politicians, businessmen and academics in Warsaw, 
Gdansk and Krakow. But it is also being sorted out -- often with great anguish 
and hand-wringing -- by everyday Poles in little-known outposts in Poland's 
heartland, unwavering towns that have outlasted centuries of change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have shown that we can produce a revolution to destroy something, but we 
have yet to show that we can create something as well," said Andrzej Celinski, 
a former Solidarity activist who represents Plock in the Polish Parliament. 
"Unfortunately, in towns like Plock many people's mentality is still in 
communism. They have freedom, but they are not using it as pioneers would." 
</P>
<P>
 Plock has endured many invasions in its thousand-year history, and town 
historian Jakub Chojnacki predicted with confidence that it will master the 
capitalist one as well. People complain a lot these days, he said impatiently 
from his antique-adorned Old Town office, but he said the arrival of free 
markets most probably will be recorded by future historians as just another 
colorful fiber in the plush historic fabric in this town, whose name in Polish 
is pronounced Pwawtsk . 
</P>
<P>
 Plock's story is Poland's story, a continuum of triumph and failure. It has 
been plundered and raided from east and west, has played host to kings and 
queens, has served as the nation's capital, has burned to the ground half a 
dozen times and has been swallowed up by Germany twice in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, as part of the socialist vision of an industrialized workers' 
paradise, one of the largest petrochemical refineries in Eastern Europe was 
erected at the north end of town. It is a vast complex that has polluted the 
air, dirtied the soil, tripled the town's population and cluttered its historic 
horizon with unsightly smokestacks and concrete apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 free-market economy will change this town as well," said Chojnacki, who does 
not hide his nostalgia for the lost Communist era, a period when his 
174-year-old Plock Scientific Society enjoyed generous state subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is still a question of many years to come," he added. "The old 
system gave us free schools, retirement benefits and what we call the Plock 
phenomenon -- 30 years of industrialization. We are still waiting to see what 
the new system will bring." 
</P>
<P>
 The wait is now entering its sixth year, and so far the unfolding journey has 
been a turbulent one, an emotional and psychological roller-coaster ride that 
has not yet settled on a steady course. For every success in this town of 
130,000, it is easy to find a failure; for every hopeful dreamer, a bitter 
cynic. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years of democracy have given Plock its first millionaire, a clever 
investor who drives a top-model Mercedes and runs his business from a cellular 
telephone. It has also given the town its first homeless shelter, a small 
building near the main street where about 30 victims of alcoholism and drug 
abuse struggle to collect their lives every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "These used to be hidden problems under communism -- you weren't allowed to 
speak about them," said Rev. Marek Smogorzewski, director of parish life for 
the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plock, which runs the shelter. "The changes have 
helped reveal that a lot of people have been left out and are needy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious high school students at the prestigious 800-year-old Malachowski 
School in the center of Old Town gather in the afternoons in an entrepreneur's 
club and talk openly about earning lots of money. At a nearby pedestrian mall, 
other teen-agers waste away the afternoons smoking cigarettes and roaming the 
streets. Police say teen-age thieves looking for a shortcut to capitalism pose 
the city's biggest crime threat.

 "It is very important to get a job that pays well," said 18-year-old Sebastian 
Kajak, who was writing mathematical equations in a Malachowski study hall. "In 
these times, you have to make sure you can manage financially." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside on the cobblestoned streets it is virtually impossible to find a place 
to park, thanks to a proliferation of automobiles that would have been 
inconceivable under communism. Plock has one of the highest levels of car 
ownership in Poland, but its good fortune has come at a price. Car thefts are 
among the most common crimes in Plock, and the lure of easy money has 
apparently been too great even for some law enforcement officials. Police 
recently cracked one of the biggest rings of local thieves, only to discover 
the leader was a police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still learning this new way of life," said Andrzej Dretkiewicz, the 
city's mayor. "We didn't have the luxury of going to a democratic country to 
observe how it worked. It has been difficult, but we are trying to make it 
work."  
</P>
<P>
 Even the 12th-Century Plock cathedral has been struggling with the adjustment. 
High on a bluff overlooking the Vistula River at the edge of Old Town, it is 
one of the oldest churches in Poland and one of only three burial sites of 
Polish kings. 
</P>
<P>
 During 45 years of communism, it became a closed fortress, an inward-looking 
refuge for defiant Poles searching for faith in a faithless political system. 
Today, traditionally clad Roman Catholic priests and nuns openly walk the 
narrow streets of Old Town, attend civic events, bless factories and public 
works projects, and run the homeless shelter, a soup kitchen and a religious 
radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 But five years of democracy have plunged the church into an identity crisis. 
The crowded Masses -- and overloaded collection plates -- of the 1980s are 
gone; offerings are off by nearly two-thirds. Many priests, accustomed to a 
life of seclusion, have found it difficult to get out among parishioners, while 
churchgoers, used to seeing priests behind the scenes, resent their sudden 
visibility and public moralizing. Two-thirds of Poles surveyed in a recent poll 
said the role of the church in politics is too great. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years Polish Catholicism combined two things: faith and a voice of 
protest," said Smogorzewski, the diocese official. "When freedom came, the 
element of protest was eliminated. This is a time of adjustment and transition 
in Plock, and that includes the Catholic church." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has the transition been more trying than in the job market, which 
under communism was synonymous with full employment but now resembles a game of 
Russian roulette. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of new jobs is everywhere. Billboards and storefront advertisements 
beckon customers on main roads and back alleys to hundreds of new shops and 
storefront businesses. Living rooms and bedrooms have been converted into 
offices and makeshift workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Miroslaw Drozdz, a pipe-smoking 42-year-old entrepreneur, his 
three-bedroom apartment doubles as a production line for customized T-shirts, 
caps and pins. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Drozdz's third incarnation as a self-employed businessman. He made gobs 
of money in construction, then lost it all when a deal went sour and a business 
partner double-crossed him. He then leased a Danish tour bus and ran luxury 
European tours, but soon went belly up when the value of the dollar jumped, and 
he could no longer afford his loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't laugh," he said apologetically as he demonstrated his newest 
trade on a hand-held pin-making machine in his son's bedroom. "It took me a 
year to get my sanity back. I haven't had anything to drink since a year ago 
June. Thanks to these little buttons -- did I tell you they are made of 
American steel? -- we can manage to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 8,000 daring entrepreneurs -- from seamstresses to computer programmers 
-- have jumped headfirst into the market economy in Plock, building businesses, 
hiring workers and helping fuel Poland's astounding economic growth, which is 
among the highest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, countless have failed. More than 13,000 people -- about 20% 
of the local labor force -- cannot find work at all, also among the highest 
levels in Europe. Huge state-owned enterprises have let go thousands of 
employees, with a local sweater factory the latest in a long line. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the 1,800 garment workers at the Cotex factory will be out 
of work by Christmas in a last-ditch effort to make the company competitive. 
When it opened in the 1970s, the operation was already outdated, having been 
stocked with antiquated East German equipment. It did not matter then, but 
today half the machines sit idle because they were designed to sew poor-quality 
sweaters for export to the Soviet Union, a market that collapsed with the Iron 
Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a new reality here that we have had to accept: If you are not good 
at your job, you will lose it," said Teresa Bonatowska, a 20-year Cotex 
employee and union leader. "And even if you are good at your job, you may lose 
it too." 
</P>
<P>
 But Plock has accomplishments, and among the most heralded has been bringing 
in the coveted symbol of the capitalist West -- Levi Strauss blue jeans. Since 
1992, Levi Strauss' factory No. 273 has churned out more than 2 million pairs 
of jeans a year from a nondescript refurbished warehouse stuck among a 
collection of apartment buildings not far from the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Town authorities were so eager to get Levi Strauss that they agreed to lease 
the football-field-sized warehouse to the U.S. company for less than a penny a 
year, enough to persuade Levi Strauss to cut off negotiations with other Polish 
bidders. Foreign investors, particularly big-name ones, were seen as Plock's 
ticket to instant fortune and full employment, and town officials went to 
extreme lengths to please the San Francisco pants maker. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign investment euphoria has fizzled. No other Western companies 
have planted their roots in Plock, and local authorities, reflecting a growing 
public disenchantment with the failed miracle, have become decidedly more 
hostile toward the jeans giant. Complaints about noise and water pollution top 
the list of gripes, followed by general resentment toward a hoped-for cash cow 
that has not lived up to its promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Levi became a symbol of disappointment in Plock, and some local politicians 
wanted to build political capital at its expense," said Wieslaw Ryszard 
Kossakowski, a former City Council member who was elected to Parliament last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Levi Strauss said it has been a bumpy road. The company has had 
trouble filling middle-management jobs because of the dearth of experienced 
Poles familiar with Western business practices. Customs regulations have been 
costly and onerous, a particular concern since most of the jeans are exported 
-- Poles cannot afford the $60 price tag -- and almost all the fabric and raw 
materials have to be imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi Strauss would like to find Polish suppliers, but so far none have met 
minimum quality standards -- even for basic items such as pocket liners. The 
Poles also have poor records of meeting deadlines and filling orders on time, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi Strauss' operations director, Jim Watson, a plain-speaking bearded 
Scotsman, said that the plant makes money and produces a high-quality product 
but that the headaches of doing business in Plock have been more severe than 
ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't always concentrate on what you came here to do," Watson said. "It 
is like there is a thorn always in your side." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience at Levi Strauss has been watched closely across town at 
Petrochemia Plock, the huge state-owned oil refinery that provides about 8,500 
well-paying jobs in town and processes two-thirds of the fuel consumed in 
Poland. The refinery is on the lookout for a foreign investor willing to drop 
$1.5 billion to make it competitive with Western oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling refinery is the second-largest taxpayer in Poland and the 
biggest contributor to the Plock city budget. Its future, in some form, is 
secure, but the relative calm of the last five years is likely to soon pass. 
Company officials say they do not intend to lay off workers, but they 
acknowledge that such pledges are really contingent upon who buys into the 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty at Petrochemia hangs over Plock like a dark cloud of its 
noxious emissions. Five years ago, workers would have celebrated the prospect 
of a Western investor buying the company, but today "privatization" has become 
a word of fear and distrust, a precursor to joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Director Dariusz Krajowski-Kukiel, 38, one of the company's new 
breed of managers, is keenly aware of the task before him. The direction that 
the oil giant and the city of Plock take over the next few years will largely 
be determined by people like him -- go-getters who are young enough to envision 
a better future but old enough to remember the miserable past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to build a new image," Krajowski-Kukiel said from a newly 
refurbished office at the otherwise drab company headquarters. "We want to make 
it so that when you say you are from Plock, you have reason to be proud. That 
was not the case under socialism."

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; LUDWIGSFELDE, GERMANY; . . SEEKING FOR MIDDLE GROUND 
IN THE EAST; CAPITALISM HAS PROVEN A ROLLER COASTER OF HOPE AND DESPAIR, 
BRINGING JOBLESSNESS AND CRIME ALONG WITH NEW INVESTMENT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This community of 23,000 was a Communist poster-town during the East German 
years: an adequate if dreary-looking settlement built up around a single huge 
truck factory, a place where most people enjoyed cradle-to-grave security in 
drab, prefabricated cement apartment blocks thrown up by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, life is far more uncertain and also far more exciting. Over the past 
five years, Ludwigsfelde, less than an hour's drive south of Berlin, has ridden 
a roller coaster of hopes and disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the way that the past five years have turned out for Klaus Perlet and 
Reinhold Schulz, both former truck mechanics in Ludwigsfelde. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlet, for his part, has the luxury of contemplating his transformation from 
socialist worker-bee to entrepreneur in the comfort and style of the skylighted 
head office of the metal-working firm he has owned since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have fun," says the heavyset Perlet, sitting amid a potted-plant decor and 
blueprints spread across his drafting table. "I love the feeling of making my 
own decisions, of finding the way for this little business. But I have two 
souls in my chest. One of them is the soul of a proprietor, who has to find a 
place in a very competitive market. The other is just the soul of a human 
being, trying to work with others. These two souls can't always be reconciled." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, across town, just off the parking lot that passes for 
Ludwigsfelde's town square, Schulz is taking advantage of the last lingering 
rays of autumn sunshine to drink a little beer outdoors and watch the world go 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 For Schulz, there is no point in soul-searching these days about free markets 
and the human condition; there is barely any point in getting out of bed in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of East German communism has spelled for him not opportunity, but a 
chain reaction that started with the loss of his good factory job and ended up 
with life in a flophouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived better before than I do now," says Schulz, who was rescued from the 
street by a fellow jobless man, Werner Nowark, and brought home to the 
unheated, unlighted apartment the two now share. Schulz lost his old flat when 
the owner renovated the building and raised the rent; the so-called guest house 
where he was subsequently accommodated was torn down, and in the confusion that 
marked eastern Germany in the early 1990s, he never managed to find another 
place of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I couldn't ever get bananas in East Germany, and the coffee cost more," 
Schulz says. "A color TV set cost a fortune. But I had work. I could wake up in 
the morning and look forward to the day. I had something to be happy about. Now 
I wake up and I say to myself, 'What do I do with myself today?' "  
</P>
<P>
 They are extremes, perhaps, the two mechanics: one who commands a staff of 
nine and the other approaching a state of utter dereliction. Yet the picture of 
eastern Germany five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall includes many 
examples of extreme adaptation and failure, and a whole spectrum of people in 
between: rising go-getters who drive cars with radio phones plugged into the 
dashboard, embittered 50-year-olds who will never work again, frightened 
elderly on scanty state pensions and tough Rosie-the-Riveter types who now stay 
home unwillingly with small children. 
</P>
<P>
 A look around eastern Germany today turns up any number of Ludwigsfeldes, 
places where East German economic planners once decided to found single 
industries -- electronics, perhaps, or steel-milling -- and where the local 
economies collapsed when communism failed and steady Eastern Bloc markets dried 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwigsfelde is better off today than many of these central-planning outposts. 
Its new, post-Communist administrators have managed to court a handsome number 
of private investments -- altogether, $510 million worth of new business 
through 1993 -- and to put a respectable percentage of the able-bodied adult 
population back to work. It has a dynamic mayor, Heinrich Scholl, a former 
circus executive and a free thinker who chafed under East German-style 
communism. He has worked with relish since the regime's collapse to fulfill 
capitalism's textbook promise. 
</P>
<P>
 But most people in Ludwigsfelde are conscious of the five years of ceaseless 
struggle endured just to bring their community this far, and of how much 
further they still have to go before life ever feels secure again. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall unemployment rate here is about 10%, significantly lower than in 
the rest of eastern Germany, but the figure is kept down artificially by 
make-work schemes. A depressing 65% of the jobless are skilled women. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have simply given up on the town: Hundreds have moved away since 
1989. An estimated 10% to 15% of the townspeople still support the former 
Communist Party, reorganized and renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism. 
Others take out their frustrations by engaging in violence against foreigners 
and vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call the mood in this city right now one of repressed optimism," said 
Gerhard Birk, a longtime Ludwigsfelde resident who now works as an archivist 
for the state government. "The place is changing now from a simple factory 
settlement to a town in its own right, with its own typical flair. The 
direction is upward, but we are moving very gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel satisfied when I bump into people I knew in the old days who are 
working again now," added Karl-Heinz Reifenberger, a former East German 
accountant who is now charged with privatizing what's left of the former truck 
works. "But, when I walk by the old production halls that are still standing 
empty, I feel frustrated and bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwigsfelde traces its origins to 1750, but it really came into its own as a 
town in 1936, when Daimler-Benz and Adolf Hitler's aviation ministry chose it 
as the site of a vast, strategically decisive fighter-aircraft factory. The 
town boomed as Daimler recruited young workers from across Germany and set them 
to work building warplanes. After universal conscription was imposed, Daimler 
kept the factory going with forced labor from concentration camps and with 
POWs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, the advancing Red Army captured Ludwigsfelde, dismantled the aircraft 
factory and carted the hardware back as war reparations. When the German 
Democratic Republic opened for business in 1949, the new government faced a 
problem: Ludwigsfelde had a population of skilled industrial artisans and no 
work for them to do. So the central planners brought in industry: first, a 
state-owned aircraft-engine factory, and later, after the prototype aircraft 
crashed, a huge truck factory called IFA Automobilwerk Ludwigsfelde. 
</P>
<P>
 Within East Germany's planned economy, IFA emerged as a model factory, and 
Ludwigsfelde again thrived as a model town. Most of IFA's output was exported 
throughout the Eastern Bloc and the Third World, although East Germany had 
plenty of farm produce to get to market, so there was a big domestic demand 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Berlin Wall came down, nearly 10,000 people were punching the 
clock on IFA's sprawling, 540-acre grounds. Schulz recalls that as a skilled 
mechanic he made 1,100 eastmarks per month -- in an economy where a standard 
apartment rented for 40 eastmarks per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Factory management and the government, tightly intertwined, saw to all the 
bedrock wants of the townspeople. IFA administered the local government, 
distributed heat, water and power, ran a hotel, operated most of the local 
day-care centers and even provided all-important wurst out of its own butcher 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as you didn't step out of line, life here was comfortable -- so much 
so that the unrest that swept the larger East German cities in 1989 never 
really touched Ludwigsfelde. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the feeling that the Wende (the Great Change) was happening someplace 
else, and not in Ludwigsfelde," says Ute Schmidt, a former teacher who is now 
Ludwigsfelde's equal rights commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the East German regime collapsed before their eyes, she says, people 
in Ludwigsfelde innocently assumed that not much trouble would come their way 
because of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'Now we can travel,' or 'now we'll need hard currency,' but it 
didn't occur to them that their individual lives would be affected," she says. 
"Nobody was talking about the danger of losing a job, or not being able to find 
an apartment. It just wasn't a topic." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when orders stopped coming into the truck factory, when production ground 
to a standstill and word went out that entire departments might have to be 
closed, people still did not grasp quite what was happening. Some people -- 
women, in particular, says Schmidt -- grabbed at their pink slips greedily, 
delighted at the chance for some time off and assuming in their innocence that 
they would always be able to find work later. Unemployment in East Germany had 
been unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, women had no idea what it really meant to stay home," says 
Schmidt, pointing out that virtually 100% of Ludwigsfelde's working-age women 
had factory jobs and sent their children to day care. "They didn't know how 
hard it would be to come back later. . . . When I look back now, I think that 
our mistake was having started from the assumption that we would improve upon 
what we had (under communism). It didn't occur to us that we should have been 
defending our position." 
</P>
<P>
 The blissful optimism was nurtured, in particular, by Daimler-Benz, which 
suddenly returned to Ludwigsfelde, seeking the return of its old World War II 
factory site. 
</P>
<P>
 The land claim failed -- the expropriation was deemed a valid and irreversible 
sanction for Daimler's wartime use of forced labor -- but then Daimler's 
flagship subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz, announced that it would come to 
Ludwigsfelde just the same, buying a separate tract of land and building 
Europe's biggest truck factory from the ground up, with jobs for 4,000 of IFA's 
former work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just assumed Mercedes-Benz would come and save their lives," Schmidt 
remembers. "They didn't realize Mercedes would come only on the condition that 
it could make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 And as it turned out, Mercedes came to the conclusion that it could not make a 
profit on trucks here -- not, at least, in a new factory. In the end, it bought 
out just a portion of the old IFA works and has hired only about 1,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the big Mercedes-Benz project burst like a balloon, it triggered a wave 
of disappointment and a wave of outward migration," says Birk, the archivist. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, reality sank in: Capitalism would not be an uncomplicated good for 
Ludwigsfelde. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand in hand with the federal government, people such as Reifenberger, the 
privatization officer, began the slow, frustrating work of selling off 
piecemeal the factory that had once treated them so protectively. Skilled 
workers, such as Schulz, began to understand that they might never hold regular 
jobs again. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt says she began receiving a stream of women in her office, former 
forklift drivers or metal stampers, complaining that they were going out of 
their minds at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, ever again will we have as many working women as in the German 
Democratic Republic," she says. "And never again will we have working 
conditions that are so fair for women." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Reifenberger, whose official title is the baleful-sounding 
Representative of the Liquidator, has managed to attract more than a dozen West 
German investors to the old factory grounds. They produce everything from 
aircraft turbines to armored cars. These new investors employ about 3,800 of 
the 10,000 who used to work here. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as it registers the entrepreneurial successes of such native sons as 
Klaus Perlet, Ludwigsfelde must come to terms with the likes of Reinhold 
Schulz, who spends his days gathering firewood for the stove and his nights 
warding off neo-Nazi street toughs. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, he reports, skinheads in the town set a 65-year-old 
acquaintance on fire; the man later died in the hospital. Hooligans have 
smashed all the windows in Schulz's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinhead violence has flared in the east since German unification, but until 
about 1993, it was generally directed at foreigners who were perceived as 
stealing jobs from Germans. Now that there are stringent restrictions on who 
may enter Germany, the number of attacks has fallen off somewhat, but the 
target group has broadened to include anyone the attackers see as weaker than 
they: tramps, beggars, slum dwellers and other unfortunates. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulz's story, sad as it is, is doubly shocking in a society where vagrants 
and bag ladies were until recently unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never go out by myself, and I walk only on well-lit streets," Schulz says. 
"If I could afford a gun, I would shoot the next person who hassles me. I don't 
want to get set on fire, like my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no longer afraid of brutality from the state," says local Pastor Bernd 
Schewe. "Now, I'm afraid of the violence directed from one individual against 
another. We didn't have that in East Germany. You could walk in the street at 
midnight and nothing would happen to you. A woman could go into the forest 
alone and collect mushrooms. All this is gone now."

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN 2 OR 3 YEARS.'; 
JACQUES DELORS, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tyler Marshall 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I f post-Cold War Europe has a political visionary, it is Jacques Delors, the 
president of the European Union's Executive Commission for the past decade and 
the man who revived the dream of binding onetime enemy states into an economic 
and political union.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a work table in his airy 14th floor office in Brussels, Delors 
spoke quietly but forcefully about the region's problems and its future with 
Times correspondent Tyler Marshall:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. Before the Berlin Wall opened, you talked of resolving the German 
question within a European federation. Germany is now united but what has 
happened to your vision of a federated Europe? Did the fall of the Berlin Wall 
come a decade too soon for the architects of a united Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. The federalist approach remains the best way . . . (but) the main 
problem is a question of goals. For me, the responsibility of my generation is 
to extend the values of peace, tolerance, mutual recognition and cooperation to 
all European countries. It's the only way to avoid many Bosnian wars in the 
future. These are the same goals that drove the fathers of a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a priority to me, because if Europe's identity exists -- and it does 
exist as strongly in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw as in London, Paris or Berlin 
-- then the fall of communism implies a new approach to the geographic and 
political limits of the EU. It's not possible to achieve this in two or three 
years because the economic conditions are not the same in eastern and western 
Europe. We just have to accept that reality.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Eastern European democracies are still very new. Some do not have strong 
democratic traditions. Isn't that a danger to the united Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, because for more than 40 years, the Communist regimes tried to stifle 
the development of the individual, his initiative and his spirit. We must 
rebuild this spirit. This is the reason why European countries face not only 
economic problems but also psychological ones. As citizens of Western Europe, 
we must understand that and be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not possible to do this in two or three years. However, if I assess the 
situation in many East European countries right now, I'm confident. But please, 
we need time! They need time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much time? Two generations, three generations? 
</P>
<P>
 A. One generation. Twenty years to adjust to democracy. But do not forget that 
Western democracies must think about the quality of their own political life. 
They must reinforce the feeling of responsibility of each citizen. If people 
remain too individualistic, too indifferent to public life, it is impossible to 
make progress in the democratization of European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There has been criticism in Central and Eastern Europe that the EU nations 
have not done enough to help them. How do you react to this? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Through our loans and loans from the European Investment Bank, we have 
matched the efforts of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World 
Bank. We have also opened our markets. Imports into the EU in 1993 were twice 
that of 1989. From my personal point of view, we have ended with stage one of 
our relation with Eastern European countries -- the emergency support. For me 
stage two . . . means a more sophisticated form of help, notably through common 
infrastructure, creation of financial markets in those countries, financing of 
private investments and helping with a very difficult restructuring of 
agriculture. To succeed, we must combine these steps with a greater opening of 
our markets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is not easy but the concession we make today will be a benefit for all 
tomorrow, in increasing the level of exchange and also in opening your 
(American) market for our economy. 
</P>
<P>

 Q. As you look back over the five years since the Berlin Wall fell, what 
concerns you most about the future of Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I have two worries. First, the risk of economic decline of all Europe 
vis-a-vis the United States, Japan, China, Asian countries and so on. Without a 
strong economic position, it is going to be impossible for Europe to maintain 
its distinctiveness and its influence in the world. This is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 My second worry is how people accept the present trend toward a more 
fragmented society with the phenomena of social exclusion and unemployment. . . 
. These (worries) are not directly linked with the future of the construction 
of Europe, but they are fundamental points. The discussion of the future of 
Europe is not only one about which country is capable of joining the EU.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'WE LEARNED FROM THE AMERICANS'; HANS-DIETRICH 
GENSCHER, FORMER WEST GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tyler Marshall and Marjorie Miller 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A s West German foreign minister over a period of 18 years between 1974-1992, 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher was an important figure in the events surrounding the 
collapse of the Berlin Wall and the rush to reunification. He remains a 
powerful force in German domestic politics and was recently reelected to the 
Bundestag. Amiable, open, and relaxed, he shook hands warmly with Times 
correspondents Tyler Marshall and Marjorie Miller. Then he sunk into one of the 
velour sofas that dominate the elegant living room of his home outside Bonn and 
talked of the events of 1989 and their meaning for the future of Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Question. When the Hungarians decided to roll up part of the Iron Curtain in 
the spring of 1989 and East Germans began to cross in large numbers from 
Hungary to Austria, did you and the German Cabinet see this at the time as the 
beginning of the end of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. The first step in 1989 was the statement by (Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard) Shevardnadze in Vienna during a (January) speech to the CSCE 
(Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe) when he said that the Iron 
Curtain is rusty. This was a clear signal that the Soviet leadership was aware 
that the division of Europe could not survive. The second step came in May of 
1989 when (Hungary's then-foreign minister Gyula) Horn and (Austrian Foreign 
Minister Alois) Mock opened the Iron Curtain along the Hungarian-Austrian 
border. And the third step was the courageous decision of the Hungarian 
government to give permission to the Germans from the GDR to leave Hungary by 
crossing the Austrian-Hungarian border. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why has unification been so difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unification was difficult because of . . . half a century of separate 
development. The same country with systems so different -- one cannot imagine 
two systems more different than there were here in Germany. The people are not 
at all really different. They have a different experience over decades, and 
this we have to overcome. But the basic feelings for democracy, for freedom and 
personal identity, there is no difference. The main problem was that the 
economic strength of the GDR was overrated in western opinion. I always had my 
doubts when Western economic experts listed the GDR as No. 7 or 8 on the list 
of strongest industrialized countries. I couldn't believe that when I saw the 
real situation of the people in the streets of the cities. This led to an 
underestimation of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did you imagine it would be this hard? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We had a (Bundestag) debate on Nov. 8, the day before the Wall fell, on the 
so-called report of the German government on the state of the nation of divided 
Germany. In my speech I said, referring to German unification, that nothing 
will be as it was, not in the East but also not in the West. . . . I added that 
it is our responsibility to say right now, today, to Germans here (in the West) 
that they will be called upon to make extraordinary efforts for the unity of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Five years from now, when we come back here and sit down with you, what do 
you expect to be telling us? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't think in five years you will bother coming because you will not 
find the situation in Germany interesting enough. Maybe you will come to 
discuss another subject in five years: How Europe is answering the same 
questions that Germany has already answered, if Europe as a whole accepts its 
unity. We accepted (our unity), and we immediately started to solve our common 
problems. But in Europe, it is different. The people in the East of course 
accept unity, but in the West there are many people who really cannot 
understand that unity in Europe is a reality, that there is no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But the costs are high. If many Germans don't want to give up a very 
comfortable status quo for other Germans, will the French or Spanish give it up 
for Poles, Hungarians and others to the East? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They really don't have to give it up, in this sense. . . . We learned from 
the Americans. What they did after the Second World War is exactly what we are 
doing now. They helped Europe with the Marshall Plan, but what they received 
was far, far more. The same is happening now between western and eastern 
Germany, and the same will be true for Europe as a whole. NATO was strong 
enough to deter hundreds of divisions from the Warsaw Pact coming to the West. 
But no NATO and no police can help when millions of eastern Europeans without 
any hope will come to the West. It will be far worse for Europe if we do not, 
in good faith, plan for the long-term future of all Europeans.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'PEOPLE MUST LEARN AGAIN TO BE CITIZENS.'; VACLAV 
HAVEL, PRESIDENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dean E. Murphy 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I n his Prague office, Czech President Vaclav Havel sat for a 30-minute 
interview with Times correspondent Dean E. Murphy despite the stress of the 
moment. He had just concluded a war of words with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
over the direction of Czech society, he was preparing for a trip to the United 
States and he was in the midst of the latest government crisis: the removal of 
the Czech defense minister.  
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a glen-plaid suit with matching tie and pocket handkerchief, Havel 
spoke softly, rarely looked up and smoked four Camel cigarettes. Finally, at 
the end of the session, he broke into a wide grin when asked to pose with 
Sophia, a towering white figurine with a gold headband created by Czech 
sculptor Olbram Zoubek:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. In a conversation about politics in the 1980s, you told writer Karel 
Hvizdala that "a genuinely fundamental and hopeful improvement in systems 
cannot happen without a significant shift in human consciousness, and that it 
cannot be accomplished through a simple organizational trick." What is your 
assessment of the changes in Eastern Europe since 1989? Are they the shallow 
consequences of an organizational trick, or has there been a genuine shift in 
human consciousness? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. I think it is valid generally that the systematic changes, the 
organizational ones, must evolve from some . . . new concept of human 
coexistence. And in this sense I think that consciousness precedes the 
so-called technicalities. That is naturally true also in our case, and maybe 
more so because the transformation of the totalitarian system into a democratic 
one is indeed not only a matter of several parties replacing one ruling party 
and the introduction of some democratic mechanisms. It is also a matter of a 
great transformation of thinking because people must learn again to be 
citizens, to rediscover the civic responsibility which the totalitarian regime 
did not demand from them because it required mere obedience. 
</P>
<P>
 They must find a new relationship to their own state and a new concept of 
their responsibility for themselves. These changes are naturally demanding and 
do not take place quickly. But I see it as the most important task, and from it 
all the other transformational changes evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Has there been enough progress in this regard over the past five years? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Possibly at the time of such revolutionary joy over the overthrow of 
communism many of us could have had the illusion that everything would go 
faster. I would not say that progress is not taking place, but it needs its 
time. It is not as simple as it might have appeared to people at first. The 
former Communist stereotypes of behavior are dormant in the subconsciousness of 
society and are still making themselves felt. There is much evidence that 
changes are taking place, but there is also much evidence that they are not 
taking place everywhere in the way they should. Many remnants of the past are 
still manifested one way or the other in the behavior of people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Would you give an example that illustrates how these changes are taking 
place? 
</P>
<P>
 A. One surprising and encouraging phenomenon is that after decades of the 
Communist centralized economy there has awakened in the people the spirit of 
enterprise. There are now in our country hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs 
and millions of shareholders, even though one almost thought people here didn't 
know what a share was. It is a very encouraging development that there is such 
creative entrepreneurship. It shows that people have come to accept the idea 
that their fate depends primarily on themselves, that they are finding a real 
relationship to property and a responsibility for this property, which for 
years had only anonymous ownership. That is an example of the good changes.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You have spoken and written extensively about the creation of a civic 
society in post-Communist countries, a sense of civic consciousness and 
responsibility that would exist between the levels of the individual and the 
state. Has this civic society formed in the Czech Republic? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The question addresses what is public and what concerns the individual 
citizen. That is something I personally regard as extremely important, a topic 
which is being much discussed in our country. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that it is crucial that the public sphere in which citizens are 
engaged be strengthened, expanded and given more prominence to somehow do away 
with the situation in which everything is directed by the state and public 
property is looked after by the state. And here too you can see the potential 
which exists in society and is beginning to make itself felt. There has emerged 
for instance a number of foundations and civic communities and associations, 
and many people work in self-governing organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless it seems to me that it is necessary, especially at this time, to 
focus more on this (public) sphere. Apart from the fact that people are engaged 
in private enterprise -- and everything now belongs to somebody and through 
producing individual profit our entire economy is being strengthened -- there 
exists another dimension to man. He is a social being who wants to open himself 
to other people, associate with them, and do something for the common good, 
something which need not directly be tied to individual gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Much of Eastern Europe is dispirited and disappointed about democracy and 
free markets. Are you able to explain how this came to be? Was it inevitable or 
is there something fundamentally flawed with the transformation process? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Psychologically, some kind of disillusionment or disappointment is 
absolutely understandable. Suddenly, very quickly, after such a long period of 
boredom and timelessness under communism, everything collapsed, the borders 
opened and journalists wrote freely. Society was naturally in a certain manner 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
 But sooner or later the time had to come for everyday work. It has become 
apparent that what we inherited from communism is extremely complicated and 
difficult to deal with. The changes are bound to take time -- and that can't be 
otherwise. That reality understandably has as an accompanying phenomenon, the 
appearance of disillusionment. I would compare it to someone smashing an old 
inlaid chest into pieces. That can take just a few seconds to do, but to put it 
back together, to restore the chest, may take many years -- a long time. And we 
are restoring something which had existed here and we had enjoyed, but which 
was violently and brutally destroyed. It is simply a long task. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to be very impatient. Everything seemed to be moving slowly, but in the 
end, I have learned not to be so impatient. I have come to understand that 
everything needs its time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the biggest disappointments of the past five years? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Several things could be spoken about, which I thought would move forward 
faster. For instance, I believed that our integration into the democratic world 
would proceed faster, into its political, security and economic structures. 
Also I thought that after the experiences of communism, there would not be so 
many people in the various parts of the post-Communist world who would give in 
to nationalism and xenophobia. I also probably did not expect that with the 
arrival of freedom there also would be so much room for so many bad human 
traits which are making themselves felt almost explosively. 
</P>
<P>
 I repeat, I could imagine that many things could be better, but at the same 
time, I repeat that I have learned patience. I know that it is not possible to 
make the grass grow taller, to make it grow faster, by pulling at it. 
Everything needs its time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If I were to return in five years on the 10th anniversary of the 
revolutions in Eastern Europe, what will have changed? What are your 
expectations for the future? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think that it would be good if in five years time our country had indeed 
become a regular and legitimate member of the democratic world, that it was 
forgotten that communism was ever here and that we no longer carried the 
curious title of a "post-Communist country," which is a description that is 
somewhat denigrating. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the extensive privatization which is taking place in our 
country will have settled down and that it will be quite clear who owns what 
property. As for the economy as a whole, I expect it will be returning to the 
level of development it once had when we were a country that was economically 
comparable with Germany or France. And above all, I believe that there will be 
no reason for complaints about the low political or civic culture here, that 
this culture will have developed. All of this will be directly linked to the 
emergence of the younger generation, one not deformed by communism.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'I DIDN'T CONSIDER THAT STEP OF MINE THE FIRST ONE'; 
GYULA HORN, HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carol J. Williams and Tyler Marshall 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A s foreign minister in Hungary during its dramatic overthrow of the Communist 
order, Gyula Horn probably did more than any other political insider to 
dismantle the system that gave him privilege and power.  
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive diplomat snipped the first hole in the Iron Curtain in 1989, 
opening Hungary's border with neutral Austria , then shrugged off East Berlin's 
fury when that symbolic opening became a corridor to freedom for East Germans 
fleeing a reform-resistant regime.  
</P>
<P>
 Now 62 and the newly elected Hungarian prime minister, Horn is sorting through 
the aftermath of four years of an experimental center-right government and four 
decades of ruinous rule by his Communist colleagues. He was interviewed by 
Times correspondents Carol J. Williams and Tyler Marshall in his Budapest 
offices.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. When you were cutting through the fence between Austria and Hungary, 
what did you expect to be the consequences of that action? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. I hadn't realized that such historical change would come after that, 
but I was sure of one thing -- that life would not go on as it had before. We 
were strongly criticized for taking that step, by Moscow and by the other 
countries of the Warsaw Pact. But it was decisive that (then Soviet leader 
Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and (then Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze 
were in control of the Soviet Union's foreign policy at that time, and they 
were against any kind of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did you think that you were taking the first step toward the destruction of 
the Berlin Wall? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I didn't consider that step of mine the first one. . . . It was a kind of 
process, with two principal aims: We wanted to assert an independent Hungarian 
foreign policy instead of one that conformed to the standards of the alliance, 
and secondly, we wanted to emulate the European concept of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You say that Gorbachev and Shevardnadze's policies allowed Eastern Europe 
to take these steps. Did you have any prior consultations with the Moscow 
leadership? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Never. . . . We did not want to put the Soviet leadership into the position 
of having to determine the balance of justice in such matters as our opening of 
the borders to allow movement of tourists from the GDR (East Germany). We said 
we were doing this as a sovereign step and that it had nothing to do with the 
Warsaw Pact. That made it easier for Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, as they were 
already under pressure from orthodox Communist hard-liners for allowing other 
relaxations of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning what the past five years has brought, we hadn't expected that 
getting rid of the aftermath of Stalinism would be so difficult. It will take 
many long years. It was relatively easy to create a multi-party system, to 
declare a Western orientation and to take on other important political issues. 
But we did not realize what a terrible economic situation we inherited from the 
former regime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We have also been unfavorably affected by recession in the West, which is only 
now starting to ease. Developments in the European Union have also had some 
difficult consequences for us. Western Europe has been in a process of 
transition as well, with the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty, which has 
diverted attention from our region. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Has the West lived up to the promises it made at the time of the 
revolution? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The West did not promise anything. The West did not say that, if Hungary 
makes this turn, we will be rewarded. So I am not disappointed. . . . I do, 
however, think better cooperation is needed. The West was not prepared for a 
lot of things that have happened, first of all that new wars could burst out in 
this region. The nationalist conflict in Yugoslavia has been a big challenge 
for the West, a very difficult challenge, and its responses have been quite 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the West doesn't seem to have expected such big migrations as have 
occurred, and it can't respond to this simply by closing borders. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thirdly . . . a kind of security vacuum has formed. I support the idea of the 
Partnership for Peace . . . but it does not substitute for the need our 
countries have for either NATO membership or some security guarantees. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the matter of economic and social relations, a list of 
requirements should be set out to explain what Hungary . . . must do to join 
the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. With all the realities you know of now, what do you expect your children's 
and grandchildren's Hungary to be like? Will their Hungary fit into Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hungary . . . is in a unique position as the only country that has huge 
minorities living in its neighboring countries. And this is a sensitive 
situation now because almost nowhere are the rights of these minorities fully 
respected. . . . That is why European integration is so important for Hungary, 
as this would reduce the tension. . . . Within a European Union, the problems 
associated with borders would be neutralized. . . . The future presents us a 
mixed picture. It doesn't look too much better for our children right now, but 
maybe for our grandchildren.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'WE HAVE TO SUCCEED.'; LECH WALESA, PRESIDENT OF 
POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dean E. Murphy 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 W ith a year to go before the Polish presidential elections, President Lech 
Walesa has kicked into a campaign mode. Ranked in recent popularity polls below 
former Polish Communist boss Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Walesa, democratic 
Poland's first president, has axed his press spokesman, fired members of the 
Polish television council and made new overtures to his former backers in 
Solidarity, the labor-based mass movement that shook Communist control in the 
1980s but later split into several competing factions.  
</P>
<P>
 When he sat down for 30 minutes in his new presidential palace for an 
interview with Times correspondent Dean E. Murphy, he spoke energetically about 
his vision of Poland:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. What is wrong with Poland? Why are people so unhappy? And why are 
you so low in the opinion polls? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. That is a complicated issue. We are undergoing great transformations, 
great reforms. We want to build a market economy and democracy. The effects 
that we are noticing today are just normal signs indicating that this 
reconstruction has been effective. And as far as the issue of my popularity 
goes, then of course if you just look at numbers, they look the way you have 
interpreted them. But I look at it in a totally opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always stood at the forefront of reforms in Poland. Often I do things 
which are beyond my duties as president. I work very hard, and sometimes I 
expose myself to the displeasure of those whom I am trying to encourage to do 
something. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I am a practitioner, and if I succeed in building a proper, good capitalist 
system, then I know that capitalists pay honest wages for hard work, and I am 
certain that I am going to be paid well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So you don't believe your job is done in Poland? Poland still needs Lech 
Walesa? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Of course. Again this is a broader problem. We were all starting from the 
same level of poverty. Now we are building capitalism. Even in the best 
possible situation only one in 10 will have his own company. The remaining nine 
will envy him, and they will be unhappy. That's why those problems won't 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Is there another solution? For example, the division of 
Solidarity. You do things differently when you are fighting against a 
totalitarian system because you have to be united. However, after victory, when 
people have to work and build democracy and pluralism, we cannot keep an 
organization which would function well in China where everybody is supposed to 
be equal and the same. Pluralism and democracy cannot be built without 
dividing. I had to divide my child, Solidarity. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some people today miss the Soviet Union just like others yearn for Solidarity 
of the old days. But the question is: Would it be democracy if the president 
came from Solidarity, the prime minister came from Solidarity and the 
Parliament was also Solidarity? I would then be just like Kim Il Sung. I didn't 
want that. I wanted something better. . . . I wanted to build a proper system 
which meant creating great divisions so in the future we could unite. I did all 
that, so it would be rather surprising if I wasn't blamed for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have the experiences of the past five years lived up to your expectations 
or do you have major disappointments? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Of course I wish that many things happened in a different way. But if I 
wanted to do it properly, then I should have asked all Poles to move out of 
Poland and build this country from the beginning, organize it in a proper way. 
But that cannot be done. But there really were such ideas. People were writing 
letters to me that if we want to make money quickly, then let's send everyone 
to America, let them earn dollars and then come back with their money to 
Poland. Wonderful idea for one family or two but not for 40 million people. And 
that's why we have to work with the conditions given to us. And that's why a 
lot of things could have been done in a different way, but socially it is 
impossible. Some things could have been improved but we would have to take 
shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we inherited our legal system from the Communists. And now when 
we say that we want to build a "state of law" we have to wait for the whims of 
the members of our Parliament to create a new legal framework and pass laws. I 
could have issued decrees but then I would be no different from Stalin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do you see coming in the next five or 10 years? Can Poland make the 
transition to capitalism and democracy that quickly, or will it take a 
generational change? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We don't have a choice. We have to succeed. There are no other solutions. 
The question is only how long is it going to take and what price are we going 
to pay. Europe and the world today are just like Lego blocks. I have always 
liked to watch children play. What is it that they are building? When they find 
a block that doesn't fit they throw it aside. The same applies to countries in 
Europe. The Lego blocks are democracy, pluralism, market economy. Those who do 
not accept them will be thrown aside. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot separate ourselves from the others in the middle of Europe. We have 
to follow the same rules. Of course we can make them better, improve them. 
</P>
<P>
 We see now that in some cases coordination on the European and world scale is 
needed. We also see that people have difficulty communicating in certain areas 
-- agriculture for example -- and they probably won't come to agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How would you grade Poland's performance over the past five years? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I would give Poland a 4-minus on a scale of 1 to 6 (6 being best). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is that a good grade, or are you disappointed? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It isn't so simple. The judgment of the Polish road to democracy is 
difficult, and it is looked at differently from different positions. We really 
have accomplished a lot, but for the time being, the effects are not visible 
yet, and everyone would like to see effects first. That's why I said that the 
reformers, those who stand at the forefront of reforms, cannot expect people to 
be grateful to them and to thank them. They have to pay a price. Of course, in 
50 years, there will be no city in Poland without a monument to me. . . . There 
will be all kinds of celebrations in front of my monuments. But I won't be 
there, I won't be able to kick from beneath the ground and ask: Where were you 
when I needed you?

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; 'WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS STUPIDITY ANYMORE.'; FRIEDRICH 
SCHORLEMMER, EASTERN GERMAN CLERGYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Williams Walsh 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H e was a father of the East German revolution, but Pastor Friedrich 
Schorlemmer is saddened by much of what has come of the fall of East Germany, 
and Germany's subsequent unification.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression that the West is treating the former German Democratic 
Republic as if they were on a hunting party and we were a lame deer," he said, 
interviewed by Times correspondent Mary Williams Walsh in the compartment of a 
train traveling from the eastern state capital of Magdeburg to the western city 
of Cologne. "They have already killed us, and now they're going to take the 
very best pieces for themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 His is a hard view, and yet Schorlemmer had never intended that the fall of 
the Berlin Wall should lead to the dissolution of East Germany and unification 
with the West. Like many other East German intellectuals and reform agitators 
in 1989, he had merely sought a recasting of the East German state.  
</P>
<P>
 When he appeared at the microphone in the huge demonstrations of November, 
1989, he quoted Martin Luther and urged nonviolent resistance to Communist 
authority: "Let the spirits clash together, but not the fists," he said:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question. What, exactly, were you trying to achieve in 1988, when you 
promulgated your 20 Wittenberg Theses?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer. The main goal was to do whatever I could to ensure that the final 
document of the Helsinki Accord (the charter of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, signed in 1975), which East Germany had signed, would be 
fulfilled, particularly its provisions on culture, communication and human 
rights.  
</P>
<P>
 If this were to happen, then East Germany would have to become a state where 
people would be happy to live, where work would be meaningful, where people 
could participate in public decision-making processes and where the state 
wouldn't make all the decisions for everybody. This meant that there had to be 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I wanted the detente and the arms reduction that was going on in the 
outside world to take place within East Germany. I wanted East Germany to stop 
madly categorizing every country in the world as good or evil, friend or foe. I 
wanted ours to become a society capable of peace, a society that could survive 
without organizing itself around an enemy. That is, a society that could 
negotiate with its internal critics and not clap everybody who suggested there 
might be some problems into prison. East Germany thought that by banning 
seismographs, it could prevent earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Instead, East Germany has disappeared. What made the quiet revolution in 
East Germany turn out the way it has? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The problem with the revolution of 1989 was the following: The people who 
were calling for change, until November, 1989, wanted a democratic revolution. 
Then, when the Berlin Wall was broken through, the participants in the 
demonstrations, and also the leaders, changed. The revolution was detoured 
toward German unification. 
</P>
<P>
 Money was a big part of the game, even though everybody was talking only about 
the ideal of German unity. If someone says, "Here is unity," and unity means 
you get to have the deutsche mark, then everyone will say, "I am for German 
unity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What sort of attitudes toward the former East and toward unification do you 
encounter on your travels in western Germany? Will the former West ever 
understand eastern Germans? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Forty-five years of separation have caused a tremendous mental gap between 
eastern and western Europe. In addition, there is the equally large economic 
gap. These divisions will be with us for another generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of west German citizens consider the fall of the Berlin Wall to 
be nothing more than an irritating accident. Because now, the poor, poor 
citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany are being asked to pay (for the 
reconstruction of the former East). And, the east Germans take the money, and 
then have the ingratitude to turn around and vote for the Party of Democratic 
Socialism (the former East German Communist Party).  
</P>
<P>
 But one shouldn't forget to mention that there have been a considerable number 
of (western) people who are truly delighted, and who have been willing to make 
a sacrifice for East Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What else has surprised you about the way the events of 1989 have turned 
out? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The problems of converting the military infrastructure to peaceful purposes 
are so much larger than I ever imagined. The two superpowers, and their allies, 
were able, with conventional and nuclear weapons, to fight each other and 
destroy everything on Earth 50 times over. So one can see that it's very hard 
to come up with answers to questions like: What will we do with all these 
weapons? What will we do with the weapons factories? What will we do with the 
workers there, in America as well as in Czechoslovakia? What do we do with the 
gigantic armies? How should we motivate them, the sailors in Murmansk (Russia) 
with their submarines, for instance, to come ashore? They don't know whom 
they're doing it for. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of a clear role for the (post-Cold War) military is a dangerous 
thing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens next in the process of bringing Eastern and Western Europe 
together? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I anticipate an authoritarian solution to Russia's problems in the near 
future. This could come from the military, or from somebody else. In any case, 
the enormous economic and social problems in Russia are not enhancing 
democratic development in the former East. I can't see that democracy in Russia 
is stable. But the gigantic military potential in weapons, and in human 
resources, is still present. 
</P>
<P>
 I consider the present situation more dangerous than the one in 1983, at the 
height of the nuclear confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. And in Germany? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The majority is stupid. In the old (East German) days, I didn't dare say 
that, because I would have been called arrogant, but it's the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't afford this stupidity anymore. The saying goes, "One learns by making 
mistakes," but we can no longer afford to make these costly mistakes. Somebody 
has to say this. I admit it: I am an extremist, a left-Green extremist. But the 
people who write me off as an extremist are rushing at full speed toward a 
global catastrophe.  
</P>
<P>
 If the West doesn't change, the world will break apart. The West has to 
change. The East failed first, because its inefficiencies showed first. But the 
West will follow.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; VASLUI, ROMANIA; HAMMER AND CYCLE OF DESPERATION; 
MISTRUST, MANIPULATION AND DEFEATISM THWART THE QUEST FOR A BETTER LIFE AFTER 
THE RAVAGES OF COMMUNISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a paneled office high above the whining lathes and deafening compressors of 
the Moldova Mechanical Enterprise, Director Gigi Tiplea oscillates nervously in 
his swivel chair and narrows his eyes with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 He is discomfited by questions about the shrinking staff and flagging output 
of the cavernous workshops that sprawl across hundreds of acres, a dehumanizing 
monument to Eastern Europe's Communist-era obsession with development on a 
Gargantuan scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you need to know such details?" he demands of a reporter who has come 
to gauge the course of change in this proletarian bastion after Eastern 
Europe's bloodiest overthrow of a Communist regime five years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Tiplea grudgingly discloses that 4,000 workers have been laid off from his 
failing enterprise, still Vaslui's biggest employer, and that most of the 
remaining 2,000 would also have to go if he was forced to live within a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 When the talk turns to plans for the future and prospects for foreign 
investment, the director explodes into a fit of paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think we don't know what security service you work for!" Tiplea 
suddenly bellows at his visitor, whipping open a drawer and brandishing a 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-page missive in poor English, purported to be from a trading 
company in Nigeria, might indeed have been a crude provocation from what 
remains of Romania's once-omnipotent Securitate secret police. The months-old 
letter seems to be enticing the factory boss to take part in some sort of scam. 
</P>
<P>
 But what it had to do with a discussion of how Vaslui has deteriorated from an 
industrial stronghold to the depths of despair was unclear to the journalist, 
and indeed to Tiplea himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusation is a skillful evasion technique, in the doctrine of former 
Communists, even if all that is being avoided is a discussion of the cruelties 
of fate. Fear of change, suspicion of foreigners and a stubborn refusal to 
acknowledge failings are reactions as natural as breathing for those who 
learned the skills of survival behind the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having thrown off hard-line communism five years ago, millions of 
workers and managers in the region -- people like Tiplea -- remain locked in a 
time warp, indoctrinated in the adversarial politics of a bygone era and 
seemingly incapable of learning another way. 
</P>
<P>
 In places such as Vaslui, where the quest for a better life after the ravages 
of communism has gone horribly wrong, people remain stuck in a rut of mistrust, 
manipulation and defeatism that sabotages every inclination toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment here is officially 37% and in reality much higher, as most 
surviving factories have no product orders and have sent their employees on 
indefinite leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 80,000 people who lived in Vaslui five years ago have fled abroad 
or to other areas of Romania, leaving the dark, decaying workers' apartment 
blocks half-empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire town, built up from nothing a quarter of a century ago on the 
parched plains of Moldova, has the look of having been used up and discarded. 
Broken windows and unlit corridors give even working factories an abandoned 
appearance. Street lights and traffic signals were long ago turned off to save 
electricity. Gas prices of about $1 a gallon might be considered a bargain 
elsewhere in Europe, but in Vaslui most cars have been garaged or left in yards 
for children to play in. Streets are empty but for pedestrians and groaning 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The most depressed town in the poorest region of arguably the most devastated 
country of the former East Bloc, Vaslui typifies the tragedy of Stalinist 
experiments that toyed with a society's natural order. 
</P>
<P>
 The late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu created dozens of towns like this one in 
the late 1960s and 1970s when he herded farmers into cities to work in 
factories in a fevered quest for mass industrialization. Vaslui was transformed 
in a few short months of 1970 from a sleepy village of woodworkers into a 
monolithic company town, complete with shabby, prefabricated high-rises thrown 
up in haste for the workers forcibly moved out of the fields and forests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that each county would be raised to a high level of development 
by the location of a major industry in its central town," explains Pompiliu 
Sirghe, local liaison with the national Ministry of Labor and one of many 
political survivors from the apparatus built by Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight buildup succeeded in providing a subsistence living for Vaslui 
laborers, but only so long as the closed circle of the Moscow-led Comecon 
trading alliance assured a market for even the shoddiest goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaslui cog in the pre-revolutionary wheel of East Bloc industry produced 
mostly extraction and ventilation equipment for mining -- a sector of the 
economy that has fallen on particularly bad times and taken its provincial 
suppliers down with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Vaslui's laid-off masses might be said to be free to return to the 
countryside. But one lesson of dictatorship everyone seems to have learned well 
is that nothing good ever comes from taking charge or taking chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The migrations broke the bond between land and peasant and stripped workers of 
all initiative, pounding home the message that they had no power over their own 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Codrescu has been without work since a local textile plant cut half of 
its work force a few months after the revolution. The collapse of Comecon meant 
supplies of cheap cotton from Central Asian republics were no longer 
forthcoming, and the fabric factory was having trouble finding buyers for its 
slipshod wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Codrescu, 39, is widowed with two children and gets a $15-a-month death 
benefit from her late husband's employer. The pittance paid by the Romanian 
government to its jobless expired a year ago, and Codrescu is the first to 
admit that prospects of being called back to the textile plant are nil. 
</P>
<P>
 But the thin, sullen woman shrugs helplessly when asked how she'll manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she says, sighing morosely. "Maybe we will all starve." 
</P>
<P>
 Her 20-year-old daughter, Loredana, was lured to Cyprus over the summer with a 
thirdhand promise of a hotel maid's job. She returned home in September with 
shoes and coats for her brother and mother, some gold jewelry, expensive 
lingerie and a silent determination not to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask what she did there," says neighbor Eugenia Stefanescu with a 
knowing yet sympathetic look. "She brought back some sneakers for my Michaela, 
which God knows she needed, but I don't like to think about where they came 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanescu, also a widow and heading into a five-month season of being 
unemployed when the dairy she works at closes for winter, fears mostly for her 
own pretty daughter, who has no prospects of finding work when she finishes her 
last year of high school in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother has land in the countryside. We could go back there and at least 
know we would eat. But I have no experience with that kind of work, and neither 
does Michaela," says Stefanescu, who earns about $22 a month at the dairy and 
must help out two adult sons whose jobs at Moldova Mechanical have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddled in the dark of the Codrescu apartment, where there is neither a 
working light bulb nor the 400 lei (23 cents) needed to buy one, the families 
fritter away their idle evenings bemoaning the pitfalls of change and imagining 
what more might go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to work in a private shop that sells makeup or dresses. But no 
owner will hire me unless I have 100,000 lei to kick into the business," says 
Loredana, citing a sum of less than $60 but one that might as well be a million 
in a household that can't muster 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 While Romania's casualties of economic transition have a tendency to see doom 
in every venture, a conspicuous mafia of local hucksters does appear to have an 
exclusive lock on private business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to do anything here. Those with connections control 
everything," insists Eugen Sacaleanu, who two years ago slipped illegally 
across the Hungarian and Austrian borders to get to Italy, where he earns more 
than $1,000 each month as a waiter. "I wouldn't live here again for anything. 
Even with money I wouldn't succeed. I've just come to get my wife and 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is no future worth working for here is a conclusion drawn by 
frightening numbers of Romanians, who make up a hefty share of the illegal 
immigrant populations in most West European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 With no feel for the land, no concept of service and little chance of success 
in commerce, most unemployed workers have grown accustomed to their role as 
reform's victims. The few with initiative, such as Sacaleanu, have given up on 
their homeland and voted with their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasive fatalism stems largely from the Communist era, when Ceausescu's 
maniacal drive for a Greater Romania dictated every decision for the people, 
from what they should eat to the number of children each woman should bear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaslui's mayor, Victor Cristea, also invokes eastern Romania's history of 
Russian and Turkish occupation in explaining why the local population seems 
paralyzed by expectations of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a different mentality than the Romanians who live in Transylvania, 
which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire for centuries," he says. "The 
Hapsburg occupiers imposed civilization and culture, while those who came here 
only took away what they could. That is why we feel disadvantaged. People have 
always been afraid to build anything here. They think it will only be taken 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to make the broken machinery of a command economy work anymore and 
unwilling to risk building another system, those in positions of authority in 
basket-case towns such as Vaslui resort to the knee-jerk Communist practice of 
denying reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of products we make here will be needed in the future. These are 
just transitional difficulties," insists Tiplea. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off workers who still live here continue to show up for monthly 
discussions about the prospects for a return to their jobs, undeterred by the 
consistent message that there is no relief on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Impoverished both financially and spiritually, the resentful victims of 
Romania's stalled transformation say they are nostalgic for the days of 
dictatorship, preferring the vague ache in their souls induced by repression to 
the sharp pain of hunger now felt in their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the revolution never happened," says Michaela Stefanescu, who was 12 
when Ceausescu was toppled. "Maybe we didn't have a lot of freedom then, but 
now we don't have enough food, and you're not safe on the streets. Young people 
have nothing to look forward to. We just stay inside and worry about how we'll 
survive tomorrow."

 Erich Honecker. The hard-line East German Communist leader who supervised 
construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 was toppled from power in October, 
1989. He fled to Moscow in early 1990 but was returned to Germany the following 
year to face trial for killings at the Wall. Suffering from cancer, his trial 
was terminated on health grounds in early 1993 with no verdict. He flew 
immediately to Chile to spend his final months with his daughter. He died in 
Santiago in May at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Egon Krenz, 57. Honecker's successor and the man who ordered free passage 
through the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, lasted only six weeks in power. He was 
swept away by the East German revolution and resurfaced in 1990 working as an 
investment adviser to a Berlin businessman. He is now unemployed. He spends his 
time trying to present the Communist regime in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, 71. Poland's Communist leader who imposed martial 
law in 1981 to crush the pro-democracy Solidarity movement had come to terms 
with the trade union and helped negotiate the country's move to a multi-party 
democracy in 1989. He served as Poland's president until December, 1990, and is 
now retired. He occasionally attends conferences as an expert on societies in 
transition. He is now recovering after being attacked in September by an angry 
pensioner, who blamed Jaruzelski for the loss of his livelihood during the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Milos Jakes, 72. The Czechoslovak Communist Party leader, who fell from power 
a week into the Czech revolution, was questioned briefly by authorities 
following his downfall but was never formally charged with a crime. He now 
lives quietly in Prague and is spotted occasionally shopping at neighborhood 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Todor Zhivkov, 83. The Bulgarian Communist Party leader for 35 years was 
ousted the day after the Berlin Wall fell. He was expelled from the party at 
the end of 1989 and convicted three years later on charges of corruption. His 
case remains under appeal, and he presently lives with a grandchild in Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolae Ceaucescu. Romania's brutal Communist leader for more than two decades 
was overthrown in December, 1989. He was arrested as he tried to flee 
Bucharest, was tried secretly and then executed along with his wife, Elena, on 
Christmas Day at age 71. The Ceaucescu's three children, Nicu, Zoia and 
Valentin, all live in Bucharest.

HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY WAR AND ETHNIC DIVISION.

 The glass-and-steel Unis office towers loom over the city like charred 
skeletons, their mirrored windows blasted out by artillery shells, the metal 
frames blackened by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In what were once modern apartment houses hugging the rocky banks of the 
Miljacka River, artists and professional people pass their days debating 
politics in salons adorned with pianos and oil paintings but deprived of heat, 
water and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo airport, given a face lift for the 1984 Winter Olympics, is now a 
sandbagged no-man's-land, straddling a deadly front line between the forces of 
the Bosnian government and rebel Serb nationalists. The few civilians leaving 
this besieged city must grope through a secret tunnel dug under the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most bitter of post-Communist ironies afflicting Eastern Europe, the 
people of the former Yugoslav federation who enjoyed the region's most 
prosperous lifestyle have been lured in this vaunted age of reform and freedom 
into the bloodiest conflict to disrupt Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 For the brutalized people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a comfortable and cultured 
life has been destroyed and replaced with a daily battle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the anti-Communist revolutions that were supposed to have 
ushered in a new world order, Bosnia -- especially this shattered capital -- 
has become a monument to madness and a reminder that even sophisticated 
societies are not immune to the virus of nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent breakup of Yugoslavia has also shaken the widely held belief that 
people with food on the table, work to perform and faith in the future can 
learn to overcome past sufferings and injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the stern, paternalistic rule of the late Josip Broz, known throughout 
his 35-year presidency by his wartime code name of Marshal Tito, the myriad 
peoples of the Balkan federation came to see themselves as Yugoslavs and to 
overlook individual national groups' earlier trespasses against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after four decades of peace and prosperity, skillful manipulation by 
a handful of political zealots persuaded the descendants of those who suffered 
atrocities during World War II that they should neither forgive nor forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had a very good life before this war. There was no reason for it to 
have happened, except that some backward people who live in the mountains 
decided they had to avenge history," says a Sarajevo elementary school 
principal, Narcis Polimac. 
</P>
<P>
 His praise of the Yugoslavia that has been systematically destroyed over the 
last four years echoes the words of almost every victim of the conflict, with 
the blame for it subject to ethnic variation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here and in the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Macedonia and 
Croatia -- also now independent states -- lay the blame on Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic, who began more than seven years ago to whip up a 
nationalist psychosis to enhance his own power. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, especially Serbs, accuse Croatian extremists of confusing independence 
with ethnic supremacy and undermining the national reconciliation achieved by 
Tito. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bosnians, caught in the cross-fire of the resurgent Serb-Croat conflict, 
the horror and devastation visited on their fledgling state is a cruel twist of 
history that might have been avoided if Tito had lived another decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraits of the late Yugoslav strongman, who died in 1980, still adorn homes 
and offices in Bosnia, where the most beleaguered victims of the 2 1/2-year-old 
war believe that they might have been spared if the partisan hero had survived 
to pilot his people into the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a decade-long power struggle ensued, with unscrupulous politicians 
emerging to seize the reins of authority and drive the Yugoslav peoples into 
war and ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks spurred retaliation. Suffering nurtured resentment. Atrocities sated a 
thirst for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after 30 months on the treadmill of violence, both the Serbian 
nationalists holding the high ground and the hapless civilians trapped in 
inaptly named "U.N. safe havens" below nurse festering grudges against each 
other for a war that has dropped their living standard nearly into the Stone 
Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blame Western powers as much as they blame nationalists for allowing 
their country to be overrun while mouthing platitudes about the sanctity of 
property and borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only mistake was believing the outside world would help us when we were 
attacked," says Polimac, the principal. "Now we see that we are on our own. We 
don't want revenge, but neither will we let those who left us at the Serbs' 
mercy give away our land and homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Vows to press on with the fighting that has already claimed 200,000 lives in 
Bosnia and 10,000 more in an earlier clash in Croatia raise the specter of an 
endless and expanding war. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggression committed in Bosnia and Croatia could also inspire nationalist 
zealots elsewhere in the ethnic patchwork of Eastern Europe to resort to brute 
force, taking the land and power they covet and facing little resistance in a 
passive world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be other Bosnias," Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic predicts with 
resignation. "Unfortunately, this tragedy will happen again and again until the 
leaders of the world realize they must take risks when the principles of 
democracy are threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 That the worst-case scenario of rapid historical change unfolded in placid 
Bosnia took the diplomatic world by surprise, but only because no one was 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia, with its open borders, was communism's success story, if the 
ideology had one. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito, who broke with Moscow in 1948 and charted a unique course of development 
in Yugoslavia, followed his ideological cohorts in the quest for economic 
progress through rapid industrialization, throwing up power plants, steelworks 
and munitions factories in the 1950s and 1960s. While many of the heavy 
industries were no more successful here than in other command economies, 
opportunities for family-run businesses and freedom to travel opened up 
horizons that were unique in the Communist world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists flowed in for bargain beach vacations along the stunning Adriatic 
seacoast, often wandering up Bosnia's majestic Neretva River valley to take in 
its succession of scenic jewels from medieval Orthodox monasteries to the 
Ottoman-era marble bridge at Mostar, all since destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Yugoslavs could go abroad themselves, and millions did. Young 
men keen on building up the family homestead worked for hard-currency wages in 
Western Europe, sending their earnings back home where they were to be plowed 
into sprawling houses or used to start hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The remissions maintained a prosperity that enhanced Tito's drive to stamp out 
the virulent nationalism that separated Yugoslav peoples during World War II. 
But in his advancing years, the flagging industrial output that afflicted much 
of the Communist world in the 1970s prompted Tito to borrow heavily from banks 
and governments in the West, mortgaging the economic future of the federation. 
By the time of his death in 1980, Yugoslavia was already suffering the ravages 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years progressed and no successor emerged who was as committed as Tito 
to a strong federation, the complex leadership formula he had devised to keep 
each ethnic group's power in check began to unravel at the hands of 
self-interested nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic rose to become head of the Serbian republic's Communist Party in 
1987 on a campaign to reassert Serbian supremacy over the ethnic Albanian 
majority in Kosovo province. He then maneuvered nationalist allies into 
positions in the federal structure until he reached the point where he could 
dismantle it from within. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Serbian nationalists who controlled the collective purse strings 
funneled up to 70% of the federal budget to preparations for war, secessionist 
movements took hold in Slovenia, where the most affluent Yugoslavs feared 
economic disaster, and in Croatia, where nationalist sentiments flared to meet 
the Serbian challenge from Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The war in Bosnia has been a battle for territorial superiority between small 
groups of aggressive Serbs and Croats in the rival countries that flank this 
republic. But that the blame for their suffering probably lies elsewhere is no 
comfort for the victims of the most dramatic historical change in the last half 
a century.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; THE DECADES OF DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1946: The Soviet Union tightens its grip on Eastern Europe. British statesman 
Winston Churchill warns a world exhausted by war that "an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent." 
</P>
<P>
 1948-49: In the Berlin Airlift, Western Allies mount a massive supply effort 
to keep West Berlin alive after the Soviets sever land routes in an attempt to 
starve the western half of the divided city and force the Allies -- the United 
States, Britain and France -- to abandon their jurisdictions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 1949: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance of 
Western nations, is formed. Soviet-occupied eastern Germany becomes the German 
Democratic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 1953: Soviet dictator Josef Stalin dies. Riots in East Berlin mark the first 
large-scale uprising against Soviet rule in Eastern Europe. Widespread protests 
are brutally crushed with the aid of Red Army tanks.

<P>
 1955: The Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Bloc's equivalent of NATO, is formed. 
</P>
<P>
 1956: Workers in the Polish industrial city of Poznan riot. A rebellion breaks 
out in Hungary. The United States encourages a short-lived rebel government, 
but the revolt is crushed by Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
 1961: The Berlin Wall is erected. To stem an exodus in which more than 2 
million East Germans had fled to the West, the Communists fill the last 
remaining hole in the Iron Curtain by building a heavily fortified barrier 
through the city. The Wall quickly becomes the most infamous symbol of Cold War 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 1963: U.S. President John F. Kennedy travels to West Berlin. Public morale 
soars when he declares himself a citizen of the city in spirit with the 
statement, "Ich bin ein Berliner." 
</P>
<P>
 1968: Reformist Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek begins to liberalize 
Czechoslovakia. The Soviets arrest Dubcek, invade the country and place a 
hard-liner in control. 
</P>
<P>
 1975: The Helsinki Final Act is signed by the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. The commitment allows fledgling dissident movements to 
exist in the East, sowing the seeds of communism's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: Shipyard electrician Lech Walesa leads Poland's Solidarity trade union 
into direct confrontation with Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 1981: Martial law is imposed in Poland. The Solidarity leadership is arrested 
and anti-government strikes end as factories are occupied by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 1985: Mikhail S. Gorbachev assumes the Soviet leadership and embarks on 
radical liberalization of Soviet policy. Glasnost (openness) and perestroika 
(restructuring) become household words. Poland and Hungary follow Gorbachev's 
lead, but hard-line leaders in Romania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and 
Bulgaria resist. 
</P>
<P>
 1989 -- April: The first Soviet troops begin their withdrawal from Hungary. 
Solidarity gains legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 May: Hungarians remove barbed-wire fencing from their border with Austria, the 
first breach in the Iron Curtain, after 200,000 Hungarians travel to Vienna on 
special visas for an Easter weekend shopping binge. 
</P>
<P>
 June: Solidarity wins the first free elections in Poland since the Communist 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 September: Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn orders border posts on the 
Austrian frontier to no longer stop East Germans, who had been crossing into 
the West by doing an end run around the Berlin Wall. East Germans begin pouring 
through official checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 7: Gorbachev urges East German leader Erich Honecker to liberalize, 
warning him that those who fail to see the need for reform will be punished by 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 16: In Leipzig, 100,000 protest in the largest unauthorized demonstration 
in East Germany since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 18: Honecker resigns and is replaced by Communist Politburo member Egon 
Krenz. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 1-5: The East German government removes curbs on foreign travel and 
thousands pour across the border to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 4: Up to 1 million protesters crowd the center of East Berlin, carrying 
banners and singing. The event is carried live by East German television. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 9: Buckling under pressure, East Germany opens the Berlin Wall, 
announcing that "private trips abroad can be requested without fulfilling any 
requirements." Within hours, Berlin is reunited and East Berliners flood 
through the city's checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 17: In Prague, police attack about 20,000 demonstrators near the city 
center. Czechoslovakia's "Velvet Revolution" begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 9: Communists relinquish power in Czechoslovakia. Alexander Dubcek 
becomes chairman of the National Assembly, and playwright Vaclav Havel is named 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 17: The Romanians follow with a general strike, more demonstrations and 
shootings in Cluj. Turmoil leads to the arrest and Dec. 25 execution of 
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife. A National Salvation Front 
proclaims itself the provisional government. 
</P>
<P>
 1990: Germany reunifies. The Soviet Union pledges to withdraw its 380,000 
troops in the former East Germany within four years. Lech Walesa becomes 
president of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 1991: The Yugoslav federation begins to disintegrate, as fighting erupts in 
Croatia and Slovenia. A coup attempt by Soviet hard-liners is thwarted. Within 
months, Gorbachev steps down and the Soviet Union is dissolved. The 12-nation 
European Community (now called the European Union) signs agreements with 
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia that liberalize trade and offer technical 
and financial help. EC nations commit themselves to the Maastricht Treaty, 
which calls for the formation of a political, economic and monetary union by 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: War in Bosnia-Herzegovina begins, and the euphoria of freedom starts to 
fade in Eastern Europe. Disillusioned electorates, facing unemployment and 
uncertain futures for the first time, turn back to socialism. Lithuanians vote 
a retooled Communist Party back into power. 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: Other ex-East Bloc countries, including Poland and Hungary, elect 
former Communists as leaders. In German national elections, the onetime 
Communists increase the number of their seats in Parliament from 17 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: Poland and Hungary apply for membership in the European Union amid 
predictions that they would become full members around the turn of the century. 
The last Russian troops depart Berlin and Germany in August, and about a week 
later the Western Allies make final their departure from West Berlin.

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 WALL FACTS The Wall began as a barrier between the east and west sides of 
Berlin, but it was later extended to surround West Berlin, sealing it off 
entirely from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concrete structure that faced the West was made up of three-ton panels 
on average 11 1/2 feet tall, 3 1/2 feet wide and 8 to 10 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 * In some places, the barrier had up to nine elements, including guard towers 
and a vehicle barrer trench. 
</P>
<P>
 * 45,000 panels were used. Each cost 856 marks to manufacture, or $572 at the 
current exchange rate. * The panels were originally intended for use as 
building blocks for corn silos. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wall-peckers" was the nickname given by Berliners to the entrepreneurs who 
chiseled out and sold chunks of the Wall as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * East Germany sold 70 of the most interesting panels at auction in Monaco 
with plans to apply the proceeds to improving health care and restoring 
historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average price at auction: 30,000 marks, or about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the 230 panels not sold at the auction have left Berlin as gifts, 
from the East German government or through private sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the rest of the Wall has either been ground up for paving material 
or sent back out into the eastern German countryside to be used in construction 
of corn silos. WHERE THE WALL IS NOW 
</P>
<P>
 Panels from the Berlin Wall are now at sites scattered all over the world, 
including: * The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Freedom Forum World Center in Arlington, Va., a human rights and press 
freedom center, which has 10 panels and the Checkpoint Charlie guardhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * The John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Danish artist Jens Galsciot Christophersen, who has two 
panels in Denmark and others on reserve in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 * The border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Gibauderie, the Paris home of cognac heiress and former Yugoslav actress 
Ljiljana Hennessy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hotel Metropole Palace in Monte Carlo. This panel was a gift of the East 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Vatican, the gift of clergymen from the former East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Jaguba Rizzoli in Cap Ferrat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The German town of Dingelstedt, which has made the panel into a sundial. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Thomas Steffen, a master baker in the southern German town 
of Waldshut-Tiengen. Source: Hagen Koch, Berlin Wall Archive The Berlin Wall

 It came suddenly. The Central Committee of the East German Communist Party 
announced at 7 p.m. that it had decided to relax travel restrictions. Then the 
state radio indicated that checkpoints along the infamous Berlin Wall would be 
opened. The flood began. Thousands of East Germans headed, without exit visas, 
for West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those scenes fixed forever in the memories of correspondents 
like myself and all the others who were there in Berlin on that flood-lit night 
of Thursday, Nov. 9, 1989. It was the most dramatic event in Europe since the 
end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 East German border guards, instead of shooting, stood by as Berliners passed 
through the hated and impregnable Wall that had divided their city. Hundreds of 
jubilant Germans from the East climbed atop the graffiti-scrawled section in 
front of the massive columns of the Brandenburg Gate to hail the unity of 
Berlin and all it portended. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long, exuberant pre-dawn hours, everyone around me was full of 
excitement and filled with relief that it had happened without violence. Berlin 
that night became a capital of hope. WILLIAM TUOHY

PROPERTY VALUES: RESIDENTS CAN TAKE STEPS TO LESSEN RISK OF LETHAL GAS LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All in the Marshall family felt like they had the flu back in February. Their 
symptoms got worse, however. Within a few days, the whole family was bedridden 
and barely mobile. By the time they figured out what was happening, their 
10-year-old son, Lawrence Jr., had died in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 What killed Lawrence Jr. -- and nearly killed the rest of the family -- was 
carbon monoxide (CO) being emitted from a faulty wall furnace in the family's 
Pasadena home. CO is a colorless and odorless gas that is the byproduct of 
burning oil, natural gas and other fuels. Simple, flulike symptoms mark the 
first stages of CO poisoning. The symptoms grow more serious as the air 
concentration of CO grows in a home and as blood levels of the lethal gas 
escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journal of the American Medical Assn. reports that CO poisoning is 
responsible for 1,500 deaths and 10,000 illnesses annually in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carbon monoxide poisoning is something you don't expect, and we hadn't been 
educated properly," said Lawrence Marshall, father of Lawrence Jr. The exhaust 
manifold of the family furnace wasn't properly expelling the lethal CO through 
the roof, Marshall recalled, and the home had recently been weatherized to make 
it air-tight. The result was that the whole family was being poisoned and they 
didn't know it. "The effect of the gas makes you like you're drugged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This deadly gas is a byproduct of common home appliances such as gas or oil 
furnaces, hot water heaters, ranges, refrigerators, clothes dryers, fireplaces 
and barbecue grills. Car exhaust fumes are also a major culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness about the problem with CO has been growing as a result of the recent 
death of tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis, and as a result of damage from the 
Northridge earthquake. The January temblor shook loose many venting and exhaust 
systems in the San Fernando Valley, and residents are having to properly 
reconnect some of their CO-emitting appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you avoid the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning at home? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the easiest, and certainly the cheapest way, is simply to call 
Southern California Gas Co. Why? The Gas Co. makes house calls for free to 
check your gas appliances for proper venting. This has become especially 
popular since the earthquake because many vents and appliances were moved out 
of their proper place, said Michelle Bagley, a spokeswoman for the Gas Co. in 
downtown Los Angeles. It's also a good idea to have the Gas Co. check your 
heater and other gas appliances once a year, even if there is no earthquake. 
The number to call for a free home inspection is (800) 427-2200. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can also lessen the risk of CO poisoning by keeping the area around 
forced air units or wall heaters free from dust and lint, which may block the 
entrance of air at the base of the gas burner. When a blockage of air occurs, 
the normal blue flame will turn yellow and become larger. The flame gets bigger 
because it is reaching up for the oxygen it needs. When complete combustion is 
interrupted, carbon monoxide is produced. It is also helpful to regularly clean 
or replace furnace air filters every few months. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also several manufacturers of CO detectors who claim that their 
detectors are a good way to lessen the risk of poisoning. Before you go out and 
buy a detector, however, it pays to do a bit of research. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike smoke -- which you can see and smell -- carbon monoxide is both 
colorless and odorless. It is quickly absorbed in the body and often can cause 
death while the victim is asleep. A handful of companies -- most notably First 
Alert -- are now making CO detectors for home use that sell in the $50 to $80 
range. All of these units look very much like smoke detectors and sound similar 
85-decibel shrieks. The detectors are supposed to sound an alarm well before a 
person would experience dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
 But tests of these detectors have yielded mixed results. The problem, 
according to a story in the May issue of Consumer Reports, is that once some of 
these detectors go on, it takes up to two hours for them to shut off. The 
nuisance leads many consumers to simply disconnect the units, which often issue 
false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are also selling carbon monoxide detection cards with spots 
that change color when exposed to certain levels of carbon monoxide. While 
these cards are inexpensive -- $5 to $15 -- they won't do you much good if 
you're sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the issue of effectiveness, there are also people who question the 
need for carbon monoxide detectors in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's something as important on the West Coast," said Bob 
Nickols, service manager at Fire Master, a fire prevention company near 
downtown Los Angeles. "It's more of an East Coast problem where homes are 
sealed tight to keep heat from escaping in winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Because homes are not as air-tight in Southern California, Nickols said, a gas 
leak, for example, isn't likely to cause a lethal buildup of carbon monoxide. 
Most poisonings in California come from people who do something like use a 
barbecue indoors, Nickols said. "You don't need a detector to realize that it's 
not smart to have a barbecue indoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickols reported that his company has received many inquiries from worried 
homeowners in the Valley since Gerulaitis' death. "I think the interest is 
something being created by the panic of his death," Nickols said. "The media 
has sensationalized it and the manufacturers of carbon monoxide detectors have 
taken advantage of the scare." 
</P>
<P>
 If people want to use CO detectors, they need to be aware of the limitations, 
warned Bagley, the Gas Co. spokeswoman. "There is a wide range of price and 
performance," she said. The Gas Co. is studying the use of CO detectors, Bagley 
reported. "But we haven't come to any conclusions." Most of the CO detectors 
being sold are sensitive devices that need regular testing. "If consumers can't 
test weekly or monthly, they might not want to get one."

U.S. HEATEDLY HITS RESISTANCE GROUP IN IRAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Department has issued a scathing report on an Iranian resistance 
group, saying it is not a viable alternative to the Tehran government. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, made public Monday, was criticized by Rep. Robert G. Torricelli 
(D-N.J.), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as incomplete 
and biased because of the department's refusal to meet with the group, the 
People's Moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress ordered the report to be made in foreign aid legislation. Recently, 
110 members of the House and Senate signed letters calling for official talks 
with the Moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the unclassified portion of its report, the State Department said it 
consulted with a large cross-section of Iranian opposition groups and 
expatriates, including Moujahedeen sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting its conclusions, it said, "Shunned by most Iranians and 
fundamentally undemocratic, the Mojahedin-e Khalq (People's Moujahedeen) are 
not a viable alternative to the current government of Iran."

NURSE SAYS HE'S NOT GUILTY OF RAPING PATIENTS

<P>
 A nurse pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he raped five women while 
they were under sedation in a hospital's surgical recovery room. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge John Thurman set a pretrial hearing date of Dec. 5 for Bruce 
Alan Young and entered an order forbidding his accusers to discuss the case 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 45, a registered nurse at Citrus Memorial Hospital since 1990, stood 
shackled hand and foot before the judge. His attorney, William Lackay, wanted 
Thurman to prohibit the accusers from discussing the case with anybody at all, 
but prosecutors protested and the judge narrowed the scope of the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has been held under $100,000 bond at the Citrus County Jail since his 
arrest Oct. 3 after another nurse reported seeing him atop a 15-year-old 
anesthetized patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he told them he targeted the unconscious teen-ager because she was 
"helpless and pretty."

NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS CUT AIDS RISK, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handing out clean needles to drug users appears to cut their risk of AIDS in 
half, a new study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 U.S. cities have needle exchange programs, but evidence that they 
actually reduce the risk of AIDS infection has been slim. Most of the data has 
come from studies in Europe, where AIDS among drug addicts is generally far 
less common than in the United States, especially the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study was based on a needle exchange program in New York City, 
where about half the city's 200,000 intravenous drug abusers are infected with 
HIV, the AIDS virus. Addicts can become infected with the virus if they share 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort, sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS Research, has 
provided clean injection supplies to 22,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais of New York's Beth Israel Medical Center presented data 
on the program's results Monday at a meeting in Washington of the American 
Public Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best estimate of the effect of the program for the people who come in is 
that it probably reduces the new infection rate by about half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were based on 350 users whose saliva was tested for HIV when they 
enrolled in the program and when they returned to pick up clean needles. Des 
Jarlais calculated that their annual risk of infection was 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 For ethical reasons, the researchers did not enroll a comparison group that 
was deprived of clean needles. However, other studies of addicts in New York 
suggest that about 5% a year are infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Those participating in the study were frequent drug users, averaging three 
injections a day. In the month before the needle exchange, they rented or 
bought used syringes an average of 16 times. After the program, this fell to 
four times.

OUTBOARD BOAT ENGINES FACE EPA CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that it will require new 
pollution controls on outboard-motor boats because they are a major contributor 
to air and water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA controls will be phased in beginning in 1998 over eight years and 
likely will lead to the gradual replacement of the dirtier two-cycle boat 
engines with more sophisticated, cleaner-burning, four-cycle engines. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 12 million registered motor boats now in use are not expected to 
be affected directly, but newly built engines will have to meet the tougher EPA 
pollution standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the EPA regulation, manufacturers will have to begin reducing 
smog-causing hydrocarbon emissions beginning with 1998 model boats and motors. 
They will have to reduce such emissions by 75% of current levels by 2006, EPA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new controls are the latest effort by the EPA to curb pollution on a 
variety of off-road gasoline or diesel burning engines.

DEVIL'S NIGHT ARSON SPREE BACK IN A BIG WAY IN DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city's Devil's Night arson spree returned with a vengeance, officials 
said Monday, with hundreds of fires set and more than 300 teen-agers arrested 
for curfew violation. At least two people were charged with setting fires and 
police expected more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes back to one of our worst nights since I have been on the job," Fire 
Chief Archie Warde said as firefighters struggled against one of the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 Television reports put the number of fires Sunday night and Monday morning at 
200 to 300. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, 314 teen-agers had been arrested for violating the Devil's 
Night curfew, and several families had been left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Highland Park, Mich., 1-year-old Destiny Wilson was dead and four 
other people were injured after a fire swept through a four-story apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Destiny's sister, Ivory, 3, was in critical condition, said a Detroit 
Children's Hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believe the apartment house fire was an act of 
vengeance against someone living in the building and not related to Devil's 
Night, but they could not be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Detroit had taken drastic steps to control the number of Devil's 
Night fires, including ordering a dusk-to-dawn curfew for teen-agers and 
organizing residents into patrols to discourage arsonists from torching 
abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said only 8,000 volunteers were on the streets this year, 
contrasted with 40,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the number of arsons had fallen dramatically, with only 65 
reported last year -- no more than on an average night.

SCOTT HARRIS: HALLOWEEN IS MORE ABOUT FUN THAN FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bright and sunny day. We scheduled the interview for noon, and I was 
walking up the driveway to the Studio City ranch-style home, when I noticed 
something on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lantern, lying on its side, and it was attached to something. Wait. 
No, not something. Some body. Somebody was holding it -- but the somebody 
wasn't there! It was just a lantern, a hand and an arm! 
</P>
<P>
 Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! The sound reverberated inside my skull. Took a second to 
recognize the "Psycho" theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, I confronted the young man of the house. "Oh, that," he said 
dismissively. "The rest of the person is in the back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Corb is a friendly fellow, but then so was Norman Bates. Every Halloween, 
this 35-year-old free-lance film editor goes through a transformation. Some 
people turn into werewolves; Corb becomes a kind of homespun Hitchcock who 
turns his folks' suburban front yard into a nether world spooked by the spirits 
beyond. Corb takes pains to explain that blood, gore and loose body parts 
really aren't his cup of tea. He bemoans the fact that make-believe horror has 
become as subtle as a Texan wielding a chain saw. A student of the old school, 
Corb prefers the ghostly sound of a disembodied voice to the ghastly sight of a 
dismemberment. 
</P>
<P>
 The arm on the lawn, Corb assured me, was a work in progress -- "the beginning 
of a shrouded human form." 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, I dropped by and saw the shrouded grieving parents, the 
lantern held aloft over the grave of a small child. A few steps later, I heard 
a little girl's voice, and I then saw her ghost, shimmering inside her nursery. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As holidays go, Halloween has always been one of my favorites. My affection 
survived the trauma I experienced some 30 years ago, when a teen-ager on a 
Schwinn Stingray pedaled off with my hard-earned candy. Boiled down to its 
essence, Halloween is a ritual that transforms fear into fun. Adding to the fun 
are some of the scariest people on the face of the Earth -- humorless sorts who 
wave Bibles and insist that Halloween is an exercise in Satanism and devil 
worship. They are a distinct minority, however, and we can thank God for that. 
Or perhaps you-know-who. 
</P>
<P>
 In my trick-or-treating days, the candy mattered more than the history. 
Halloween, my handiest encyclopedias explain, is rooted in a Druid ceremony 
that honored a god of the dead. This pagan festival was adapted into Christian 
ritual; it's called Halloween because it occurs on the eve of All Saint's Day, 
or "All Hallows." 
</P>
<P>
 "The souls of the dead were supposed to revisit their homes on this day," the 
Encyclopedia Britannica states, "and the autumnal festival acquired sinister 
significance. . . . It was the time to placate the supernatural powers 
controlling the processes of nature. . . . It was the only day on which the 
help of the devil was invoked for such purposes. "  
</P>
<P>
 The devil, you say?  
</P>
<P>
 The italics are mine. Irish immigrants introduced the secular customs of 
Halloween to the United States in the 19th Century. Irish mythology about elves 
and fairies making mischief on this day inspired boys and young men to engage 
in such "tricks" as the overturning of outhouses. Everybody who has ever gone 
trick-or-treating owes a debt of gratitude to those hooligans of yore. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a day to confront and overcome our fears. The other night, I took my 
friends Jenny and Christopher, ages 7 and 5, through the "Spooky House" on 
Friar Street in Woodland Hills. This one featured a large cast of young actors 
dressed as monsters and ghouls. A giant foam-rubber tarantula landed on my 
head. There was a fair amount of bogus blood and gore. At one point, I saw a 
familiar psycho in a hockey mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's Freddy!" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The psycho lifted his mask and whispered: "I'm Jason. Jason. " 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so I don't know Elm Street from Friday the 13th, but Jenny and Chris don't 
either. They entered boldly, but when they saw the living dead, they stopped in 
fear and wanted to turn around. With some gentle coaxing from the spirits, they 
hustled on through.  
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, I praised them for being so brave. That's part of the 
ritual too. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The crowds have lined up outside Gary Corb's house for years. Inspired by 
Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, he staged his first haunting at the age of 13, a 
modest exhibit with eerie sounds from one set of speakers. Now Corb and his 
friends work for days to stage the production, with its 40 speakers and 
elaborate lighting. The walls of a crypt seem to breathe, and his homemade 
special effects enable Corb to project the spectral images of the little girl 
and a skeleton playing a harp. Corb, a songwriter, composed and recorded a 
spooky melody on a church pipe organ. He also sang Gregorian chants. "Nobody's 
corrected my Latin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, one visitor was so impressed that he presented Corb 
with "a severed hand" from a novelty shop. At first Corb wasn't sure what to do 
with it -- until he used it for a new creation, the statue of an angel in 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Corb isn't sure why he does it, year after year. "It's a calling," he says. 
For three nights, hundreds of visitors line the street and take up all the 
parking. Studio City is suspiciously fond of the tradition. The negative 
reaction has come not from neighbors, but from those occasional folks who 
insist that Corb is in league with the Prince of Darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there was one neighbor who complained about the noise, but that was 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's heard from him since.

CITY MEASURES; VIEW TAX AND BEACHFRONT LEASES AMONG THE ISSUES FACING VOTERS; 
BALLOT: SANTA PAULA RESIDENTS WILL WEIGH CITY CLERK APPOINTMENT. VENTURANS WILL 
CONSIDER REOPENING POLI STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 View taxes, beachfront leases and the question of whether to elect or appoint 
a city official are among the issues that will be considered next week by 
voters in three Ventura County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the attention has gone to a measure to reopen Poli Street 
near Ventura High School during school hours, there are three other measures on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Measure B in Santa Paula, Measure C in Port Hueneme and Measure D 
in Ventura are policy issues that council members said should or must be 
decided by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula residents will be asked whether they want the City Council to 
appoint the city clerk; Ventura voters will be asked whether to increase limits 
on waterfront leases of city property from 10 to 30 years, and Port Hueneme 
voters are being asked whether the city should amend its beach and park 
maintenance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme measure, however, is not binding. Officials there said they 
want to know whether residents approve of the existing park and beach tax so 
the incoming council can decide whether to amend it. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two ballot measures require a majority vote to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, the Santa Paula City Council named City Administrator Arnold 
Dowdy to the position of city clerk after elected City Clerk Stacey MacDonald 
left midterm for another job. By law, voters must approve giving the council 
the authority to appoint a city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything the city clerk is required to do is specified by law," Councilman 
John A. F. Melton said. "We can save some money and it's already being done 
in-house. I'm for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dowdy said the duties add extra responsibility to his job as city 
administrator but added that he has done the work for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes sense from an administrative point of view to have the 
position appointed," Dowdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura voters will decide whether the city's charter should be changed to 
allow longer waterfront leases on city-owned property.  
</P>
<P>
 The lease issue arose when developer after developer hesitated to open a 
restaurant on the Ventura Pier because the city charter only permits a 10-year 
lease on beachfront properties. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lease expires, the contract is up for bid again and the renter has no 
legal advantage over other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs say 20- to 50-year leases, which are more common in the 
industry, are necessary to allow a business to recoup its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wachter, owner of Ventura's Eric Ericcson's Fish Co. and the restaurateur 
selected to open a business on the pier, has said that if the ballot measure 
does not pass, he wants a guarantee that Ventura will either renew his contract 
in 10 years or buy out his business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council voted early last summer to put the issue before 
voters, who must decide the measure because it calls for amending the city's 
charter. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will also decide on the much more publicized Measure E, which would 
reopen Poli Street to through traffic as it winds through Ventura High School. 
The city closed the street last year after the stabbing death of a Ventura High 
School student near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, an advisory measure queries voters on whether the city should 
change any of its park and beach maintenance taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Measure C asks whether the city should adopt a citywide beach maintenance tax 
that would replace the existing so-called view tax. 
</P>
<P>
 As of now, the view tax, levied on property owners south of Hueneme Road, 
raises $157,500 a year that is spent maintaining the beach area. The tax, which 
ranges from $80 to $208 a year, is levied according to the parcels' proximity 
to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the measure would poll voters on changing the park maintenance 
tax -- which ranges from $37 to $51 a year and is based on the properties' 
proximity to the city's five parks -- to a flat-rate levy. The current tax 
brings in about $300,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city received a lot of written protests about both the park and beach 
assessment districts," Councilman Dorill Wright said. "That's why we decided to 
put it on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents complained when the view tax was passed that everyone uses the 
beach and everyone should be responsible for its upkeep.

OJAI CITY COUNCIL; CANDIDATES DISAGREE ON CHAIN STORES, IMPORTANCE OF TOURISM; 
CAMPAIGN: THE THREE INCUMBENTS AND FOUR CHALLENGERS ALL BACK THE TOWN'S TIGHT 
RESTRICTIONS ON GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a town known for its slow-growth policies and disdain for strip malls, the 
race for three seats on the Ojai City Council has focused attention on some 
familiar issues: traffic, tourism and the presence of chain stores in the Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven candidates in the low-key contest say preserving the quality of life 
in the picturesque valley is the top issue facing the city in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 They support Ojai's tight restrictions on growth, though they are split on 
allowing chain stores inside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 They agree that too many cars crowd the downtown area on the weekends, but 
they differ on whether the best solution is more traffic lights, a parking 
garage, or a network of bike paths and walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 As for tourism, the candidates, including three incumbents and four 
challengers, offer a range of opinions on how the city should balance its only 
industry against the concerns of full-time residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very anti-tourist," said Bruce Roland, 41, a political novice and liquor 
store clerk, adding that he is frustrated that many downtown businesses now 
cater to tourists by offering upscale clothing, jewelry and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real services in town for the people who live here," he said. "You 
can't even really get a toaster up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates, however, say the city cannot afford to ignore the importance 
of tourism. A quarter of the city's revenue is generated by taxes on hotel 
rooms, and another quarter comes from sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure we have the revenues we need for our budgeting," said 
three-term incumbent Nina Shelley. "We need to keep this town going and our 
only industry of note is tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Shelley, Mayor Joe De Vito and Councilman Steve Olsen are running 
to keep their seats on the five-member council. They are being challenged by 
Roland, carpenter Richard Fernow, yoga teacher and columnist Suza Francina and 
environmental activist Stan Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 4,000 registered voters in Ojai, campaigning consists mainly of 
mailing flyers, walking the precincts and attending a few back-yard 
fund-raisers. All together, the four top money-raisers have spent less than 
$7,000 on the campaign. And the other three candidates filed statements saying 
they would spend less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai has always been a grass-roots type of campaign," said Steve Olsen, 45, a 
city councilman for eight years. "I think it's extremely important to get out 
and meet with the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four challengers, Francina and Greene are both known for their activism 
in the community and have built their campaigns around environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Francina, 45, has owned the Ojai Yoga Center since 1976 and writes a regular 
column on health and environmental topics for an Ojai newspaper. Her goals 
include "traffic calming" and expanding Ojai's network of bike paths and 
walkways to encourage tourists and residents to avoid driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic calming," Francina said, means landscaping and narrowing streets so 
that cars are forced to slow down. "You immediately communicate that this is 
shared space and you better slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce congestion and promote exercise, Francina said she wants to persuade 
the Ojai school district to give physical education credit to students who walk 
to campus. And she wants to replace fluorescent lighting in the council 
chambers with full-spectrum lights, which she said are closer to natural light 
and less stressful to sit beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of studies show those neon lights are stressful," she said. "Any public 
place should have full spectrum lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, 65, is a former aerospace engineer who, for the last 23 years, has 
owned an air-conditioning and heating repair business in Ojai. He was elected 
to the board of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District four years ago, and has 
served as the president of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his direction, the group successfully stopped the expansion of an oil 
refinery on Ventura Avenue in the early 1980s. In 1989, the group's lawsuit 
against the Environmental Protection Agency led to strict new air quality 
regulations for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said those battles have given him experience working with the county 
and tackling issues on a regional scale. "I know how to win battles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene opposes large chain stores entering the Ojai Valley, because he said 
they will create unfair competition and drive local merchants out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "People argue that's a non-competitive position, but it's these large stores 
that create the non-competitive environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All three incumbents say the issue of chain stores needs to be studied further 
as part of the city's process of updating its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We the council will have to debate that and open up a dialogue with the 
people in the community," Shelley said. "We certainly have a great deal of 
respect for our business people who are already here." 
</P>
<P>
 While the incumbents are not running as a slate, each makes a point of talking 
about the cooperation among council members. They defend the panel's 
environmental record over the last four years, pointing to the fight against 
Weldon Canyon, the introduction of a "green waste" composting program, the 
opening of a Park 'N Ride lot and Ojai's tight restrictions on growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked very, very well together," De Vito said. "We're not afraid to 
voice our opinion and get in and get our hands dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired elementary school principal and president of the Ojai Valley Tennis 
Tournament, De Vito, 62, favors a plan to install new traffic lights to ease 
congestion on Ojai Avenue, and he has proposed a valleywide assessment district 
to support the Ojai Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, 45, principal at Chaparral High School, said the city needs to maintain 
its strong tax base by keeping high aesthetic standards and a low crime rate. 
While other cities have cut services or laid off employees, Ojai has doubled 
its reserves since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to come to Ojai if they think they're going to get mugged," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley, 73, said the council should continue to make Ojai's downtown the 
focus of commercial activity, and to present a united front against the Weldon 
Canyon dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Like De Vito, Shelley said the experience and harmony among present council 
members would be an asset during the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no rancor or any of the problems that plague some of the councils we 
know about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernow and Roland, however, think the current council has catered too much to 
businesses that draw in tourists. Instead, they say the council should pay more 
attention to local residents and work to bring in a non-tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who get up and go to work in the morning need a voice," said 
Fernow, 44, who works as a carpenter in building and replacing bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need to have a tourist-based attraction every weekend in 
town," Fernow said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help with parking and traffic, he has suggested building a two- or 
three-story garage near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 And he thinks the city should do more to encourage the construction of 
mid-priced and affordable homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not established here, you can't afford to live here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland, 41, who is building several houses with his father in Meiners Oaks, 
said he entered the council race out of anger over the city's treatment of 
businesses off Ojai Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He opposes the city's restrictions on business signs and its anti-smoking 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very anti-government," he said. "Government needs to be pared down and 
gotten out of private peoples' lives."

NEW U.S. RULES EXTEND MEDFLY SPRAYING PERIOD; FARMING: OFFICIALS SAY THE CHANGE 
FOR GROWERS IS TIED TO THE FLY'S LONGER LIFE CYCLE DURING COOLER WINTER MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under new rules to be announced today, growers in Ventura County's Medfly 
quarantine area must spray their crops with pesticide for at least five weeks 
-- and as long as 11 1/2 weeks in cooler weather -- before harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations call for some spraying periods that are nearly three times as 
long as had previously been outlined, a change officials tied to the fly's 
longer life cycle during the winter. Under the new schedule, crops must still 
be sprayed every six to 10 days, but the length of the entire treatment will 
vary, depending on the time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the federal Department of Food and Agriculture will explain the 
spraying guidelines to growers of avocados -- the largest crop to be affected 
by the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation -- during a meeting this morning in 
Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 While the treatment schedule will not prevent growers from picking in time for 
the January and February markets, the requirements could make it more difficult 
to capture premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough trying to do things on a one-month time frame," said rancher 
Bill Butchko, who cultivates about 25 acres of avocados near Somis. "If it's 
going to be in effect for almost two months, certainly that's all the more 
harder to try and plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, Butchko said he would gauge market prices, 
coordinate with a packinghouse and schedule a harvest about two weeks in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If conditions change for the better or against you, you can speed up your 
harvest . . . or curtail it or chop it off entirely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the restrictions on harvesting, growers also will have less flexibility 
to pick avocados quickly if forecasters call for a crop-damaging freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Peirce, a consultant with Calavo Growers of California, an avocado 
cooperative that represents 204 grove owners in the quarantine area, said it is 
difficult to predict how many farmers will elect to begin spraying. Some, he 
said, may try to wait, hoping the quarantine will be lifted while the fruit is 
still usable. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, Calavo handled 15% of its Ventura County crop during December, 
January and February. Last year, when the crop was unusually large, that 
amounted to about 12 million pounds, said Carlos Vasquez, a regional manager 
with the cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular wintertime varieties in Ventura County are Bacons and 
Pinkertons, officials said, while the largest crop, Hass avocados, are usually 
harvested later. 
</P>
<P>
 To recover the cost of the pesticide spraying, Butchko said some growers may 
elect to pick part of their Hass crop early along with the other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first two Medflies were discovered in Ventura County on Sept. 29, 
growers within the 86-square-mile quarantine were told they had to fumigate, 
put their crops in cold storage or spray them with a mixture of malathion and 
corn syrup bait before they could sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, state and federal officials had described the spraying treatment 
-- which is expected to be the most popular option -- as a monthlong process 
with weekly sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment lengths will now vary, growing longer through January and February, 
then shortening as temperatures warm. For instance, if a grower began spraying 
Monday, he or she could harvest Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 If the quarantine is still in effect June 1, treatment lengths will return to 
one month. So far, seven growers have begun spraying, hiring either ground 
crews or helicopter companies to blanket the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hendrix, spokesman for the Cooperative Medfly Project, said the longer 
lengths should not come as a surprise. He said growers were cautioned that the 
four-week model was based on warmer temperatures in Corona and during the 
summer in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them this could possibly change to follow the biology of the fly, so 
this isn't going to catch them by surprise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, said he 
had expected the treatment length to remain at one month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were talking about 30 days before and now it's more like 45, that may 
surprise some folks. It does me. I didn't realize there was going to be a 
climatic adjustment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Grether, who owns about 150 acres of avocados inside the quarantine zone, 
said the inconvenience of the longer treatment schedule is outweighed by the 
need to wipe out the fly and bring an end to the quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to achieve foremost is to eradicate the fly," he said. "We're 
willing to cooperate with any program that has good science and good reasoning 
behind it."

HOPING TO RESUSCITATE THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN; OXNARD CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER 
REVITALIZATION PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, Oxnard's leaders have been trying to resurrect the 
city's downtown, a once-booming strip of family-owned shops and department 
stores that has become increasingly run-down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of city-sponsored committees and advisory panels have spent hundreds of 
thousands of dollars laboring to find the cure for the ailing 50-square-block 
area, but the vacant storefronts are a reminder that nothing has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of any town is the downtown," said Gloria Stuart, who with her 
husband, Bill, has owned BG's Coffee Shop in the center of downtown for 23 
years. "They're finding that out all over the place . . . and I just hope 
Oxnard finds that out before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council today will consider investing $1.6 million into the 
latest plans for downtown revival, including proposals to upgrade storefront 
facades, install theme lighting and walkways, recruit new businesses and 
schedule more cultural events in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's plan, put together by Andres Duany, a Miami-based consultant 
renowned for traditional town planning, involves using available redevelopment 
funds as a catalyst to spur private investment in the area and make downtown 
competitive with newer office complexes and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members today will review a combination of merchants' suggestions and 
previous city proposals for sprucing up downtown and determine which plans 
should be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities, including Pasadena, Santa Monica and Glendale, were used as 
models for Oxnard's plan, said 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Maggio, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geographically, downtown is still the center of the city and certainly has 
the possibility of coming back and being a viable area," Maggio said. "What we 
intend to do is use the funds to induce capital investment, to give the area an 
extra edge."  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said that downtown needs to become more dense, with 
retail businesses on the ground floor of buildings and offices above. He also 
said if the area is ever to make a comeback, it will need a make-over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having a unified theme would certainly add to the beauty of the 
area," Lopez said. "If you just have a hodgepodge of development, it doesn't 
look good. Something has to be put in place, architecturally or in another way, 
to make everything blend together." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals for bringing downtown back are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A program where signs and kiosks would be strategically placed throughout 
Oxnard pointing the way to downtown and detailing what can be found in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 * A centralized management program akin to a shopping mall that would 
coordinate the marketing efforts of downtown merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 * A facade program that would assist property owners in upgrading their 
buildings to create an attractive environment for pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plan to enhance A Street, the center of downtown, by providing additional 
parking and greater storefront visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials are also recommending that the city use the money to begin a 
$2.5-million program to upgrade downtown's Plaza Park by closing off North 5th 
Street to traffic, providing more landscaping and building a colonnade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown merchants remain skeptical of the city's promises to improve the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 They say downtown has been hurt by the city's short-term efforts to increase 
revenue with developments such as the Oxnard Factory Outlet Mall and the 
Shopping at the Rose complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become a freeway town," said Stuart, whose restaurant is still 
frequented by many of Oxnard's old-timers. "They forgot all the people who've 
been here all these years and never left." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez said downtown could still be successful if businesses in the area 
offered similar goods at similar prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have services that are of good quality, and those services are at a 
competitive price, people will come to the area," he said. "Besides, there are 
a lot of people who live near downtown."

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; THRIFT STORE RAISES 
FUNDS AND SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Weeks before the new Out of the Closet Thrift Store opened in North Hollywood, 
the donations were rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just give and give," said Peter Frater of Van Nuys, a computer systems 
operator working as a volunteer at the store. "We were so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Location was probably a big part of the success. The new thrift store -- set 
up by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation -- is only a couple of doors away from a 
Goodwill store on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and people appeared to be splitting 
their donations between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the donations, comes a need for volunteers to help sort the wares, 
stock the shelves and help keep the store running, said Juan Jose Lomeli, 
assistant manager and volunteer coordinator for the store, which opened Oct. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need volunteers with the bric-a-brac and the books," Lomeli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than just another place to find stuffed animals, toys, games, tennis 
rackets, inexpensive electronic equipment and a $2 pair of shoes, the thrift 
store can also help raise awareness about AIDS and HIV, AIDS Healthcare 
Foundation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose someone you love, it's very difficult," said Frater, whose 
companion of seven years died of AIDS five years ago. "I just felt compelled to 
do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Frater has not tested positive for the virus himself, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone who does volunteer or work with the foundation and its 
three thrift stores has a similar story, said Pablo Garcia, who has worked at 
the Out of the Closet Stores in Atwater Village and on Fairfax Avenue in Los 
Angeles. The Atwater Village store opened in October, 1990. The Fairfax store 
opened in July, replacing another store on La Brea Avenue that was burned by an 
arsonist two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteers help our morale here, and our viability for funding," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifts stores have proven to be an ideal way to raise money, said Keith 
Malone, a spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for bargains nowadays," Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer, call Lomeli at (818) 769-0503. 
</P>
<P>
 New Horizons, a nonprofit organization providing housing for mentally retarded 
people in the San Fernando Valley, is looking for volunteers to help in 
fund-raising, marketing, public relations and quality control, as well as with 
helping clients with projects in the group's activity center. Activities 
include ceramics, painting and learning skills like writing and counting. For 
more information or to volunteer call Gloria Griskevitch at (818) 894-9301. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Guardian Volunteers are looking for help in wrapping 2,300 holiday 
gifts for the disabled, elderly or bedridden. More volunteers also will be 
needed to deliver the gifts to wards of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Mental Health. Gift-wrapping is being done at the office of the Public 
Guardian, 320 West Temple St., ninth floor, Los Angeles. Parking is free but 
reservations must be made ahead of time. For more information call Joan Vitale 
or Chris Marshall at (213) 974-0400 or (213) 974-0543. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Elder-Care Corps is looking for volunteers willing to adopt elderly 
people of all faiths living in a nursing home or residential facility. 
According to the group, 40% of these residents seldom or never have visitors. 
Hours are flexible. To volunteer call Kay Ginsberg at (310) 359-9336. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to serve on a jury for mock trials at UCLA Law School. 
The volunteers hear a case and render a verdict. The deliberations are 
videotaped. Volunteers may sign up for only one of the following dates: Nov. 
21, 22, 28, 29 or 30. For more information call Bunny Friedman at (310) 
206-1193. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TAKASUGI OUTSPENDS MARON BY BIG MARGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) has spent more than 10 times what his 
Democratic opponent Dorothy Maron has spent in a contest for the 37th Assembly 
District seat, according to recent campaign finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi spent a total of $86,700 on his campaign, while Maron reported 
expenditures of $7,913.The candidates' latest campaign finance reports cover 
the period through Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are running in an Assembly district that stretches from Oxnard to 
Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi, who is seeking his second term, so far has received $100,900 in 
campaign donations. During October, he received more than $2,000 from local 
attorneys and about the same from doctors, dentists and ophthalmologists. He 
also received $500 contributions each from Amgen and the California Rifle and 
Pistol Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Maron reported $23,000 in campaign money, including a 
personal loan of $20,000. She said she plans to spend most of it on a campaign 
mailer the week before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district favors Republicans, Maron said that she is determined to 
win and that is why "you have to put your money where your mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th Assembly District, Republican incumbent Paula L. Boland of Granada 
Hills has spent $64,000 on her reelection bid, while her 19-year-old Democratic 
opponent, Josh Arce, has raised and spent about $14,000. The district includes 
Simi Valley, Fillmore and parts of the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Boland's spending lead, Arce, a resident of Chatsworth, said he is not 
deterred. He said he has run a strong grass-roots campaign, claiming to have 
knocked on about 12,000 doors while canvassing neighborhoods in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a test of my theory that people power can beat money," he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNCILMAN PRESSES BID FOR ROAD BARRIERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with what he says are twice as many deaths on California 126 as other 
state highways, Fillmore Councilman Roger E. Campbell is taking his campaign 
for placing concrete barriers on the road known as "Blood Alley" to each city 
council in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell has already won support from his own City Council to send a letter to 
the state Department of Transportation in support of the barriers.The Simi 
Valley council voiced approval Monday, and agreed to consider an endorsement 
letter next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell will ask Ventura County supervisors this morning for a similar 
letter, and plans to address the Camarillo and Moorpark councils Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying this will stop accidents, but it'll stop head-on collisions," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who doubles as the city's assistant fire chief and responds to 
accidents around Fillmore, began his latest call for the barriers after two men 
died in a violent collision two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials concluded last year that the barriers were not feasible 
along that stretch of road because of the number of openings that would have to 
be cut to allow homeowners to get on and off the highway. State officials also 
said the barriers could possibly create more problems than they would solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he does not buy that reasoning. He wants barriers erected 
between Boozey Road east of Santa Paula and Santa Clarita, excluding the city 
of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lives are being destroyed by the accidents occurring on that road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine people have died on the stretch of road since 1989, a figure 
Campbell said is twice the state average. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PUBLIC'S IDEAS SOUGHT ON CANYON 
PARKLAND 
</P>

<P>
 The National Park Service is holding meetings tonight and Thursday to solicit 
public input on how to manage its parkland at Palo Comado and Cheeseboro 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The two canyons that make up a 4,400-acre park are part of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area.The site includes the former Jordan Ranch, 
which became part of the park last April after years of debate over whether its 
oak-lined canyon and grasslands should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we acquire a site we need to develop a detailed plan for what 
specifically we will do with that space," said David Gackenbach, superintendent 
of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. "We've got to decide 
whether we are going to build trails, parking lots, picnic areas. We want to 
find out from the public what they want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The comprehensive management plan for the two canyons will not be complete for 
nearly two years, Gackenbach said. After gathering public input, the Park 
Service will develop a draft plan and environmental assessment for release in 
the fall of 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting is at the Sycamore Drive Community Center in Simi Valley, 
1692 Sycamore Drive, from 7:30 to 9 p.m. On Thursday, the meeting is in 
Calabasas at the A.E. Wright Middle School, 4029 N. Las Virgenes Canyon Road, 
also from 7:30 to 9 p.m.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY: PORT HUENEME; SITE GAINS UPGRADED FOREIGN TRADE STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to boost trade and increase jobs, Oxnard Harbor District 
officials announced Monday that the Port of Hueneme has been named the 205th 
foreign trade zone port in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation, made by the U. S. Department of Commerce, allows foreign 
shippers to move goods to one of three harbor district-owned sites in Ventura 
County where products, such as cars, can be stored, prepared for market or 
customized without the owner of the products paying duty for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the shipper or manufacturer moves the products to market, they would then 
pay duty fees to the U. S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade zone sites include the seaport, parts of the U. S. Navy's Construction 
Battalion Center, a downtown Oxnard freezer facility and an industrial park 
site in south Oxnard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new status "will add a great deal of flexibility to our international 
customers' operations," said Raymond E. Fosse, president of the Oxnard Harbor 
District Board of Harbor Commissioners. "It's a solid incentive for foreign 
companies to utilize American workers in preparing their goods for the U. S. 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam Quarles, a spokesman for the district, said officials first learned that 
foreign trade zone status had been granted to the port late last Friday. The 
decision capped a yearlong effort by the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarles said the port, which contributes an estimated $275 million to the 
Ventura County economy, will be the only deep-water foreign trade zone port 
between the ports of Los Angeles-Long Beach and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this will move us into the forefront of international trading," 
Quarles said. "We're very excited. I think we will see a very healthy increase 
in business with our new designation." J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO VOTE ON PACT FOR TREATMENT 
PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council members tonight can move forward with plans to 
build an expanded, high-tech waste water treatment plant when they vote on a 
contract to design the proposed $65-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to drastically overhaul the Hill Canyon Wastewater Treatment 
Plant within the next few years.The redesign would help Thousand Oaks meet new 
federal pollutant standards, and ensure the waste water treatment plant could 
keep pace with a growing population, Public Works Director Donald Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plant would not need to use chlorine, a potentially toxic chemical, to 
disinfect waste. Instead, the facility would rely on ultraviolet rays to 
accomplish the same task -- with no hazardous waste byproducts, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate odors, city officials plan to shut down the sludge storage pits 
and handle solid wastes off-site, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be paid for through bond issues or other debt financing, and 
through a likely increase in waste water service fees, Nelson said. The city 
has already saved up a small fund to start the project, but "it's just a couple 
of million, just peanuts" compared to the total price tag, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote tonight on a $997,228 contract with CH2M Hill California 
Inc. to complete preliminary designs on the facility. If awarded, that contract 
will bring the company's total consulting fees to $1.25 million. STEPHANIE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CANDIDATE LEVELS CHARGE AGAINST 
RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council candidate Greg Cole has filed a complaint against 
three of his rivals, claiming their supporters violated campaign disclosure 
laws by failing to register as an organized group. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole accused the Grassroots Coalition, which includes six citizens groups, of 
contributing to the campaigns of Elois Zeanah, David Hare and M. Ali Issari 
without completing necessary paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, any person or group who contributes more than $1,000 to a 
political campaign must file a statement of organization with the secretary of 
state and the city clerk, according to Jeanette Turvill, a spokeswoman for the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A leader of the Grassroots Coalition, Michelle Koetke, said the umbrella 
organization has spent only about $800 on a flyer backing the slate of Zeanah, 
Hare and Issari. "We've been very careful about it," she said. "I'm keeping 
strict records." 
</P>
<P>
 But Koetke acknowledged that individual coalition members may have dipped into 
their own wallets to make additional copies of the literature. "I can't stop 
people from going out and doing their own thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If members of the coalition, emptying their own pockets, have bumped the 
group's total expenditures above $1,000, the coalition could be required to 
register as an official political organization, Turvill said. Violations of the 
campaign code carry a $2,000 administrative fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said he would ask the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah, however, dismissed the charge as ludicrous. "It seems some candidates 
will do anything to grab a headline," she said. "It's an attack on residents."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY: CAMARILLO; GIRL, 14, ARRESTED AT PROP. 187 PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Adolfo Camarillo High School student was arrested Monday 
afternoon on suspicion of striking a police officer during a short-lived 
Proposition 187 protest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 2 p.m. an estimated 20 students began protesting the statewide ballot 
initiative that would, if approved by voters Nov. 8, severely limit public 
assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose identity was not released because of her age, is accused of 
striking Ventura Sheriff's Detective Mark Criger as he was videotaping the 
student protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "She apparently took offense at me videotaping her," Criger said after the 
incident. He was not injured and the other student demonstrators dispersed 
quickly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Criger said the girl was arrested, cited and released to the custody of her 
parents a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Tackett, the school's principal, said the incident began after students 
attending a party off campus walked back to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were loud but it didn't last very long," Tackett said. "To their credit, 
other students did not join them when the change-of-class bell rang." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was the latest in a series of student protests across the county. 
Last Friday hundreds of students from area high schools left their classes to 
protest the much-debated ballot measure. Officers arrested three students and 
one adult during those demonstrations. J.E. MITCHELL

 Ventura police officers have arrested two men and are searching for two others 
in connection with an assault on a 25-year-old Ventura resident, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Guadalupe Rodriguez, suffered a cut to his right eye that required 
stitches, Ventura Police Officer Ray Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the trouble began at a party Sunday night on Mission Street when 
one of the suspects, Braulio Garcia, tried to run over his cousin, Rodriguez, 
with a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez ran after Garcia and caught up with him at Park Row Avenue and Olive 
Street, police said. Rodriguez was then knocked down and kicked in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said three other men are suspected of involvement in the assault: 
19-year-old Jose Cruz and 34-year-old Augustine Munoz, who are both in Ventura 
County Jail, and Guadalupe Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still trying to locate Garcia and Guadalupe Munoz, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz and Augustine Munoz are scheduled to be arraigned today at 1:30 p.m. in 
Ventura County Municipal Court. MAIA DAVIS

SCHILLO'S ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD CRITICIZED; SUPERVISOR'S RACE: OPPONENTS CITE 
HIS SUPPORT OF THE DOS VIENTOS PROJECT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT. BUT BUSINESSMAN 
DEFENDS SELF AS 'A MODERATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists who support county supervisorial candidate Trudi Loh joined 
Monday to denounce opponent Frank Schillo's record on development issues and 
his attempt to campaign as a protector of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Schillo has not been a friend of the environment in terms of land-use," 
said Cassandra Auerbach, a member of the Conejo Valley chapter of the Sierra 
Club. "Whatever else he may say, he hasn't seen a development he didn't like." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who attended a news conference near rolling hills soon to be converted 
to the Dos Vientos housing project criticized Schillo for his support of that 
2,350-house development. He also drew fire for endorsing a proposed landfill at 
Weldon Canyon near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo said in an interview that Loh and her supporters have distorted 
his record on development issues, and that he has fought to manage growth in 
Thousand Oaks during his 10 years on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trudi Loh has never spoken out for or against a single development in the 
city in the last 12 years," Schillo said. "What kind of environmentalist is 
she?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said that Dos Vientos was initially slated for 3,000 houses, but that 
the project was scaled back. He also noted that the developer agreed to 
preserve 1,300 acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, however, Loh and her supporters said that the Dos 
Vientos site had been planned for much less construction until the city changed 
the zoning to allow more houses. They also said that the project would cause 
major smog and traffic problems, while opening up the area to more growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Save Open Space believes that no Ventura County open space or greenbelts will 
be safe under Frank Schillo," said Mary Wiesbrock, president of the 
Agoura-based environmental group that was instrumental in helping to elect 
Supervisor Maria VanderKolk in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk decided not to seek another term in the 2nd District, an area 
covering most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pleased to have the endorsement of Save Open Space and other 
environmental organizations, Loh stressed that she is not anti-development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly we need to have a good balance," said Loh, an attorney. "We need to 
have good, healthy economic growth. And we need to preserve the things that 
make Ventura County unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who participated in Monday's news conference were Sue Boecker, a 
Ventura County planning commissioner; Brad Childs, executive director of the 
Wilderness Institute; Lu Setnicka, a spokeswoman for Patagonia, and Michael 
Shapiro, a member of an Ojai-based environmental group opposed to the Weldon 
Canyon landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Setnicka and Shapiro applauded Loh's position against the dump. The candidate 
wants the county to explore other alternatives for disposing of trash, possibly 
even shipping it elsewhere by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trudi is a candidate thinking and acting upon the very issues that directly 
affect our quality of life in this county," Setnicka said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo said that if the county's trash is shipped by rail, trash rates in 
Thousand Oaks will soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she opposes the Weldon Canyon dump out of concern that the operator 
will import trash from such places as Los Angeles, a move that could lead to a 
parade of trash trucks rolling through Thousand Oaks. Loh said that a new dump 
would also make it more difficult to attract businesses because it would add to 
the county's already serious smog problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Auerbach criticized a recent Schillo flyer that features a color 
picture of the candidate standing with a group of Sierra Club hikers in an open 
field off Hampshire Road at the east end of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer states that Schillo's "goals are to enact legislation to control 
development, provide for more open space and reinforce better waste management, 
making Ventura County one of the best places to live and work in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Auerbach and others described the flyer as "a fraud," saying it misrepresented 
Schillo's record on development. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said everything stated in the flyer is accurate, including statements 
that he was instrumental in preserving thousands of acres of open space.

PROBST DONATES $16,000 TO 2 COUNCIL CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Millionaire businessman Charles E. Probst on Monday donated $16,000 to two 
Thousand Oaks City Council candidates with pro-business platforms, financing a 
last-minute blitz of cable television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial services manager Michael Friedman said he received a $10,000 check 
from Probst. And homicide detective Michael Markey reported a $6,000 campaign 
contribution from the North Ranch telecommunications executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst earned a measure of notoriety last month when he donated $2 million to 
the Civic Arts Plaza. Then, just one week after his record-setting donation, 
Probst persuaded a majority of council members to approve a controversial plan 
to landscape his estate in violation of city policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Friedman and Markey spoke in favor of Probst's landscape plan at the 
public hearing in early October. But neither candidate has ever met the 
mysterious businessman who boosted their campaigns, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock, really," said Markey, who had collected only about $8,000 
before Probst's gift. "I don't even know the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Probst could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 While both candidates welcomed the infusion of cash, Friedman worried that the 
donation might tar him as a special-interest puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman had financed his aggressive campaign in large part with a $13,000 
contribution from car dealers at the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I called some friends today to ask how I should deal with it, and they said 
to wear it with a badge of honor," Friedman said. "Well, that's a great slogan, 
but how does it look to Joe and Mary Six-Pack, who are making $30,000 a year, 
when this kid gets $10,000 out of nowhere?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the 27-year-old Friedman decided to "accept (the money) with all 
enthusiasm," especially since his campaign treasury is down to $66. He has 
spent much of his money running two ads on cable television: one introducing 
himself at a family picnic and the other fiercely denouncing slow-growth 
incumbent Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 To help her rebut such attacks, Zeanah's husband, James, loaned $10,000 to her 
campaign Monday, nearly doubling her contributions. Zeanah said she would use 
the money to mail a flyer to registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing a distinction between her husband's loan and Probst's gifts, Zeanah 
condemned her opponents for accepting "special-interest money" that she 
insisted comes with strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sit back and allow special interests and their candidates to 
buy the election, which is what they're trying to do," she said.

ELECTIONS / RANCHO SIMI PARK DISTRICT; ARMING RANGERS EMERGES AS DOMINANT ISSUE 
IN RACE; CAMPAIGN: FIVE CANDIDATES FOR TWO SEATS ARE SPLIT ON THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER GUNS SHOULD BE CARRIED ON PATROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Whether Simi Valley park rangers should carry guns has become one of the key 
issues in a race among five candidates for two at-large seats on the Rancho 
Simi Recreation and Park District board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The park district, which includes Simi Valley and Oak Park, is in the process 
of reviewing a request from rangers that they be equipped with weapons. The 
final decision will probably not be made until after the two top vote-getters 
in the Nov. 8 election are sworn into office in December, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, first-time candidate Gene Hostetler is making safety in the 
parks -- and arming the rangers -- the cornerstone of his aggressive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should carry guns," said Hostetler, 45, a detective with the Simi Valley 
Police Department. "When you're working in that kind of job, you can come upon 
the same kind of stuff that police officers do." 
</P>
<P>
 But park board member James Meredith, a retired mail clerk who is running for 
his fourth term, said the issue of safety has been exaggerated by Hostetler and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had over 1,200,000 visits from people in our parks during 1993," Meredith, 
64, said. "There were only 45 arrests in our park. This year, up until October, 
there were 40 arrests. People are talking about how we are having Los Angeles 
park problems. That is not true at all." 
</P>
<P>
 According to park records, there were five weapons violations in Simi Valley 
parks from January to June, including incidents with BB guns, pellet guns and 
knives. Four people were arrested on felony charges during the same period in 
Simi Valley, one person in Oak Park. There were 30 narcotics violations and 
arrests as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Johnson, a 45-year-old high school math teacher who is running for his 
second term on the board, called the safety issue overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parks are still very, very safe," Johnson said. "Everybody would like to 
be able to go out and take a walk at midnight, but I think those days are 30 
years gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he is not opposed to arming the rangers, all three of whom are 
retired Los Angeles Police Department officers, but he has reservations about 
establishing a policy that may be expensive to maintain in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little leery of arming all the rangers down the line," Johnson said. 
"The rangers that we have right now have a combined 100 years of service with 
the LAPD. I don't have a problem with these rangers carrying weapons. But what 
are we going to do with the next set?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although some state and federal rangers in the county are armed, no other 
special district, city or county park rangers carry weapons at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Meredith and Johnson said their campaigns focus more on how the district 
will face its ongoing budget crisis. State cuts from special districts have 
sliced into Rancho Simi's operating budget over the last few years, and both 
incumbents said they fear more cuts are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major issue is the budget that Sacramento keeps eroding from the 
district," Johnson said. "They have left us at a bare-bones minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has an operating budget of $8.5 million for 1994-95, but Meredith 
said that figure has been somewhat inflated by federal relief money following 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. Both men defended the way the district has handled its 
fiscal crisis -- including laying off 17 workers in the past two years -- 
against criticism from the three other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing the best we can," Meredith said. "You can't get blood out of a 
turnip." 
</P>
<P>
 He proposes leasing out more of the district's facilities, including 
concession stands the park shut down last year due to the cuts and the 
equestrian center on Royal Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he also favors leasing out more of the district's vast holdings 
in Simi Valley and Oak Park, which include 2,319 acres of public parkland. He 
said leasing local golf courses to private enterprise had saved the district 
$686,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more agreements with private enterprise to lease our land," he said. 
"Maybe we should build another golf course. We have the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he thought the race will be a tight one, with Hostetler 
presenting a challenge because he has strong name recognition in the community. 
Hostetler organized softball games between Simi Valley and South-Central Los 
Angeles residents following the 1992 riots. He has also been an umpire and 
coach for the district's softball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hostetler has actively campaigned, raising several thousand dollars and 
planting signs around the city, two other district novices are hoping to get 
elected without campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the people want it, they are going to elect me," said Teoman Yatman, 62, a 
computer consultant who has lived in Simi Valley for about 18 months. "I don't 
want to spend the money. If I am going to get a job that pays me $10 a day, I 
don't want to spend $2,000 to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yatman said he was compelled to run for office because he wants to give 
something back to the community, and the park district seemed like a good place 
to start. He has never run for public office before. He said he hopes to oust 
an incumbent because the district needs fresh faces and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yatman, who also favors arming the park rangers, said he would like to step up 
park fund-raising by organizing petting zoos, concerts, Western events and 
cultural fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Ostrander, 46, a full-time student in commercial and computer graphics 
at West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland Hills, is also running a 
low-profile campaign. He said he chose not to post signs because they are 
unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They add to the clutter of the community," Ostrander said. "And I'm not sure 
how effective they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrander was on the county Parks and Harbor Commission from 1979 to 1983. He 
unsuccessfully ran for Moorpark City Council in 1983. He said he has no 
problems with the current board, but he, too, wanted to make a contribution to 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park district the way it is is probably the best in Ventura County," 
Ostrander said. "With my participation, I could help keep it the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrander favors arming park rangers and advertising the district's facilities 
outside the region to boost fund raising.

 Re "Can We Deny Aid to the Poor?" by Brian D. Johnston, Oct. 27: Amen! It is 
an incredible experience being one of the 37 million uninsured nationally, 5 
million statewide and 2.6 million locally. In perspective one out of six people 
you meet is uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I had to take an out-of-state visiting relative to a nearby 
hospital's emergency room. Since she did not have any insurance, the hospital 
would not admit her. I had to deposit $3,500 up front before the hospital would 
even allow the doctors to look at her. While all this haggling was going on, 
she was experiencing excruciating pain. We ought to do something about this 
issue since tomorrow we can be one of the above statistics.

JUDGE TO ALLOW RE-ENACTMENT OF WESTLAKE NURSE'S KILLING; TRIAL: ONE RULING ON 
DEFENSE MOTIONS FAVORS THOUSAND OAKS DEFENDANT: SLAYING CANNOT BE CALLED 
'EXECUTION' BEFORE JURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of his murder trial, Mark Scott Thornton of Thousand Oaks was hit 
with a series of unfavorable court rulings Monday, including one that allows 
prosecutors to use a controversial photo re-enactment of Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the re-enactment, photos show the victim being shot once in the chest and 
twice in the back after her attacker orders her to kneel in front of him, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two legal scholars, contacted after the ruling in Ventura County Superior 
Court, said it is unusual for prosecutors to re-enact crimes with still 
photographs, rather than the more commonly used videotapes or computer 
simulations. 
</P>
<P>
 With still pictures, "I would be concerned whether any individual photograph 
would be misleading," said Southwestern University of Law professor Myrna 
Raeder. 
</P>
<P>
 Raeder and Laurie L. Levinson, a Loyola University law professor, said jurors 
could easily take such pictures out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 But Levinson said a re-enactment based on still photographs might actually be 
less prejudicial to a defendant's case than videotape -- which, she said, 
jurors can sometimes put too much faith in. "A videotape can be be too 
TV-like," Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Thornton lawyer Howard J. Asher questioned whether prosecutors 
could accurately piece together any credible re-enactment of the O'Sullivan 
murder, since there were no witnesses to the Sept. 14, 1993, shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basing it on a theory that in large part is speculation as to how 
Kellie O'Sullivan died," Asher said. "I think there is no solid basis for it. 
Therefore, there is a danger of it being misused by the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton kidnaped the 34-year-old O'Sullivan in broad daylight 
and took her to the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles County, where she was 
fatally shot. He then stole her car, abducted his teen-age girlfriend and shot 
at the girl's mother, they said. His jury trial begins with opening statements 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris, lead prosecutor on the case, declined to 
discuss the re-enactment outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said the Thornton trial will not 
be the first time that local prosecutors have used still photographs to 
re-enact a crime for a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that is a cutting-edge kind of technology that is being used 
more and more in court by both sides," said McGee, declining to answer specific 
questions about the Thornton prosecution. "It's obvious that pictures make a 
case more understandable. And people relate to things they see on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ruling on the photo re-enactment, McGrath made three other 
decisions on last-minute defense motions in the Thornton case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge denied a motion to keep from the jury incriminating statements 
Thornton's grandmother made about her grandson. The judge also denied a defense 
motion that would have prohibited a probation officer from testifying about 
Thornton's criminal record as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lone victory Monday for the defense, the judge instructed prosecutors 
not to refer to O'Sullivan's slaying in front of the jury as an "execution." 
</P>
<P>
 On the re-enactment matter, Asher argued that the only evidence supporting the 
prosecution's depiction of the killing "is the angle of the bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he argued that without other evidence, such as a witness to the killing, 
the re-enactment lacks any foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley, however, said the re-enactment would 
only be a guide for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't want us to present our evidence to the jury, that's what it 
boils down to," Frawley told Judge McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing with Frawley, McGrath said, "I think there is sufficient evidence to 
support the people's theory."

OFFICIALS PLAN TO EASE JAMS IN CIVIC ARTS PLAZA PARKING LOT; TRAFFIC: GARAGE 
GRIDLOCK AFTER WELL-ATTENDED EVENTS PROMPTS THOUSAND OAKS TO REVAMP THE EXIT 
SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dismayed by parking-garage gridlock, Thousand Oaks officials on Monday drafted 
a plan for improving traffic flow at the Civic Arts Plaza by moving cars to 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket-holders have complained of waiting up to 40 minutes to exit the parking 
structure after sellout shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But by this weekend, cars should be able to exit the five-story parking garage 
more smoothly, and the aggravating bottleneck should ease, theater director Tom 
Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to create two exit lanes from the parking garage, so cars can 
wind through the structure more rapidly, Mitze said. Engineers also plan to 
reprogram the traffic signal at the entrance of the Civic Arts Plaza to allow 
more cars to turn onto Thousand Oaks Boulevard in a single green-light cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should hopefully cut the (wait) time in half by this weekend," Mitze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic jams inside the parking garage have occurred mainly after packed 
shows, ranging from the children's drama "Beauty and the Beast" to rhythm and 
blues artist Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent performance by Hal Holbrook in "Mark Twain Tonight," patron 
Betsy Chess said it seemed as though all 1,800 ticket-holders simultaneously 
swarmed up the stairs of the parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got in our car, got in line -- and didn't move for at least 20 minutes," 
said Chess, the interim executive director of the Ventura County Symphony. "I 
was glad I didn't have claustrophobia." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure such delays do not deter people from attending her symphony's 
shows, Chess has chartered five buses to shuttle subscribers from various parts 
of the county. "We wanted to make it as easy as possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials, too, want to make it as easy as possible -- even for 
people who choose to drive their own cars and pay a $4 parking fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be fine-tuned over the next several months, and we'll see 
major improvements," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their anti-gridlock plan, Thousand Oaks officials will open up an 
outdoor lot behind the Probst Auditorium, near the loading dock. When finished, 
the lot will hold up to 60 cars, Mitze estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering yet another option, a private developer may build a 200-space 
commercial lot across the street from the Civic Arts Plaza, Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious parking crunch could occur in the future if the 11-acre site 
next to the performing arts center is developed, as planned, into a hotel, 
movie theater, shopping plaza or museum. Now vacant, that site is being used to 
handle overflow parking for performers' cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might get a little hairy if you put a movie theater in next-door -- a big 
old 20-plex with a couple of sold-out shows might create a problem," said Larry 
Janss, a member of the theater's Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitze said he believes the garage will have enough spaces to accommodate 
the musicians, dancers and actors as well as the ticket-holders. The garage's 
roof, for example, holds dozens of spots that so far have never been used. 
</P>
<P>
 As the parking staff works out the kinks and learns to move traffic smoothly, 
Janss asked his fellow theatergoers to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relative to Thousand Oaks jams, it's hellacious," he said, "but relative to 
the rest of the world, it's just a minor slow-up."

DAMAGED STORES GIVEN DEADLINE FOR CLEANUP; SIMI VALLEY: OWNERS OF 
QUAKE-DEVASTATED PIC 'N' SAVE AND SEARS OUTLET HAVE UNTIL JAN. 17. COUNCIL 
OFFERS REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS TO HELP REPAIR OR TEAR DOWN THE STRUCTURES.

<P>
 The owners of two Simi Valley stores ravaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake have 
until one year after the devastating event to clean up their property, the City 
Council decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, responding to complaints from neighbors that the vacant Pic 'N' 
Save and Sears Outlet on Tapo Street are eyesores that attract transients, 
agreed to help the landlords repair or tear down their properties as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd all like to see this problem taken care of," Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "We don't want to see those buildings falling down and empty for too much 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Both buildings were red-tagged after the quake, indicating major damage that 
includes collapsed roofs and cracked walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked the property owners to board up broken windows and offered 
to give them city redevelopment money to help with the cost of renovating or 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollars are available," Councilman Bill Davis said. "If they want to come 
in and work with the city, I'm sure we would be happy to work with them." 
</P>

 Sears is hoping to tear down its aging 30,000-square-foot center and replace 
it with a new building at the site, said part-owner Lawrence Morse, a Beverly 
Hills accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that can happen, the company had hoped to find an anchor tenant to join 
them on the Tapo Street property, a search that has proved fruitless. Sears has 
also been waiting to hear whether the neighboring Pic 'N' Save would share the 
cost of demolishing the buildings, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Pic 'N' Save officials have announced plans to sell their store and 
relocate to another site in the city. Sears is considering buying the property, 
Morse said, but would not do so unless it could first find tenants willing to 
locate there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very anxious to do something with this property, and we're working hard 
to make something happen," Morse said. "Any help the city can give is certainly 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to give the landlords until Jan. 17, 1995, and then 
re-evaluate progress on the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is reasonable to give them a full year before we do anything 
drastic, like take legal action," Davis said. "If January rolls around and 
nothing's been done, well that's another story." 
</P>
<P>
 The city could choose to condemn the buildings and impose fines if they 
determine the property owners have not taken sufficient action. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, nearby resident Eleanor Kieffer said she is concerned about 
children and transients breaking through the chain-link fence that surrounds 
the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I passed by there yesterday and somebody had taken a wire cutter and broke 
the locks off," Kieffer said. "It isn't safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he shares residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Squatters are getting in there, and as its starts getting cold, they're going 
to start making little fires to warm themselves," Stratton said. "The next 
thing you get is a raging inferno, which is something I think we'd all like to 
avoid."

 PUFFING ALONG: The Board of Supervisors today will approve another $1 
million-plus in state cigarette tax money for local tobacco prevention programs 
the next two years. But that's only half what was allocated the last two-year 
period. . . . Marilyn Cowan, the county's tobacco control coordinator, can 
point to some impressive results: her office helped more than 800 work sites 
set up anti-smoking rules. But it's no easy job, says Cowan: "It's difficult to 
impact an ingrained habit." 
</P>
<P>
 THANKS FOR MEMORY: Inc. magazine this month put out its list of the 500 
fastest growing private companies, and six from Orange County made the list. 
Top among them: Tectrik Fitness Equipment of Irvine, at No. 22, and Viking 
Components of Laguna Hills, at No. 126. . . . How prestigious is it to make the 
list? Viking, a memory upgrade computer company, bought 1,000 copies of the 
magazine to send to clients, each with a sticker saying "Thanks" from No. 126. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE LOOP? President Clinton admitted surprise at a children's Town Hall 
meeting last year that many Native American tribes are not officially 
recognized. He learned a lot more about it this past weekend. . . . David 
Belardes, tribal chief of the Juaneno band of Mission Indians from South Orange 
County, was part of a group lobbying at the White House for tribal recognition. 
"We just want to be part of the loop," Belardes says. "We want our sovereignty 
honored."

 LEARNING TO RIDE: Chapman University junior Richard Hagmann, who has two good 
legs, found out in his first wheelchair ride last year that getting around the 
campus wasn't that easy. "This school isn't as accessible as it needs to be for 
wheelchairs," he says. . . . Students and faculty will be back at it Wednesday, 
riding wheelchairs or walking on crutches, to draw attention to "Differently 
Abled Awareness Week." Says Hagmann: "We want people to see and feel what it 
would be like to be differently abled for one day."

 LENO SURGES: Look out Dave. For the first time in more than a year, ratings 
for "The Tonight Show" starring Jay Leno are catching up to "Late Show With 
David Letterman." (D1) Leno, who had been a solid No. 2 behind Letterman, 
recently has been beating Letterman in such major markets as Los Angeles and 
Chicago. Overall, in ratings two weeks ago, they tied, which is seen as a 
victory for the underdog at NBC in Burbank. . . . "Leno has come into his own," 
says one observer. "The pressures are off. He's more comfortable and doesn't 
feel there's a gun against his head."

 HIGH TIMES: After a long dry spell, profits are up in the Valley banking 
industry, hard hit by the double whammy of the recession and January's 
earthquake (Valley Business, Page 10). . . . Only a year ago, Glendale Federal 
Bank was on the verge of seizure by federal regulators. Now, after major 
restructuring, the S&L is back in the black, reporting third-quarter earnings 
of $9.37 million.

 FIRST STEP: Meilen Tu, a 16-year-old from Northridge, makes her professional 
tennis debut today in a tournament in Oakland. . . . Tu, a former Granada Hills 
High student who is in a home-study program, won two major junior tournaments 
this summer. She faces Meredith McGrath in today's first round. McGrath, of 
Midland, Mich., is currently ranked 35th on the tour. . . . Tu debuts at No. 
636.

 DEADLY VAPORS: It's flu season again, but not all the flu-like symptoms may be 
coming from the bug, say Gas. Co. officials (Valley Business, Page 11). . . . 
The Northridge quake knocked loose many furnaces and other appliances, causing 
the release of carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas that can kill. 
"The effect of the gas makes you like you're drugged," said Lawrence Marshall, 
the father of a 10-year-old boy who was slowly poisoned by the gas. You can 
call the Gas Co. for a free check-up of household gas appliances. Jeannette

PACKERS WIN THE OLD WAY; PRO FOOTBALL: WEATHER IS NO OBSTACLE AS GREEN BAY 
TROUNCES THE BEARS, 33-6, IN THE RAIN AT SOLDIER FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Upon the starched white shirt of the modern NFL Monday night, there was 
splattered a hunk of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention grass stains. Midfield paint stains. Dirty water stains. And 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, two teams wearing throwback uniforms participated in a throwback 
game. The 1937 Green Bay Packers defeated the 1925 Chicago Bears, 33-6. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe it was anybody else out there in steady, pouring rain, 
30-degree temperatures and 46-m.p.h. winds . . . then you need to brush up on 
your football history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in the stands, mud on the field, guys were saying it was like we were 
all kids playing in the park," said Guy McIntyre, Packer guard. "Tonight was 
all football, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was all Packers, and all old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Packer quarterback Brett Favre not completing a pass until midway 
through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Favre scoring the Packers' second touchdown in the first half on a 
36-yard bootleg run. In it, he directed blockers, avoided grasping defenders 
and dived over Bear Jeremy Lincoln at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I made a run like that was against North Bay in fifth grade," 
Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all that, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bryce Paup, a 250-pound Packer linebacker, catching as many passes from 
Bear quarterback Erik Kramer in the first half as any Bear receiver -- two. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Paup rumbling for 37 yards with those two interceptions, thwarting the 
Bears' two best drives of the half, helping the Packers to a 14-0 lead they 
never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Paup shivering uncontrollably during a postgame interview, 
speaking through chattering teeth as he sat in a once-white jersey that was 
dark brown and stinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This . . . was . . . a . . . must-win . . . game . . . for . . . us," Paup 
said of his team, which pulled even with the Central Division Bears at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all that, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 By the third quarter, you couldn't see Bear Raymont Harris' number 29 because 
of the mud. You couldn't see Packer John Jurkovic's name . 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't the worst playing conditions in the 147 games between these 
teams, it was at least the worst in the last 97. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it snow, I've seen it colder, but I've never seen it as bad as 
this," said Packer publicist Lee Remmel, who has seen the last 97 games in the 
NFL's oldest rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Favre, a Mississippi native: "It was like Hurricane Camille, only 80 
degrees colder." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all that, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bear punter Chris Gardocki kicking a seven-yard punt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Packer kicker Chris Jacke stumbling on a kickoff, failing to even touch 
the ball while his offside teammates raced downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Packer kick returner Charles Jordan fumbling the opening kickoff not 
because he couldn't catch, but because he couldn't run. As he leaned out for 
the ball, his cleats stuck in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like quicksand out there," said Packer defensive end Sean Jones. "This 
was Central Division football at its best." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bears at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
 They committed five turnovers while the Packers committed none. They used 
Kramer in the first half, Steve Walsh in the second half, and neither looked 
good enough to beat the Packers on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their fans quit, leaving Soldier Field in droves as early as the second 
quarter. Considering there were only 47,381 at the outset -- there were 19,563 
no-shows -- the stadium was nearly empty by the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remained, it seemed, were several hundred screaming, soaked Packer 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey Bears," shouted one rotund, green-shirted man whose Halloween makeup had 
long since streamed down his cheeks. "Trick or treat!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt got even. With six seconds remaining in the game 
and the rain turning to sleet, he called time out. The fans cursed even louder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like tonight, we were all one heartbeat," said Edgar Bennett of the 
maligned Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett rushed for 105 yards and scored three touchdowns as he helped his team 
show the football world that its fortunes, like always, are turning with the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent a message to the rest of the league tonight that we are not just 
going to lie down and die," said Sean Jones, whose team, along with the Bears, 
trails the division-leading Minnesota Vikings by two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for only the Packers to get closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears, meanwhile, touched hearts only at halftime, when the numbers of 
Gale Sayers (40) and Dick Butkus (51) were retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were dressed in garbage bags that had nothing to do with Halloween. 
And Butkus proved once again that he is the master of the unexpected, this time 
by choking back tears during an acceptance speech in which he claimed that 
George Halas was "up there somewhere, watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching? Heck, he was coaching.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; COUGAR TACKLES WILL BE SOLID CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's challenge Saturday at Washington State is to neutralize what many are 
calling the Pac-10's best pair of defensive tackles, Chad Eaton (6-5, 285) and 
Don Sasa (6-4, 300). 
</P>
<P>
 Sasa, a Samoan-born senior from Long Beach Poly High, is the surprise in 
Washington State's Pacific 10-leading defensive unit, Cougar defensive 
coordinator Bill Doba said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sasa is the surprise," he said. "He stayed in Pullman all summer and lifted 
weights, got his bench press over 400 pounds, and got in great shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, he was not in good shape and had to take a play off now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton and Sasa, Doba said, are so effective at flushing quarterbacks that 
Washington State hasn't had to blitz as often as he'd planned before the 
season. WSU defensive end DeWayne Patterson leads the conference in sacks with 
12.5. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the best pair of (defensive) tackles in the conference," said USC 
defensive coordinator Don Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not their size -- you can find 290s anywhere -- it's their 
explosiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 USC offensive line coach Mike Barry said guards Chris Brymer, Kyle Ramsay and 
Kris Pollack will be asked to slow Eaton and Sasa. Brymer, however, was limping 
on a sprained ankle in practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of another guard, onetime starter Phalen Pounds, isn't 
certain. He's been recovering from an arthroscopic knee procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' record against Washington State, 45-5-4, is USC's best against 
any Pac-10 school. USC has won 22 of the last 23 meetings. . . . Saturday's 
12:30 game will be televised by ABC. EARL GUSTKEY

NEWSWIRE: BUTCH REYNOLDS LOSES HIS SUPREME COURT BID

<TEXT>
<P>
 Track star Butch Reynolds, who was suspended for nearly 2 1/2 years after 
failing a drug test, lost his Supreme Court bid Monday to collect $27.4 million 
from the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the organization that 
barred him. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a gold and silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics, was suspended by 
the IAAF in August 1990. The IAAF said Reynolds tested positive for steroids at 
a meet in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400 meters, contended the test was 
faulty, and the U.S. track and field governing body exonerated him. But an IAAF 
arbitration panel ruled in 1992 in London that the drug test was valid. The 
panel upheld Reynolds' suspension, preventing him from competing at the 
Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who denies ever taking steroids, sued the IAAF in federal court in 
Columbus, Ohio, and the judge in that suit ordered the IAAF to pay $27.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award last May, saying the 
judge lacked authority to act because the case involved events that occurred in 
Europe and were not aimed at Ohio. The Supreme Court upheld that decision.

Puerto Rico and Venezuela, according to a copy of the draft proposal obtained 
by the Associated Press. The league, whose formation will be announced at a 
news conference today in New York, would start in 1996 with 10 to 12 teams each 
playing 154 games, according to the draft. Los Angeles and Riverside-San 
Bernardino are among possible sites.

 Groups from St. Petersburg, Fla., and Phoenix and two from northern Virginia 
will make formal presentations today to the baseball owners' expansion 
committee in Chicago. Two new franchises are expected to be added to the major

 Try to imagine what it would be like if the NFL championship were decided by 
polls instead of playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My midseason top-10 rankings: 1. Dallas, 2. San Diego, 3. San Francisco, 4. 
Miami, 5. Minnesota, 6. Philadelphia, 7. Buffalo, 8. Kansas City, 9. Cleveland, 
10. Pittsburgh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A big day for voters would be Nov. 13, when the Cowboys play the 49ers at 
Candlestick Park. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, 6-2, are ranked no higher than ninth because of a soft schedule. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson believes quarterback is the most important and neglected 
position in pro football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He says a lot of passers don't receive enough instruction. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey people will tell you the same thing about goaltenders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC West has the best record in the NFL, 22-18, and the AFC Central the 
worst, 12-20. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At this early date, San Diego can boast strong candidates for most valuable 
player, Stan Humphries; best defensive player, Junior Seau; coach of the year, 
Bobby Ross; and executive of the year, Bobby Beathard. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see how the Chargers do at Atlanta and Kansas City 
the next couple of weeks if Humphries can't play because of a dislocation of 
the elbow on his non-throwing arm and Gale Gilbert is the quarterback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With the emergence of Rob Frederickson and the improved play of "Hundred-Yard" 
Harvey Williams, the Raiders' decision to select a linebacker instead of a 
running back in the first round of the draft is looking better. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only the Washington Redskins and Indianapolis Colts have byes remaining, those 
on Nov. 13. . . . The Miami Dolphins' defense has become sound enough that they 
can beat New England on a day when Dan Marino throws for only 198 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bert Emanuel, the rookie wide receiver who is catching a lot of passes for the 
Atlanta Falcons, was a seldom-used quarterback for UCLA in 1990 behind Tommy 
Maddox. Emanuel then transferred to Rice, where he became an all-Southwest 
Conference quarterback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Both New York teams lost by the uncommon score of 28-25 Sunday, the Jets to 
Indianapolis and the Giants to Detroit in overtime. . . .

 Washington State, which defeated UCLA and plays USC Saturday, has never swept 
the Bruins and Trojans. . . .

 For the game in Pullman, Wa., the Trojans will fly into Lewistown, Ida., and 
bunk in Moscow, Ida. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC is the only team to have beaten Utah in the last 11 games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska and Penn State, Nos. 1 and 1A in the polls, won't meet this year. But 
they did play every year from 1979-83, the Huskers having a 3-2 edge. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Why did ESPN conduct its college football pregame program from outside 
Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Neb., last Saturday before televising the 
Michigan-Wisconsin game? Nebraska-Colorado was shown on ABC, and Cap Cities 
owns both networks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My idea of a balanced attack is Baylor rushing for 328 yards and passing for 
328 in a 52-13 victory over Houston. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson is bullish on freshman quarterback Scott Covington 
from Dana Hills. He's sitting out this year, but watch for him in 1995 against 
UCLA at the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 James Toney, who apparently is having weight problems, has closed his West 
Hollywood workouts to everyone, including the media. I presume that his bout 
against Roy Jones Jr. in Las Vegas on Nov. 18 will be open to the public. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Richard Mandella hopes his 44th birthday will be the least of his 
reasons to celebrate Saturday. Mandella will send out two horses, Best Pal and 
Soul Of The Matter, in the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs 
that day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Soviet Problem isn't favored in the Sprint, it will be the first time in 
her 18-race career. Among horses who were favored in every start were Native 
Dancer and Seattle Slew. . . . The highest percentage rider among regulars in 
Cup history, Patrick Valenzuela, will be absent this year because of personal 
problems. He has won six times in 32 races. . . .

 Oak Tree has scheduled seven live races surrounding the telecast of the Cup 
races, the first post at 9:15 a.m. and the nightcap at 4:30 p.m. . . .

 Greg Norman, who got a bar bill of $18,413.60 after buying drinks in 
celebration of a hole in one, can afford to pay it. For finishing in a tie for

 After a victory over Stanford that ended a six-game losing streak, UCLA has a 
week off, with practices scheduled today, Wednesday and Thursday and recruiting 
all week. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA assistants scattered Monday to take a look at high school prospects and 
were to meet today.Some might leave again after that because Coach Terry 
Donahue is trying to simultaneously conduct a week of practice and recruiting. 
</P>

 The Bruins begin preparation in earnest on Monday for the Arizona State game 
Nov. 12 at Phoenix.

 Left guard James Christensen suffered a sprained ligament in his left knee in 
Saturday's game against Stanford. He has been hobbled by a partially torn 
ligament in the same knee that forced him to miss three games and play only 
part of another. 
</P>
<P>
 They are different ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed the final nine regular season games and the Rose Bowl last season 
because of ligament problems in the same knee and was granted a medical 
hardship redshirt season.

 Michigan State President Peter McPherson has ordered the university to appoint 
an independent co-investigator to look into charges of NCAA violations by the 
football team. The Lansing State Journal reported that a former player, 
Roosevelt Wagner, alleged regular payments to players from boosters and agents 
and changes to athletes' grades to keep them eligible to play. "The whole 
program is dirty," Wagner told the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Perles, already under fire for the Spartans' record of 3-5 
overall and 2-3 in the Big Ten, said he doubts Wagner's allegations. "What 
happened was, I threw him off the team," Perles said.

 The San Diego Chargers might not know until shortly before kickoff on Sunday 
whether quarterback Stan Humphries will be the starter, the backup or the 
inactive third-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries dislocated his left (non-throwing) elbow early in the third quarter 
of Sunday's 35-15 home victory over the Seattle Seahawks. His left arm was in a 
sling on Monday and there was quite a bit of swelling, Coach Bobby Ross said. 
</P>

<P>
 Cleveland Browns quarterback Vinny Testaverde will sit out Sunday's game 
against New England after two separate head injuries forced him to leave the 
last two games prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde blacked out briefly in the 26-14 loss at Denver on Sunday on a sack 
on the sixth play of the game. He remained in the game for four more series 
before being replaced by Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 One week earlier, Testaverde sustained a slight concussion when he was sacked 
by Cincinnati's Dan Wilkinson, also during the first series of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no estimate on when Testaverde will return. 
</P>

 New York Jet free safety Ronnie Lott, continuing his vigorous defense of 
teammate Donald Evans, accused referee Bernie Kukar of shoving Evans in the 
back during the heated exchange late in Sunday's 28-25 loss to the Indianapolis 
Colts. Lott was so upset that he said Kukar and the NFL owe letters of apology 
to Evans, who was ejected after incurring two unsportsmanlike-conduct penalties 
with 1:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jet Coach) Pete (Carroll) has said we shouldn't address certain things, but 
I'm going to address it," Lott said. "The NFL can fine me, but I think it's 
uncalled for when a referee pushes a person in the back who's walking away from 
an incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was triggered when, with the Colts running out the clock, Evans 
was penalized for encroachment. Evans bumped into center Kirk Lowdermilk, 
setting off a war of words. Evans argued with Kukar, resulting in the first 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. He became upset after the alleged push, 
resulting in the second penalty and the ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Director of officiating Jerry Seeman reviewed the incident and "determined the 
situation was properly handled by the referee," league spokesman Greg Aiello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Norv Turner said Gus Frerotte will remain the Redskins' starting 
quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers, leaving top 
draft pick Heath Shuler on the bench for the third week since he sprained his 
ankle against the Arizona Cardinals. . . . Dallas Cowboys tackle Erik Williams, 
injured in a car accident a week ago, underwent knee surgery and will not play 
again this season. "I saw Erik the morning of the accident and I said then he 
wouldn't be back," said Dallas Coach Barry Switzer. "We'll go on without him.". 
. . The Jets have a problem in the backfield. Johnny Johnson has a pulled right 
hamstring. His backup, Anthony Johnson, suffered a separated left shoulder. 
Both are listed as questionable for Sunday's game with Buffalo. If neither can 
play, the Jets are down to two healthy backs, fullbacks Brad Baxter and Richie 
Anderson. They have another fullback, Fred Lester, on the practice squad. . . . 
The Federal Communications Commission ruled that three Mexican television 
stations can continue to televise live Fox network NFL telecasts into parts of 
Southern California and Texas where no local stations air the live games. 
Without the stations, more than one million viewers would not be able to see 
live games, Fox officials said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER GROGGY; CHANDLER LIKELY STARTER

 Eight days after suffering a concussion at New Orleans, quarterback Chris 
Miller still complains of headaches and "isn't clear about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller wouldn't rule himself out from starting Sunday against Denver, and 
Coach Chuck Knox wouldn't commit to starting Miller or Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler appears to have the inside track on the starting job, with Tommy 
Maddox backing him up. Chandler took most of the snaps in practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say right now that Chandler is the starter because he is getting all 
the work," Knox said. "I don't know what the situation would be Wednesday. Our 
doctors are monitoring Miller's progress, and we'll go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller plans to throw in informal workouts today and return to practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I could play," he said. "It'll be the doctor's call to see how I 
react to practice and putting a helmet on. I'm just going day-to-day right now. 
I rode the exercise bike hard and I just feel my equilibrium is a little out of 
whack." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller got the concussion when the back of his head hit the turf when he was 
tackled by New Orleans' Ernest Dixon in the first quarter. He didn't know he 
had a concussion and played the rest of the first half, throwing a touchdown 
pass to Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained of dizziness at halftime, and was replaced by Chandler at the 
start of the second half. Miller said he doesn't remember any of the second 
half of the game. A CAT scan and MRI exam showed no brain damage, but team 
doctors held Miller out of workouts during the bye week for precautionary 
reasons.

re-pulled a hamstring muscle during punt protection drills. Defensive end

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: GLENDORA FEELS THE PRESSURE, LETS OFF STEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Gary Day and his Glendora High football team reached a boiling point 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frustrating weeks in the school's athletic history was capped 
by a controversial finish to a game against Claremont, in which raging emotions 
among fans, players and coaches hit a peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sleep much this weekend," Day acknowledged Monday. "So much is going 
through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora had forfeited five victories for using an ineligible player, so it 
seemed fitting that the Tartans would go out and narrowly lose a pivotal league 
game against Claremont after a questionable call. 
</P>
<P>
 With Claremont leading, 35-28, at Citrus College, Glendora marched down the 
field with a minute to play. Quarterback Jonathan Smith appeared to have put 
his team in a position to win when he connected with Mathis Ward on a 26-yard 
pass with four seconds remaining. The line judge signaled a touchdown, but a 
second official ruled that Ward had caught the ball on the one-yard line then 
fumbled it away. So, he called a touchback and awarded the ball to Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short meeting, the officials denied the touchdown and awarded 
possession to Claremont, which ran out the clock. The Glendora coaching staff 
argued the call to no avail, and angry players had to be restrained. One 
Glendora player was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry fans also got into the act, shouting profanities at the officials, who 
tried to run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section had not received any reports on the incident as of 
Monday. And Glendora officials were not offering any apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there had been no intangibles involved, I might say our actions were a 
little out of line," said Mike LeDuc, Glendora's athletic director. "But 
considering all that happened last week, I think the whole thing is 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems started last Tuesday when Glendora administrators told the 
Southern Section that it would forfeit five victories for using an ineligible 
player. The unidentified player is a sophomore starter who did not meet the 
minimum age participation requirement of 15 during the first six weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartans went from 5-2 and a Division VI contender to 0-7 in minutes. The 
loss to Claremont assured Glendora of missing the playoffs for the first time 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my football team was out of control," said Day, who is in his 
first season at the school. "A week of frustration and anger just hit a point. 
What happened is unfortunate but somewhat understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Claremont Coach Dave Hoover, "That's a tough week on a team. I can 
certainly feel for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik, the quarterback of the moment in the Southland, said he is too 
busy resting these days to enjoy much of his newfound success. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior has led Los Alamitos to dramatic comeback victories the last two 
weeks and the Griffins' unbeaten streak has reached 43 games. Late touchdowns 
against Huntington Beach Edison on Oct. 20 and Anaheim Esperanza last Thursday 
indicate that Feterik is quickly mastering the two-minute drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Esperanza, he moved the offense 83 yards in 48 seconds, capped by a 
30-yard touchdown pass to Stan Guyness, as the Griffins escaped with a 35-32 
victory. He finished the game with 22 completions in 34 attempts for 364 yards 
and three touchdowns as Los Alamitos improved to 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "These last couple of games have really been emotionally draining," Feterik 
said. "I've been spending my weekends lying on the couch and watching football. 
I'm trying to give my body a rest. There's no extra time for partying or 
celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual number of ties in football this season has escalated the debate 
over whether there should be overtime periods. CIF rules do not require teams 
to settle ties, so the matter is left up to each league. Most leagues do not 
use overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock, a new school in the high desert, has tied three of its eight 
games. Coach Jim Bauer is not upset about the team's record, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tiebreaker is emotionally very hard on the kids," he said. "A tie can often 
be a moral victory, and it's better than losing after a hard-fought game." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona Centennial Coach Steve Silberman, whose team is coming off a 23-20 
overtime loss to Norco Friday, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to decide the outcome of a game on the field," he said. "I don't 
know anyone in football who likes ties." 
</P>
<P>
 City Section teams only play overtime if the final game of the regular season 
ends in a tie, but a proposal was recently submitted to broaden that rule to 
all regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 The City and Southern Section do not have tiebreakers for championship games, 
and there are no immediate plans to change that policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Carson was leading Gardena, 7-6, in the second quarter of a City Section game 
at Gardena on Friday night went the power went out. Because the problem was not 
immediately rectified, the game will be resumed from the point it was stopped 
at 2:15 p.m. today. . . . Bloomington continues to be the scoring machine of 
the Southland. The Bruins defeated Yucaipa on Friday, 60-14. It was the sixth 
time they have scored 60 points or more this season. With 512 points in eight 
games, Bloomington should easily break the state's regular-season scoring 
record of 564 set last year by Redding Foothill. . . . Huntington Beach Ocean 
View ended the state's longest losing streak at 36 games with its 20-12 victory 
over Santa Ana on Friday. Times' Top 20 Football Poll

 Perhaps the coaches of the third-ranked Stanford women's soccer team thought 
they were being generous when they agreed to come to town for a game against 
UCLA, a school with a fledging program. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they thought that totally dominating a team would be a nice tuneup for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Think again, Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal players are scratching their heads, pondering the Bruins' stunning 
1-1 overtime tie on Saturday on the North Soccer Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's soccer at UCLA is in its second year of existence, having grown out of 
club roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (14-1-1) has had an NCAA Division I program for 10 years. The 
Cardinal advanced to the NCAA tournament semifinals last season and is one of 
four teams -- the others are Connecticut, North Carolina and Santa Clara -- to 
have appeared in postseason play each of the last four years. Last year, 
Pacific 10 Conference coaches voted Stanford the conference champion, although 
official conference play does not begin until next season. Stanford's only loss 
this season was to second-ranked North Carolina (18-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (10-3-3) is about as young a team as they come. The Bruins start nine 
freshmen and two sophomores, so the tie against such a powerhouse was 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just proves to my girls and to a lot of people that we are a team to 
contend with and we are a growing program," said Joy Fawcett, UCLA's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Fawcett has recruited some talented players. The question is, why did 
they choose UCLA? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask them and the answer is almost always the same: It's the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett, in her second year at UCLA, has been a member of the women's U.S. 
national team since 1987, helping the United States win the World Championship 
in 1991. Before joining the national team, Fawcett, whose maiden name is 
Biefeld, was the Southern Section 4-A Division player of the year for 
Huntington Beach Edison High in 1986. She also is the all-time leading scorer 
for California, where she scored 55 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett's ties to the national team appealed to many recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a lot of experience on the national team and that's something I would 
like to do," said freshman Traci Arkenberg, UCLA's leading scorer with 12 goals 
and four assists. "That is one way of getting there, through her. She brings 
into our practices a lot of the same drills that they do on the national team. 
She treats us as if we are national team players, making everyone compete 
against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett also practices with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very good," Arkenberg said. "It's a lot of fun to play with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretchen Overgaard, UCLA's freshman goalie, said players also chose the new 
program because of the chance to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like an opportunity I couldn't pass up," Overgaard said. "To 
build a program from the grass roots really appealed to me. I could have gone 
to an already nationally recognized school and been just another member. But 
here, I could really contribute and make an impact right away and that was very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Overgaard (8-2-3) has made an impact. Her 0.46 goals-against average ranks 
fifth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 She was highly recruited at Monte Vista High in Danville and took trips to 
several nationally ranked programs. Her decision to attend UCLA was more than a 
little surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big risk," she said, "but I'm glad I took it." 
</P>

 The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team has toiled quietly this season, 
barely making the national rankings at No. 24. But with a balanced attack, the 
Lions, 15-7 overall and 9-1 and in first place in the West Coast Conference, 
have put together quite a season. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four Loyola Marymount players have been selected as the conference player 
of the week this season -- Tate Medley, a sophomore middle blocker; Kim 
Blankinship, a sophomore outside hitter; Mardell Wrensch, a junior middle 
blocker, and Tracy Holman, a freshman setter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loyola Marymount defeated Long Beach State on Sept. 10, its first victory 
over the 49ers since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lions are 11-2 in their last 13 matches. Before a 15-13, 2-15, 15-12, 
2-15, 15-13 loss to Pepperdine on Saturday, Loyola Marymount had won a 
school-record 12 consecutive West Coast Conference matches, dating back to last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Hecox, a senior at UCLA, successfully defended her title at the Pac-10 
cross-country championships Saturday at Palo Alto. Hecox, the only UCLA 
distance runner to win a conference championship, finished the five-kilometer 
course in 17 minutes. Shelley Taylor, a UCLA junior, finished sixth in 17:31. 
On the men's side, Mebrahtom Keflezighi, a UCLA freshman, finished the 
eight-kilometer course in 24:29 to take second place, 25 seconds behind the 
winner, Martin Keino, of Arizona. Keino is the son of two-time Olympic gold 
medalist Kip Keino of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough night for a couple of California volleyball teams Saturday in 
Washington. No. 23 Washington State, 15-8 overall and 7-6 in Pac-10, defeated 
No. 11 USC (15-5, 9-4), 15-9, 18-16, 15-10, and unranked Washington (12-9, 7-6) 
defeated third-ranked UCLA, (22-3, 11-2), 15-13, 3-15, 11-15, 15-12, 15-13. 
"Their programs have been on the rise," said UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski. 
"Washington played very well. We just barely beat them down here and they just 
returned the favor on us. They are a big, powerful hitting team and that type 
of team seems to give us some difficulty this year."

ENGINEERS WORK TO REVIVE SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: WORLD IN MOTION PROGRAM 
INTRODUCES GRADE-SCHOOL STUDENTS NATIONWIDE TO NEW WAYS OF THINKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four fifth-graders argued over how to approach a science project. Steve 
Gadzinsky, an engineer, suggested they write down their options and try each 
one. Several minutes later, the children had stopped arguing and were putting 
each solution to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The work force of the future? That's what big business is betting as it 
supports a program to introduce elementary school students to basic physics 
concepts, teamwork and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 corporations, including General Motors, Allied-Signal, GTE and 
Caterpillar have invested $7 million in the project, developed by the Society 
of Automotive Engineers and known as A World in Motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Over four years, it has quietly become what is believed to be the most 
comprehensive, private collaborative effort in support of public elementary 
school science education. 
</P>
<P>
 Although large companies have traditionally donated large sums to education, 
about 90% has gone to universities, the rest to high schools, experts say. 
Those efforts haven't been enough to build a science-literate population, 
companies find. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are afraid of science and technology," said Lloyd Reuss, former 
General Motors president and a leading force behind the program. "We need to 
get young children to think of science as fun and applicable." 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-on physics and math curriculum is being offered in 12% of public 
elementary schools in all 50 states, according to project director James Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Under World in Motion, 23,000 kits have been distributed free to elementary 
school teachers. They include print and video materials for experiments 
demonstrating the relationships among math, science and technology. Kits 
explore some of the main physics concepts including friction, mass, inertia and 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, a local engineer or scientist participates as a mentor. 
More than 10,000 have already volunteered 50,000 hours of time working with 
teachers and students in the classroom, SAE said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of teachers using the program found 90% believed students had 
better physical science skills, SAE said. Seventy percent thought math skills 
had improved. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the National Science Foundation awarded SAE a $1.8-million grant 
to expand the initiative to middle schools. The association is seeking an 
additional $16 million within six years to widen the reach of the initial 
project and develop the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are companies, usually motivated by bottom-line concerns, spending money 
on elementary school students? 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get kids excited about wanting to learn," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the United States aren't doing a good enough job educating students 
for a world increasingly dependent on sophisticated scientific knowledge and 
rapidly changing technology, according to the National Science Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Most children leave school without a basic understanding of science, 
mathematics or technology. More than 50% don't take a science class after the 
10th grade, the association said. About 40% take a course in chemistry, while 
only 19% take a course in physics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a particularly disturbing finding, girls are often discouraged by their 
abilities in science and math. The 1992 American Assn. of University Women 
report, "How Schools Shortchange Girls" found 80% of student-assisted science 
demonstrations are carried out by boys. 
</P>
<P>
 And about 65% of high school senior boys who had taken physics and calculus 
planned to major in science or engineering in college compared to 19% of girls 
who had taken the same subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that employment in 
technical occupations will grow at a faster pace than overall employment and 
shortages of workers in the science and engineering job markets cannot be ruled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it that caused interest in science and technology to decline? 
</P>
<P>
 Sputnik, Cook said, was a detriment to the study of science in the United 
States. When the Soviets launched the first satellite in 1957, there was a rush 
to sign up students for such courses. But schools couldn't take all who wanted 
to participate, so they made courses excessively tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a turn-off when a kid's successful parent couldn't figure out a 
homework science problem," Cook said. "It didn't take a generation of kids long 
to say, 'Who needs this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Vietnam was a deterrent to others. A cadre of teachers came into the 
profession who were anti-technology, Cook said. Children looked at scientists 
as the creators of napalm, the atomic bomb and pollution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my era, people looked up to scientists like Thomas Edison and Dr. Jonas 
Salk," Cook said. "They were seen as improving things rather than as bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in the 1970s and '80s, women with a background in science and 
math took advantage of new opportunities and went into industry rather than 
becoming teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was a downward economic spiral in schools across the country, Cook 
said. Science courses were expensive to teach, and fewer children were signing 
up, so they were the first to be dropped when budget cuts hit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, "A Nation at Risk," a government report, sounded an alarm about 
education in the United States, triggering efforts in most states to raise 
school standards. But public schools don't have the resources to fully meet the 
challenge, so industry is stepping in. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schwartz, director of education programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, 
said that recently, companies have started involving themselves in kindergarten 
through 12th grade education at the local level, but not nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "A World in Motion is an unusual example of cooperation," Schwartz said.

TOLL MAY BE 68 IN INDIANA AIR CRASH; AVIATION: ALL WERE ABOARD AN AMERICAN 
EAGLE TWIN-ENGINE TURBOPROP. THE CHICAGO-BOUND COMMUTER AIRCRAFT WENT DOWN IN 
HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 All 68 people aboard an American Eagle commuter flight apparently perished 
Monday when the plane, headed for Chicago through a downpour and gusty winds, 
crashed in a muddy field of soybean stubble. Flight 4184, a Super ATR-72 twin 
engine high-wing turboprop, went down about 30 miles south of Gary, Ind., at 
approximately 4 p.m. CST. Winds at Gary were blowing up to 49 m.p.h. at the 
time, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we've not been able to find any survivors," said Sgt. Jerry 
Parker of the Indiana State Police. About 100 emergency workers combed the 
scene for signs of life until cold weather and downpours forced a halt to the 
search after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's flight schedule called for it to leave Indianapolis at 2:10 p.m. 
CST and arrive at Chicago's O'Hare airport at 3:15 p.m. The plane was coming in 
about 45 minutes late because it had been delayed on takeoff by heavy traffic 
at O'Hare. American Eagle spokesman Patrick Henry said the plane had been 
circling in a holding pattern, waiting to begin its descent. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., as the airplane descended from 10,000 to 8,000 feet, it disappeared 
from radar screens at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Reeves, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather, a private forecasting 
company based in State College, Pa., said there was a "strong wind shear 
between 7,000 and 9,000 feet in the vicinity of the crash." A wind shear is a 
sudden shift in the direction and velocity of localized gusts that in its most 
severe form can strip from an aircraft's wings the ability to sustain lift. 
</P>
<P>
 All 64 seats on the aircraft, operated for American Eagle by Chicago-based 
Simmons Airlines, were filled with passengers. Forty-three of them were to make 
connecting flights in Chicago, Simmons spokesman Terry Hart said. Four crew 
members -- two in the cockpit and two flight attendants -- also were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew members were identified by the airline Monday night as pilot Orlando 
Aguiar, 29; co-pilot Jeffrey Gagliano, 30; and flight attendants Sandi Modaff, 
27, and Amanda Holberg, 23. Holberg had become a flight attendant on Oct. 6. 
All were based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot had logged 4,638 flight hours in his seven years with American Eagle 
and the co-pilot had 3,862 flight hours in his five years of service with the 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
 No names of passengers were released Monday night. One reason, Hart said, was 
that the airline was still checking its information. When an airline 
representative called one home expecting to notify next of kin, the man 
presumed dead answered the phone. Someone else was using his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were en route to 
the site from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the 
accident," said Simmons president Peter Piper. He said Simmons will also 
conduct its own investigation of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Midkiff said he was driving along a highway when he spotted a black puff 
of smoke and the plane banking sharply before it plunged to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't look like it had a left wing on it," Midkiff said. "It just looked 
like a black streak coming down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Stone, a hunter, said he heard the plane's engines just before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear a motor winding out and it sounded like thunder and then there 
was a crash and I didn't hear anything else," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified farmer, interviewed on radio, said the falling plane "didn't 
sound like an airplane to me. It sounded like (a) dirt bike." 
</P>
<P>
 An eyewitness told WMAQ radio that the crash sounded like the smack of plywood 
striking the ground, followed by a roll of thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Debris was scattered for about half a mile over a 40-acre field where Clarence 
Hanley harvested soybeans three weeks ago. His house is about half a mile from 
the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife heard a noise and it scared her," Hanley said. When he heard "a small 
plane" had crashed on his field, "I pictured a two-passenger plane." 
</P>
<P>
 When he drove through the reddish brown muck to the field, which he leases 
from an Illinois woman, he was dismayed by the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane "looked like it dropped down and disintegrated," Hanley said. "I 
couldn't see any big gouges or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The mud was so sticky that farmer Robert Prohosky found himself giving a ride 
in his four-wheel-drive pickup truck to a state trooper whose squad car 
couldn't make it through. He'd seen the trooper waiting, frustrated, by the 
side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way, Prohosky glimpsed a large piece of tail section sitting by itself. 
About 500 feet from the main crash site, he saw "some chunks of metal and then 
I saw a brown sweater. It had an arm in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the scene of the impact, yards and yards of wet paper -- insulation, 
Prohosky guessed -- were strewn everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to see, though, through the gray curtain of rain. There was 
little, too, to hear: just the water pelting the ground and the howling of the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the crash, people at the scene said, the rain was dense and the 
light was dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper County Sheriff Steve Reames said the Newton County Sheriff's Department 
had set up a command post near the crash site, at the Lincoln Township Fire 
Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had torrential rains all day, and right now there's such a downpour. 
They're almost unable to go out -- we're talking open farm country," Reames 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions "will hamper us a lot," said Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of the American Eagle flight was the second major plane crash in 
seven weeks. A USAir jet crashed Sept. 8 in Aliquippa, Pa., on approach to 
Pittsburgh, killing all 132 aboard. That was the worst air crash in the United 
States in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle commuter planes have been involved in at least two other fatal 
crashes in the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people were killed when an American Eagle plane crashed in a swamp at 
Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, during a heavy rainstorm on June 7, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle Flight 3378 crashed Feb. 19, 1988, in a wooded area about a 
mile away from the runway after departing in dense fog from the Raleigh-Durham, 
N.C. airport bound for Richmond, Va., killing all 12 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle spokesman Tim Smith told CNN's "Larry King Live" that his 
airline voluntarily operates its entire fleet according to the regulations that 
applied to larger aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We operate the entire American Eagle fleet of aircraft on . . . the same 
operating and safety standards as any other large jet airline, like American 
Airlines," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle canceled plans to celebrate its 10th anniversary Tuesday. It 
had planned to unveil a specially decorated airplane at Dallas-Ft. Worth 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our concern is with the families of the victims of the accident," said 
Piper, the Simmons president. 
</P>
<P>
 Four small airlines operate under the name of American Eagle. The Eagle 
carriers have the same corporate parent as American Air line: AMR Corp. based 
in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons serves American's Chicago and Dallas-Ft. Worth hubs. The other Eagle 
carriers are Los Angeles-based Wings West; Executive Airlines, which serves 
American's San Juan, Puerto Rico hub; and Nashville, Tenn.-based Flagship 
Airlines, which flies to many Eastern U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle expects to carry 12 million passengers this year. The network 
now serves 169 cities in 30 states and the District of Columbia, as well as 12 
Caribbean islands and five in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet has 279 twin-engine, turboprop aircraft carrying 19 to 64 
passengers. American Eagle owns 26 of the Super ATR aircraft, an airline 
spokesman said. The first were put into service in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane that crashed was delivered to American Eagle in March, a spokesman 
for the airline said. It had approximately 1,300 flight hours and 1,700 
landings with the airline at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR is made by Avions de Transport Regional, a joint venture of 
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of passengers may contact American Eagle toll free at 800-433-7300 
or 800-245-0999.

 Even the Mystical Traveler had to admit: Oct. 5 was a particularly trying day 
in a trying season. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the fall, California's Senate race had taken a weird hop, with 
national media and Democratic spin doctors suddenly blasting Arianna 
Stassinopoulos Huffington, wife of Republican candidate Mike Huffington, for 
her involvement with spiritual teacher John-Roger and his Church of the 
Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, or MSIA. 
</P>
<P>
 All week the Doonesbury comic strip lampooned Arianna Huffington, calling MSIA 
"a cult." 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, though, the jokes took on a sinister edge when 53 members of a 
Swiss-Canadian sect called the Order of the Solar Temple were found dead in a 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Abruptly, commentators' snide slaps at MSIA, which teaches that "the Mystical 
Traveler Consciousness" can help achieve "Soul Transcendence," turned more 
serious.

 By evening, longtime minister and staff member John Morton, to whom John-Roger 
passed "the keys" to the Mystical Traveler Consciousness in 1988, was 
countering what he termed media "witch hunts" that threatened MSIA's religious 
freedom, and trying to rebut those who "mocked and . . . persecuted" the 
movement he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a lengthy interview, Morton said there is enough of a "track record" 
so that the issue of Arianna Huffington's involvement with John-Roger and MSIA 
will "take care of itself." He also said that if she would defend MSIA, it 
might dispel the notion that "this is 'a cult' that only stupid fools would get 
involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 The public, he continued, might then see that "maybe Arianna is on to 
something that is profound and deep and real." He added, though, that given her 
recent efforts to distance herself from MSIA, he felt obliged to describe her 
involvement "in the past tense." 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington, who declined to be interviewed for this story, has said 
MSIA is not a cult, that she is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church and that 
John-Roger, whom she first met in 1973, is merely a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Current or not, her ties to MSIA have put the movement and its 4,000 to 5,000 
participants worldwide back in the public eye. 
</P>

<P>
 John-Roger, 60, was born Roger Delano Hinkins, to Mormon parents, in Rains, 
Utah. After working at various jobs and obtaining a psychology degree he moved 
to California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Rosemead High School English teacher, Hinkins was, by most accounts, 
well-liked. Students enjoyed his propensity for turning out the lights and 
leading intense "guided imagery" excursions so vivid that some were literally 
knocked out of their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Hinkins awoke from a coma caused by a kidney stone operation, 
possessed, he said, by the spirit of "John the Beloved." Hinkins started 
calling himself John-Roger -- J-R to some. He said he anchored the Mystical 
Traveler Consciousness, a spiritual mantle that had been assumed by others 
including Moses and Christ. He spoke of his communications with "beings of 
light" and his "special dispensation" to serve humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, he and the school parted ways, but at least one teacher and one of 
his former students stuck with him, and remain involved in MSIA, which was 
incorporated as a tax-exempt church in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the teachings expanded, and J-R -- who said he also anchored a rare 
force called the Preceptor Consciousness, which comes to the planet only once 
every 25,000 years -- began offering, for a fee, "aura balancings," "polarity 
balancings" and "inner phasings" -- services still integral to MSIA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 5, about 200 people gathered in a rented Santa Barbara hall to hear a 
scheduled "open seminar" by John Morton. 
</P>
<P>
 Children skittered between pews and folding chairs. Adults, some of whom had 
participated in MSIA for 25 years or longer, chatted and expressed amused 
disbelief that a group that teaches "Don't hurt yourself and don't hurt 
others," was being mentioned in the same breath as Jonestown and Waco. 
</P>
<P>
 A few longtime followers wore the purple clothes once said to be the 
Traveler's color, and others wore MSIA's insignia jewelry. Otherwise, the 
diverse group could have blended seamlessly into a Lutheran or Catholic 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar began with a ritual known as "calling in the Light." Then, as "a 
means of moving farther into the higher realms of consciousness," the group 
chanted soothingly what MSIA literature calls the sacred names for empathy and 
God, Ani-Hu . 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with John-Roger, now Traveler emeritus, sitting in the back receiving 
a neck massage from a smiling woman, Morton strode onstage in a stylish olive 
suit, looking more junior executive than Mystical Traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's monologue, like those of John-Roger that run on public access 
stations nationwide, came across to an outsider like stream of consciousness. A 
minister later explained that the Traveler was simply "picking up" and 
commenting on the audience's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then some folks were pondering God and soul transcendence, others 
donations ("Somebody's got this thing about money," Morton said); banking 
practices ("I have no knowledge whatsoever that there are any Swiss bank 
accounts or any other secret bank accounts"), and MSIA's relations with the 
Internal Revenue Service ("In actuality, we've had very good relations with the 
IRS.") 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the hostess returned to the stage, and in the same cheerful PTA 
president voice in which she announced that cookies and punch would be served, 
she advised the audience to remain seated and not touch John Morton or 
John-Roger as they left. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those people who are new, part of the reason that we ask for that is that 
during the seminar, John and John-Roger also work with a spiritual 
consciousness, and here in the seminar some imbalances from the physical, the 
emotional, or the mental may be released . . . and then they're held around the 
energy fields of John Morton and John-Roger. . . . If you touch them, then that 
could get more anchored into their body, and it's a little more difficult for 
them to clear that." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Morton had noted in his talk that sometimes the church can strike 
outsiders as "weird or kooky." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "we also appear as very beautiful, loving, joyful people. If 
you miss that part of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, you're blind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Participants have said they were initially attracted to the familial warmth of 
the early seminars, for which seekers paid $3. But quickly the movement's 
fortunes grew. In 1973, MSIA purchased a large home in Mandeville Canyon where 
John-Roger, who has taken a vow of poverty, lived with his young male staff. 
The next year, the church purchased the elegant Busby Berkeley mansion on West 
Adams Boulevard, and renamed it Prana -- the Purple Rose Ashram of the New Age. 
It later acquired an office building in Santa Monica and a Lake Arrowhead 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, John-Roger launched Insight Transformational Seminars, which, 
according to tax records, brought in more than $1 million in the first full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, a handful of ranking ministers left the church, portraying 
John-Roger as a Svengali. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous former ministers said that he used the lure of his awesome cosmic 
connections to garner wealth and worldly power. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Toso was one of three men who had served on John-Roger's personal staff 
who contended that J-R had sexually seduced them under spiritual pretense. 
Several former members, including Wendell and Susan Whitmore, claimed that when 
they left MSIA (previously pronounced "messiah") John-Roger or his staff 
members had harassed them and vandalized their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was ever charged in those incidents. John-Roger, who declined to be 
interviewed for this story, has previously denied allegations of sexual 
relations with his staff under spiritual pretense and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 After The Times published a series of articles on the movement in 1988, 
John-Roger's bad press subsided, and he went on to launch the best-selling 
"Life 101" series of books with author Peter McWilliams. But in March, 
McWilliams, MSIA's 1990 "minister of the year," left the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, MSIA sued him, demanding more than $400,000 in unpaid royalties and 
past-due promissory notes. Williams has said in interviews with The Times and 
other media that John-Roger "programmed" him to believe that J-R was more 
powerful than Jesus, then duped him into putting his name on the books. 
McWilliams says he has paid or donated more than $1 million to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials say that McWilliams' accusations -- which are spelled out in 
his speedily self-published book "Life 102 -- What to Do When Your Guru Sues 
You" -- are simply the author making good on "blackmail" he threatened when 
MSIA tried to collect money he had agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, McWilliams' collaboration with John-Roger had brought the 
movement good publicity after the collapse of its most high-profile effort, the 
John-Roger Foundation's International Integrity Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1983 to 1987, media swarmed as the awards were presented to South 
Africa's Bishop Desmond Tutu, polio researcher Dr. Jonas Salk, then-Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley, consumer activist Ralph Nader and director Oliver Stone, 
among others, usually at black-tie galas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, J-R appeared in Interview magazine, awkwardly posed beside award 
recipient Mother Teresa. Author Arianna Stassinopoulos, who was ordained an 
MSIA minister in 1978, had gone with J-R to present the prize. In the preface 
to her interview with him for the magazine, Stassinopoulos wrote that her first 
encounter with her "way-shower and friend" was a pivotal moment in her long 
spiritual quest, and that she had studied with him ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Jim and Dodie Brady, then MSIA ministers, were in the midst of 
bringing the annual gala to Washington when they spoke to staffers and 
ministers who had left the movement. They began to question the integrity of 
the man who inspired the awards, they say. Amid considerable turmoil, the event 
was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodie Brady, now a critic of the way Arianna Huffington has represented her 
relationship with MSIA, says that she is still "embarrassed" that she had 
helped persuade then-Sen. Alan Cranston and other lawmakers to introduce 
national legislation that would have declared Sept. 24 -- John-Roger's birthday 
-- an annual Integrity Day. Forty-seven states and 200 cities had already 
approved such a proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, after the cancellation of the Integrity Awards, the MSIA faithful 
organized a celebration for John-Roger. Led by Morton, the church threw a 
black-tie bash and presented him with "the symbolic gift" of a $752,000 house 
near the John-Roger Foundation's Santa Barbara-area ranch, although he still 
spends most of his time at the Mandeville Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton now lives with wife, printing heiress and MSIA supporter Laura 
Donnelley-Morton. In July, Architectural Digest featured the couple in their 
remodeled Brentwood-area "Spanish-Passadian-Oriental-Ranch" style home, which 
boasts views "from Downtown to Palos Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, John-Roger's teachings continue to spread through MSIA and its 
aligned organizations. The once-lucrative Insight has gone through financial 
travails and is now independently owned by three MSIA participants. MSIA 
seminars, retreats, trips, Peace Awareness Trainings, Spiritual Warrior 
workshops and other events are held across the United States and in Canada, 
Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, Spain and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus at the moment, however, is the Institute for Individual and World 
Peace's Windermere ranch, 140 acres of stunning boulder-strewn chaparral 
overlooking Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Hall, vice president of the institute (of which John-Roger is 
president), said the plan for Windermere is to create a peace retreat to help 
realize the institute slogan: "Peace in the world will result when we take 
responsibility for peace in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of John-Roger's and John Morton's movement activities now go toward 
raising money for Windermere, where events for the aligned organizations would 
be held. Wealthy donors have also been generous. Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys 
and Donnelley-Morton have each contributed more than $200,000 to the institute, 
according to tax records. Arianna Huffington contributed $35,000 between 
September, 1990, and November, 1992, and McWilliams contributed more than 
$54,000 before parting ways with John-Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Institute has also donated to several "designated charities" in the 
past five years. The largest amounts have gone to MSIA, with smaller checks 
written to other John-Roger-aligned organizations, including the University of 
Santa Monica, Peace Theological Seminary and the Educare Foundation, which 
teaches the Achievement and Commitment to Excellence self-esteem program in 
some public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 John-Roger defines "peace" as "the cessation of againstness." And the 
institute -- previously the John-Roger Foundation -- has faced plenty of 
againstness regarding Windermere. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent plans shown to neighbors, scaled back from the original 
drawings, include a 3,600-square-foot dining facility, a 3,000-square-foot 
community building, a new hay barn, a basketball court as well as 10 one- and 
two-story cabins and campsites. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors in the remote community with its narrow winding roads cite fire 
danger and traffic, noise, water and environmental concerns. They complain, 
too, that the Peace Institute plays hardball. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the John-Roger Foundation sued resident Helen Larsen for $1 million 
to gain access to a small road on her property. The suit was dismissed three 
years later, and Larsen said the institute reimbursed her legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the moment the John-Roger Foundation came into this community," Larsen 
said, "I have known no peaceful enjoyment; instead I have felt harassed and 
invaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall says she is confident that consensus can be reached in the community. The 
institute has worked closely with the neighbors, and a team of top consultants 
has offered assurance that the uses the institute envisions are harmonious with 
the environment and the community's needs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For neighbors Craig and Judy Jennings, though, the problem with Windermere is 
symbolized by the 8,000-square-foot barn the institute built in 1992, while the 
site was still zoned for agriculture but then used for institute events. 
</P>
<P>
 The barn was necessary, said ranch manager and MSIA minister Jack Espey, to 
keep the ranch's 46 horses warm on cold nights. Indeed, about half the 
cavernous space has a dirt floor and paddocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But another large section is carpeted and paneled, has ceiling fans, 
insulation, a massive air-conditioning system and a panel of switches 
controlling various functions, including stage lights. A placard on one wall 
sports a roster of people who contributed to the "tree fund" in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but think of it as a 'compound,' " Craig Jennings said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, MSIA President Paul Kaye and other participants are frustrated by 
renewed suggestions that their ecumenical church, which encourages the 
spreading of "Light and Love," is a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps people working with MSIA, Morton and Kaye say, is the value they 
get from the Traveler's teachings -- that God is within everyone, that "no soul 
shall be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brilliant teaching," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 But John-Roger's words, recorded in more than 24 books, 5,000 tapes and 144 
monthly "soul awareness discourses," are open to interpretation. And to 
complicate matters, his supporters say that much of what happens in seminars is 
not necessarily meant to be grasped on "the word level." 
</P>
<P>
 Students of the Traveler -- J-R used to call them "votaries" -- negotiate a 
labyrinth of his cosmic insight on working with the Light, overcoming karma, 
reincarnation, the negative "kal power," and moving through the lower realms -- 
physical, astral, causal, mental, etheric -- toward Soul Transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers have no problem shrugging off the more unusual aspects of the 
teachings, and seem baffled that outsiders see anything in J-R but love and 
selfless commitment to serving others. 
</P>
<P>
 Heide Banks, 38, first attended a John-Roger seminar 16 years ago. She 
continues to study the teachings, but adds that MSIA is only a part of a life 
that is rich with friends and activities outside the movement. Of John-Roger, 
she said: "I think he has a tremendous loving energy around him, that really 
encourages people to be the best that they can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye and Banks said that most people who study with MSIA never "put J-R on a 
pedestal" and those who move on do so without bitterness. Both independently 
suggested nine-year participant Victoria Marine as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 From October, 1990, until November, 1992, Marine lived at Prana and edited the 
movement's New Day Herald newspaper, with John-Roger as her editor-in-chief. 
When she left MSIA early last month, she wrote letters saying she did so with 
no "againstness" toward anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, she said, "my eyes have opened a little . . . it's like I put 
my glasses on and started seeing clearly . . . The more I go along now, the 
more I think, 'My God, I was manipulated and used.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marine, 35, now attends First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, which she said 
seems "open" and "inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, MSIA "charges for everything," she said, from seminars to 
polarity balancings; MSIA initiates are discouraged from sharing their thoughts 
with each other, she said, and many ministers were so obedient to J-R that they 
abided by the most offbeat rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine said many staffers would not eat pork or garlic before conducting 
services such as aura balancings because J-R is allergic to those foods and 
could be affected, even though he participates only "spiritually" from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine said her recent questioning of MSIA was in part inspired by the 
"suspicious" call she got from Banks, who wanted to know if she would talk to a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked, would I be OK if (the reporter) asked me about Arianna? The 
question seemed strange: Would I be OK? What does that mean? Will I have a 
seizure, start crying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Banks later said she never mentioned Arianna Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine said that she had talked to Huffington and attended several seminars 
and a retreat open only to ministers and initiates with her in recent years. 
Once, she wanted to publish some "excellent" photographs of J-R holding 
Arianna's daughter, but the answer was no. With J-R's permission, Marine said 
she sent the photos and the negatives to Arianna's sister, Agapi 
Stassinopoulos, a longtime MSIA participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman said Friday that Arianna 
Huffington has spent too much time "trying to rebut malicious lies and rumors" 
and will let her "six books and countless speeches speak for themselves. . . . 
She will not participate in a witch hunt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morton, Kaye and others say that the teachings of the Traveler are compatible 
with mainstream Christianity; that John-Roger frequently says: "Jesus is my 
boss." Morton provides a folder of J-R's quotes that mention the teachings of 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is easy to thumb through movement literature and find passages where 
John-Roger or supporters portray the Traveler as Christlike, or state that the 
positions J-R "anchors" are of greater cosmic importance than Jesus'. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in "The Path to Mastership," a book updated in 1982, John-Roger 
writes: "Buddha said, 'I am the Light of Asia.' Christ said, 'I am the Light of 
the world.' The Traveler says, 'I am the Light of the universe'; And the 
Preceptor says, 'I am the Light of all universes.' This is not a spiritual 
promise. It is reality." 
</P>
<P>
 For a church apparently intent on establishing its credentials for 
Christian-compatibility, the iconography of Western religion is conspicuously 
scarce. A tour of Prana reveals the estate as a pleasant place for spiritual 
study. There is a statue of the Buddha on one table and a Hindu sculpture in a 
nook. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident's room does display a half-dozen or so portraits of Christ, but 
they are surrounded by a reverential display of even more images of John-Roger, 
which are everywhere in Prana, now called the Peace Theological Seminary and 
College of Philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine said simply: "You have all these normal, nice, intelligent people 
repeating what J-R says, even bizarre things, and if enough say it you start to 
accept it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, anticipating McWilliams' book, MSIA's Kaye wrote a letter to 
discourse subscribers urging them to "look within" for answers to the coming 
questions: "Is MSIA a strange cult? Is this the real thing or some money-making 
scheme?" 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that in 1988, when The Times and other publications reported 
"rumors" about John-Roger and MSIA, discourse subscriptions dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ironically," he added, "it impacted positively in terms of income flowing 
to the church, because the people still involved upped their involvement and 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of you are probably wondering how J-R is doing with all of this. The 
answer is, just fine." 
</P>

WILL DEFEND PROP. 187 IN COURTS, LUNGREN SAYS; IMMIGRATION: BUT THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL SAYS HE'D LACK AUTHORITY TO PROSECUTE OFFICIALS WHO FAIL TO REPORT 
SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren promised Monday to strongly defend Proposition 187 
against expected lawsuits if voters approve the sweeping anti-illegal 
immigration measure next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren, the state's chief law enforcement officer, added that he would 
have no authority to prosecute educators and others who failed to report 
suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities, as required under the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's statements, made at a Sacramento news conference, raised new 
questions about the enforcement mechanisms for the get-tough measure, which 
includes no specific provisions for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Monday about Lungren's statements, Ronald Prince, head of the pro-187 
campaign committee, expressed surprise and said it had been his understanding 
that the attorney general's office would be responsible for enforcing the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education said 
that county prosecutors would still be able to file misdemeanor charges against 
educators who failed to report suspected illegal immigrants to the attorney 
general's office and the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, one of the leading proponents of Proposition 
187, said the Wilson Administration has no intention of shedding any light on 
the matter. Press Secretary Sean Walsh said his office plans no comment on how 
the measure would be implemented or enforced until after the votes are counted 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to engage in the debate until after the election," Walsh 
said. "We will have to make that assessment after the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who again refused to state his own position on the emotion-charged 
ballot initiative, told reporters Monday that he was legally obligated to 
defend statutes he considered contained a "defensible interest and a prospect 
for success," regardless of his private opinion of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This falls into that category," the Republican official, who is seeking 
reelection this fall, said of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any legal attack on the measure will be met by a strong legal defense by my 
office," Lungren said. "We have been working to analyze it so we could, in 
fact, put it into play if it is passed, and also to defend it." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that many provisions of the measure would be scheduled to take effect 
the day after the election, Lungren said his office is preparing memos to send 
to law enforcement and other officials on how to report suspected illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which is expected to result in a flurry of lawsuits, would bar 
illegal immigrants from receiving most government services and calls for local 
education, health care and law enforcement officials to forward the names of 
suspected illegal immigrants to the state attorney general's office and the 
INS. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lungren, in response to questions from reporters, said, "I have no 
intention of prosecuting anybody" who fails to report suspected illegal 
immigrants to his office because "it's not part of the statute." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in this (initiative) that suggests there is any criminal 
action to be taken by my office against someone who sends me inadequate lists," 
Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believes that acts by the Legislature would be necessary to put 
enforcement teeth into Proposition 187, the attorney general demurred. "I'm not 
going to assume that there is going to be a broad-scale failure of people to 
follow the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general indicated that he would treat names of suspected illegal 
immigrants filed with his office in the same way he does required statistical 
reports of local law enforcement agencies. "If they fail to do it, I couldn't 
go to court and prosecute somebody for that," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's statement drew a surprised reaction from Prince, co-chair of the 
pro-187 Save Our State committee. "The attorney general will enforce the law," 
said Prince, although he could point to no wording in the initiative that would 
define such powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for further detail about how Proposition 187 would be implemented, 
Prince said, "I'd suggest asking the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll withhold comment until after the election," Wilson press secretary 
Walsh said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh added that implementation questions may prove moot for some time because 
of anticipated lawsuits by Proposition 187 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a lawsuit to be filed immediately that would probably stay the 
implementation of 187 until the courts resolve the issue," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said that 
school personnel who defied Proposition 187 by refusing to report suspected 
illegal immigrants might face civil suits or criminal prosecution at the county 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent legal advisory from the Education Department's general counsel, 
Joseph R. Symkowick, says that under the state's Education Code, school 
employees who refuse to carry out assigned duties are guilty of misdemeanors 
and could also face dismissal from their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any willful refusal by school district personnel assigned to carry out 
Proposition 187 duties after its passage could result in serious personal 
consequences," the advisory states. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ballot measure said Monday that the questions concerning 
enforcement of the measure prove that it is poorly written. "It's clear 
whatever comes to take place will be a very chaotic situation," said Taxpayers 
Against 187 spokesman Al Lundeen. "No one is clear who is responsible. It 
doesn't sound like a very appropriate way to enact laws in this state."

 Meanwhile, a poll released Monday by the Tomas Rivera Center found that 
two-thirds of Latino voters consider Proposition 187 racist and mean-spirited, 
compared to 23% of voters overall statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by Sergio Bendixen & Associates, polled 400 Latino and 
400 general likely voters. It found that only 15% of Latinos support 
Proposition 187, compared to 48% of voters overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, 70% of Latinos polled believe that Gov. Wilson is speaking about 
the measure in a way that promotes anti-immigrant hatred and 71% believe the 
debate is creating a climate that will make it easier to discriminate against 
the overall Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most surprising findings is that 25% of all likely Latino voters 
personally fear discrimination, and they are blaming Wilson for that," said 
Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Center, a national institute for 
policy studies in Claremont.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS TOP DONOR TO WILSON CAMPAIGN; POLITICS: FIRMS PRAISE HIS 
ANTI-REGULATION STANCE. SOME CONSUMER ADVOCATES SAY HE CONSISTENTLY SIDES WITH 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Devastated by losses from the Northridge earthquake, 20th Century Insurance 
Co. was on such shaky financial ground this summer that the company raised 
rates 17%, borrowed money and stopped selling some forms of insurance in a 
desperate attempt to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as it was pleading poverty, the Woodland Hills-based company scraped 
together $5,000 to give to the campaign of Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is 
running for reelection against state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of 20th Century's contribution was modest in these days of 
multimillion-dollar political campaigns. But the fact that a company so down on 
its luck would make any donation at all illustrates the importance that one 
industry places on its participation in the state's political process -- and 
the kinship that industry feels with the incumbent governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson expects to raise and spend more than $27 million before the Nov. 8 
election, and most of that money will come from companies or individuals with a 
stake in the policies that a governor has a role in making. But the insurance 
industry, it appears, will spend more than any other single group trying to 
keep Wilson in power, by contributing more than $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance business, perhaps more than any industry except utilities, 
depends on the whims of state regulators and lawmakers as it guards the bottom 
line. Even though the state has an independently elected insurance 
commissioner, the governor often is in the position of playing referee between 
the demands of the industry and the wishes of its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say they support Wilson because they share his general 
philosophy that less regulation of business will mean more jobs for 
California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "His approach has been one of trying to help business stay in California and 
remain healthy," said Ric Hill, vice president of corporate relations for 20th 
Century. "We support that." 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer advocates say Wilson is the darling of insurers because he has 
sided with them time and again -- and in so doing has cost customers money and 
left them vulnerable to losing their insurance policies after a natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103 -- the 1988 ballot initiative 
that strengthened regulation of the industry -- describes Wilson as the 
insurance companies' "lackey." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't find one instance in his record as governor when he did not do what 
the insurance industry wanted him to do," Rosenfield said. "Pete Wilson knows 
he will receive money from the insurance industry, and the insurance industry 
knows Pete Wilson will do what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield's initiative created an independent insurance commissioner elected 
by the voters to regulate the industry. But one of Wilson's first acts as 
governor was to appoint his own insurance adviser to counter the clout of the 
elected commissioner. Wilson's choice was Marjorie Berte, a former industry 
official who helped lead the campaign against Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Berte helps Wilson raise money from her former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, she was among three Wilson aides who attended a fund-raiser with the 
governor hosted by the Assn. of California Insurance Cos., a Sacramento-based 
lobbying group that has contributed $162,000 to Wilson's reelection campaign -- 
one of the largest sums of any private-interest group. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy A. Mudge, director of finance and administration for the association's 
political action committee, said the group's contributions are based on 
"wanting good government." She added: "We want a healthy economic environment, 
and we look for fair and evenhanded regulation of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Wilson has collected more than $1.2 million from insurers, agents and 
brokers in this campaign, about 10 times the amount that Brown has received 
from these interests. 
</P>
<P>
 As governor, Wilson has compiled a record in support of the industry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson last year signed legislation allowing insurance agents and brokers to 
keep commissions that they otherwise would have been required to return as part 
of a 20% rate rollback ordered by Proposition 103. The same year, he signed 
legislation undercutting the initiative's provision making antitrust laws 
applicable to insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Wilson appointee who headed the office of administrative law in 1992 ruled 
that Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's regulations for implementing the 
rollbacks were unconstitutional, and Wilson refused to overturn the decision. 
Two years later, the state Supreme Court ruled that Garamendi was right. 
</P>
<P>
 * The governor signed another measure forcing Garamendi to act on insurance 
company requests for rate hikes within six months or allow the higher premiums 
to take effect automatically. The new law made it harder for Garamendi to 
implement a freeze on rates that he had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 * He vetoed a bill giving the governor authority to prevent insurers from 
canceling policies within a year after a disaster. The bill was backed by 
consumers who found themselves scrambling to replace their insurance after the 
Oakland Hills fire, the Southern California firestorm and the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson also vetoed the so-called Homeowners Bill of Rights, a comprehensive 
measure aimed at protecting disaster victims from unscrupulous insurers. He 
argued that the bill's provisions giving claimants new rights when being 
questioned under oath by insurers would prompt increased fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also has consistently sided with insurers in seeking to limit accident 
victims' right to sue. He has proposed no-fault automobile insurance, backed 
limits on medical malpractice judgments and vetoed legislation allowing 
insurance customers to sue for punitive damages when companies act in bad faith 
to wrongly deny their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), former chairman of the Assembly 
Insurance Committee, said he is not surprised that insurers are Wilson's most 
generous contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Pete Wilson they have a rubber stamp, and they obviously want to have 
that rubber stamp for four more years," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berte, Wilson's insurance adviser, said the governor is proud of his 
efforts to promote a healthy business environment for insurance companies. By 
doing so, she argued, he is helping consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not afraid to suggest that you need to work with insurers to help them 
fight fraudulent claims and excessive legal costs," Berte said. "The benefit of 
that goes to people buying insurance. . . . We really need a competitive, 
viable insurance market. Anything else doesn't really serve consumers very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Berte said Wilson worked with the industry and lawmakers from both parties to 
enact reforms after the 1991 Oakland Hills fire, when many homeowners 
complained that they had been misled about how much their insurance would pay 
to replace their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting legislation, she said, was the most significant reform in fire 
insurance since the standard policy was put into statute 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wilson signed legislation requiring health maintenance 
organizations to allow women to designate their gynecologist as their primary 
physician, and another measure that makes it easier for patients to get 
emergency care without checking with a doctor designated by their insurer. Both 
bills, Berte said, were opposed by insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say those bills are the exception, not the rule. They say Wilson has 
more often bowed to insurers' wishes, sometimes at the expense of the broader 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
 One example that they cite is the governor's handling of the workers' 
compensation issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Wilson held up passage of the state budget while demanding major 
changes in the costly and much criticized system. But when Democrats suggested 
in negotiations that the state allow free-market competition to play a greater 
role in setting rates -- a concept that the industry opposed -- Wilson dropped 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after the industry split on the issue, Wilson supported repealing the 
so-called minimum rate law, which had inhibited competition by preventing 
companies from offering rates below a level set by the insurance commissioner. 
But at the same time, as Wilson offered another set of proposals to overhaul 
the system, he sided with the insurance industry and rejected several ideas 
that employers had put forward to give them more leverage in their relations 
with insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms that were eventually passed by the Legislature, along with market 
pressures and a crackdown on fraud, have reduced rates on employers by nearly a 
third over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Jackson, a powerful insurance industry lobbyist who later was 
convicted of political corruption charges, was secretly taped by a state 
senator boasting of his access to Wilson's office during the first round of 
negotiations over the workers' compensation reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson told state Sen. Alan Robbins, who had turned federal informant before 
pleading guilty to corruption charges himself, that Wilson was willing to back 
the insurers, but not openly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's attitude toward insurance companies is that they're, 
politically, they're pariahs," Jackson told Robbins. "So what his unspoken 
message is, you insurance companies get behind your customers. And that way, I 
can talk about how I'm helping the employers, the doctors, the Indian chiefs. 
And that just happens to help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said Jackson, in the secret tape-recording, was overstating his 
influence. Citing the former lobbyist's conviction on federal charges, the 
governor says Jackson has no credibility. Federal investigators, moreover, have 
never suggested improper behavior by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson is not the only industry source to boast privately of Wilson's 
fealty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agents and Brokers Legislative Council, a lobbying group, published an 
October newsletter in which the top item was headlined "Governor Completes 
ABL's 1994 Legislative Agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Agents and Brokers Legislative Council," the newsletter reported, 
"successfully obtained the governor's signature on every sponsored legislative 
proposal put forth in 1994." The group's president cited campaign contributions 
as one reason for the council's success. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for another major Wilson contributor, Farmers Insurance Group 
of Cos., said the firm expects only "an ear" -- a fair hearing -- in return for 
its donations to the governor's campaign. Farmers has given Wilson more than 
$70,000 since the start of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all you can expect, that they'll listen, the door will be open at 
least to let you plead your case," said Stephen Feely, vice president for 
public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought Farmers could get in that door without making 
contributions, Feely replied: "I'd hope that we would get that all the time, 
but I think in the real world, you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Snyder, co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, said 
contributions have soared to such a high level that companies no longer are 
buying only access to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about one insurance company giving $50,000 to a 
candidate, and you expect that candidate to have in front of (him) matters that 
affect your economic interests, you are attempting to buy government," Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Democracy in Sacramento has become a marketplace for the sale of 
influence. It's not criminal. But it's plain wrong."

COLOSIO'S KILLER GETS 42 YEARS; PROBE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Aburto Martinez, a 23-year-old factory worker, was convicted Monday of 
murdering ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and 
sentenced to 42 years in prison, eight years less than the maximum term. 
</P>
<P>
 The special prosecutor in charge of the case immediately announced plans to 
appeal the sentence, insisting on the 50-year maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mexico does not have jury trials, the verdict and the sentence are 
decided by a judge, whose ruling is subject to two reviews by higher courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming about seven months after Colosio's assassination at a campaign rally in 
a working-class Tijuana neighborhood, the sentencing still leaves unanswered 
many questions about the killing, including the motive. Monday's announcement 
said the investigation, which has been viewed skeptically by much of the 
Mexican public, will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the announcement is expected to fuel a growing debate about the 
Mexican judicial system and sentences that some say are too lenient. Reform of 
the justice system was a major issue in the campaign of Colosio's replacement, 
Ernesto Zedillo, who won the Aug. 21 presidential election and is scheduled to 
take office Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that many Mexicans suspect a conspiracy to assassinate Colosio, a 
reformer who was expected to be elected easily. And since another reformer, 
second-ranking party official Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was killed Sept. 28, the 
public has linked the two murders as the result of infighting between 
hard-liners and reformers in the party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all these cases, the truth is never told," said David Tapia, a 24-year-old 
shopkeeper. "There is a Mafia government behind all this. They killed Colosio 
because he was really a straight arrow and wanted to make changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The special prosector's office released a statement last week denying that any 
ties have been found between the assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto was grabbed and beaten by the crowd immediately after he shot Colosio 
and was then turned over to police. In the following days, four other men were 
arrested as accomplices who pushed people aside to let Aburto get near Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 One was immediately released for lack of evidence. The other three remain in 
custody but have not yet been tried. At their lawyers' requests, their cases 
have been separated from that of Aburto, who has steadfastly maintained that he 
acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The first special prosecutor named to investigate the Colosio murder concluded 
that Aburto was a lone gunman. He resigned amid public furor over the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new special prosecutor continued to follow up on leads, but her 
investigation has failed to reveal any significant additional evidence, said 
Miguel Sanchez de Armas, press director for the special prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's statement announcing Aburto's sentence, the attorney general 
tacitly acknowledged public doubts about the investigation, concluding, "The 
special prosecutor will continue the investigation to completely clarify the 
events that took place in Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Tijuana on last March 
23." 
</P>
<P>
 Public confidence was not bolstered by Aburto's trial, conducted under a 
system derived from the Napoleonic Code, a legacy of European rule. The 
proceedings took place mainly behind closed doors inside the maximum security 
prison where Aburto is being held. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution and defense presented evidence to Judge Alejandro Sosa in 
sporadic hearings during the months since Aburto's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's public defender did not publicize his evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa decided Aburto's guilt and determined the sentence. Aburto was fully 
responsible for premeditated and malicious homicide, the judge found, according 
to the statement from the attorney general's office. No explanation was given 
for why Aburto did not receive the maximum sentence.

WHITE HOUSE TO WEIGH LIMITING PUBLIC'S ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Monday that the Clinton Administration 
is responding to Saturday's shooting at the White House by reviewing "every 
aspect of how the White House complex could be attacked -- from the air or from 
the ground," and acknowledged that public access might have to be further 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news briefing, Bentsen said that recommendations will be made by early 
next year for upgrading security, such as possibly closing off the two-block 
stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue that runs in front of the mansion or stationing 
more guards on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also defended the Secret Service, an agency he oversees, for the way 
it handled the incident Saturday. He said that sharpshooters on the White House 
grounds held their fire because they were afraid that bullets from their 
high-powered rifles would pass through the gunman's body and injure someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Service . . . responded, I think, effectively and with judgment. 
The last thing I wanted to see was someone firing weapons in a crowd like 
that," he said. "Even with the full accuracy of someone shooting, hitting the 
target, there's nothing to stop that bullet from passing on through and hitting 
innocent bystanders." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's remarks came as a federal magistrate ordered Francisco Martin Duran, 
who is charged with raking the White House with bullets Saturday, to undergo 
psychiatric testing to determine if he is mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson issued her ruling at the request of federal 
prosecutors, who said that the contents of handwritten notes found in Duran's 
pickup truck suggested that the precautionary move is needed to ensure a fair 
trial. Duran fired 20 to 30 rounds from a semiautomatic assault rifle shortly 
before 3 p.m. Saturday while standing on a Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk in 
front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that a review of security procedures, 
which began after the Sept. 12 crash of a light plane on the White House South 
Lawn, now centers on a sensitive question that long has been avoided: whether 
the President's house should, after two centuries, be put out of reach of the 
public -- at the cost of dimming its status as a leading symbol of the nation's 
democracy and detracting from a prime experience of visitors to the capital 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The review will examine whatever means might be available, including 
state-of-the-art technology, to better protect the White House and our national 
leaders," Bentsen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how security needs could be balanced with the public's desire for access 
to the national landmark, Bentsen said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, obviously you can't have a totally open White House. You have to 
achieve a balance insofar as making it as accessible as you can to the American 
people and in turn giving the protection that's necessary for this nation's 
leaders and their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen announced that he was appointing an outside advisory committee to 
assist in the review. The panel will include William H. Webster, former 
director of the FBI and CIA; David Jones, retired Air Force general and former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Judith Rodin, a psychologist and 
president of the University of Pennsylvania; Robert Carswell, a former deputy 
Treasury secretary, and former Transportation Secretary William Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 The review is expected to take note of how other countries protect their 
leaders. In France, for example, the executive mansion in Paris is surrounded 
by high walls. Regular French police and the Republican Guard, a special police 
force that ensures the security of all official buildings, oversee protection 
of the Elysee Palace. Cameras scan all streets leading to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the home and office of the British prime minister at 10 Downing St. 
are in a quiet setting with gates and guard posts at both ends -- a setting 
very different from the busy downtown district around the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing Street was accessible to tourists, who could stand across the street 
from its entrance, until 10 years ago. But with Irish Republican Army terrorism 
moving to London in the 1980s, onlookers were moved back, 10-foot-high steel 
gates were installed and extra security was put in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the residence was shown to be vulnerable. In 1991, an IRA 
makeshift mortar shell, fired from a pickup truck two blocks away, landed in 
the garden during a Cabinet meeting. No one was injured, although the blast 
blew out windows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Japanese prime minister's office, which also is his home, is 
surrounded by a brick wall. And in Moscow, the public does not know where 
President Boris N. Yeltsin lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At his court hearing, Duran, a husky man dressed in a black polo shirt and 
black jeans, was asked only for his name as he stood in the heavily guarded 
courtroom. He made no statement and will officially enter a plea later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. told reporters that "the competency screening 
for Mr. Duran is not an indication we believe he is incompetent and it's not a 
question of insanity. We just want doctors to examine him and determine if he 
can understand the nature of the proceedings against him and if he can help his 
counsel in his defense at trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. law, if Duran were judged to be incapable of understanding the 
proceedings or aiding his attorney, he could not be tried unless he underwent 
psychiatric treatment, which might require his commitment to a mental 
institution. If his mental state improved, he would then go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal sources said that at least one of two notes written by Duran, 26, 
before the incident indicated that he thought he might be killed by Secret 
Service agents after firing at the exterior of the White House and that he left 
instructions on how his affairs should be handled in the event of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The government expanded its charges against the former Army felon from 
Colorado to include assault on a Secret Service officer and use of a firearm in 
the commission of a violent crime, bringing to four the number of federal 
charges and exposing him to a maximum penalty of 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had filed two charges Sunday against Duran -- possessing a firearm 
as a convicted felon and damaging federal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder said that he could not comment on a possible motive for the attack in 
which no one was injured, but the additional charges stressed that lives had 
been endangered. In describing a new charge of assaulting a federal officer, 
prosecutors filed court papers stating that officers Harry O. Wilson and Carl 
Persons charged at Duran as "he continued to fire shots in their general 
direction, forcing them to take defensive action on the front lawn of the White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 Two tourists initially subdued Duran until Secret Service agents arrived 
moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said President Clinton hoped to 
personally thank the two men who tackled the gunman: Harry Rakosky, 34, of San 
Antonio and Ken Davis, 24, of Hagerstown, Md. "He definitely will want to get 
in touch with them . . . one way or the other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investigators spent the day examining the face of the White House, 
measuring and taking photographs of bullet holes. At one point, those inside 
the press briefing room -- where a bullet shattered a window -- were kept away 
from the window as investigators removed the slug from the window frame and 
used a laser measuring device to determine trajectory angles.

'KILLER BEE' SWARM CROSSES INTO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A swarm of the feared Africanized "killer" honeybees has finally reached 
California -- landing inside a prison near Blythe, where they were promptly 
killed, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're here and we're going to have to live with them," Riverside County 
Agricultural Commissioner Jim Wallace said of the bees' long-expected arrival 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 That assumes -- as experts do -- that more bees will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The ones that prompted Monday's announcement were discovered Oct. 24 and 
destroyed the same day by inmate firefighters at the Chuckawalla Valley State 
Prison, 20 miles west of Blythe, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A basketball-size swarm of bees landed atop a fence post about 50 feet from 
the pedestrian entrance to the prison and were doused with industrial-strength 
foam spray, then drowned in diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Microscopic examinations at three different government labs later identified 
the bees as the hyper-defensive honey makers that have swarmed north from 
Brazil since their release there in 1957, creating anxiety and "Here they 
come!" Hollywood hype along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But the migration turned lethargic as it approached California and local bee 
experts in September speculated that the bees might not arrive until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized bees have now settled along the eastern banks of the Colorado 
River from Yuma -- where they appeared a year ago -- to Poston, Ariz., 80 miles 
north, according to Bill Routhier, the bee expert for the California Department 
of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When will they get to Los Angeles? I don't know," Routhier said. "But will 
they get to L.A.? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unknown why the bees crossed the river at Blythe instead of earlier at 
Yuma -- or whether, perhaps, the swarm hitchhiked to the prison grounds aboard 
a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the bees situated across the Colorado River, experts assumed 
that the prison swarm was part of the migratory front -- and thus christened 
them California's first. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are them, the pure, honest-to-goodness thing," said Eric Mussen, an 
apiculturist for UC Davis Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experts offer different scenarios of what is to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Kaminskas, the assistant Riverside County agricultural commissioner, said 
he doubts that the discovery of the Blythe bees indicates that more will follow 
the same route, which headed the swarm toward the inhospitable Mojave Desert, 
approaching the Palm Springs region. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the main migration will cross into California from Yuma, 
head north from El Centro and Indio, then go up the irrigated fields of the 
Coachella Valley. From there, they would presumably cross the desert resort 
communities and swarm through the San Gorgonio Pass into San Bernardino and 
Riverside, where they would spread out. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario has the bees swarming west into San Diego County, then moving 
north, across suburbs and up the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 But, most scientists note, the bees will do whatever they want to do -- and 
there's no point trying to outguess them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bees were detected in Yuma a year ago, experts predicted that they 
could reach Los Angeles by spring, 1995. Most are now revising that timetable, 
however, because the bees have been slowed by various factors, including a 
voracious parasitic mite that has killed many. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities used Monday's announcement to warn Southern Californians to brace 
themselves for the threat the bees will eventually pose. 
</P>
<P>
 A single, migrating swarm can travel 20 to 40 miles before establishing a new 
hive, picking almost any cavity for a nest. An Africanized bee colony typically 
swarms to set up new hives four to six times a year, and can colonize a 
hospitable neighborhood with 10 times as many hives as the more docile European 
honeybee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bees are not considered dangerous when they swarm or forage for 
nectar, they can be agitated almost instantly -- by noises or vibrations as far 
away as 100 feet -- once they have established a brood-filled hive. They 
sometimes chase their targets up to half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while their venom is no worse than that of the European bees, 1,000 
or more Africanized bees may attack a victim. Most normal, healthy adults can 
sustain up to 1,500 bee stings before the attack is lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 The advice for victims: Run quickly, in a straight line, seek shelter in a 
vehicle or building and then call 911 or seek medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the bees' arrival in Texas in 1990, only one person in the United States 
has died from an Africanized bee attack. He was an elderly man, allergic to 
bees, who tried to destroy a colony inside a wall with a flaming torch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bee experts say homeowners should search their property weekly for bee swarms 
and contact removal experts before the bees are settled and become 
ultra-defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The swarm at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison had not yet established a hive. 
The Inexorable March North 
</P>
<P>
 * 1956: Geneticist Warwick Kerr imports 54 African queen bees (Apis mellifera 
scutellatus) from South Africa and Tanzania to Brazil to breed with more docile 
European honeybees, to develop a more heat-tolerant strain of honeybees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1957: Twenty-six swarms of hybrid African and European honeybees, called 
Africanized honeybees, are unwittingly released from an outdoor apiary 
laboratory in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1982: The northward-moving migratory front reaches Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1985: Africanized bees are found for the first time in California. The bees 
hitchhiked to Kern County aboard oil drilling supplies shipped from Venezuela. 
The swarm is spotted by an oil field worker and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1987: The bees' natural migratory front reaches southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: The front reaches the United States. A swarm is discovered and 
destroyed at Hidalgo, Tex. Since then, only one person has died of an 
Africanized honeybee sting in Texas. An elderly man apparently allergic to bees 
used a torch to try to eradicate a swarm inside a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992: The San Diego Fire Department begins training firefighters in the 
rescue of victims of Africanized bee stings. By now, about 1,000 people have 
died from Africanized honeybee stings in South America, Central America and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: Africanized honeybees are discovered near Tucson. Later in the year, 
they reach Phoenix and several swarms are discovered in Yuma, near the 
California state line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spring, 1994: State agricultural officials brace for the arrival of 
Africanized honeybees in Imperial County -- but none are detected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 24, 1994: The first confirmed swarm of Africanized honeybees is 
discovered and destroyed at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison near Blythe in 
Riverside County.

ARABS, ISRAELIS PLAN BANK FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delegates to a Middle East economic conference agreed Monday to create a 
regionwide development bank that will include Israelis and Arabs on its board 
of directors and will concentrate on loans to job-creating private businesses, 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, to be created along with a regional tourist board and a chamber of 
commerce, will become the first official institution to bridge the Arab-Israeli 
conflict that has kept the region in turmoil for almost half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who advocated a four-point program 
centered on the establishment of a regional bank in a speech to the opening 
session Sunday of the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit, claimed 
victory in a Monday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of (the U.S. objectives) is being realized at this conference," 
Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab-Israeli conflict is coming to an end," he continued. "This area, 
which has been poisoned for too long by this conflict, can look forward to 
better days." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the three-day conference, attended by government officials and 
more than 1,000 business people from over 60 nations, was to underwrite the 
Arab-Israeli peace process by producing tangible improvements in the region's 
standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said a committee of experts will meet soon to work out details 
for the regional bank, a process they said will take about six months. Among 
the matters yet to be decided are the amount of initial capitalization needed 
and the shares that will be purchased by the West, by oil-rich countries of the 
Persian Gulf and by other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rumors of a $10-billion fund that circulated at the conference were 
said by officials close to the process to be far too high, European diplomats 
said the bank will be as well-financed as the one created to underwrite the 
transformation of the economies of the formerly Communist countries of Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the bank, unlike the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund, will emphasize loans to private businesses, rather than to 
governments, in an effort to generate jobs in both Israel and Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Christopher said, the bank will finance "cross-border projects" 
such as roads, water development and other facilities that "knit the region 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the region is very short on 
facilities that serve more than one or two countries, and most countries trade 
more with Europe, North America and even the Far East than with their immediate 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Christopher emphasized economic development as an underpinning for the 
recent peace agreements signed by Israel with Jordan and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, diplomats from the region noted the importance of 
Israelis and Arabs working together on development projects and in joint 
organizations such as the proposed chamber of commerce and tourist board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 10 heads of state or government and 60 Cabinet ministers attended the 
sessions, the conference's most significant work came in a series of seminars 
in which business leaders discussed regional development with government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia, the region's economic heavyweight, shunned most high-profile 
events at the conference, but Saudi business leaders were active participants 
in meetings dealing with development of regional energy, transportation and 
water projects -- which will require multimillion-dollar financing and offer 
work to their construction companies -- and with the expansion of the regional 
banking system. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said high-level Israeli government officials met privately with 
groups of business leaders from Saudi Arabia and other conservative monarchies 
of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 The activities in Casablanca seemed to drive the final stake into the heart of 
the Arab economic boycott of Israel. Almost everything that happened at the 
conference was a technical violation of the boycott, but nobody seemed to care. 
In effect, the boycott is ended, although it remains on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab boycott is a relic of the past," Christopher said. He predicted that 
the Arab League will vote soon, possibly at a special meeting, to repeal the 
boycott officially. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the league moves only by unanimous approval, and it is possible that 
several countries excluded from the Casablanca meeting -- such as Iraq, Libya 
and perhaps Syria -- would veto formal repeal.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON SEEKS SWING VOTES; FOE GETS KEY 
SUPPORT; REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGNS IN FRESNO AND VISALIA. FIVE DEFENSE INDUSTRY 
LEADERS ENDORSE FEINSTEIN, WHO CELEBRATES PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF DESERT BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington appealed to the swing voters of 
California's Central Valley on Monday while rival Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
celebrated her victory in passing the desert protection bill and won the 
endorsement -- rare for a Democrat -- of five top defense industry leaders in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The volatile Senate race surged toward Election Day next Tuesday with both 
candidates watching polls that showed the contest still close, although 
Feinstein's support was improving. The Field Poll found Feinstein beating her 
GOP rival 45% to 39% among the most likely voters -- a turnaround from last 
month when the same poll found the race dead even. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the poll respondents were queried after Huffington acknowledged that 
he violated federal law by employing an illegal immigrant at his home for a 
little more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaigned Monday in Fresno and Visalia, areas traditionally 
friendly to GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of shoring up (support), it's a matter of running (votes) 
up," said Huffington adviser Ken Khachigian, who was traveling with the 
candidate. "If we don't win this area by a big margin, we lose, no question." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Attorneys representing the Huffingtons paid $10,450 in back taxes and 
penalties to the Internal Revenue Service, correcting a violation stemming from 
the employment of their illegal immigrant nanny, Marisela Garcia. The 
Huffingtons released records showing that they paid three years of taxes for 
Garcia, but they acknowledged that no taxes were paid for the first year of her 
employment. Campaign officials did not say how much of the settlement 
represented back taxes and how much was penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington attorneys also approached the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service on Monday but were told that any penalties would not be determined 
until after the election. Federal law prohibits employers from hiring illegal 
immigrants and requires that they check employees for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Huffington campaign released two signed statements from the illegal 
immigrant and her husband, Fermin Garcia. In a one-paragraph statement dated 
Monday, Marisela Garcia confirmed the Huffingtons' statement that she had not 
worked for them since August, 1993. Her husband, also an illegal immigrant, 
signed a two-page statement, saying he had never worked for the family, 
countering sources who have told The Times that Fermin Garcia was paid for 
doing various temporary work at the home. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, President Clinton signed the California Desert Protection Act 
into law Monday, ending a long congressional battle to put nearly 8 million 
acres of fragile Southern California land off limits to developers. Feinstein 
celebrated the event in Los Angeles with leaders of the Sierra Club, which 
supported the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein won the endorsement of five top defense industry leaders from 
Northrop Grumman Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co., Douglas Aircraft, Rockwell 
International and TRW. At a news conference, the leaders countered Huffington's 
contention that Feinstein's support for defense cuts has cost jobs in 
California and jeopardized military preparedness. They said Feinstein has 
fought hard for a number of military projects that have saved thousands of 
California jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington's campaign produced a new television commercial that sought to 
draw a basic contrast between the two candidates. "When you strip away all of 
the campaign rhetoric, simple truths emerge," the candidate says, speaking to 
the camera. "I've consistently voted for lower spending and lower taxes. Mrs. 
Feinstein has consistently voted for higher spending and higher taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also indicated in an interview on the Michael Jackson radio talk 
show Monday that she will end her campaign on a high note, producing a positive 
television commercial that will highlight some of her accomplishments in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein's day began with a surprise when she was being driven to her 
morning news conference and happened upon a bicyclist who had been struck by a 
car moments earlier. Feinstein ordered her staff to stop the car and call 911. 
Campaign officials said she put her red suit jacket over the bleeding victim to 
keep him warm until an ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein endorsement from the defense companies was perhaps most 
significant because the industry leaders rebutted one of Huffington's major 
complaints about his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has said that Feinstein's support for a reduction in the defense 
budget cost thousands of jobs in California and threatened the nation's 
military preparedness. The Republican candidate has said that he would support 
a larger defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense industry leaders praised Feinstein for her understanding of their 
issues and for fighting for their projects. They acknowledged defense industry 
downsizing, but said that the cuts would probably have been larger if Feinstein 
was not such a strong advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us here are fighting very hard to make sure the American public 
understands the importance of defense, and I believe Dianne Feinstein does very 
well," said Kent Kresa, chairman, chief executive officer and president of 
Northrop Grumman Corp. "There are certain realities in how far one can go and I 
would say that Dianne Feinstein does her homework, understands what the issues 
are and has fought very hard for a lot of programs that probably would be a lot 
smaller today had she not been out there to make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry leaders said they were speaking as individuals, not on behalf of 
their companies and their employees. Those joining Kresa were C. Michael 
Armstrong, chairman and CEO of Hughes Aircraft Co.; Robert Hood, president of 
Douglas Aircraft; Sam Iacobellis, executive vice president and deputy chairman 
of Rockwell International; and Tim Hannemann, executive vice president of TRW 
Space and Electronics Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said of their support, "These endorsements are very important to me 
because they come from California business leaders who understand the need for 
effective representation in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the morning, Feinstein met with supporters of the desert bill to 
celebrate the presidential signing. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill creates the largest U.S. wilderness area outside of Alaska and 
designates two new national parks in Death Valley and Joshua Tree. Much of the 
east Mojave Desert becomes a national preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House ceremony, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), along with other 
key legislators and environmental activists, joined Clinton for the signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a deeply satisfying moment," said Miller, chairman of the Natural 
Resources Committee, who oversaw the bill's sometimes rocky journey through the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, desert bill supporters praised Feinstein's help. "No one in 
this room should have any doubts at all: Without Dianne Feinstein, we would not 
have gotten a desert bill," said Sam Schuchat, executive director of the 
California League of Conservation Voters. "Sending her back to Washington is 
one of the most important things we can do this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Central Valley, Huffington attacked "the liberal media" for writing 
negative stories about his campaign. In a speech to a bipartisan club of about 
350 people, Huffington emphasized his theme that he is a Republican who is 
tough on crime running against a big-spending Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a career politician who has been in office for almost 25 years," he 
said. "You have a candidate like myself who has spent 20 years, like all of 
you, in business, and only got involved (in government) two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his speech, Huffington seemed more relaxed than in recent days, 
even joking about the firestorm of publicity that has surrounded his admission 
of hiring an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all . . . I want to apologize over the last couple of days for 
taking away so much media attention from the O.J. Simpson trial," Huffington 
said. "My wife and I both agree that next Tuesday that I have a good chance of 
winning this race if we can just maintain our honeymoon with the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington made no mention of his support for Proposition 187, the ballot 
measure that would cut health and education benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington increasingly has blamed the media for trying to hinder his 
campaign. In recent days, the Huffingtons have argued that reporters covering 
the race were tools of the Feinstein campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a candidate who will not only stand up to the politicians, but who 
will stand up to the liberal press," Huffington said. "And they don't like it 
at all, because I have gone around them and gone directly to you -- the 
people."

JURY ADDS $5 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO TAILHOOK VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury Monday ordered the Las Vegas Hilton and its parent company to 
pay former Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin $5 million in punitive damages, bringing her 
total award to $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Vegas Hilton and Hilton Hotels Corp. were found guilty on Friday of 
failing to provide adequate security at the 1991 Tailhook convention, where 
Coughlin and more than 80 other women said they were sexually assaulted by 
drunken Navy and Marine aviators. Coughlin settled for an undisclosed amount 
with the Tailhook Assn. before the trial against the hotel started. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-man, four-woman jury awarded her $1.7 million in compensatory damages 
after deliberating for one day and returned Monday afternoon to begin 
deliberating the punitive damage award. They handed up their decision less than 
one hour after hearing testimony about the company's assets and arguments from 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think justice was served," Coughlin said afterward, speaking with reporters 
for the first time since the trial began Sept. 12. "This sends a message that 
you can't tolerate abusing women even for making money." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin testified earlier that she was trapped in the hotel's third-floor 
hallway on the Saturday night of the convention by a group of men who shoved 
their hands down her bra and tried to reach up her skirt and pull off her 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin's attorney urged jurors to issue a multimillion-dollar award "to get 
the (Hilton) shareholders' attention" in order to prevent future assaults or to 
get some company executives removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen to Mr. (Eugene) Wait's comments, they're still equating the 
damage done to Paula Coughlin and her life to a broken lamp," Dennis Schoville, 
one of Coughlin's attorneys, said of the lead Hilton attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait said Monday that the Hilton had been punished enough by all of the 
negative publicity surrounding the women's allegations and by the $1.7-million 
compensatory award. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the message has already found its way to the Las Vegas 
Hilton," he said. "Your verdict punished the Hilton." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait tried to discourage the jury from giving Coughlin a punitive damage award 
by telling them they'd be hurting other Americans and their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans and others have invested their money in this company. These are the 
people that you'll affect. That's really what you're talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial statements introduced in court Monday showed the net worth of Hilton 
Hotel Corp. at $1.089 billion and the Las Vegas Hilton at $274 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, who has been unemployed since leaving the Navy in June, said she 
hopes now to "slip into obscurity." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to paint my house," she said. "I just want to go home."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 186; BANK MEMO ABOUT EFFECT OF SINGLE-PAYER 
PLAN IS DENOUNCED; AMERICAN SAVINGS EMPLOYEES ARE TOLD THAT TAX HIKES MANDATED 
BY THE MEASURE WOULD BRING BENEFIT CUTS AND ENDANGER THEIR RETIREMENT PLAN. 
INITIATIVE BACKERS DECRY 'COERCIVE TACTICS.' 
</P>

<P>
 The corporate campaign against the single-payer health care initiative, 
Proposition 186, took a new turn Monday with release of a memo from the head of 
American Savings Bank warning employees that big tax increases mandated by the 
initiative would end company contributions to the employee retirement plan and 
force other cuts in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative supporters who gathered outside the bank's branch in Downtown Los 
Angeles released copies of the memo and said they intend to file a complaint of 
unfair campaign practices against the bank over what they termed "coercive 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, drafted by Mario J. Antoci, chief executive officer of the bank, 
said that if Proposition 186 passes it will cost the company an additional $6 
million annually in medical benefits because of a new payroll tax of 8.9% on 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, where would we get the additional $6 million that Proposition 186 would 
cost? We would be forced to reduce our other benefit areas to make up the 
shortfall," Antoci said, and pointed to the $4.8 million the company puts into 
its 401(k) retirement plan and another $1.2 million in the payroll-benefit 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief executive officer ended the memo by explaining that although he will 
vote "no" on Proposition 186, he wanted his employees "to make an informed and 
independent decision based on what's best for you and your family." 
</P>
<P>
 The supporters of the measure complained that the bank, by paying the cost of 
putting out the memo to its 3,500 employees statewide, was making what amounted 
to an in-kind contribution to the campaign to defeat the initiative. They 
argued that the contribution should be reported to the secretary of state, 
which has not been done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an underhanded tactic (to) lean on your employees like this and try to 
influence their vote," said Jeff Wagner, a spokesman for the initiative 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings Bank fired back with a statement that the memo had nothing to 
do with the formal anti-Proposition 186 campaign and was generated internally 
to keep its employees informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Savings Bank made no contributions to Proposition 186. American does 
not make corporate contributions regarding propositions," said Dianne L. 
Seeber, a vice president of the bank. A statement released by the bank 
reiterated that it "would never presume to advise employees how to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat generated by the memo reflects the high level of concern in many 
corporate boardrooms over Proposition 186, a sweeping proposal that would 
dismantle the current health system based on private insurance and replace it 
with a state-run system. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, State Farm Insurance has disclosed contributions of more than 
$900,000 to kill the initiative. Nearly all of that went into letters mailed to 
State Farm's 2.5 million policyholders in California calling the initiative 
"bad medicine" and urging them to vote against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Farm letters, signed by agents or company executives, cite massive 
new tax increases proposed by the initiative to pay for the new system and 
point to studies saying that the measure could lead to the loss of 300,000 
jobs. The letters close with the statement that the current health care system 
is not perfect "but Proposition 186 is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 PacificCare of California, a health provider, also disclosed that it sent out 
600,000 letters to policyholders and physicians that criticized the initiative 
in strong terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters and the memo were one-sided and did not mention what supporters of 
the measure consider Proposition 186's strong suits: cradle-to-grave health 
coverage that could not be taken away because of illness or job loss, studies 
that show Californians would save -- even with the tax increases -- significant 
money by being freed of insurance premiums, and current inequities that deny 
coverage to an estimated 6 million state residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure complain not only about the content but also about 
the use of customer dollars for what they claim are political purposes.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; RIVALS EXCHANGE HYPOCRISY BARBS ON FUND 
RAISING; BROWN ACCUSES WILSON OF PROTECTING CONTRIBUTOR FROM INS WHEN HE WAS 
SENATOR. THE GOVERNOR'S CAMP CLAIMS HIS FOE SHOWED FAVORITISM TOWARD UNION THAT 
GAVE $86,000 TO HER CAMPAIGN.

 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown and Gov. Pete Wilson traded 
charges of hypocrisy Monday, with Brown calling Wilson "trick or treat Pete" 
and Wilson campaign officials telling Brown to "look in the mirror" before she 
accuses the incumbent Republican of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown began the day at a Sherman Oaks news conference, where she held up a 
letter that then-Sen. Wilson sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
on behalf of a campaign contributor in 1989. In the letter, Wilson urges the 
INS to "meet immediately" with San Diego hotel owner Anne Evans, who was under 
investigation for employing illegal immigrants. Wilson also suggests that a 
raid of Evans' hotels was not "helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sheer hypocrisy to say you support employer sanctions and want to stop 
illegal immigration and then turn around and put your friends who are employing 
illegal aliens above the law," said Brown. She said Wilson reminded her of Rep. 
Mike Huffington, who -- despite his support for Proposition 187, which would 
deny health and education services to illegal immigrants -- recently admitted 
to hiring an illegal immigrant child-care worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is incumbent Pete Wilson: Do as I say, not as I do," said Brown, who 
criticized her opponent for "beating the anti-immigrant drum so loudly." 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown rode a campaign bus to Long Beach and San Diego to repeat her claims, 
Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur issued a statement decrying what he called 
Brown's "campaign trash." 
</P>
<P>
 "All Sen. Pete Wilson ever did was suggest a meeting between the INS and one 
of his constituents, and even the INS says that he did nothing to influence the 
outcome of their investigation," Schnur said. "But if Kathleen Brown wants to 
talk about doing favors for campaign contributors, she ought to look in the 
mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said that state Treasurer Brown "tried to get a state contractor fired 
on behalf of a public employees' union that has given her $86,000 in campaign 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur provided reporters with copies of a letter Brown wrote to the state 
labor commissioner trying to get a company called Helix Electric barred from 
doing state business. The letter came after several charges filed against Helix 
Electric by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers were settled or 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that's a candidate who's willing to help out special interests," Schnur 
said. "And that's what I'd call a hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials responded that Helix Electric, too, was a major 
Wilson contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helix Electric has given at least $25,000 to Pete Wilson," said spokesman 
Steven M. Glazer. "So Wilson now is claiming that Kathleen Brown was unfair to 
one of his campaign contributors in defense of his hypocrisy on illegal 
immigration. Go figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was in Vacaville Monday, where Genentech, the bio-technology company, 
is planning a $150-million expansion that will bring 300 new jobs. Wilson 
called the expansion "great news . . . proof that California continues to lead 
the world in the cutting edge technology that has long made our state the place 
where the continent ends, but the future begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson lauded Republican and Democratic legislators alike for working to 
reform the state's jobs climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attacked fraud and abuse in the workers' comp system to reduce costs for 
small businesses by nearly a third. We enacted sweeping tax incentives to 
promote investment in R&D . . . We streamlined regulations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said his Administration is seeking a tax deferral for biotech companies 
and he proposed a new technology tax credit as well to encourage investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Wilson attended a fund-raising luncheon in San Francisco and 
a crime victims meeting in Ontario, while Brown headed south to San Diego to go 
trick-or-treating with two of her grandchildren.

AREA'S SMOG YEAR ALMOST AS CLEAN AS RECORD 1993 
</P>

 In Glendora, the nation's smog capital, the quality of the air depends on your 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of once every 18 days since May, the town at the foot of the San 
Gabriel Mountains has been smothered by air deemed so unsafe to breathe that 
even healthy people were warned to stay indoors. But as bleak as that seems, 
1994 has been a breath of fresh air for Glendora and other Southland cities 
compared to the foul 1970s and much of the 1980s, when smog alerts and summer 
afternoons went hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Embracing the good news/bad news philosophy of a longtime sufferer, the 
four-county Southland ended its May-through-October smog season Monday closely 
mirroring 1993, which was the cleanest year in more than 40 years of 
record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 By a slim margin, this year set a record low for ozone-based smog alerts in 
the basin that comprises Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties, according to measurements by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. Stage 1 alerts occurred on 23 days compared to 24 days in 1993, 41 in 
1992 and 121 days in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, health advisories, which mean the pollution poses a serious 
threat but not enough for a full-scale alert, were recorded on 96 days, up 
slightly from 92 days in 1993 and much better than 1992's 109. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend toward milder smog seasons is promising to local and state air 
quality officials, who believe their regulations have set the Los Angeles Basin 
on a permanent path toward meeting the elusive goal of blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The peak concentration of ozone -- a colorless, lung-scarring oxidizing gas 
that is the Southland's most pervasive pollutant -- has dropped 33% in 15 
years, largely because of emissions controls on cars and industrial plants, 
according to AQMD data. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD senior meteorologist Joseph Cassmassi said even with stagnant air and 
other weather conditions that foster ozone, he does not expect the Southland to 
return to the severe levels of the past. Annual smog alerts for ozone, he said, 
will probably never top 35 days -- as they did in 1992 -- and could soon dip 
below 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect with pretty adverse weather conditions we would see 30 to 35 
episodes. Keep in mind, 10 years ago, it would have been 100 episodes under 
those same conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time, however, the air remains unhealthful. An average of once 
every two to three days, or 118 days this year, the national health standard 
for ozone was violated in at least one part of the basin. This year's worst 
ozone concentration -- 0.3 parts per million recorded in Glendora on Aug. 5 -- 
exceeded the standard 2 1/2 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more distressing, AQMD officials say the Southland will keep violating 
the health limit at least through 2010 -- even if every element of its 
controversial anti-smog plan, which will cost at least $5 billion a year, is 
enacted. Next week, the California Air Resources Board meets in Sacramento to 
decide whether to adopt a far-reaching 20-year clean air plan for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Henry Gong, a USC medical professor who has performed numerous studies on 
urban air pollution, said 1994's concentrations of ozone remained severe enough 
to gradually deplete the lung function of even healthy adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is we still have the nation's worst ozone concentrations and the 
concern is not so much acute health effects, but chronic health effects," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical research shows lungs seem to age prematurely from the ozone in the Los 
Angeles Basin's air. Glendora residents suffered twice as much loss of lung 
function every year than residents of Tucson, which does not have an ozone 
pollution problem, according to studies by UCLA scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an insidious type of thing. You don't have to be symptomatic. When you 
breathe ozone it causes changes in your airways that you don't realize," Gong 
said. "It's like hypertension, sort of a silent killer. Ozone decreases your 
breathing reserve, and perhaps other reserves in your body. It also makes you 
more susceptible to lung infections." 
</P>
<P>
 During smog alerts, the air is deemed unsafe for everyone within the affected 
area, and even healthy people are advised to avoid the outdoors or risk 
symptoms of acute smog sickness, such as chest pain, shortness of breath and 
stinging eyes, as well as long-term lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even highly trained, healthy athletes can suffer. In Gong's 1984 studies, 
Olympic cyclists exposed to Stage 1 levels of ozone in a smog chamber had 
substantially worsened lung function and exercise performance and symptoms such 
as shortness of breath. Their cycling performance also worsened at a much lower 
concentration, one that frequently occurs throughout the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Asthmatics and people with other lung diseases also say they can notice the 
difference between a good smog year and a bad one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anecdotally, my clinical impression is the cleaner the air the better the 
lung health of my patients," said Gong, who treats respiratory patients as 
chief of environmental health service at Rancho Los Amigos Medical School in 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Although anti-smog rules deserve credit for the long-term decline in ozone, 
when it comes to year-to-year fluctuations, weather is the key factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone, or photochemical smog, is formed when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides 
released by motor vehicles, industries and other sources react with strong 
sunlight and are trapped near the ground by inversion layers. Cloudy skies and 
ocean breezes prevent its formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassmassi said 1994 turned out much milder than expected because of strong sea 
breezes in late August and September, which usually is one of the smoggiest 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 No alerts have been recorded for almost three months. A low-pressure area 
hovered off the coast, drawing southerly winds through the atmosphere and 
weakening the inversion layer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an extraordinarily clean two-month period," Cassmassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 An early hot, smoggy streak in June and cool late-summer breezes canceled each 
other out, bringing average weather conditions for the year that neither 
fostered nor deterred heavy ozone buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the pollutants that create ozone are emitted mostly near the coast but 
move toward the mountains before reacting, ozone is most severe in the San 
Gabriel, Santa Clarita and San Bernardino valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora, Crestline, Fontana, San Bernardino, Redlands, Upland and Santa 
Clarita suffered the worst smog in the four counties this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While maintaining its stigma as the U.S. smog capital, Glendora, in the 
eastern San Gabriel Valley, suffered dramatically fewer days of severe smog 
this year than last. Glendora's 10 smog alerts compared to 19 in 1993, and 
Azusa, with two alert days this year and 11 last year, vastly improved. 
Pasadena and Pomona also had good years. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Los Angeles -- which many people wrongly perceive as a symbol of smog 
-- has experienced no alerts for two years in a row, compared to eight a decade 
ago. Riverside fared almost as well, with two alert days, better than 1993's 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Orange County's air worsened a bit, with two alert days in 
La Habra and one in Anaheim, while there were none in 1993. Air quality also 
declined in San Bernardino (eight alert days), Santa Clarita (six alert days), 
Crestline (nine alert days) and Fontana (nine alert days). 
</P>
<P>
 Cassmassi said those areas probably worsened because of temporary, local wind 
patterns, not increases in emissions there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has a much less severe ozone problem than the Los Angeles 
Basin, but the county still violated the federal health standard 15 days this 
year, an increase of two days from last year but much fewer than in the 1980s. 
The county had no smog alerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ozone season has ended, the Southland's other pollution problems 
have just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide, which can endanger heart patients, and nitrogen-based 
pollution that causes a whiskey-brown haze, peak in winter weather conditions. 
Although those pollutants can reach levels severe enough to trigger health 
alerts, they too, have been steadily declining.

BORDER CROSSERS SHIFT EFFORTS TO PORT OF ENTRY; IMMIGRATION: CRACKDOWN STYMIES 
SMUGGLERS USING CANYONS, OPEN TERRAIN. ATTEMPTS TO SNEAK THROUGH SAN YSIDRO IN 
VEHICLES AND WITH FAKE DOCUMENTS RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Smugglers frustrated by a month-old Border Patrol crackdown have mounted a 
concerted assault on the San Ysidro port of entry, immigration officials said 
Monday, citing brazen incidents this weekend in which vehicles crashed through 
inspection gates and sped north. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to sneak past border inspectors with vehicles and fake documents 
skyrocketed in October, according to statistics released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smugglers' frustration level is rising," said Rudy Murillo, a spokesman 
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensifying pressure on the freeway port of entry results from the 
success of the Border Patrol's Operation Gatekeeper, which since Oct. 1 has 
doubled the Border Patrol deployment guarding the 14-mile San Diego-Tijuana 
boundary. As the show of force makes it more difficult for illegal immigrants 
to elude capture in canyons and open terrain, smugglers are probing the 
international freeway crossings with a mix of subterfuge and aggressiveness, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to 1993, the number of illegal crossers caught using fraudulent 
immigration documents in October went up about 85%, while those with 
counterfeit or altered passports went up 129%. There were 491 attempted entries 
without inspection -- a 643% increase in illegal immigrants trying to sneak 
through on foot or hidden in vehicles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, a pickup truck zoomed through the closed gate of Lane 6 
of the port of entry, officials said. Four hours later, two cars did the same. 
The suspected smugglers eluded pursuing inspectors in both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potentially disturbing sign was the arrest last week of a U.S. Customs 
Service inspector accused of complicity with smugglers. Investigators arrested 
him after discovering three vans packed with 68 illegal immigrants approaching 
his inspection booth at the San Ysidro port of entry and learning that the vans 
had been seen at his home earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The case raises fears that the smugglers' new focus on the port of entry could 
result in more attempts to bribe inspectors. Corruption is always a risk 
because of the wealth of smuggling rings and the considerable autonomy of 
inspectors at the world's busiest border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a concern," said Jeff Casey, the deputy special agent in charge 
of Customs Service investigations in San Diego. "If you've got an inspector at 
the port of entry, you've got the keys to the kingdom. All you have to do is 
get him to let one load through and then you've got him for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators are trying to determine how long the suspect, eight-year 
Customs Service veteran Guy Henry Kmett, worked with the sophisticated 
smuggling ring and whether other inspectors were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Operation Gatekeeper, the INS has deployed a special team of 
inspectors drawn from across the country to reinforce the port of entry. The 
Immediate Response Team members are experts in detecting document fraud and are 
to help guard against "port runners," who are difficult to stop if they make it 
past inspection booths onto Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol made 24,768 arrests in San Diego last month -- a 20% drop 
compared to last year. The statistics suggest that the operation is deterring 
border crossers and increasing the agents' effectiveness, officials said.

RUSSIAN WINS PARLIAMENT SEAT AND IMMUNITY; ELECTION: SERGEI MAVRODI BILKED 
THOUSANDS WITH HIS MMM PYRAMID SCHEME. BUT VOTERS TOOK HIM AT HIS WORD AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Taking his investment firm's you-can-be-rich message to the political arena, 
the protagonist of Russia's biggest post-Communist financial scandal has won a 
seat in Parliament and immunity from prosecution as an alleged tax evader, 
according to election returns Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Mavrodi, whose MMM financial giant provoked panic among millions of 
investors when its ballooning share prices collapsed in July, was declared the 
winner over 11 rivals in Sunday's special election to select a new 
representative for a north suburban Moscow district in the Duma, Parliament's 
lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Mavrodi, freed from jail to run but barred by court order from 
leaving Moscow, promised in a flood of leaflets and television ads to spend 
$100 million improving the depressed military-industrial district and getting 
every household there a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that government meddling had provoked MMM's collapse, he also told the 
estimated 36,000 MMM investors in the 489,000-voter district that his election 
and consequent immunity from prosecution would be their best hope for 
recovering the value of their depressed shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have new chances to defend the rights of my shareholders," Mavrodi said 
through a spokesman Monday after election officials announced that he had 
finished first with 27.8% of the vote, nearly double that of his nearest 
challenger. No runoffs are held in races for Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The election, called after the district's deputy was gunned down 
gangland-style in April, was closely watched as an indicator of the national 
mood two years before Russians are scheduled to elect a new president. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared to show that most people are disillusioned by politics -- fewer 
than one-third of those eligible voted -- and that any candidate appealing 
aggressively to their most selfish interests can win, especially in such a 
divided field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of (the voters) were ready to believe anybody who would promise to make 
them wealthy," said Alexander Fyodorov, one of the also-rans. "They voted not 
for a political program but for a sack of money. . . . It is a Wizard of Oz 
they elected to Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Zharov, Communist mayor of the district town of Solnechnogorsk, 
finished second with 14.5% of the vote. Millionaire democrat Konstantin 
Borovoi, a free-marketeer who promised that his "business contacts" would 
enrich the district, was third with 13.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov finished sixth with 5.9%. His Russian National Unity party, whose 
swastika-bearing supporters flashed straight-armed salutes, failed to match the 
surprising success of neo-fascist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in last year's 
parliamentary election. In fact, the ultranationalist camp split, as 
Zhirinovsky backed Mavrodi in hopes of future financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodi's investment fund became the hottest game in Russia last spring, 
promising 3,000% annual dividends. Lured by slick, fictional TV ads that showed 
poor Russians cashing in MMM shares to buy apartments in Paris and jet to 
tropical vacations, millions bought in, and many indeed became wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investigators called MMM a classic pyramid scheme that used income 
from new investors to buy back shares from old investors at ever-rising prices. 
The price of one share rose from 1,000 rubles in February to 125,000 rubles 
(then more than $60,000) in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the government announced that MMM was under investigation, investors 
panicked and soon there was no more new money to buy back old shares. Many 
Russians lost their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodi was arrested Aug. 4 on charges that another of his companies evaded 
taxes and that he was obstructing the investigation. MMM suspended trading but 
did not close down. Freed from jail Oct. 12, Mavrodi promised voters that, if 
elected, he could restore MMM shares, now valued at 13,000 rubles each, to 
their July value within three months. He didn't say how. 
</P>
<P>
 MMM offices received instructions from Mavrodi to reopen today but to keep the 
trading in old shares suspended until Jan. 1. Instead, MMM will sell new shares 
for 1,000 rubles each, with promises to raise the price twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gennady Ponomarev, the Moscow city prosecutor, said the investigation of 
Mavrodi will continue. If there is enough evidence to bring a criminal case to 
court, he added, the government will ask the Duma to strip Mavrodi of his 
immunity.

 Thirty-six governorships are up for grabs, and whoever controls the 
statehouses will have the opportunity to influence the 1996 presidential 
contest, particularly in the larger states. It's more than simply a matter of 
Republicans versus Democrats; this year, seven independents are either serious 
contenders or are influencing their races. Here is a look at some key races: 
</P>
<P>
 Florida: Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles and Republican Jeb Bush, son of former 
President George Bush, are in a dead heat. Bush has focused his campaign on 
pledges of no new taxes and getting tough on crime. Chiles is turning the 
popular "throw the bums out" sentiment on its head, blasting his younger 
opponent's ideas as untried and unworkable. The Bush campaign is airing an ad 
that features a murdered girl's mother, who attacks Chiles for refusing to sign 
the killer's death warrant. Chiles backs the death penalty and has countered 
with an ad that claims his hands have been tied by the judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
 New York: Boosted by the endorsement of New York's Republican Mayor Rudolph W. 
Giuliani, three-term Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has soared into the lead 
against Republican state Sen. George Pataki. In two weeks, Cuomo has 
transformed a nine-percentage-point poll deficit into a 10-point lead. He also 
was heartened by a New York Times' position that "not only recommend(s) his 
reelection; we urge it as essential to New York's progress." Pataki has ripped 
Cuomo's opposition to the death penalty, while Cuomo has ridiculed Pataki's 
plan for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas: Democratic Gov. Ann Richards is running neck and neck with Republican 
businessman George W. Bush, another son of the ex-President. Most women are 
siding with Richards and most men are choosing Bush. Recent press coverage of a 
probe into Bush's sale of stock has hurt him, and Richards has capitalized on 
it by portraying him as an "unsuccessful" and "unethical" businessman simply 
riding on the name of his father. She also has touted her own support of 
abortion rights. Bush has repeatedly argued that it is "time for change," 
charging that Richards has been soft on crime and has allowed the welfare rolls 
to swell. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania: In one of 15 races without an incumbent, Rep. Tom Ridge has a 
good shot to recapture the state's top job for the GOP. One poll shows Ridge 12 
points ahead of Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, while another has him ahead by 
a couple of points. Ridge's campaign has labeled Singel as soft on crime and 
recently included an ad similar to the controversial Willie Horton spot used in 
the 1988 presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee. Ridge and Singel 
are both moderates, support abortion rights and have presented similar economic 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine: In a three-way battle, former Democratic Gov. Joe Brennan has 
lengthened his lead in the polls over independent businessman Angus King and 
former GOP state Cabinet official Susan Collins, who appears to be out of the 
running. King has attempted to tap into the pervasive anti-politician mood and 
has identified himself as a friend to the business community. Brennan has 
sought to show King as a foe of environmental and liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia: In another nasty campaign, Democratic Gov. Zell Miller is holding a 
slim lead over millionaire GOP businessman Guy Millner. Millner's ads have 
tried to make an issue of his opponent's close association with President 
Clinton -- showing them watching the Super Bowl together, for instance. The 
Republican also has attacked the governor's position on welfare. Miller, 
meanwhile, has accused Millner of not paying state income taxes and has 
criticized him for running a negative campaign. But the governor has drawn flak 
for refusing to remove the Confederate symbol from the state's flag. Democrats

KIDNAPED CALIFORNIA MAN, 3 BRITONS RESCUED IN INDIA; TERRORISM: CAPTIVES FACED 
THREATS OF BEHEADING BY MUSLIM GROUP DEMANDING THE RELEASE OF 10 EXTREMISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The armed struggle over Kashmir reached into India's capital Monday when a 
militant Muslim group announced it had kidnaped an American and three Britons 
here and would behead them, one after the other, unless the Indian government 
freed 10 of the captors' jailed "brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hostages are as yet unhurt," claimed the little-known group, which 
identified itself as Al Hadid. "Whether they remain that way is the sole 
responsibility of the Indian government." 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours of the delivery of its claim and demands to the Voice of 
America and British Broadcasting Corp., the American, identified as Bela Josef 
Nuss of the San Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek, was found unharmed in a house 
near New Delhi, shackled by one of his legs to a post, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Information obtained from three of Nuss' captors led police early this morning 
to the hide-out where the Britons were being held, and they too were freed in 
an operation that cost a police inspector and a constable their lives, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuss told police he had been kidnaped 10 days before. The raid that freed him 
came in the grimy industrial settlement of Ghaziabad after police spied someone 
leaping over a back wall from a house already linked to criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers crashed into the residence and found Nuss, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, when I heard noises, I felt good, I knew something was happening, and 
then came the policemen," the 43-year-old Nuss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as a "frequent traveler," Nuss told the Associated Press 
that a Kashmiri man he met in a New Delhi hotel offered to take him to a 
wedding. They traveled to Mussoorie, a desolate area near Ghaziabad, east of 
New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no wedding. "I realized something was wrong," Nuss said. "When I 
told them on the third day that I want to go back to Delhi, they told me a big 
no." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told by the kidnapers that they were holding me and three . . . Britons 
as captives separately and we would be freed when their friends got released 
from Indian jails," Nuss said at Ghaziabad police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they captured one militant and injured another in a shootout with 
guerrillas at the hide-out in Uttar Pradesh state where Nuss was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Omkarnath Sharma, Ghaziabad police spokesman, said the injured militant and 
two men who had been helping Nuss' kidnapers gave them the location of a house 
in Saharanpur, another city in Uttar Pradesh about 100 miles north of New 
Delhi, where the Britons were being held. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 this morning, a Ghaziabad inspector and a team of constables aided by 
local officers surrounded the home. They knocked on the door but got no answer. 
When they tried to force open the door, Sharma said, there was a burst of 
gunfire from inside, and the inspector and a constable were mortally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Britons were freed unharmed, Sharma said. He said he had no further 
details of the early morning raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Britons were identified by the BBC as Paul Ridout, Miles Croston and 
Rhys Partridge. Photocopies of their passports, like Nuss', were delivered to 
the New Delhi bureaus of the VOA and BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the hostage crisis was resolved, it could still prove an embarrassing 
setback in India's campaign to convince its people and the world that the 
situation in the strife-racked state of Jammu and Kashmir has been normalized 
to the point where free and fair elections can be held to fill state offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping of what appeared to be foreign tourists in India's capital could 
also deal another blow to the country's travel industry, still reeling from the 
enormous number of cancellations sparked by an earlier outbreak of plague in 
the western city of Surat and Bombay's state of Maharashtra. 
</P>
<P>
 As confirmation of the high stakes involved in Monday's events, virtually the 
entire top brass of the New Delhi police force was said by Indian media on 
Monday night to be discussing strategies to deal with a genuine "crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter delivered to the VOA office by post office courier Monday 
afternoon, Al Hadid included two Polaroid snapshots of the captives, who it 
said were recently abducted in New Delhi and were in confinement "somewhere in 
India." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westerners were shown held at gunpoint by hooded captors, and a copy of an 
Indian newspaper dated Oct. 26 was prominently displayed in one photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless our brothers are released, the guests of the Indian government will be 
beheaded one at a time," the letter warned. "Since the Indian government 
clearly understands the situation, it will bear full responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 It gave 10 names of people it demanded be freed, at least half of whom are 
arrested members of the various militant organizations fighting to end India's 
rule in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Sajjad Afghani, is believed to belong to the Harkat ul Ansar group 
responsible for kidnaping two British trekkers in the disputed north Indian 
state this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two Britons, a 17-year-old student and a 36-year-old video director, 
were released unharmed June 24 after 17 days in captivity. Like the latest 
kidnap victims, the hikers were grabbed to blackmail Indian authorities into 
releasing Kashmiri separatists.

MACEDONIAN'S VICTORY HAS A BITTER TASTE; BALKANS: PRESIDENT KIRO GLIGOROV HAS 
BEEN REELECTED HANDILY. BUT ETHNIC CONFLICT REMAINS A THREAT IN THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC. 
</P>

<P>
 For a man freshly rewarded for peacefully piloting this former Yugoslav 
republic to independence, President Kiro Gligorov exuded little semblance of 
victory Monday after his Alliance for Macedonia won an unassailable lock on 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 With Greece strangling the country with an economic blockade, U.N. sanctions 
against Serbia having cost Macedonia $3 billion and the region's ethnic 
conflicts poised to spread here, Gligorov emerged from the elections with a 
sobering vision of the perils that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel a sense of triumph," the president conceded in an interview, 
even as his moderate coalition was racking up a commanding majority in the 
120-seat national assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 International election monitors described the two-stage voting for president 
and Parliament that concluded Sunday as reasonably free and fair, considering 
the instability of the Balkans and the fledgling nature of democratic reform 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote was marred by low turnout and an opposition boycott, ostensibly 
to protest widespread fraud, leaving the new leadership with the one-party look 
of the old Communist monopoly replaced during Macedonia's first pluralist vote 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A final tally is not expected until later this week, but Gligorov's Alliance 
is projected to win at least 90 seats, a good deal more than the two-thirds 
needed to ensure passage of constitutional issues. Most of the rest of the 
seats are likely to go to two ethnic Albanian parties aligned with Gligorov, 
who has battled the kind of aggressive nationalism that brought war to Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the economy nose-diving and the defeated nationalist opposition 
threatening social unrest, the 2.2 million people of Macedonia appear headed 
for a winter of discontent that could crush the last fragile barriers to an 
expanded Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats and officials with the 1,100-strong U.N. peacekeeping force 
here assessed the election results as a demonstration of resistance to ethnic 
unrest despite the boycott by the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The example of Bosnia, where a nationalist Serb rebellion against independence 
has killed 200,000 and made 2 million homeless, has served as a deterrent to 
ethnic conflict in Macedonia, where Albanians constitute more than 30% of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gligorov and foreign observers dejectedly concede that whether Macedonia 
escapes the violent horrors visited on other former Yugoslav republics depends 
more on the actions of leaders in the countries that surround it than on the 
laudable political moderation exhibited within. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pleased at all by the fundamental principles of democracy that have 
been violated in Bosnia," Gligorov said, characterizing a five-nation proposal 
to partition Bosnia on ethnic lines as a recipe for regional disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community has also been slow to ease Macedonia's economic 
woes, which diplomats and the special U.N. envoy for Macedonia, Hugo Anson, 
warn could play into the hands of the disgruntled opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Anson praised the United Nations for "putting its money where its mouth is" by 
deploying U.S. and Scandinavian peacekeepers to Macedonia in the first 
international effort at preventing a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other observers expressed concern about the slow response of 
Western countries to Macedonia's critical need for economic support to weather 
the devastating blockade imposed by Greece in its attempt to force this country 
to change its name and its flag. Athens insists that Macedonia harbors 
territorial ambitions against its northern province of the same name, and it 
has been vetoing European Union aid proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat painted an even more ominous outlook, describing this 
country as a sitting duck for nationalist adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 In Serbia's tense Kosovo province, which makes up most of Macedonia's northern 
border, 2 million Albanians have been living in a virtual police state imposed 
by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Milosevic, who has been known to need an occasional crisis, decides to put 
the hand on Kosovo, the situation could deteriorate quickly," a U.N. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any conflict in Kosovo, the medieval Serbian heartland that Milosevic has 
vowed to "recover" from the majority Albanians, would drive hundreds of 
thousands to seek refuge with Albanians here. That, in turn, would sharpen 
tensions with the majority Slavs and expose Macedonia to Serbian accusations 
that it was harboring enemies.

BOSNIAN SERBS UNDER ASSAULT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government forces who have handed Bosnian Serbs their worst defeats in 2 1/2 
years of war pushed ahead Monday with assaults on a supply route near Sarajevo 
and on Serb-held towns in the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs claimed to have blunted the offensives and promised intense fighting to 
regain lost territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Serbs have the troops, materiel and morale to rebound could 
determine whether the government's offensive will decisively change the course 
of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs said the government attack on their supply road, near Trnovo, was backed 
by an estimated 8,000 troops who traveled to the front from besieged Sarajevo 
through a tunnel under the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeepers confirmed that government forces pushed back Serbian troops 
in northwestern Bosnia. Bosnia's official radio reported that government troops 
took 12 square miles of territory, closing in on the towns of Bosanska Krupa 
and Bosanski Petrovac.

PRISON BREAK IN HAITI IS BARELY NOTICED BY LAX POLICE; CARIBBEAN: OFFICERS DID 
NOTHING. INDIFFERENCE POINTS UP TOUGH U.S. TASK OF TRAINING LAW AGENTS IN A 
LAWLESS LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was a prison break from Haiti's National Penitentiary in downtown 
Port-au-Prince on Sunday afternoon. The Haitian police did nothing to stop it 
and didn't investigate it Monday. In fact, 24 hours later, they had no idea how 
many inmates had escaped after crawling through a hole dug in the prison's 
concrete outer wall. 
</P>
<P>
 And by noon Monday, the police and prison guards had not even closed off the 
hole, which leads into the basketball court of the Methodist school next door. 
With classes back in session, the school's security guard had to do it from his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one outside the school and prison would have known about the 
breakout had it not been for the U.S. Army military police and U.S.-financed 
international police monitors who discovered it. They caught eight inmates in 
the schoolyard and returned them to jail. But even they didn't know how many 
had gotten away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many escaped because of the poor record-keeping in the 
prison," said Paul Browne, the deputy director of the police-monitoring 
program. "We don't even know how many prisoners are in there right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The school guard, Constant Derival, said he believes at least 15 inmates 
escaped; local radio stations put the figure at more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion occurred on the symbolic first day of the appearance of a 
gentler, more caring Haitian police -- the day the first graduates from a 
U.S.-funded, five-day emergency retraining program took to the streets of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers at the National Penitentiary were not among the graduates, 
the first 335 of Haiti's military police to take a weeklong series of behavior 
modification and law-enforcement classes from FBI and other Justice Department 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the first-day performance of the graduates was spotty, at best. The 
American MPs, who have been the only semblance of law in town, said they still 
could not get most of the officers to leave their barracks. "I haven't really 
noticed much difference," Lt. Erica Vodak said of the 98 new graduates at the 
station in the suburb of Petionville. "We're still trying to push them out the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, Monday's police blotter in the capital provided a kaleidoscope 
of imagery highlighting the obstacles facing the U.S. military intervention 
force here, as well as the Clinton Administration's $60-million, five-year 
program to help solve the most urgent problem facing Haiti today. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terrorized nation of victims now demanding justice after three years of 
brutal military rule, there still isn't even a semblance of a judicial system, 
let alone a trained police department to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two weeks after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return, the 
president has yet to appoint a Cabinet minister to deliver the justice he 
promised in his arrival speech. The last Haitian justice minister was 
assassinated by agents of the military regime more than a year ago, and he 
cannot be replaced until Aristide's nominated prime minister, Smarck Michel, is 
confirmed by the Haitian Parliament, expected later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials and Haitian human-rights activists said the appointment of a 
justice minister and a core staff to begin the long process of building a 
functioning civil court and penal system is critical to the success of the 
police retraining program -- and ultimately a more ambitious U.S.-funded plan 
to create a new police force in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you've got these new police graduates out on the streets now. But what 
happens to them next?" said one official close to the program. "What happens if 
they arrest somebody? What do they do with the suspect? They're going to put 
him in one of these medieval jails where they don't even write down prisoners' 
names, let alone count them." 
</P>
<P>
 The urgency for reform affects the image, and ultimate success, of the U.S. 
military intervention force. As the U.S. force tries to keep the Haitian police 
together to fill the law-and-order vacuum and keep the American troops from 
serving as the local police, it risks alienating the public it was sent to 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Vodak illustrated the problem dramatically at the Petionville station 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for my patrols," she said of the MPs who managed to persuade a 
handful of the Haitian police to join in joint patrols. "At one point, a 
Haitian man who spoke good English came up to one of my MPs and said, 'How can 
you walk with this guy? He killed my brother.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here supposedly to help this country, and here we are walking with 
murderers." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. program is designed to prevent that in the future. Retraining is only 
the first step. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters Monday on the initial phase of the program, coordinator 
Cary Hoover said that the only police officers permitted in the one-week "crash 
course" are those checked against lists of known human-rights violators and 
approved first by Aristide's government and then by the U.S. Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "These gentlemen have all been vetted," he said of the graduates who ventured 
into the streets Monday and a second group of 378 who are taking the course at 
the Justice Department's makeshift Port-au-Prince camp this week. "These are 
fairly decent human beings, if not very decent human beings who just want to do 
their job right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoover conceded that the training "is, in fact, just a stopgap measure" 
for a police force that has never really been a police force. All Haitian 
police officers are soldiers, and none has ever received formal training in 
civilian police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not enough. Absolutely not. But at least it's a start," Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Justice Department program, a new police academy will be built and 
intensive four-month classes in professional law enforcement provided to the 
most professional police incumbents and new recruits, among them a group of 
police trainees drafted from among Haitian refugees at the U.S. Marine base in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Those trainees are already at work in the northern city 
of Cap Haitien. More on Haiti

5 ARMY CADETS ACCUSED OF SEX HARASSMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five members of the U.S. Military Academy's football team face an official 
inquiry for allegedly groping female cadets during a pep rally at West Point 
last month, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 An official West Point inquiry was ordered after three women complained of 
being groped during the Oct. 20 "spirit run," the New York Times reported in 
today's editions.The inquiry elicited reports from 18 women who said they were 
brushed across the breasts as they and other cadets ran past a cordon of Army 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen of the women considered the incident to be sexual harassment, while 
the other three described it as inadvertent, Lt. Gen. Howard D. Graves, the 
superintendent of the academy, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon spokeswoman in Washington told the Associated Press she had no 
information about the incident.

 Five U.S. soldiers and three Cuban refugees were injured during a 
stone-throwing confrontation at one of the Cuban refugee camps in Panama, the 
U.S. military said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 50 to 75 Cuban refugees threw stones at U.S. soldiers and 
tore down a gate late Sunday at one of four camps where the United States holds 
about 9,000 Cuban boat people, U.S. military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispute among the Cubans over cigarettes sparked the incident, a military 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. soldier required five stitches after a stone struck him in the head, 
but no one needed hospitalization, the official said.

ISRAEL TRIES TO REPAIR RELATIONS WITH PALESTINIANS; MIDEAST: A HEBRON SHRINE 
REMAINS CLOSED. BUT OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE MOVES INTENDED TO REASSURE ARABS THAT 
ACCORDS REACHED WITH THE PLO WILL BE HONORED.

<P>
 It is hard to feel it in this town where Arabs and Jews live locked in mutual 
loathing, but Israel is slowly trying to repair the damage that a recent string 
of guerrilla attacks inflicted on its relationship with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hebron on Monday, both Jews and Muslims spoke bitterly of the government's 
continuing refusal to reopen the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site holy to both 
their religions. The massive structure, called the Ibrahim Mosque by Muslims, 
has been shut since a Jewish settler killed Muslim worshipers there in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the public that has a direct interest in the reopening, and we hear 
nothing from the government," said Noam Arnon, spokesman for the Jewish 
settlers who live in the heart of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The army has spent months devising a system that will physically separate 
Jewish and Muslim worshipers inside the structure and had tentatively planned 
to open the site Monday. But the Israelis postponed the opening until at least 
next week for what government spokesman Uri Dromi insisted were "technical 
security reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our working assumption is that when the cave is opened, it is opened into a 
tense situation," Dromi said. "This is why we need to make sure that no 
technical function will ignite the whole situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the shrine stayed closed, Israeli officials announced moves 
intended to reassure the Palestinians that Israel will continue to honor the 
agreement it reached with them 13 months ago and gradually hand over civil 
authority throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police are scheduled to take up positions today at two crossing 
points -- one between Jordan and the West Bank, the other between Egypt and the 
Gaza Strip -- for the first time. The Palestinian flag was hoisted alongside 
the Israeli flag at the Rafah crossing in Gaza on Monday and will be raised at 
the Allenby Bridge in the West Bank today. And Palestinians visiting the 
territories will now be questioned and searched by Palestinian police rather 
than Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 An official presence at the two international crossings is an important symbol 
of the sovereignty that Palestinians are struggling to establish in the 
territories. Palestinians have always resented the aggressive questioning and 
searching that Israelis routinely subjected them to at international crossings. 
Israel retains the right to intervene for security purposes when it wishes, but 
most Palestinian travelers to the territories now will have face-to-face 
contact only with Palestinian officials. Israel's presence will fade from 
another aspect of their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO also have reached agreement, after months of difficult 
negotiations, on the so-called safe passages that will link Gaza and the West 
Bank town of Jericho, the two areas of self-rule. The passages will be roads 
that Palestinian officials and their bodyguards may freely travel, armed, 
without fear of being stopped at Israeli roadblocks. They are scheduled to open 
next week and will allow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to assert his presence in 
Jericho, which he has visited only once since May. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for the vast majority of Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin promised in the Moroccan port of Casablanca on Sunday, after 
meeting with Arafat, to "progressively lift" the current closure of Gaza and 
the West Bank. The two were attending a regional economic conference designed 
to bring Israelis and Arabs together to plan the economic revitalization of the 
Middle East and North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel closed the territories Oct. 12 after Israeli soldier Nachshon Waxman 
was kidnaped by the militant Islamic organization Hamas. It briefly lifted the 
closure Oct. 19, only to reimpose it the next day after a Hamas suicide bomber 
blew up a busload of people in Tel Aviv. The territories have remained closed 
since. Closure means that about 63,500 permit-holding Palestinian workers are 
not allowed to travel to their jobs in Israel. It has disrupted life for nearly 
every Palestinian living in the territories and has infuriated the 
self-governing Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials Monday immediately criticized Rabin for not completely 
ending the closure, and Israeli officials declined to provide details of what 
Rabin meant by "progressive." But what seems certain is that thousands of 
Palestinians will begin returning to their jobs today, relieving some of the 
political pressure that Arafat has been feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with Arafat on Sunday, Rabin also announced he will meet the 
chairman next Monday at Erez checkpoint -- the crossing point between Israel 
and Gaza -- to discuss the holding of Palestinian elections. Arafat had wanted 
elections this month, a target that is now all but impossible to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO remain far apart on who should participate in the elections 
and on the size of the body to be elected. Israel wants a 30-member executive 
committee; the Palestinians want a 100-member legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians accuse Israel of manufacturing excuses to avoid reaching an 
agreement on elections, which they say are essential for establishing the 
appointed authority's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed -- no, I should say we are extremely disappointed -- 
about the election issue," said Marwan Kanafani, a spokesman for Arafat who was 
in Casablanca with him Monday. "Elections are important and essential; they are 
the heart of the peace process," he said. "Unfortunately, the seriousness and 
the urgency that we feel is met neither by the prime minister nor the foreign 
minister of Israel. We met with Prime Minister Rabin on Sunday and heard, once 
again, nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanafani said he hoped the Israelis "will be able to concentrate their minds" 
by the time Arafat and Rabin meet next week. He also complained that the United 
States has failed to pressure Israel on holding elections quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtius reported from Hebron and Parks from Casablanca, Morocco.

 7 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: Republican Gov. Pete Wilson visited Vacaville to 
commend Genentech Co. officials on their $150-million plant expansion leading 
to 300 new jobs. Wilson said that 150,000 more Californians are working now 
than 18 months ago. Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown accused Wilson of 
being "trick-or-treat Pete" on the issue of illegal immigration, claiming that, 
as a U.S. senator, he tried to intervene on behalf of a contributor under 
investigation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Wilson planned a "law-enforcement bus tour" today with stops 
in Riverside, Los Angeles, Garden Grove and San Diego. Brown planned to attend 
a rally in San Bernardino with Vice President Al Gore and then make campaign 
stops in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: GOP candidate Mike Huffington addressed the Fresno 
Rotary Club at lunch and a Tulare County GOP rally in Visalia. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein received the endorsement of five top executives of defense and 
aerospace companies. Later at a Los Angeles Sierra Club gathering, she 
celebrated President Clinton's Washington signing of the California Desert 
Protection Act, which she sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Huffington is to address a rally in Victorville protesting the 
desert protection bill at noon today and a Los Angeles County Republican 
get-out-the-vote drive at the Universal Hilton tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "As a socialist, La Riva is the only candidate for governor who is willing to 
stand up for the rights of poor and working people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Becker, spokesman for Gloria La Riva, the Peace and Freedom Party 
candidate for governor who was arrested after handing out free bagels to 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 LIGHTER TOUCH 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, perhaps, the tastes of gubernatorial candidates Kathleen 
Brown and Pete Wilson differ on a variety of subjects. Brown likes rock 'n' 
roll while Wilson favors Broadway show tunes and barbershop quartets, according 
to an Associated Press survey. For vacations, she likes the far North Coast of 
California and Wilson prefers San Diego. They were together on one category, 
however: last book read. It was "The Agenda," by Bob Woodward, an account of 
the turbulent first year of the Clinton Administration. Wilson spokesman Dan 
Schnur said, "I'm sure he liked it more than she did."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WILSON'S TOP 20 DONORS GIVE $3 MILLION TO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 You might think of them as members of Gov. Pete Wilson's $100,000 club. 
</P>
<P>
 They are 20 private interests -- companies, individuals and political action 
committees -- that each have contributed at least $100,000 to help the 
Republican incumbent finance his reelection campaign against Democrat Kathleen 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 With no limits on contributions to candidates for state office, huge donations 
from a very few can help a governor or would-be chief executive as much as 
hundreds of smaller gifts that would take far longer to solicit and collect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson lists thousands of donors to his campaign committee, these top 
20 alone have contributed more than $3 million of the record-setting $26.8 
million that Wilson had reported receiving as of Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The group includes old friends of Wilson such as the owner of the San Diego 
Chargers football team, big companies such as oil giant Chevron Corp. and 
vintner E & J Gallo, industry groups such as the Assn. of California Insurance 
Cos., and one labor union, the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That group, representing state prison guards, has emerged as Wilson's top 
contributor in 1994, giving the governor $525,000 this year alone. The guards 
spent more than $900,000 on an independent advertising campaign to help elect 
Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's most generous individual donor is Sam Bamieh, a Bay Area businessman 
whose firm, American Intertrade Group, is an international developer and 
financial consultant. Bamieh, who has given Wilson $259,000, told The Times 
earlier this year that the governor is too liberal for his tastes but he 
contributes anyway because he considers himself a loyal Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big individual donor: Alex Spanos, the Stockton real estate developer 
and owner of the San Diego Chargers, Wilson's hometown football team. Spanos 
has contributed $195,000 to Wilson's campaign during this election. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has accepted $125,000 from Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts 
-- takeover specialists who hold a significant stake in RJR Nabisco, the giant 
conglomerate that sells food and tobacco products. Wilson does not accept 
contributions directly from tobacco companies, but a campaign aide said Kravis 
and Roberts -- partners in a huge venture capital firm -- have significant 
interests outside the tobacco firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among Wilson's elite supporters are two oil companies -- Chevron, which 
gave $100,125, and Atlantic Richfield, which contributed $136,421. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs whose names are synonymous with the computer 
industry -- William Hewlett and David Packard -- gave Wilson big checks as 
individuals. Hewlett has given Wilson $101,000 and Packard has kicked in 
$151,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $162,000 he has received from the Assn. of California 
Insurance Cos., Wilson has collected six-figure donations from two insurance 
companies: Fremont Corp., which gave him $126,000, and Mercury General, which 
donated $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another state-regulated company -- Pacific Telesis, which has been working to 
ward off competition from the cable television industry -- gave Wilson 
$110,250. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., the Orange County developer that has been a longtime supporter 
of Wilson and needs his help to continue building in an area that is a habitat 
of endangered species, gave the governor $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Others among Wilson's six-figure contributors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jerry Perenchio, Chartwell Partnership Group -- $151,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thomas Weisel, chief executive of San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, 
an investment banker -- $109,800. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph Fenley, chairman of Los Angeles-based Gateway Freight Services -- 
$106,600. 
</P>
<P>
 * AGI Management Corp. of New York -- $100,000 
</P>
<P>
 * David Price, chairman of American Golf, a Santa Monica-based firm that 
contracts with public agencies to manage golf courses -- $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The California Hospitals Political Action Committee -- $105,700. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vintner E & J Gallo -- $110,000.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: EVERYONE JUST BE QUIET AND PICK ANY 12 JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simpson case lawyers could fire their expensive consultants, drop their 
media manipulation, pick the first 12 prospective jurors who come through the 
door -- and still get as fair a trial as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always suspected this, and my feelings were confirmed Monday when I 
interviewed non-Simpson case jurors sitting on benches in the 11th-floor 
hallway of the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the unknown jurors, the grunts, as opposed to the Simpson case jury 
prospects now at the center of attention as attorneys, acting as if they were 
questioning suspects, poke and prod their minds. Nobody cares what movies the 
grunts have seen or whether they or anyone close to them has undergone an 
amniocentesis. When judges and lawyers question them, it doesn't take much time 
and their answers aren't broadcast or printed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was interviewing them because this is their week. Somebody in the Civic 
Center finally stood up for the jurors. Los Angeles County's Citizens Economy 
and Efficiency Commission is expected to approve a report Wednesday declaring: 
</P>
<P>
 "All too often jury service in Los Angeles County, as elsewhere, is 
characterized by those participating as an experience of frustration, wasted 
time, uncomfortable and unattractive facilities, a lack of information to 
adequately understand the process and the failure to recognize the sacrifices 
involved in the performance of jury service. . . . Jurors have the lowest 
priority in the judicial system when it comes to concern for their treatment 
and funding for their services and facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 I've been complaining about the physical discomfort visited upon jurors since 
my own jury duty. Lately, listening to the voir dire questioning of the 
prospective Simpson jurors, I've become aware of the mental pain they must 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution and defense attorneys seem to really believe that their questions 
will reveal the perfect juror. In that, they remind me of National Football 
League scouts who measure athletes' body fat, muscle bulk, speed and urine 
content, looking for the perfect prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 What the tests don't reveal are character, courage and common sense, the 
ingredients that make a great NFL player -- and an effective juror. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to talk to jurors about the physical discomforts and to get an idea 
of their attitude toward their civic duty. 
</P>
<P>
 They had their complaints, same as I did. "They don't have enough telephones," 
said a man, pointing to two pay phones in the hallway. If anyone wanted to 
bring a laptop and do some work, they'd have trouble communicating with the 
office via modem. The Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission recommended 
computer facilities for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Another complained about the poor quality of water in the Criminal Courts 
Building. The commission told the Board of Supervisors to "immediately repair 
or replace the water supply equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 A third juror told me: "They don't have enough seating inside the assembly 
room or outside the courtroom." Most said it took a half-hour to 45 minutes to 
get out of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get the wrong idea. Even the jurors with complaints had a good 
attitude toward jury duty. To use a phrase that sounds out of date in these 
cynical times, they were public-spirited citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to three alternates on a jury that was deliberating. They had heard 
the testimony, same as the regular jurors. When the trial was done, the jurors 
started going over the case. The alternates waited outside, on a bench. Their 
service, both in listening to the evidence and waiting outside the courtroom, 
has occupied almost a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad part is the length involved," one of them said. "Everybody complains 
the process is so long. People at my work say that." But he didn't agree. "If 
you have a conscience, you can't be fast with this. It has to be slow and 
deliberative." 
</P>
<P>
 All three -- along with a man and a woman sitting near them -- agreed that 
they had learned a lot about the criminal justice system, and had come away 
with a lot of admiration for the judges for handling big caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked what they thought of the system. "It works," a man said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then I walked up to our 12th-floor pressroom and listened to the nitpicking 
questioning of the Simpson jury panelists. Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro 
wanted to know what juror 353 (they are anonymous) expected of Simpson during 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she expected him to "sit there and listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman asked her about a multiple defendant murder 
trial in which she had served as a juror a few years ago. Some of the 
defendants had been convicted, but the jury hung on others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried very hard," she said. "We went back to the judge several times . . . 
we just weren't getting anywhere. . . . The judge agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 How did you feel when you walked out of the courtroom? Hodgman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lot younger," she said. "It felt good. I remember the people (on the 
jury)." 
</P>
<P>
 However, if she had it to do again, she said, "I would do it differently, with 
my life experience." She said she would listen to her own convictions more, not 
be so ready to follow the opinions of others. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought she was a thoughtful person. Her replies to Shapiro and Hodgman had 
a lot of common sense. She sounded as if she would be a good juror, as did the 
men and women I talked to earlier in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers are asking too many questions. They're wasting their time trying 
to propagandize during the selection process. Just pick 12 men and women from 
the Criminal Courts Building benches. Any 12 will do.

3 WOUNDED IN GUN BATTLE AT TIJUANA PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gun battle in the Baja California state penitentiary left three people 
wounded Monday evening, and police were negotiating with inmates who barricaded 
themselves in a cellblock after attacking and disarming a guard. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 100 city and state police officers rushed to reinforce guards at the 
violent, heavily overcrowded prison, which periodically experiences gunfights 
between inmate gangs.The police came under automatic-weapons fire from snipers 
in several parts of the 2,400-inmate facility, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m., authorities reported that negotiations with the rebellious group 
of at least six inmates were progressing and that the group had agreed to 
surrender. Mother Antonia, a nun who lives in the prison and is renowned for 
her charitable work there, apparently played a central role in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 She told a television interviewer that she walked among the inmates restoring 
order. "They are not violent . . . with me. I talked with many of them, cell by 
cell, to see what they felt and how we could resolve their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reports were sketchy, the incident apparently began in a maximum 
security section of the prison shortly after 5 p.m. as guards were conducting a 
daily count of the prison population. A group of inmates on one of the upper 
floors of a cellblock suddenly wrestled away a guard's weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing brawl and exchange of gunfire left two inmates seriously wounded. 
A guard suffered minor injuries from a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 A prison official told reporters that initial accounts indicated that the 
mutinous inmates may have been trying to gain the release of a fellow inmate 
from a punitive confinement area.

TRICKSTERS ALTER CANDIDATE'S PHONE MESSAGE

 Matt Fong, Republican candidate for state treasurer, was the latest victim of 
election-year dirty tricks Monday, when someone sabotaged his 800 phone number 
to make it seem that callers were getting a Chinese restaurant, in which a man 
with a Charlie Chan accent offered Fong's mother's won-ton recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clear that they're making fun of my ethnicity," said Fong, who is 
Chinese American. "It's really too bad. . . . I just hope this kind of thing 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, in a statewide television advertising campaign, had asked listeners 
interested in his proposal for cutting $2 billion in state spending to call 
1-800-MATT FONG to find out more about his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But late Monday he discovered that what listeners were getting when they 
dialed the number was not his voice explaining how to get copies of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they heard a bad imitation of a Chinese accent. "You want good won-ton 
soup made by mother, you press 1," said the man's voice. "You want vote for me, 
Matt Fong, for election, press 2." Fong's mother, March Fong Eu, was formerly 
California's secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong said someone apparently was able to get access to a string of codes and 
special numbers that enabled them to erase his message and replace it with the 
fake. He said he did not know how long the message was on the phone line, but 
it could have been most of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever changed the message, he said, was also able to alter the passwords, so 
when his campaign tried to reprogram the line they were at first unable to do 
so. The message was finally changed after the telephone company intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong said he had no idea who had tampered with his message, but hinted it 
might have come from the campaign of his opponent, Democrat Phil Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Baltake, a spokeswoman for the Angelides campaign, denied that the 
campaign was involved, calling the accusation "ridiculous."

CLINTON WARNS GOP VICTORIES COULD PERIL SOCIAL SECURITY; POLITICS: PRESIDENT 
TRIES TO GIVE ELDERLY A HALLOWEEN FRIGHT AT PHILADELPHIA RALLY. ATTACK FOLLOWS 
CLAIMS THAT WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO TRIM BENEFITS. 
</P>

<P>
 As the midterm election campaign moved into its final week, President Clinton 
tried to send a Halloween shiver through one of the nation's most powerful 
voter blocs -- the elderly -- by warning Monday that Republican victories could 
threaten Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for Democratic congressional candidates in Philadelphia, Clinton said 
that recent statements from Republican senatorial candidates Rick Santorum in 
Pennsylvania and Oliver L. North in Virginia reflected GOP designs on Social 
Security that have been apparent for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say no to this radical attack on Social Security," Clinton declared at a 
rally at Philadelphia City Hall as he joined Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford 
and gubernatorial candidate Mark Singel for a day of campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's warning was part of an intensifying Democratic effort to exploit 
Republican campaign statements and turn Social Security, a potent Democratic 
issue in countless past campaigns, into an effective weapon in this year's 
exceptionally tight races. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President spoke, the Democratic National Committee was about to begin 
running two new television ads in 10 to 15 areas that make the same charge and 
close with the phrase: "The Republicans: They're at it again." The 
advertisements will begin airing today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats came under attack over politically sacred federal entitlements 
last month with disclosure of a memo from Office of Management and Budget 
Director Alice Rivlin that discussed several ways to hold down entitlement 
benefits to cut the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials then denied that they had any intention of cutting 
Social Security. The issue began to look more promising for the Democrats on 
Oct. 16, when Santorum, Wofford's opponent, said in impromptu remarks that he 
would like to see the Social Security benefits age raised to 70. Benefits can 
now be received as soon as age 62. 
</P>
<P>
 North, who is running against Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, said that he 
would like to make the Social Security system voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats have tried to further sharpen the issue by asserting that the 
Republican "contract with America," a campaign manifesto signed in September by 
about 300 House candidates, would require huge cuts to achieve its goals of 
balancing the budget, cutting taxes and increasing military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a congressional committee's calculations, the Democrats say that 
carrying out all those goals at once would require cuts of 22% in all other 
programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Clinton pounced on that theme 
as he spoke to several hundred Philadelphians in the courtyard of the ornate 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Republican promises would require cuts of $2,000 per person 
in Social Security and another $1,800 per person in Medicare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That money comes "out of the most vulnerable people in this country," Clinton 
said, "people who have worked hard all their lives, people who have paid their 
taxes -- people who have paid their dues." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton asserted that President Ronald Reagan had gone after Social Security 
in 1981 with his proposals to fix the system and that Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), the minority whip, had proposed to change it as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Gingrich's office said that he has not considered such changes 
since 1986. And the Republican National Committee countered that in 1986 
Clinton had voiced support for across-the-board entitlement cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides repeated Clinton's pledges that he is opposed to Social Security 
cuts and will offer no changes in the system in his budget. Yet they stopped 
short of a categorical pledge that Clinton would never change its current 
terms, saying, as one aide put it, that he "has rejected cuts for the 
foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford, still facing a tough challenge from Santorum, joined Monday in 
Clinton's attacks, calling Social Security "a sacred trust." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to let Rick Santorum or anybody raid the Social Security Trust 
Fund to pay for more tax breaks for the rich and more budget-busting military 
programs that we don't need," Wofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home the point, David Wilhelm, the Democratic National Committee 
chairman, boarded a White House press flight Monday to show reporters 
Democratic television ads hitting Santorum for his comments on Social Security. 
The ads show Santorum at a campaign appearance saying that he would like to see 
the eligibility age raised to 70 and adding that it is "ridiculous" that 
one-quarter of the population receives the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently to counter any objections that they are trying to scare the 
elderly, the Democrats said that they had mounted the attack only because of 
Republican claims that they would slash the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Security issue may have particular resonance in Pennsylvania, which 
has the nation's second-largest elderly population. If the topic does give 
Wofford a boost, it will come not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford, 68, a former civil rights worker and aide to President John F. 
Kennedy, is in a tight race with Santorum, a two-term congressman from the 
Pittsburgh area who is known for his sharp anti-government rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Most public opinion polls have shown the two candidates very close, although a 
poll released last weekend by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and WTAE-TV showed 
Santorum ahead by a margin of 46% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm denounced the poll Monday as "strange" and "incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Philadelphia stop was followed by an appearance at a Democratic 
campaign rally at the David Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh. With his 
approval rating edging up to nearly 50% in polls, Clinton seemed no longer to 
have trouble attracting congressional candidates to stand by his side: Five 
joined him in Philadelphia and three in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Both events were open only to those who obtained tickets from the Democratic 
campaign organizations, a system that reduced the risk that the appearance 
would draw protesters who could disrupt television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint appearance by Clinton and Wofford -- their first of the campaign -- 
was also notable because the two scarcely mentioned health care, the subject 
that propelled Wofford to his stunning 1991 victory and was embraced the 
following year by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some in Clinton's audience in Pittsburgh took his warnings about 
Social Security seriously. Georgia Konopka, a Pittsburgh housewife, and her 
husband, Don, said that they regard the Republican threat to their Social 
Security and Medicare benefits as the biggest issue in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in our 50s and this is scary stuff," said Mrs. Konopka, who added that 
in her first look at Clinton, she found the President "adorable."

JUDGE ORDERS LEGAL ADVICE FOR CUBANS; IMMIGRATION: DETAINED RAFTERS MUST HAVE A 
CHANCE TO TALK WITH A LAWYER BEFORE REPATRIATION, RULING SAYS. ACTION THWARTS 
PLANS TO THIN OUT TENT CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some 32,000 Cuban rafters being held in detention camps cannot be returned to 
Cuba, even if they volunteer to go, until they have had a chance to consult 
with lawyers about the possible consequences of their decision, a federal judge 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins issued a temporary restraining order 
barring the further repatriation of any Cubans being held at the U.S. naval 
base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The order thwarts both the Clinton 
Administration's hopes of reducing the population of the internment camps and 
the desires of at least 1,000 refugees who have said that they want to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubans were picked up in the Florida Straits, most clinging to flimsy 
rafts, after Cuban President Fidel Castro dropped his ban on leaving the 
island. Then the Clinton Administration reversed 30 years of preferential 
treatment and declared in mid-August that no Cubans would be permitted to enter 
the United States except through normal immigration channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins' order comes in response to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the refugees 
by a group of 24 Miami attorneys, most of them Cuban Americans, who contended 
that the government is using harsh conditions at Guantanamo to coerce the 
Cubans into choosing repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are absolutely thrilled," said Roberto Martinez, a former U.S. attorney 
acting as lead counsel for the refugees. "This is a significant step to getting 
these people the right to make application for refugee status." 
</P>
<P>
 Added attorney Marcos Jimenez: "They are making a life-changing decision when 
they go back to Castro, and they should talk to a lawyer before they do that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 23,000 Cubans remain in Guantanamo; another 8,000 have volunteered to be 
transferred to a camp in Panama. Forty-two Cubans from Guantanamo have been 
voluntarily repatriated through Havana, while several others have returned on 
their own by jumping barbed-wire fences and crossing a minefield or swimming 
into Cuban territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 14-page ruling, Atkins did not address conditions in the camps. But 
Guarione M. Diaz, appointed civilian ombudsman to represent the Guantanamo 
Cubans, said that indefinite detention and a lack of adequate medical care have 
led to widespread anxiety and depression in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are uneasy," said Diaz. "They are uncertain about the future. Those who 
want to go back to Cuba don't know when they can go. And those who want to come 
to the United States don't know if they will ever get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said that several Guantanamo Cubans are protesting their indefinite 
detention with a hunger strike. Several peaceful demonstrations have taken 
place, and last week about 20 camp residents tried to escape by swimming into 
Cuban territory. A few made it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said that a lack of medicine and doctors "is more urgent than ever," 
particularly in the cases of detainees who are epileptic, disabled, pregnant or 
have tested positive for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguments before Atkins last week, lawyers for the Justice Department 
asserted that the Guantanamo refugees, like Haitian refugees interdicted at 
sea, have no rights under the U.S. Constitution -- a claim upheld by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in a 1993 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Cubans said the refugees do have constitutional rights, since 
Guantanamo, by virtue of a 1903 lease, is under U.S. control. Atkins agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Atkins issued an emergency order that stopped the government from 
flying 23 Cubans from Guantanamo to Havana at the last minute. Three days later 
Diaz faxed to Atkins a handwritten letter, signed by 21 of the 23 refugees, 
protesting the judge's order. Insisting that their decision to go home was 
voluntary and not coerced, the signers said: "There is nothing in this world 
that will make us change our minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyers further stated that some of the 23 Cubans were so 
despondent about being kept from going home that at least two "fell to the 
ground weeping" and one threatened to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also defended camp conditions, saying that the "migrants 
receive at least one hot meal a day (and) continental breakfasts are served." 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from the picture of squalor and chaos that plaintiffs try to paint, there 
is in fact a daily routine available to adults and children alike, which 
includes education, recreation and entertainment," government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, lawyers for the Cubans are to submit their plan for interviewing 
and advising the 23,000 refugees at Guantanamo.

WITNESSES LINK HILL TO ABORTION CLINIC KILLINGS AS TRIAL OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting as his own lawyer, a former minister made no opening statement and 
asked no questions Monday during his trial in the shotgun slayings of an 
abortion doctor and his bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, 40, could get the electric chair if convicted in the July 29 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 After a prosecutor made his opening statement, four witnesses testified that 
they saw Hill fire the fatal shots or standing near the body after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Disney, a financial aid representative at a college, said she heard a 
"pop-pop" and saw Hill standing by one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just standing there and he had a weapon in his hand. And he was 
looking at the body, staring at the body," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 5, Hill became the first person convicted under the new federal law 
against using violence or intimidation to prevent people from entering abortion 
clinics. He could get up to life in prison when he is sentenced Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 At the federal trial, Hill also acted as his own lawyer and offered no 
defense, calling no witnesses and cross-examining none of his accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's murder trial in state court began amid tight security. Police set up 
crowd-control barricades around the courthouse and put sharpshooters on the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the shootings were Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, and his volunteer 
bodyguard James H. Barrett, 74. Barrett's wife, June, 68, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Earl Jackson was driving by the clinic in a pickup truck and saw 
Hill pull a gun from some bushes, take a couple of steps and fire. Jackson said 
he then saw Barrett's body laying next to the truck. Jackson said he got a good 
look at Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Disney also testified at Hill's federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant State Atty. James Murray said Hill had been carrying signs and 
protesting in front of the abortion clinic for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these signs was prophetic," Murray said in his opening statement. "You 
are going to see photographs of the defendant carrying a sign saying 'Execute 
abortionists and accessories.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Frank Bell rejected Hill's last-minute request for help from two 
lawyers who support his contention that the killings were justifiable homicide.

LAWYER WITH HIV SETTLES SUIT AGAINST FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case similar to the movie "Philadelphia," an attorney who has the AIDS 
virus settled his discrimination lawsuit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, known only as Scott Doe, got hugs and kisses from jurors after the 
settlement was announced.All sides agreed not to reveal the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am anxious to get on with my life and the practice of law," he said. Doe's 
federal lawsuit said he was dismissed from the firm Kohn, Nast & Graf in March, 
1993, after his boss learned that he had HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm had argued that "Scott Doe" failed to live up to his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission joined in the suit. Carmen 
Matos, the agency's lawyer, said the firm agreed not to engage in "any 
employment practices which constitute unlawful disability-based 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 The case resembled the plot of "Philadelphia," in which a lawyer with AIDS was 
fired and won a settlement. Work on the film was already in progress when the 
lawyer in the real case was fired.

HIGH COURT TO HEAR BAN ON SUBSIDY TO RELIGIOUS GROUP; JUDICIARY: CHRISTIAN 
STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CLAIM DISCRIMINATION. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AT 
STATE-RUN SCHOOL RECEIVE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to widespread complaints from Christian legal advocates, the Supreme 
Court said Monday that it will consider a lower court ruling that bars a state 
university from subsidizing a student magazine because it espouses an "avowedly 
Christian" perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Christian legal groups have complained that the high court's 
insistence on a strict separation of church and state sometimes translates into 
discrimination against mainstream religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some school and state college officials have said that their 
institutions may subsidize student groups that promote feminism, 
environmentalism, gay rights or a variety of other causes but they may not 
subsidize student groups that promote religion. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach "strips religious speakers of their constitutional protection" 
to freedom of speech and "condones discrimination against religion," according 
to lawyers for a Christian students' group at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Their complaints now have won a hearing at the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the court intervened when a school district refused to rent its 
auditorium to a group that espoused Christian values, even though it allowed 
other groups to use the facility. In overturning that discriminatory policy, 
the justices said that public officials must treat religious groups like all 
others when their doors are opened to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Virginia case gives the court a chance to decide whether the 
same rule applies when government subsidies are disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990-91 school year, 118 student groups on the Charlottesville 
campus received subsidies from a mandatory student fee, including 15 groups 
that publish magazines or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a magazine called Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of 
Virginia was denied $5,862 in publishing fees by the student council because it 
was deemed a "religious activity." The council relied on university guidelines 
in refusing the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine, founded by undergraduate Ronald Rosenberger, is published three 
times during the year and distributed free on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the magazine pointed out that other religiously oriented groups, 
such as the Muslim Students Assn. and the Jewish Law Students Assn., had their 
activities and publications subsidized. The university defended those subsidies 
as being for cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting a lawsuit filed by the Christian students, a U.S. appellate court in 
Richmond, Va., sided with the university and agreed that it would be 
unconstitutional for it to pay for "the propagation of the Christian religion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Wide Awake is a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion and 
advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal philosophy," the 
university may not subsidize it, the appeals court said. It cited the First 
Amendment's ban on laws fostering an "establishment of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 But in their appeal, the students cited the other words of the First 
Amendment, which protect "freedom of speech" and the "free exercise of 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 The justices said they will hear the case (Rosenberger vs. the University of 
Virginia, 94-329) and try to clarify the conflict built into the First 
Amendment. A written ruling will be issued by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that the government has to be neutral," said University of 
Chicago Law Prof. Michael W. McConnell, who represented the religious students 
in their appeal to the high court. If the university plans to pay for some 
student publications, it cannot exclude others simply because they are 
religious, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a leader of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said 
the Constitution does not permit the use of public money to pay for promoting 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "University students have the right to evangelize but they shouldn't pass the 
collection plate to the taxpayers," said Barry W. Lynn, the group's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting in a second religion case, the court rejected an appeal from a landlord 
in Alaska who said his Christian beliefs prompted him to refuse to rent an 
apartment to an unmarried couple. The Alaska Supreme Court said his refusal 
violated state anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 This issue has arisen in several states and is pending before the California 
Supreme Court. The justices may prefer to rule on the matter after several 
lower courts have issued opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Justice Clarence Thomas voted to hear the appeal of the case (Swanner vs. 
Anchorage Equal Rights Commission, 94-169). 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to decide whether cities can exclude group homes for recovering 
alcoholics and drug addicts from an area of single-family homes (City of 
Edmonds, Wash., vs. United States, 94-23). According to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco, the federal Fair Housing Act bars such discrimination 
against handicapped people, including former addicts, and preempts local zoning 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * Said it would clarify the standard of proof for determining when the 
government will pay compensation to children who suffer complications after 
taking vaccines (Shalala vs. Whitecotton, 94-372). In 1986, Congress set up a 
fund to pay compensation but government lawyers said that lower courts have 
been too willing to award money, even when the child's ailments are not caused 
by the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a case involving a divorced couple from Los Angeles, agreed to rule on 
whether an ex-wife can get a refund for taxes that she paid but were owed by 
her ex-husband (United States vs. Williams, 94-395). A U.S. appeals court in 
California said the ex-wife, Lori Rabin Williams, was due a refund, but the 
high court agreed to hear the federal government's appeal.

 Eight days after suffering a concussion at New Orleans, quarterback Chris 
Miller still complains of headaches and "isn't clear about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller wouldn't rule himself out from starting Sunday against Denver, and 
Coach Chuck Knox on Monday wouldn't commit to starting Miller or Chris 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler appears to have the inside track on the starting job, with Tommy 
Maddox backing him up. Chandler took most of the snaps in practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say right now that Chandler is the starter because he is getting all 
the work," Knox said. "I don't know what the situation would be Wednesday. Our 
doctors are monitoring Miller's progress, and we'll go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller plans to throw in informal workouts today and return to practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I could play," he said. "It'll be the doctor's call to see how I 
react to practice and putting a helmet on. I'm just going day-to-day right now. 
I rode the exercise bike hard and I just feel my equilibrium is a little out of 
whack." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller got the concussion when he was tackled by New Orleans' Ernest Dixon in 
the first quarter. He didn't know he had a concussion and played the rest of 
the first half, throwing a touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained of dizziness at halftime, and was replaced by Chandler at the 
start of the second half. Miller said he doesn't remember any of the second 
half of the game. A CAT scan and MRI exam showed no brain damage, but team 
doctors held Miller out of workouts during the bye week for precautionary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the stuff going on, and the stories that have been talked about, you 
become a little more leery of those types of things," Miller said. "And I was 
kind of messed up to begin with anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got concerns. I get headaches all the time, and I have a hard time 
reading an article in the paper, it starts getting fuzzy. It should start 
clearing up. Doctors say it sometimes takes a couple weeks and so hopefully, it 
will be sooner than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago running back Merril Hoge retired recently because of Post Concussion 
Syndrome, which also forced former Jets wide receiver Al Toon out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he has had concussions four or five times in his career "this is 
the one that has stuck with me the longest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I got knocked unconscious for a brief period of time in college (at Oregon)," 
he said. "This one has just been hard for me, to get my head clear. It has kind 
of stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of two knee surgeries and a variety of other injuries, Miller has 
never played a full season in his eight-year NFL career. He has been sidelined 
this season with a sore abdominal muscle in the exhibition season, and sore rib 
cartilage and shoulder injury in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed 51.2% of his passes with seven touchdowns and eight 
interceptions, and the Rams are 2-4 with him as their starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's sprained left ankle still isn't 100%, but he said he's approaching 
this week as though he's the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not exactly what I want," said Chandler, who injured his ankle Oct. 2 
against Atlanta. "I would need a lot of time off to get it perfect but I'm 
playing with it and I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Novak, general counsel with the Rams the last six seasons, will leave 
the team at the end of the week to become counsel for Fox Network. . . . Right 
tackle Darryl Ashmore, who returned last week from a knee injury, worked at 
right guard, backing up starter Leo Goeas. Rookie Wayne Gandy continued to work 
with the first-string at right tackle, with veteran Jackie Slater, back from a 
torn triceps muscle, as the backup. Slater's return allowed Ashmore to move to 
guard, where the Rams have no depth behind starters Goeas and Chuck Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, who was involved in a fight during training camp, helped break one up 
Monday between defensive tackle D'Marco Farr and practice squad player Brad 
Fichtel. . . . Wide receiver Richard Buchanan re-pulled a hamstring muscle 
during punt protection drills. Defensive end Robert Young (knee) expects to 
return to practice Wednesday. Linebacker Shane Conlan (pinched nerve) also 
missed Monday's practice but expects to be ready later in the week. MIKE

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: DONS' RUNNERS GET OFF ON WRONG FOOT 
AT MEET

 Rancho Santiago, expected to do well at the Johnie O cross-country 
invitational Saturday at Moorpark College, didn't even have enough runners to 
register a score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, consistently one of the 10 best teams in Southern California this 
season, were derailed long before the race started. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams need five runners to compete, but Coach Al Siddons had only four 
available. One over-slept and failed to show up in time to catch the van and 
the another forgot his uniform top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel for our guys who were there and ready to run," Siddons said. 
"It made me think of all the work we put in over the summer, then all the 
training we did. It's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 By not scoring at the meet, the Dons fail to qualify for the State meet, which 
is Nov. 19 at Woodward Park in Fresno. The top 14 teams from the Moorpark meet 
go to the State race. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons said the performance of the women's team was also hampered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is really a family-thing with us and it's too bad we had all 
these other people affected," Siddons said. "Some coaches asked me if maybe we 
could have held off leaving for a few minutes. Maybe we could have, but it's 
the principle of the thing that matters to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Valley women's team finished fourth at Moorpark to earn a berth in 
the State meet. The Lasers are the defending State champions. The Orange Coast 
women's team also earned berth with a 13th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (13th) earned the only State berth for an Orange County men's team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More cross-country: The Orange Empire Conference championships are Saturday at 
Fairview Regional Park in Costa Mesa. Irvine Valley is the favorite in the 
women's race, which starts at 9 a.m. Riverside should dominate the men's 
division in the 10 a.m. race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's division: Riverside's Charlotte Mayock, who has been the 
strongest runner in Southern California this fall, is the clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley's Mayra Medina, Orange Coast's Erin Remy, Fullerton's Teresa 
Vega and Golden West's Kim Foster also are strong runners. Medina was fourth, 
Vega sixth and Remy eighth at Moorpark. Mayock won the Moorpark race. 
</P>
<P>
 On the men's side: Wilhelm Gidabuday of Riverside is the favorite and teammate 
Aberrazak Merchoud is his most likely challenger. The pair finished one-two at 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackles: Despite the struggles of the Saddleback football team, which is 
1-5-1, linebacker Andy Osborne and safety Morgan Bannister are having strong 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was in on 15 tackles in Saturday's 25-23 victory over Riverside. He 
has 199 tackles in his career and needs eight more to become the Gauchos' 
all-time leader. Scott von der Ahe (1991-92) had 206 tackles. He is currently a 
red-shirt at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Bannister was in on 16 tackles and had an interception against Riverside. 
After getting a total of 20 tackles and an interception in his first three 
games, Bannister has 54 tackles, two interceptions and a fumble recovery in the 
last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football poll: El Camino (7-0) remains atop the Southland Poll with Rancho 
Santiago (6-1) second. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley (7-0) is third, Long Beach (7-1) fourth, Bakersfield (6-1) 
fifth, Moorpark (5-2) sixth, Grossmont (6-1) seventh, Cerritos (5-2) eighth, 
Fullerton (4-2-1) ninth and Chaffey (5-2) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 In games involving top-10 teams: El Camino is at Long Beach, Bakersfield is at 
L.A. Valley and Grossmont is at Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a possible top 10 meeting between Orange County teams when Fullerton 
and Rancho Santiago meet Nov. 12 at Cal State Fullerton but each teams needs a 
victory this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, which has won three of four, is at Orange Coast in a 1:30 p.m. 
game. Orange Coast lost its first six before beating Southwestern, 42-38, 
Saturday. Rancho Santiago, which has won six in a row, plays Southwestern 
(0-6-1) at Santa Ana Stadium at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton-Rancho Santiago game will be the 71st meeting between the teams. 
Each team has won 33 games and there were four ties.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; PREVIEW OF MEN'S BASKETBALL REVEALS SOME 
PROMISE, SOME PITFALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The new and apparently improved men's basketball team made its public debut 
Sunday afternoon in the Bren Center. Maybe a couple of hundred fans showed up 
for the shooting contests, free popcorn and annual blue-gold scrimmage, but 
those who did got a first look at the new Anteaters, a team that probably will 
have three newcomers in its starting lineup for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Three 10-minute, teammate-vs.-teammate scrimmages aren't going to be all that 
revealing, but here's a look at how the top four new guys fared Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rookie of the Scrimmage Award goes to . . . Brian Keefe. "How's that for 
a last-minute, fill-out-the-roster guy?" asked beaming Irvine assistant Maz 
Trakh after Keefe put on a bit of a show. The skinny 6-4 freshman from 
Winchester, Mass., drilled a few three-pointers and even more impressively 
drove strong to the hoop for a couple of twisting layups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not judge a freshman on his first intrasquad scrimmage and make him the 
next Chris Brown," Coach Rod Baker said, in reference to Irvine's senior guard 
who led the nation in three-point shooting last season. "Let's see if he can 
string a few together before we make him into Byron Scott." 
</P>
<P>
 Keefe, who plays behind Brown, is the new face you won't see in that starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Least Impressive On-Court Debut Award was "won" by Raimonds Miglinieks, 
the Latvian point guard who averaged more than 11 assists at Riverside College. 
He made one spectacular, no-look, over-the-back-of-the-head pass, but he didn't 
wow anybody otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can play better than he did tonight," Baker said, "but still he's getting 
the ball to the right people. And he's still getting used to some things we're 
asking him to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Least Impressive Debut Award goes to Kevin Simmons, the 6-8 freshman 
center from Brooklyn who sooner or later figures to be the best of the bunch. 
He's got a nice outside shooting touch for a big man and good inside moves for 
a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Anteater faithful who showed up to see him only got a look 
at him in street clothes. Junior transfer Michael Tate elbowed Simmons in the 
mouth during practice Saturday, and Simmons' loose front teeth had to be wired 
together and attached to his gums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take him in this week to get an X-ray and see if his nose is 
broken," Baker said. "Then we'll know how long he's going to be out." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Could Easily Pass for a Heavyweight Award is in the firm grip of Tate, 
who is not afraid to battle anyone for a rebound or loose ball. He's also not 
afraid to grab a teammate by the arm, pull him close and make an animated and 
angry appeal into his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael plays at a certain level, all the time," Baker said, smiling. "And 
that is good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he plays taller: OK, Tate is no shrinking violet on a basketball court. 
Just ask Simmons' dentist. But he keeps getting shorter on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Anteaters announced that Tate had signed a letter of intent to attend 
Irvine, he was a "6-6, 210-pound forward." By the time the 1994-95 basketball 
prospectus was printed, he was listed at 6-5, 200 pounds. And Sunday 
afternoon's roster listed him at 6-4 and 225. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is probably closest to the truth. And a large portion of that 225 
pounds is biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: The Sporting News ranks the Anteaters 176th in the nation, 
behind Big West peers New Mexico State (47), UNLV (78), Utah State (131), Long 
Beach State (136) and UC Santa Barbara (160). 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Vitale has it figured this way: New Mexico State (52); Utah State (59); 
UNLV (61); Long Beach State (111); UC Santa Barbara (149) and Irvine (151). 
</P>
<P>
 "Street & Smith's" predicts the Anteaters will finish seventh in the Big West 
and "Athlon" picks Irvine to end up sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has higher aspirations. The Anteaters ended up face down in the Big West 
cellar with a 4-14 regular-season record last season, but no one was holding 
their heads higher after they swept through the postseason tournament before 
losing the final to New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our wing players have had great practices, but we've had trouble staying 
healthy with the inside guys," Baker said. "I'd like to see it all together at 
the same time to determine how good we are, but I feel good about this team. I 
feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a roll? The women's basketball team, which also made its debut Sunday 
afternoon, won three of its last seven games and also had a semi-positive 
experience in the Big West tournament, losing to top-seeded Hawaii, 85-82. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission," said Coach Colleen Matsuhara, "is to build from the way we 
played in that game, when we were seconds away from upsetting the best team in 
the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters have two freshmen recruits -- Leticia Oseguera from Mater Dei 
High and Sabrina Roberson from Corpus Christi, Tex. -- but neither figures to 
have the kind of immediate impact expected of the new players on the men's 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do expect them both to challenge for significant playing time," Matsuhara 
said. "Roberson is probably the quickest player we have ever had here and she 
is going to allow us to put some real defensive pressure on people. And I 
thought Oseguera did some very positive things in the scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fever? A crowd of 280 filled the bleachers and crowded around the 
Irvine soccer field Sunday afternoon to see the women's team play Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters lost, 2-1, when San Luis Obispo's Kolleen Kassis scored in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Chris Tontz, who is ranked No. 67 in the country, is seeded seventh in 
the Rolex-International Tennis Assn. Southern California Men's Tennis Regional, 
which begins Wednesday and runs through Sunday at Irvine. Most of the matches 
will be played at the UCI Tennis Stadium with some scheduled for the Racquet 
Club of Irvine and the Newport Beach Tennis Club. The singles final is 10:30 
a.m. Sunday, followed by the doubles championship. . . . The men's soccer team 
ended the season on a sour note, losing three times last week to finish 11-8, 
one victory shy of tying the single-season record of 12, set in 1984. Senior 
P.J. Polowski ensured his spot in the record book, however, scoring a goal and 
adding an assist to give him a career-record 73 points at Irvine. He 
accomplished the feat in only two seasons. . . . Basketball injury update: 
Senior forward LaDay Smith has a sprained knee and is "day-to-day," according 
to trainer Jim Pluemer. Forwards Michael Tate (pulled hamstring) and Shaun 
Battle (pulled quadriceps) are also hobbled. On the women's side, senior guard 
Michele Kahler has a severely sprained ankle and senior forward Jinelle 
Williams has been hampered by tendinitis in both knees. . . . Two freshmen 
swimmers -- Amerie Nordberg and Carrie Rowe -- had impressive outings in the 
USC Invitational last weekend. Nordberg was third in both the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke events and Rowe was fifth in the 100 butterfly.

was impressed with almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fit all my needs," she said. "I really liked the campus, the team was 
great, and I liked the coaching staff as well. It's a big school and that's 
important because I like to be around a lot of people."

CHAPMAN MISSES SOCCER PLAYOFFS

 The Chapman men's and women's soccer teams received bad news from the NCAA 
Sunday night: Neither team was picked to play in the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman women (12-6) lost to UC San Diego, 3-2, Sunday, which likely ended 
the Panthers' chances of being picked.San Diego (11-0-3) was the only team from 
California to get a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther men's team beat Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills, 2-0, 
Sunday. Chapman Coach Gregg Murphy believed Chapman's strength of schedule 
would help earn it the bid despite a 10-4-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman beat Division I UC Santa Barbara and was 1-1-1 in games against 
Division II opponents. UC San Diego (11-6-1) and Claremont-Mudd (15-2-1), teams 
that Chapman tied, each received playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Claremont had a better record than us, but their schedule wasn't nearly as 
strong," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Chapman teams will complete their seasons by playing host to Cal Poly 
Pomona today. MARTIN BECK

 Knowing the rules is an increasingly important -- and difficult -- reality for 
administrators at NCAA schools, and Long Beach athletes recently have learned 
this the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior point guard Tyrone Mays, a starter for the men's basketball team last 
season, is academically ineligible because Long Beach officials again provided 
wrong information about NCAA rules, Long Beach Director of Compliance and 
Student Services Mary Ann Tripodi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripodi, in her first year as the compliance officer, said Mays is in good 
academic standing, but he cannot participate in games because officials wrongly 
advised him about selecting the proper courses in order to remain eligible 
under NCAA guidelines. Three members of the water polo team also were declared 
ineligible by the NCAA Eligibility Committee this season after receiving 
similar advise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're just waiting to see what happens," Coach Seth Greenberg said. 
"It's not his fault. He only needs six classes to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays, who is 6 feet 1 and averaged 4.2 points last season, will not play in 
the 49ers' first exhibition game against High-Five America Saturday night at 
The Gold Mine. Tripodi said he can continue practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is assessing the possibility of filing an appeal with the 
committee. The university unsuccessfully appealed the ineligibility of the 
water polo players. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Test run: A crowd of approximately 500 watched the men's basketball team in 
its first public appearance this season Saturday in an intrasquad scrimmage at 
The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard James Cotton (6-4), the conference's freshman of the year last season, 
and senior center Joe McNaull (6-10) each scored 18 points to lead the Black 
team to a 71-65 victory over the Gold. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just another showdown: Talk with some coaches and players the week of two key 
volleyball matches against the conference leader, and you'll almost sense the 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 However, you won't see the women's volleyball team sweat. Well, at least not 
until game time. 
</P>
<P>
 Big West Conference-leading Hawaii enters The Gold Mine at 7:30 tonight for 
the first of two pivotal matches with the 49ers. The teams also play Wednesday 
night at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, ranked fifth in the nation by Volleyball Monthly magazine, is 20-2, 
13-1 in conference play. The No. 8 49ers (17-3, 12-1), three-time defending 
conference champions, have three conference matches left after this week and 
the Rainbow Wahine have two. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner gains the inside track at the conference title, and momentum 
entering the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers aren't wide-eyed with fear, tension, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because when you're the defending national champion, you learn to deal 
with what's dealt. The 49ers' attitude? Been there; done that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big week, but we're not changing anything (for Hawaii)," Coach 
Brian Gimmillaro said. "We do the same things against everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow Wahine hold the conference record for consecutive titles with four 
(1987-90). Gimmillaro acknowledges this is one of Hawaii's best teams, and he 
can think of a better scenario than playing back-to-back nights, but he likes 
the 49ers' chances nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have a month of practice (before playing Hawaii)," Gimmillaro 
said. "It makes it tough on us, but we're good as long as we do what we know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pay-back: Although often erratic, the 49ers defeated visiting Santa Barbara on 
Friday in a conference match, 14-16, 15-11, 15-8, 15-4. The third-place Gauchos 
won an intense match when the teams met Oct. 1 at Santa Barbara, 11-15, 15-10, 
15-12, 6-15, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little lack of motivation at times (Friday), but then we started 
getting angry at ourselves," said senior defensive specialist Prentice Perkins, 
who had a career-high five aces. "Then we started playing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running high: Andy Sythe, coach of the men's and women's cross-country teams, 
thought he had an airtight plan for success at the Big West Conference 
championship meet in Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevation at the course is 4,800 feet, so Sythe instructed the 49ers to 
take things slow and let the high altitude take effect on their opponents. 
Sythe figured many runners would struggle in that environment -- and that the 
49ers would remain strong and finish well. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems reasonable. And the execution? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, some things are best left on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "My race strategy just didn't work out," Sythe said. "We weren't in the race 
from the beginning. We were relying on people to come back to us and they never 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 The men finished fifth with a team score of 136. Freshman Pat Bendzick ran the 
fastest time for the men, covering the five-mile course in 26 minutes 38.4 
seconds and finishing 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 More disappointing was the women's finish. Sythe believed the team could take 
third, but it wound up seventh with 160 points. Sophomore Christa Ayuso 
provided a bright spot, however, covering the 3.1-mile course in 19:11.2. She 
was 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ayuso ran a beautiful race," Sythe said, "especially considering the strategy 
didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes

SELF-DEFENSE TACTICS: DEFUSE TROUBLE OR RUN AWAY; PROTECTION: 'COPING WITH 
THREAT AND ANGER IN A VIOLENT WORLD' THROUGH UCI EXTENSION WILL FOCUS ON 
AGGRESSION IN THE WORKPLACE, HOW IT CAN ESCALATE AND HOW TO AVOID IT.

 "H e that fights and runs away may live to fight another day. " -- Anonymous 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Novaco and Alon Stivi see a flaw in that reasoning. In our ever-nastier 
modern world, they say, the trick is not to fight at all, and to perfect the 
technique of running away. Life in the '90s is not a Rambo movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "No John Wayne stuff," Novaco said. "The most important thing is to survive, 
and the imperative thing is to run and escape. That's your first course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Not your usual self-defense advice. But the course Novaco and Stivi will teach 
Friday and Saturday through UCI Extension isn't designed to turn out a roomful 
of Chuck Norrises. It's designed to show how, in a potentially hostile 
situation, "you can regulate anger and aggression," Novaco said. "It isn't a 
martial-arts class. We're going to be talking about survival strategies and 
tactical awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, how to spot trouble and either defuse it or escape from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Novaco, a UCI professor of psychology and social behavior who has done 
extensive study of anger, aggression and stress, said he got the idea for the 
class after conferring with his self-defense teacher, Stivi, a former 
commando/paratrooper in the Israeli Special Forces and a counter-terrorism 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the class, titled "Survival Psychology and Personal Protection: 
Coping with Threat and Anger in a Violent World," will be primarily on 
workplace violence, said Novaco, and how anger can escalate to aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all confrontations are predictable, said Stivi, a specialist in the 
Israeli self-defense and survival system known as Hisardut (literally, 
"survival"). 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know what you're doing, there's never anything that happens just out 
of the blue," he said. "People give you signs and warnings about 99% of the 
time that they're going to do something. But most people don't know how to read 
those signs. There are always cues. And they can last a month or two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially dangerous escalations of anger, in the workplace and elsewhere, 
can occur "any time a person feels boxed in without many options and . . . 
highly agitated," Novaco said. "Typically, when confrontations escalate, 
negatives, such as dismissive behavior, lead to more negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 To break the cycles of frustration and anger that can lead to violence, Novaco 
said students will be taught to acknowledge the person's anger and to give that 
person "an opportunity to redirect the anger. Ask them to say what's wrong and 
give them time to tell it: 'Start at the beginning; I'm listening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the situation appears to be spiraling out of control, the students 
must be aware of "proper distancing, proper positioning, body motion, the ways 
their surroundings can be used." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in high-risk professions, such as nurses at mental institutions or 
probation department employees, lack such knowledge, Novaco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be amazed at the number of errors these professional people make in 
dealing with violent people," he said. "I've seen people position themselves 
behind a desk with no escape route. There have been instances when people have 
stood and blocked doors while dealing with highly agitated people. I saw one 
woman sit down, and the first thing she did was take off her scarf and lay it 
on the table. That's a potential weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, the students will be made aware of how their internal state 
changes during a threatening situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotional arousal," Novaco said, "narrows your attention. You're not 
considering your alternatives very well." 
</P>
<P>
 To give the students the experience of an actual threat, Stivi said that they 
will be taught in the UCI Social Ecology building's Environmental Simulation 
Laboratory, an office-like environment where the lights and sound can be 
controlled and situations can be staged. Novaco calls that process "stress 
inoculation." 
</P>
<P>
 He advised that people be aware of their surroundings at all times. Know what 
objects in the room could be used as weapons. Decide what the best escape route 
might be and how many seconds it will take to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there a whiff of paranoia there? 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that paranoid? No. It's cautious," Stivi said. "Ever since you were a kid 
you were taught, when you get ready to cross a street you look left and right. 
Is that paranoid? These things that we'll be teaching aren't paranoid because 
society has created a need for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Novaco: "There's no use in pretending the need for it isn't there."

BUT THEN, WOMEN CAN FIND THEIR OWN SOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WEINGARTEN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This thesis will reluctantly examine the painful though inescapable scientific 
fact that women are stupider than men. 
</P>
<P>
 The author wishes to emphasize at the outset that not all women are stupider 
than all men; indeed, some women are very smart, such as Marie Curie and 
Katharine Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unassailable evidence from all available aggregate data -- as measured 
physiologically, taxonomically and through the application of empirical testing 
procedures involving highly scientific terminology such as "standard deviation" 
-- is that women, in comparison to men, are imbeciles. 
</P>
<P>
 This conclusion should not be used to discriminate in any way against women, 
nor to make any assumptions whatsoever about the cognitive abilities of 
individual women, many of whom have made valuable contributions to society, 
such as Sandra Day O'Connor and Katharine Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Before summarizing his findings, the author also wishes to acknowledge his 
indebtedness to Charles Murray and the late Richard J. Herrnstein, authors of 
the controversial, gigantically scientific new book arguing, with grave 
misgivings, that black people are genetically inferior to white people in 
intelligence. Drs. Murray and Herrnstein make this courageous assertion at the 
very real risk of being labeled dangerous, evil racists and making many 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 This article could not have happened without their inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Ascent of Man 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren are familiar with the standard drawing illustrating mankind's 
emergence from the primordial soup and gradual evolution to the upright, 
cerebral biped he is today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is instructive to note that the most obvious evolutionary development 
accompanying man's increasing sentience is his increasing erectness. Stated 
more scientifically, the evolution of the brain is inextricably twinned with an 
increase in the height of his center of gravity (emphasis mine). 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Gray's Anatomy," a woman's center of gravity is 12% lower than a 
man's. This reflects the comparatively larger displacement of her hips and 
lower torso, a factor attributable to her capacity for childbearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The author wishes to emphasize that women's childbearing role is an important 
one, and women should not be disrespected for this, or belittled for it, even 
though it is irrefutable evidence that they are lower than men on the 
evolutionary scale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Weighty Evidence 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 medical study of cadavers at the University of Western Ontario and a 
contemporary but independent study in Ulster, Northern Ireland, concluded that 
on the average, men's brains are 8% larger than women's brains, even after 
adjusting for the discrepancy in the total body weight of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 We make no assertion here that brain mass relates directly to intelligence. As 
scientists, we must at all costs avoid the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter 
hoc. To argue that women are dumber because their brains are smaller would be 
no more intellectually valid than asserting that just because someone is 6 
feet, 7 inches tall, he is more likely to be able to dunk a basketball than 
someone who is 5 feet 3. 
</P>
<P>
 So call this one a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. Extremely Empirical Data 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., women, on 
average, score nearly 50 points below men on the Scholastic Assessment Test, 
the national college entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies point out that once women are in college, their performance is 
equal to, or even superior to, men's performance. We must accept that fact for 
what it is. Unscientific. Unlike an exam administered anonymously, graded by 
computer and field-tested over generations to eliminate bias of any sort, 
performance in school is perforce a manipulable measurement. It is a measure 
not of raw ability, or of intellectual capacity, but of a mishmash of qualities 
that includes diligence, organization and diplomatic skills. It can be affected 
by factors as extraneous as one's consumption of fraternity beer, or one's 
skill at coquettishly elevating one's stockinged thigh in a manner pleasing to 
the professorial eye. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Women's Tutorial 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, social scientists have been conducting elaborate studies involving 
male and female performance in the workplace. One of the more interesting of 
these was a recent study by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners 
on the relative success of businesses run by men and businesses run by women. 
The study also surveys the management techniques employed by each sex. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, the results suggest parity. Men and women owners succeed in 
business in about equal proportion. Men tend to be more dictatorial, women more 
consensus-building. These were the results as reported in the national media. 
</P>
<P>
 The national media failed to properly interpret the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Further analysis of the findings reveals that men tend to make their decisions 
on their own. Women are 30% more likely to call in consultants. Consultants are 
60% more likely to be men. (Emphasis mine.) Successful female-owned businesses, 
then, rely in substantial measure on help from men. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, complicated scientific concepts are best grasped by laymen through the 
adoption of a simpler statistical model. Think of it this way: The United 
States and Canada both won World War II. Were they entitled to be equally 
proud? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5. The Penultimate Pitch 
</P>
<P>
 Plato, the first social scientist, watched shadows dancing on the cave wall 
and drew elaborate conclusions about the lives of the people within. So too may 
we analyze the mysteries of the brain through its shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain is a machine, comparable to an internal combustion engine. The more 
efficient the engine, the better the mileage, the lower the oil consumption, 
the stronger the torque. 
</P>
<P>
 The more efficient the brain, the more efficient the operation of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider man versus woman on the ball field. 
</P>
<P>
 The human female's "bent-arm" contorted throwing style is the least efficient 
possible method for propelling a baseball through space, and yet it is 
automatically adopted by any girl or woman of any age throwing a ball for the 
first, or thousandth, time. 
</P>
<P>
 The straighter, whiplike off-the-shoulder male style is the most efficient 
method yet devised. No one teaches this. The male brain simply knows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6. The Marathon Woman 
</P>
<P>
 Consistently, since ancient Greece, the best women's times in the marathon 
have been 10% to 20% slower than the best men's times, and this disparity has 
generally extended over the aggregate times of all finishers. Historically, 
this has been attributed to an assumed lesser strength of women, a contention 
we reject as patronizing. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the material thus far presented, is it not reasonable to speculate 
that women's longer marathon times might be attributable to the fact that, 
during the course of the race, they tend to get lost? 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion 
</P>
<P>
 Society must recognize the existence of inherent gender-based intellectual 
disparities, and celebrate these differences without seeking to denigrate women 
or minimize their historical contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 Women must be encouraged to tailor their goals to reasonable expectations, 
considering their limitations. Because humor is a function of intellect, 
articles like this should be patiently explained to them, so they do not make 
untoward and uncharitable assumptions about the motives of the author, who is, 
after all, like Drs. Murray and Herrnstein, an impartial scientist who is free 
of all bigotry.

A MEDICAL IMBALANCE; AFTER A LONG HISTORY OF TESTING TREATMENTS PRIMARILY ON 
WHITE MEN, SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO INCLUDE WOMEN AND MINORITIES. ATTRACTING 
THEM COULD MEAN SAVING MORE LIVES -- BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was envisioned as one of the first ethnically balanced, large-scale studies 
of its kind: a trial of 16,000 women to test tamoxifen's ability to prevent 
breast cancer in women at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But when researchers began recruiting subjectts for the nationwide drug study 
in 1992, they were able to attract few minorities. Just 2% of the initial study 
population were African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinas or Pacific 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 A later recruiting drive, this time targeting ethnic groups, raised the 
percentage to 4. But researchers, who had hoped for up to 20%, remain troubled. 
If a significant number of minority women aren't enrolled soon, researchers 
will be unable to answer a key question when the study ends: Does the drug work 
any differently in women of color? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts now estimate that about 60% of the study's final 5,000 to 6,000 women 
will have to be minorities -- a daunting number by any research standards -- in 
order to answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers in the tamoxifen study are hardly alone in their dilemma. After a 
long history of testing medical treatments primarily on white men, scientists 
performing federally funded research are now generally required to enroll a 
certain percentage of women in the studies and, in many cases, a certain 
percentage of racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But opening this door to better and certainly more equitable science has not 
resulted in a flood of candidates. Many studies designed to include minority 
women are sorely lacking in participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all the studies going on right now are underrepresented in terms of 
women of color," says Dr. Antronette K. Yancey, an assistant professor of 
public health at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the poor participation are complex and suggest that 
improvements won't be simple to achieve. According to Dr. Machelle Allen, an 
obstetrician at the New York University Medical Center who has studied the 
issue, the reasons include: 
</P>
<P>
 * a history of unethical and abusive studies involving minority groups; 
</P>
<P>
 * discrimination in medical care; 
</P>
<P>
 * practical barriers, such as a lack of transportation to clinical trials or 
time to participate in them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an article by Allen in a recent issue of the Journal of the 
American Medical Women's Assn., the efforts to establish race-based quotas for 
participation in clinical research will be unsuccessful unless these problems 
are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are complicated issues," Yancey acknowledges. "(Participation in 
studies) takes a certain attitude and mind-set. But before that, it takes a lot 
of information." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a historical perspective, it should be no surprise that minorities -- 
especially women -- distrust clinical research, which oftentimes divides 
patients into two groups -- one group receives the experimental therapy and the 
other receives a placebo or no therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most notorious examples of unethical medical research involved 
minority groups, says Leslie Laurence, co-author of the book "Outrageous 
Practices: The Alarming Truths About How Medicine Treats Women" (Fawcett 
Columbine, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the fear on the part of some minority women that they are going to 
be used as guinea pigs," says Laurence, whose book documents how women in 
general have been ignored in medical research. "It's the legend of Tuskegee." 
</P>
<P>
 The infamous 1932 Tuskegee study looked at untreated syphilis in black men. 
Treatment with penicillin was withheld from the men even though their death 
rate was twice as high as normal. The study was eventually exposed and halted. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other examples. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1845 and 1849, Dr. J. Marion Sims -- widely known as the "father of 
American gynecology" -- performed 42 surgeries on Alabama slave women without 
their consent or the comfort of anesthesia in search of a cure for fistulas (a 
tear from the bladder to the vagina), Laurence recounts in her book. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the 1950s, a group of mostly poor Mexican American women were enrolled 
in a trial to study the side effects of oral contraceptives. According to 
Allen, all the women thought they would receive oral contraceptives. None of 
the women were informed that they would actually be taking a placebo some of 
the time. Ten became pregnant while on the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 While oversight committees -- called institutional review boards -- are now 
used to protect patients and ensure that ethical guidelines are met in clinical 
trials, conducted under scientifically rigorous conditions, the mistrust 
lingers, Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of abuse in the name of research has created fear and 
skepticism," she says in her journal report. "It will take more than the 
assurance of an institutional review board to undo the generations of harm done 
by research abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides trust, many people simply do not know that they are eligible to 
participate in medical studies. This is especially true of disadvantaged women, 
particularly minorities who may not even see a doctor or go to a clinic on a 
regular basis, Laurence says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The care these women get is often fragmented. They already feel frustration 
with the medical system. And often, to get into a trial, you have to be 
referred by your personal doctor," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Practical issues also come into play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a woman is also low income, she may not have the child care or 
transportation to get to the trial site," Laurence says. "Altruism isn't enough 
of a reason to take a bus for two hours."

 Experts agree that diversifying studies will result in more precise medical 
practices that are based on gender and ethnic makeup. For instance, in certain 
ethnic groups, some drugs are metabolized differently, and some diseases are 
more prevalent and even appear deadlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure that a new treatment . . . would apply equally across 
various ethnic groups," says Dr. John S. Kovach, executive vice president for 
medical and scientific affairs at the City of Hope National Medical Center in 
Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Biological differences among ethnic groups, while rare, are of extreme 
importance in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. found 
that black women with breast cancer are more than twice as likely to die from 
it as white women, in part because the malignancies are often more aggressive 
and fast-growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the results of the 16,000-women, $68-million Breast Cancer Prevention 
Trial to test tamoxifen for disease prevention will be, perhaps, of greater 
significance to African American women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly are anxious to recruit women of color," says Dr. Leslie Ford, 
who is directing the study for the National Cancer Institute. "In black women, 
breast cancer rates are higher at a younger age. And when they get it they seem 
to die more often. That is why we need to know what happens with the (black) 
women who take tamoxifen." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers exploring AIDS treatments are also concerned about minority 
involvement in trials, Allen says. For example, the early studies on zidovudine 
-- the first approved treatment for HIV -- did not address possible racial 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks and Latinos, especially women, are still slightly underrepresented in 
some studies at the UCLA CARE Center, says the director, Dr. Ronald Mitsuyasu. 
The center -- which stands for Clinical AIDS Research and Education -- is one 
of the leading AIDS research institutes in the nation, with more than 11,000 
people involved in studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized quite early that we were deficient in terms of our minority 
enrollment. But it hasn't been easy," Mitsuyasu says. 
</P>
<P>
 The CARE Center has offered taxi and bus vouchers, free meals and child care 
to attract study volunteers. Researchers are even giving more attention to the 
demands of their studies, looking for ways to reduce tests or clinic visits 
that are not essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to think long and hard about whether we absolutely need a certain 
test, such as a weekly blood test, in a study," Mitsuyasu says. "Just from a 
fairness standpoint, we have to make it easier for people for whom it's not 
easy to participate." 
</P>

 Yancey has demonstrated that if you make it easy and understandable, they will 
come. To recruit volunteers for her study on how diet and exercise can 
influence the health of African American women, she hit the public lecture 
circuit, ran radio spots and newspaper blurbs, and offered participants a free 
three-month fitness-club membership and a cookbook featuring the healthiest 
recipes of black American chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yancey also appealed to the women's sense of fairness with the message that 
cancer and heart disease kill African Americans more than any other group. 
"When programs are developed to fight cancer and heart disease, our voices must 
be heard. After all, our tax dollars are paying for it," she said in the study 
literature and radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
 When told what the study entailed and how they would benefit, the women had no 
hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have connective tissue disease, and I had gained 20 pounds in the last six 
months. So I felt that anything that can benefit my health would be great," 
says Peyton Chappell, 44, who joined the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Moore, 43, says she was intrigued with a medical study that was 
exclusively for black women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Well, that's a new concept.' You hear about studies all the time 
with Caucasian males, and even white women. So when they get around to studying 
black women, I figured, 'it's my turn,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers hope that attitude catches on as they begin recruitment this 
winter on the largest-ever study on women -- the Women's Health Initiative -- 
which will involve 163,000 post-menopausal women at 40 research centers 
nationwide. The 15-year, $628-million trial will study chronic diseases that 
affect women. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the most sweeping attempt ever to include minorities in medical 
research, various centers will set goals for minority recruitment ranging from 
10% to 60% of their total participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Women's Health Initiative is making an enormous attempt to recruit 
minority women," says Dr. Howard Judd, the principal investigator at UCLA for 
the trial. "And there is serious concern about the ability to do this -- it's 
one thing to recruit African American women, but there are now, in California, 
so many minority groups." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the Women's Health Initiative was largely conceived as a result of 
the longstanding exclusion of women and minorities from medical research, to 
settle for less would be wrong, Judd says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so little work being done in minorities and in women that we really 
need to recoup that and make an effort to bring them in." How to Be a Test

 Mao Tse-Tung -- the spelling of whose name was later changed to Mao Zedong, 
forcing the world's comedians to make fairly significant changes in numerous 
punch lines -- overcame peasant status to march across China, overthrow the 
Nationalists, then rule a massive nation for nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 All this from an overweight man with green teeth who never bathed and who, 
into his 80s, spent much of his time rolling around naked with young women. 
That latter habit earned him the affectionate nickname Sunkuotang Jianxgi 
Miuxtin ("Bob Barker of China.") 
</P>
<P>
 These and other startling and stomach-churning revelations about the communist 
giant are courtesy Li Zhisui, Mao's personal physician for 22 years. Li seldom 
left Mao's side, which, by the way, tended to be the upwind side. 
</P>
<P>
 Li now lives in Chicago and has written a book about the unbathed leader, a 
book initially titled, "Twenty-Two Years With a Clothespin on My Nose" but 
changed at the last minute to "The Private Life of Chairman Mao." 
</P>
<P>
 In those 22 years, Li claims, Mao never once bathed. He also refused to brush 
his teeth, and years before his death the choppers had turned a lovely 
turquoise from decay. When the doctor begged Mao to brush, he replied, "A tiger 
never brushes his teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Li seemingly did not want to risk being disciplined by suggesting that Mao did 
not resemble a tiger but rather a bloated water buffalo, and opted for the more 
simple response of, "You betcha, Boss!" 
</P>
<P>
 Li says Mao spent years without even leaving his bed, a monstrous piece of 
furniture that was carried about the country -- with the happy-go-lucky leader 
under the sheets -- by legions of strong men. Strong enough, in fact, to be 
able to hoist the Honorable Load with just one hand, the other needed, of 
course, to pinch their nostrils shut. Most dreaded by these servants was not 
war or famine or even a bloody counterrevolution, but rather an unexpected gust 
of wind that would sweep the Supreme Stench over them. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you're probably wondering how the heck did an aging man who smelled like 
the rear ends of a thousand panda bears and had mushrooms growing from his 
mouth do so well with the babes? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, experts have suggested it was the Chairman's magnificent personality and 
overwhelming aura of sexuality. Of course, others have suggested that perhaps 
his fanatical, billion-man army may have contributed -- at least in some small 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his reign, not a single account was written of even one teen-age 
target of Mao's great lust telling him: "Not tonight, I have a headache. And 
more to the point, my teal-toothed Great Communist Landfill, you give off 
unspeakable odor." 
</P>
<P>
 Not one! 
</P>
<P>
 Mao's particular bell-ringer was a bout with four or five girls at the same 
time -- the girls were ordered to exclaim "Papa Oom Mao, Mao!" at frequent 
intervals -- which he claimed was the only way to restore his "declining yang," 
in Li's words. To be able to restore this yang (I think we should be careful 
here not to overuse the word yang ) for hours at a time without stopping, Mao 
was often forced to think about baseball. Or, as a last resort, about his own 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampant sexuality, Li says, was Mao's attempt to copy China's legendary 
first emperor, a man said to have achieved immortality by making love to 1,000 
virgins. Chinese legend also has it that this emperor took a lot of naps. He 
lives still, the story goes, roaming the Chinese countryside with a big, stupid 
grin on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mao's final years, as he became ill and his hatred of soap and great fear 
of dental floss increased, Dr. Li put the Chairman on a strict diet of pancakes 
and flounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pancakes and flounder?" a weakening Mao asked his loyal physician. "This will 
prolong my life and restore the health of such a great man as I?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," Li told the great emperor. "It's the only food we're gonna be able to 
slide under your door."

YOUR BODY: BODY WATCH; FASTER RELIEF FROM A PRESSING PROBLEM; THE SIGNS ARE 
UNMISTAKABLE -- IT'S ANOTHER URINARY TRACT INFECTION. NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS: 
THERE ARE BETTER REMEDIES NOWADAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first clue might be an annoying need to visit the bathroom way too often. 
That's followed by a burning sensation while urinating and sometimes pain in 
the pelvic area. 
</P>
<P>
 Urinary tract infections most often affect women, but men aren't immune, 
especially in later life when enlargement of the prostate gland can increase 
the likelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately there's good news for sufferers. Treatment of urinary tract 
infections -- which can involve the bladder, kidneys or the urine-transporting 
tubes -- has become easier in recent years, thanks, in part, to new antibiotics 
and shorter courses of medication. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Stats and the Source: Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are nearly always 
bacterial. Women are more prone than men due partly to anatomy. A woman's 
urethra -- the tube through which urine is excreted from the bladder -- is 
shorter, making infection more likely. Infection can occur after intercourse, 
when bacteria normally found in the genital area can be pushed up into the 
urinary tract. 
</P>
<P>
 UTIs are so common, some experts say, that most women can count on having at 
least one at some point in their lives. Published figures estimate 10% of women 
have had UTIs, says Dr. Eila Skinner, USC assistant professor of urology, but 
she suspects the percentage is actually much higher. "And of those women who 
get one, 20% will have recurring infections," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of a diaphragm or IUD for contraception can be associated with UTIs, 
experts say. And what about the folklore that also links horseback riding, 
bicycling, and wearing tight jeans and tight pantyhose to UTIs? 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be some merit to the horseback riding," says Dr. Barton Wachs, a 
urologist at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and clinical instructor at 
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. As for the risk of the other behaviors, evidence is 
"mostly anecdotal," he says. But if women notice a link, avoiding the attire or 
activity might help. "But of course many people who do all these things never 
have an infection," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home Remedies: At the first sign of infection, many women self-treat by 
drinking plenty of fluids, including cranberry juice, hoping to flush out the 
bad bugs. It probably can't hurt in most cases, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who's had a type of kidney stone composed of calcium oxalate -- the 
most common kind -- should avoid the cranberry juice remedy, Wachs says, 
because the juice contains oxalic acid. (But others, including a spokeswoman 
for a cranberry juice manufacturer, counter that there's not enough oxalic acid 
to do harm.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Professional Help: Self-care helps about half of women, Skinner says. If 
symptoms don't improve in two or three days, see a doctor, she advises. 
</P>
<P>
 Seek medical help, too, if the urine contains blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Men or children with suspected UTIs should always see a physician because 
their infections are likely to be associated with potentially serious 
underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis & Treatment: A physician may order a culture of the urine, which can 
pinpoint the bacteria involved and determine whether kidney stones have formed. 
"Certain organisms suggest kidney stones or other abnormalities," Skinner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Oral antibiotics are the usual treatment. Commonly prescribed are such 
medicines as ampicillin or nitrofurantoin. Quinolones, a newer choice, have 
become a common treatment, but they are being overused, says Dr. Philip Hanno, 
professor and chairman of the department of urology at Temple University School 
of Medicine. Quinolones -- such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) -- should be reserved 
for "complicated cases," he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're a lifesaver on a Friday afternoon when you can't get a culture 
(analyzed)," Wachs counters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Versus Old Treatments: Not too many years ago, standard antibiotic 
treatment for UTIs took seven to 10 days, Hanno says. Now, patients are placed 
on "shorter and shorter" courses, with two-day regimens common. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the medicine is even taken in a single dose, thus increasing patient 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within 24 hours after starting an antibiotic you should feel better," Wachs 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Following antibiotic treatment, however, women are more prone to yeast 
infections, Wachs says. So he recommends an over-the-counter anti-fungal remedy 
(such as Monistat 7 or Gyne-Lotrimin) or a prescription anti-fungal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 If a woman has repeated UTIs, a physician might recommend daily use of 
antibiotics for three to six months to build resistance. Or, some women are 
given an emergency supply of antibiotics to use when they notice symptoms or to 
take before and after intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who get more than four UTIs in a year should see a urologist, Wachs 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An Ounce of Prevention: Drinking plenty of fluids and voiding after 
intercourse can help flush away bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Horizon: Under development is a vaccine to protect against UTIs. While 
it is not expected to be on the market in the immediate future, Hanno says, it 
does promise eventual relief to women prone to infections. How the Urinary 
System Works Also known as the urinary tract, the system, which filters and 
disposes of waste from the blood, consist of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and 
the urethra. The Kidneys This is where urine is formed to help carry out waste 
from the blood. Located next to the aorta, more than two pints of blood passess 
through the kidneys every minute. Cross section Cortex, Medulla, Calyces, 
Pelvis Collecting System After going through the filtration system, or medulla, 
most of the water and other substances are reabsorbed into the blood. The 
remaining concentrated urine are collected by the calyces and run through the 
pelvis. From there, the urine goes to the ureter. The Ureters The tubes that 
carry the urine from the kidney to the bladder. The Bladder This is where up to 
a pint of urine is stored. Composition of Urine * 96% water * 2% urea (the main 
waste product) * 1% sodium chloride (salt)

 Hola! . . . puff puff, puff . . . Como esta usted? . . . puff, puff, puff . . 
. Only five more miles to go! Bueno! . . . puff. 
</P>
<P>
 I made it -- logged nearly 15 miles on an exercise bike and at the same time 
expanded my knowledge of a foreign tongue. Education and exercise? Surely this 
is what living in the '90s is all about. By the end of this seven-week class I 
will have terrific language skills, not to mention great thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm enrolled in Cyclearning Conversational Spanish at a local gym, Corner on 
Health. There are six of us, all adults. We face the chalkboard and our teacher 
(the only person actually standing) in a half-circle of stationary bicycles. 
She teaches; we pedal. 
</P>
<P>
 And we learn, possibly more efficiently than if we weren't simultaneously 
burning fat. That's the theory of gym owner Ellie Hodder, a former music 
teacher. She once observed that kids learned faster if their bodies were 
working along with their minds. To test her theory, she added Exercycle French 
and Spanish to the gym's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly five years later, she has a faithful band of cycle learners. It 
seems they're game for just about any class on wheels. There have been 
nutrition classes, film appreciation classes, even a Perry Mason fan club that 
pedaled through the TV reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the highbrow stuff. This month, Hodder is bringing in a director 
from the Portland Repertory Theatre, who will discuss this season's offerings 
over the whir of culture-seekers' pedaling. The price of that class includes 
opening-night play tickets, but wearing bicycle shorts at the gala is 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm looking forward to the fall film series. One feature-length film, plus 
group discussion after the credits, can burn up a lot of calories. "Thelma and 
Louise" is the one I don't want to miss. We will be pedaling away, with the 
long-range goal of improving our male-female relations, while on the screen T & 
L are handling it in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment, I'm in Spanish class. It's a relief to see that other 
students are also saddle sore and occasionally have to stand up on the pedals 
to restore circulation. At least Spanish class doesn't dehydrate me; like all 
the other students, I keep my water bottle handy. 
</P>
<P>
 I had originally signed up for French but attended only one class. You see, 
some time ago I'd had four years of high school French. It soon became clear 
that my rather elementary French was miles beyond that of my fellow travelers. 
After just a few laps of class, the teacher observed that my French was coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I agreed. "It's like riding a bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
 I dropped out -- dismounted, actually -- with some regret because the French 
students had devised a fun way to motivate their feet. They kept track of their 
mileage and then mapped their progress on the route of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
 A few veterans of the French class -- those students with the slim thighs -- 
remarked that they'd already circled France several times. Somebody suggested 
Tahiti for a change, until they realized that their total mileage from the 
first class alone already had exceeded Tahiti's circumference. Oh, well. Back 
to France. 
</P>
<P>
 I said au revoir and transferred to Spanish. Our teacher (or pedalgogue, if 
you will) had lived in Mexico for five years and was working at a Portland 
preschool when she landed this job. She said it was the oddest way of teaching 
Spanish she'd ever seen, but she liked the method. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always taught with games and a lot of moving around," she said. In this 
class, of course, it's only our feet that are moving around. But because we're 
constantly clutching the handlebars, we can't refer to notes or dictionaries. 
The teacher gets our rapt attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She teaches us snippets of Spanish conversation and we practice among 
ourselves, turning to speak to neighboring cyclists. Among the questions 
already in our repertoire: "Where are you going?" . . . puff, puff, puff . . . 
"Do you like to bicycle?" 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the hour, I know it's been a good class if my shirt is sopping 
wet. I wipe my brow and slip off the saddle. I do stretches for my quads, 
calves and hamstrings. Someday I'll be able to say those words in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Already we've learned a children's song about touching our head, neck and 
shoulders, but we didn't dare do the hand movements for fear of falling off our 
bikes. It was hard enough adjusting the rhythm of the song to the rhythm of our 
pedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's raring to go before the next class begins. 
</P>
<P>
 We're doing warm-ups and stretches while greeting each other in Spanish: 
"Hola!" But our teacher is a few minutes late. She rushes in, apologetic. She 
lost track of the time, she says. She was at home, riding her Exercycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's doing it. Muy bien! PHYSICAL FITNESS

 Crossword puzzles do it for me. The harder the better. These are tough 
problems I can solve.Life's day-to-day problems are a lot harder. 
Unfortunately, I'm usually part of the problem myself. But when I zip through a 
five-star 21x21 in record time, it gives me the illusion that I can lick 'em 
all. It feels good to solve a problem that I'm not a part of. Too bad I'm the 
only one who knows how clever I really am.

BOOKS AND AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY; POETS PAINT DIFFERENT PORTRAITS OF HUMAN 
CONNECTEDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Orange County poets Lee Mallory and Julian Palley are making the 
rounds of poetry readings and bookstores to promote their recently published 
new collections, in which they both return to familiar themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Mallory what the title of his new book, "Full Moon, Empty Hands," means, 
and the poet in Mallory kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk out on a beautiful night," he says, "and there's a full moon, and 
there's a warm wind stirring on your flanks, and the sound of soft music is 
rippling on the air, and you have no one . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His evocative word picture lingers only as long as a stolen kiss. Then the 
teacher in Mallory takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words," he says, "the idyllic scene is set for romance, but the real 
world intrudes. It's what I've said for years and years: We're coming up 
empty-handed because we're losing our connectedness as human beings, and that's 
also true between the sexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory says none of the 51 poems in "Full Moon, Empty Hands" (Lightning 
Publications, Fullerton; $12.95) embodies the title, "but there are plenty of 
poems of sorrow and losses, which are the 'empty hands,' and there are plenty 
of poems that equate to the 'full moon,' the positive side" of relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory, who teaches poetry at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, says his 
book is roughly divided into thirds: new poems, poems that have been previously 
published but never gathered into a collection, and reader-favorites from his 
1990 book, now out of print, "I Write Your Name." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than half of the poems in "Full Moon, Empty Hands," his fifth book of 
poetry, deal with love. Indeed, Mallory isn't called "the Love Poet" for 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's kind of schlocky," he says of the "Love Poet" designation. "It 
sounds like the name of a disk jockey on one of those call-in radio shows. But 
in a way, as I look at my work, it's probably pretty factual, because I'm 
fascinated with the interplay between the sexes more than just in a visceral, 
sensual way." 
</P>
<P>
 As a poet, Mallory is known for not only understanding "the depth of the 
feminine mystery" -- as poet Lisa Rafel has put it -- but for understanding 
both sides of the male/female equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strongest people in my life have always been female, so it's not 
accidental that my writing seeks to bring them onto my plane or that I use 
writing to reach out to that other side," Mallory says. "I agonize over the 
fact that as a writer and as a poet I can never fully understand the female 
side, her reality. Man, for example, will never understand the mystery of 
childbirth, and the male writer who tries to be the master of all experience 
feels that gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory, a 30-year resident of Newport Beach, will be the featured reader at 
the Factory Readings gathering at 8 p.m. Monday in a new venue, Koo's Arts 
Cafe, 1505 N. Main St., Santa Ana. He'll also sign copies of his book, which is 
available at Barnes & Noble in Costa Mesa, Brentano's in South Coast Plaza, 
Costa Mesa, and Barnes & Noble in MainPlace/Santa Ana. 
</P>

<P>
 Palley says "Family Portraits" (The Inevitable Press, Laguna Beach; $10) is 
more introspective than his three previous collections. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1987 book, "Bestiary," for example, "is largely visual," he says. "Here, I 
think there's a different tone, perhaps you could call it more mature or 
reflective." 
</P>
<P>
 The poems in the new book mirror how he was feeling during the time he wrote 
them -- 1989 to 1993 -- but, he says, "it also is a product of experience, of 
writing and living." 
</P>
<P>
 Palley, who recently retired from the Spanish department at UC Irvine, where 
he taught Spanish literature and comparative literature for 27 years, says the 
family portrait on the book's cover shows his mother in 1909 at the age of 13 
with her two younger sisters, and his poem "Anne Palley, with Sisters, 1909" is 
"kind of a meditation on that photo and my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a couple of the poems in the book, however, deal directly with his 
family. The title poem is his reflection on family portraits, those graying 
pictures of bygone relatives who, as he writes, whisper from walls and mantels 
to their progeny that "we also loved & suffered as you do now. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Palley, in fact, views the title "Family Portraits" in a much broader sense. 
As the book's dedication indicates, he says, "I consider all animals and people 
to be part of one family, one human and animal family." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the book includes poems about vultures, suburban coyotes, a red-tail 
hawk. Animals are a recurring subject in his poems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think living in Orange County since 1966 has really influenced my poetry, 
and much of it is inspired by the nature of this area," he says, noting that 
his book, "Bestiary," is mostly about birds found in Irvine and along the 
coast. And, he says, "in my third book, 'Pictures at an Exhibition,' there are 
a great many poems that relate to the bird life and animal life of Orange 
County, so I sort of discovered nature here in a meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
 Palley's poetry is perhaps best summed up by Jack Foley, editor of Poetry/USA, 
an Oakland-based poetry journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Writes Foley, referring to an earlier Palley poem about an owl: "Often as you 
look, it looks: 'The intensity of his gaze/went down to my shoes.' " The poems, 
Foley continues, "seem poised between mind and other, arriving at insight by 
means of the interplay between the two: 'Living/things spoke to me as never 
before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Palley: "That's very pertinent about nearly all of my poetry. When I 
write about a person or thing it's always two-way: The thing observed always 
looks back at me and speaks in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other poems in the collection grew out of Palley's travels to 
southern India, Italy and Mexico. "I have a long love affair with Mexico," he 
says. "Massacre of the Innocents" is about the massacre of students in Mexico 
City in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Palley, an Irvine resident who has lived in Orange County since 1966, has been 
writing poetry since high school.  
</P>
<P>
 Why he writes it is, he says, "a very complicated question." 
</P>
<P>
 It's partly a matter of having an experience that he would like to remember or 
to communicate to others, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "But writing poems is also a process of self-discovery," he says. "You 
discover who you are and what you can do and insights about the subject in the 
process of writing, so that, more than an attempt at communication, it's an 
attempt at self-discovery. And as you may know, poems usually write themselves. 
The poet just helps them along."  
</P>
<P>
 With a laugh, he adds: "at least that's my experience, and it's the experience 
of a lot of other poets." 
</P>
<P>
 Palley, along with poet Maurya Simon, will read from "Family Portraits" at 4 
p.m. Saturday at the Real Bookstore, 17350 E. 17th St., Tustin. His book is 
available at the UCI bookstore, Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach and 
will be available at the Real Bookstore.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; COSTUMED OPERA SUPPORTERS HAVE A BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Powdered wigs, extravagant headdresses, capes and masks add to the elaborate 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 If they sang as good as they looked, those masquerading as their favorite 
opera characters Saturday would all be superstars like Beverly Sills or Luciano 
Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the Halloween season, many of the 450 guests attending Opera 
Pacific's Grand Costume Opera Ball donned powdered wigs, elaborate headdresses, 
capes and masks and played out their favorite opera fantasies in the Grand 
Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Irvine. The $175-per-person gala raised about 
$100,000 in net proceeds for Opera Pacific. Let Them Eat Cake 
</P>
<P>
 "The opera ball is one of those special events that every year has a special 
motif," said Laila Conlin, ball co-chairwoman, dressed like Cinderella in a 
blue gown and sparkling tiara with her own Prince Charming, husband Bill, in a 
white tuxedo at her side. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera buffs, some in $500-a-day rental costumes that they booked months in 
advance and others in costumes they found buried in their closets, mingled 
during a champagne reception and ogled each other's outfits. Marie Antoinette 
proved a popular character; a half-dozen or so Marie look-alikes wandered 
around in brocade gowns with tight bodices and towering pompadour wigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been an extravagant costume ball in Orange County, and people 
who support the opera tend to be extravagant," said Barbara Venezia, event 
co-chairwoman, one of the Antoinettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Jorgenson Johnson, resplendent in a white gown with ostrich feathers and 
matching boa, played Muzette from "La Traviata" (the opera's winter season 
opener Jan. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you practice your opera?" asked Opera Pacific's general director David 
DiChiera. To his surprise, Johnson responded by singing a few notes from the 
piece in a lovely soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 The other cast of characters included Royal Radtke, dressed as Falstaff in a 
blue velvet tunic and passing out gold chocolate coins to passers-by; Meme 
Kasen, who balanced a tall gold headpiece on her head for her stint as a Thai 
dancer from "The King and I," and William Adler as Prince Igor ("actually it's 
a Captain Hook costume, but I left off the hook," Adler said). Garden Party 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Wiggins of Casello and Cherrie Lightburn of the Green Effects helped 
turn the grand ballroom into an enchanted garden, with carved stone benches, 
columns, fountains and greenery. At the center of each table stood birdbaths 
filled with floating candles and gardenias. 
</P>
<P>
 On the dance floor, couples from the Fred Astaire Dance Studio twirled to 
synthesized versions of the Strauss Waltz and Beethoven's Fifth. After the 
performance, the co-chairwomen emerged from Cinderella's coach to welcome 
guests and kick off the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was a gourmet feast -- crab and goat cheese wrapped in filo, filet 
mignon, roasted salmon and, for dessert, chocolate savarin with an almond 
cornucopia filled with brandied cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater, television and recording star Gary Morris then took the stage with 
his guitar and sang selections from "Les Miserables," in which he starred on 
Broadway, and "La Boheme."  
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were Gloria Gellman, president of the guild alliance, George and 
Adrienne Brennan, Elaine Redfield, Matt and Tina Schafnitz, Mark Chapin 
Johnson, Jerry Harrington, Norm and Myril Kreuder, Tita Loza, George Schreyer, 
John Provine, Ed and Helen Shanbrom, Wally and Gerry Schroeder, Ellie Cortese, 
Ralph and Georgene Smith, Gayle Widyolar and David Scott, Lon and Mary Anne 
Wells, McKinley and Ester Malapas and George and Anne Schopick. KATHRYN BOLD

A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF POTENTIAL; IT'S NOT JUST THE RESULTS OF HER CREATIONS 
THAT INTEREST ANGIE BRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angie Bray doesn't cringe if you note that there's something childlike about 
her subtle, investigative art. "If I'm making a piece, it's the potential that 
interests me -- to see what it will do, without imposing something ahead of 
time," she said the other day. "So maybe that's the childlike part." 
</P>
<P>
 We were standing in her studio, a cube of a living room in the sunny Venice 
apartment that serves as an urban refuge from her Laguna Beach home. Random 
snapping noises emanated from several of her untitled motor-powered wood poles. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them twitched against a cello wire stretched across a corner of the 
room. The tip of another pole scrabbled on the ceiling. A third, covered in 
graphite, rubbed against the walls, leaving two lazy arcs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids learn something, they just do it," Bray continued. "Let's say 
everyone is singing a song. A kid doesn't think, 'Oh, I don't know all the 
words to this song. . . .' No, they just -- " Tilting her head up, she 
metamorphosed into a curious child experimentally mouthing the words to a song. 
Gradually, raw sounds became recognizable words. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Slowly, they do it. So I think that's the way to do things. And then you find 
out what happens. My art is . . . all about investigating through doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pieces in the studio are destined for a one-woman show opening 
Saturday at critically well-regarded Sue Spaid Fine Art in Los Angeles -- a 
first for Bray, whose work has been in various group exhibitions over the 
years, at the Laguna Art Museum, Saddleback College Art Gallery, BC Space in 
Laguna Beach, Cirrus Gallery in Los Angeles and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging as an artist years after a bi-coastal career as an educator, Bray 
prefers not to be typecast by age ("You can say I'm a well-preserved 85," she 
jokes, exaggerating wildly). But she readily admits that she is not one to 
hustle. "I figured my job was to make work that maybe was going to turn out to 
be good," she said. "Also, I'm lazy. I would rather play in my studio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her work utilizes ordinary objects and materials: feathers, paper, slender 
sticks of bass wood, small stones, eggshells and thin sheets of lead. Subject 
to the vagaries of air currents and subtle shifts in lighting, these works 
exist in a highly provisional realm that is just this side of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Five wispy lengths of wood lightly pinned to the wall are liable to shift 
suddenly, like errant Pick-Up-Stix. Faint graphite particles blown onto sheets 
of translucent film trace the ebbing of a human breath.Nestled in skinny boxes 
hung on the wall, long, narrow sheets of paper contain the sooty traces of 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is interesting about the smoke (pieces)," Bray said, "is how hard it is 
to control them. There's the wind coming in, the height of the candle flame. . 
. . But it's also more fun than if you just learn to draw (smoke). Because I'm 
dealing with the real thing. You need to control it to a certain point . . . 
but it will do things all by itself that no one would ever associate with it." 
</P>
<P>
 As we spoke, one of the motor-powered pieces got stuck on a bump on the 
ceiling. "It's trying very hard to get out," Bray remarked, in her 
anthropomorphizing way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only interested in the wispy things in a (particular) space," she said. 
"Everything I make, whether I want to or not, is for the place where it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tricky thing is, can you make some wispy thing and have someone see it? 
You never know (if a piece is working) until the other person says, 'I saw it' 
or 'I didn't.' . . . I don't think it's fair to be hermetic. Because you put 
something in public and it has to speak a language." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman blessed with delicate features and a diminutive physique, Bray always 
has worked small. Once another artist told her she must be "afraid" of mass in 
her work. "I thought, well, maybe I am. I ought to do something about it. So 
for a month I did these things called 'Chunky Experiments.' " She laughed. 
"Then I thought, I'm not afraid of mass; I'm just not interested." 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time she was puzzled about the origin of the aesthetic sensibility 
some have seen as specifically "Japanese." (In fact, she has never visited 
Japan.) It was only when her mother sent her a picture of the pasture at her 
family's Pennsylvania country house in winter that Bray realized the true 
source of her vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with this (quality of) almost disappearing. There's snow on the 
ground, but not completely covering everything and there are these sticks of 
dried grasses and stuff, and the trees that are all bare. There's an electric 
wire fence with torn pieces of cloth, so people will see the wire. It's very, 
very subtle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her studio, ordinary white feathers mounted on a skinny pole slowly revolve 
on a small base that wobbles slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said, 'Why doesn't it go faster?' But I don't want it to go faster. 
It's that quarter-inch that makes all the difference. There's no leeway in what 
I do. I can't get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 A long, stringlike piece of lead that oozes mysteriously across the floor from 
a low point on the wall is the product of a weirdly convincing strain of 
Bray-logic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally," she explained, "the piece was (as long as) the width of the 
room. I pounded it out to the length of the room. Although one thing is not a 
substitute for another, we talk as if it were -- as if length times width were 
(literally) the area of a plane. But would anyone talk about this (piece) as 
the area of the room?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite such conceptual underpinning, Bray is adamant that her art "can't 
just be a one-liner. An idea means nothing if you don't want to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid says she was attracted to Bray's work because "each piece is rooted in a 
certain quest, an investigation of a particular idea. But it's not a one-liner 
because it's rooted in a value system, a completely fatalistic belief that 
everything happens for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has an immense amount of trust in the future and in her personal history. 
That kind of trust allows her to find the meaning in everything. . . . There's 
no sense of regret in her work. It is only about rejuvenation, taking from the 
past and building on it. . . . Some of her simplest pieces are the most 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging from Bray's studio ceiling, a pile of small, curling pieces of lead 
painted with the images of feathers evokes the old joke about which weighs 
more, a pound of feathers or a pound of lead. The notion of lead painted to 
resemble feathers is itself an absurdity, evoking the futility of any form of 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lead piece consists of a small pile of lead stars. Their perfect 
five-pointed shapes evoke the childhood ideal of the tinfoil cutout atop the 
Christmas tree. But the attributes of these stars are all wrong; they're dull, 
fallen, clumped together. They are at once as starlike and as un-starlike as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 On a private level, the stars evoke a deeply painful event, the suicide last 
winter of Bray's son Daniel, who had been a member of the experimental Blue Man 
theater troupe in New York. "For me," she said simply, "it was like the stars 
fell out of the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might have thought the tragedy would change the direction of Bray's work, 
but the impact was extremely subtle. In her art, even agonizing personal 
suffering becomes part of a world in which every experience yields a sense of 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Bray received critical praise for her solo in "Zone," a group 
piece by her close friend, performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, which premiered 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'Oh, wasn't it nice to have that escape,' " Bray said, her voice 
uncharacteristically tense with irritation. "But what was the piece I did? It 
was about the death of a horse! . . . When I was a child, this horse was killed 
and I watched. My whole point was: So, something is terrible. So keep your eyes 
open." 
</P>

Lyon's work is no less important to the Vikings. Case in point: Crouch had a 
career-high 41 kills in a five-game victory Thursday over then-fourth ranked 
Huntington Beach, but Marina Coach Jason Bilbruck was raving about Lyon's 81 
assists and 15 digs."Jessica runs down every ball for us," Bilbruck said. "She 
basically kept us in the last two matches because when our passing gets bad, 
she gets to every ball." Lyon also had 37 assists and 10 digs in the Vikings' 
four-game victory Tuesday over Fountain Valley.

NOTEBOOK; MATER DEI GIRLS' TENNIS FIGHTING FOR PLAYOFF SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a big year for the Mater Dei girls' tennis team. The 
Monarchs had one of the county's top players in Laura Ruben and were ranked 
fourth in The Times' preseason poll. But heading into the regular season's 
final week, the Monarchs are fighting for a playoff spot, instead of fighting 
for a high seeding in next week's Southern Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (9-9, 5-4) probably must defeat Capistrano Valley today to qualify 
for the playoffs as the South Coast League's third-place team. But the Monarchs 
will play today without Ruben, who has missed the last month because of 
arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been tough, but the girls have played the best they could have," Mater 
Dei Coach Sue Harrison said. "We've just really had a tough season. We've 
played six or seven of the top teams. We had high expectations, but we lost 
some close matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Ruben's injury, Mater Dei lost to second-ranked Los Alamitos and 
fourth-ranked Woodbridge, 10-8. After the injury, the Monarchs were beaten 
twice by unranked San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben saw the doctor Monday, and her availability for the remainder of the 
season is uncertain. If she doesn't play in the South Coast League prelims 
Thursday, she would not be eligible to play in the Southern Section individual 
tournament. 
</P>

 Water polo showdowns: Three league titles will be decided by games Wednesday 
between undefeated teams. In the Century League, third-ranked Foothill will 
play host to No. 6 Villa Park at 4 p.m. In the Sunset League, Marina and No. 5 
Esperanza play at 6 p.m. at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Freeway League, La Habra will be at Buena Park for a 4 p.m. game to 
decide the league title. It will be the first time since 1969 that Sunny Hills 
will not win the league championship. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The final week of the girls' volleyball regular season begins tonight with 
some league championships on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Sunny Hills (14-0, 8-0) plays host to No. 8 La Habra (11-1, 7-1) 
with the Freeway title at stake tonight. Los Amigos plays Thursday at Pacifica 
in a match that should determine the Garden Grove League champ.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PICO PRODUCTS REPORTS PROFIT INCREASE OF 35% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pico Products Inc., a Lakeview Terrace maker of cable television parts, said 
its profit for the fourth fiscal quarter that ended July 31 was up 35% to 
$221,250 from $164,480 the previous year. The gain was on a 9% increase in 
revenue to $7.2 million from $6.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the full fiscal year, the company reported a record profit of $905,015 
versus a loss of $276,648 last year. The surge was on revenues of $29.9 
million, up 26% from $23.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Moerbeek, Pico's chief financial officer, attributed the year's results 
to strong sales overseas, particularly in South America, where demand for cable 
television services is growing. Pico provides amplifiers, electronics and other 
parts needed to hook up cable television systems to hotels and apartment 
buildings. Wiring individual buildings for cable -- as opposed to entire cities 
-- is becoming common outside the United States, Moerbeek said.

INDUSTRY SHIVERS AT BAN ON CFC REFRIGERANTS; ENVIRONMENT: AN END TO PRODUCTION 
OF THE OZONE-ERODING CHEMICALS NEXT YEAR IS FORCING A COSTLY TRANSFORMATION ON 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As governments around the world intensify their war on chemicals that weaken 
the Earth's vital ozone layer, people like Ron Ford are becoming part of the 
collateral damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford owns an automotive air-conditioning business in Granada Hills that 
depends on Freon, an ozone-eroding gas widely used as a refrigerant. With the 
federal government poised to ban production of Freon next year, its price has 
skyrocketed -- and that is costing Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers can't afford it," he said. "Business is way off. And the average 
customer gets upset at us first, not the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is hardly alone in his complaints. Around the nation, the drive to flush 
Freon and other ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons out of American cars, 
homes and factories is forcing a costly, and historic, transformation on 
consumers and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With CFC prices soaring and government imposing new regulations, consumers 
face higher costs to service their cars and home air conditioners. Reports of 
CFC smuggling have surfaced. And some industries are converting to a CFC 
alternative that does no harm to the ozone layer but is a potent contributor to 
global warming.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a small but vocal band of "anti-environmentalists" has launched a 
counteroffensive in Op-Ed pages and magazine columns, arguing that the adverse 
impact of CFCs has been overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects of all this hubbub were once viewed as among the most useful and 
versatile compounds ever made. CFCs were found in thousands of consumer 
products and industrial processes, from aerosol sprays to sterilizing agents 
for medical instruments. They were best-known to consumers as coolants in air 
conditioners and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1980s, CFCs had become widely viewed as environmental villains 
as more and more scientists concluded that the chemicals were behind an 
alarming thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts worried that a weakened ozone shield would allow more dangerous 
ultraviolet radiation to seep through to the Earth's surface, setting the stage 
for devastating increases in skin cancer and blindness, crop failures and 
disruptions of the marine food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ozone loss over Antarctica has been spectacular," F. Sherwood Rowland, a 
UC Irvine chemistry professor, said recently. Rowland co-wrote the landmark 
1974 study theorizing that CFCs were the culprits behind ozone depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want that to happen in the Northern Hemisphere. To avoid anything 
like that happening, we have to have a total ban on chlorofluorocarbons." 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinary show of international cooperation, more than 20 nations in 
1987 signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, 
which sets deadlines for stopping production of CFCs and similar chemicals. 
More than 130 nations have now signed the accord. In the United States, CFC 
production must stop by Dec. 31, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by the Montreal treaty and the coming federal ban, U.S. industry is 
retooling on a large scale. And there have been some striking successes as 
businesses scramble to rid themselves of CFCs and convert to less 
environmentally damaging substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Makers of foam boxes for hamburgers and other fast foods now use materials 
with no ozone-ruining agents. Electronics firms and other high-tech 
manufacturers eliminated CFC-based solvents, switching to cleaning processes 
that rely on water or citrus compounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne, the Canoga Park-based aerospace and defense contractor that 
formerly used CFCs to wash metal parts, now employs a water-vibration technique 
used for years in ultrasonic denture cleaners. Some manufacturers say they have 
actually saved money by dumping CFCs, which require more steps in the cleaning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 As industry has begun to wean itself from the chemicals, domestic CFC 
production has plummeted. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, about 126,000 tons of CFCs were manufactured last year, a 62% drop from 
1986. Nonetheless, ridding American industry of CFCs remains a monumental task, 
especially in the air-conditioning and refrigeration sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 CFCs still are used in more than 140 million vehicle air conditioners, 160 
million home refrigerators, 5 million commercial refrigerators and 80,000 
air-conditioning systems in skyscrapers and other large buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For owners of that machinery, the impending CFC production ban leaves three 
painful choices: replace the equipment, retrofit to run on CFC alternatives or 
stick with CFCs and face tightening supplies and rising prices. (Although 
manufacturing CFCs will be outlawed, it will remain legal to use them in air 
conditioners and other products.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has estimated the cost of cleansing the United States of CFCs through 
the year 2075 at $45 billion. But that expense will be offset many times, the 
agency said, by the $32 trillion in savings in the form of reduced rates of 
skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the costs of industrial conversion have been largely absorbed by 
business. But with the federal ban on retail products such as Freon less than 
18 months away, price jumps and the specter of shortages are beginning to hit 
home with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where it's coming down to the pocketbook. And that's what people 
haven't had to deal with before," said Catherine L. Andriadis, spokeswoman for 
Du Pont Co., one of the world's largest CFC producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Montreal Protocol, Freon prices have zoomed. Six years ago, the 
compound sold for less than $1 a pound. But with the impending phaseout and 
talk of shortages, its price has leaped to $20 a pound or more. The hikes 
include a $4.35-per-pound federal excise tax intended to discourage 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid price increases have sparked reports of CFCs being smuggled into the 
United States from China, Russia and other countries. Also, new batches of CFCs 
manufactured abroad reportedly are being contaminated so they look recycled, 
thus avoiding federal import quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any direct evidence . . . but our sense is that (smuggled and 
illegally imported CFCs represent) a fairly significant amount that may add up 
to millions or hundreds of thousands of pounds," said James Harris, a spokesman 
for Allied-Signal Inc., a large CFC manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have customers who get offers from importers for truckloads of this 
material," he said. The EPA, Customs Service and Internal Revenue Service are 
investigating reports of CFC smuggling, an EPA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating possible shortages, many car makers and other firms are 
stockpiling large amounts of CFCs. In an effort to head off supply problems, 
the Clinton Administration last year persuaded Du Pont to keep making CFCs 
through 1995, even though the firm had planned to halt production at the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. consumers are most likely to feel rising refrigerant prices when they get 
their car or home air conditioners serviced. While most new cars use a CFC 
substitute, 90 million autos with CFC-filled air conditioners will remain on 
American roads after the production ban takes effect, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who owns Acme Auto Air Conditioning of the West Inc., in Granada Hills, 
said that with recent Freon price increases, he is charging more than $100 to 
refill older air-conditioning units -- a service that not long ago cost $40. If 
CFC prices climb higher, his rates will have to follow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Older cars can be retrofitted to accept CFC alternatives, but doing so costs 
up to $800, according to the EPA. Car makers have not yet issued retrofit 
guidelines for most models, and many service technicians recommend against it, 
saying older-model air conditioners work better with Freon. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation may be even more unsettled among owners of high-rises and other 
big buildings with air-conditioning systems that often require several thousand 
pounds of CFCs. So far, owners of only about 25% of the country's 80,000 large 
air conditioners have converted or replaced them, said Ed Dooley, spokesman for 
the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials said property owners have reacted sluggishly because they 
think the EPA will back down on the ban at the last minute or that a "drop-in" 
replacement for CFC refrigerants will be invented, eliminating the need to 
convert or replace equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residential air conditioners run on HCFC-22, a compound that is not as 
damaging to the ozone layer as CFCs but that is scheduled to be banned in 2010. 
Although supplies of that coolant remain adequate, costs of servicing home 
units are rising, driven by federal rules that require repair technicians to 
recycle HCFC-22 rather than vent it into the open air. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass along the costs of expensive gas-recovery equipment, many service 
technicians have tacked recycling fees on to their regular maintenance charges. 
In Los Angeles, such fees often range from $95 to $175.  
</P>
<P>
 Many air-conditioning business owners said that despite the prospect of heavy 
federal fines for illegal venting of ozone-wrecking gases, fly-by-night repair 
workers routinely do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't afford to buy that (recycling) equipment, nor do they," said 
Marvin Hendler, president of Air Comfort of California, a small Van Nuys home 
air-conditioning firm that has shelled out $40,000 for recycling machines. 
"They get on top of the building and they cut the lines and all the (gases) go 
into the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the federal ban on CFCs and strict requirements for recycling, 
significant leakage of ozone-damaging chemicals will continue, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still going to be leaks from different sectors, just because of the 
nature of the equipment," said Steve Seidel, acting director of the EPA's 
stratospheric protection division. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, environmentalists complain that U.S. industry, by switching so 
quickly to a leading CFC substitute known as HFC-134a, is trading one serious 
environmental problem for another. 
</P>
<P>
 HFC-134a does not erode the ozone layer, and manufacturers of autos and air 
conditioners have rushed to redesign their systems to accept it. Most 1994 car 
models contain air conditioners that use HFC-134a. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists said HFC-134a is a potent contributor to the "greenhouse 
effect," a gradual increase in Earth's temperature caused when solar heat is 
trapped by atmospheric gases. Some scientists believe higher temperatures could 
result in catastrophic rises in sea levels, altered rain patterns and other 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Rosas, who directs an ozone-protection campaign for the environmental 
group Greenpeace, said HFC-134a "is 3,200 times more potent than carbon dioxide 
as a greenhouse gas." Du Pont's Andriadis disputes that, saying new data shows 
that HFC-134a is only 1,200 times as potent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical makers say that given the urgency of the situation, HFC-134a is an 
acceptable temporary substitute for CFCs despite its adverse side effects -- a 
view shared by some environmentalists. Although the chemical industry says it 
has spent tens of millions of research dollars, it has yet to come up with a 
"silver bullet" substitute that would require no retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 While environmentalists and manufacturers debate HFC-134a technology, critics 
argue that the threat to the ozone layer is largely a myth created by shaky 
science and environmentalist hysteria -- and that the ban is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent article in Business Week, one such activist said measurements show 
that less, not more, ultraviolet radiation is reaching the Earth and that in 
any event, malignant melanoma is caused by a type of UV radiation that is not 
blocked by ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the true story turns out to be eventually, propaganda has prevailed 
over scientific fact up until now, and a government policy that is going to 
impose undue hardship on us all has run far in advance of the evidence," wrote 
Paul Craig Roberts, chairman of the Institute for Political Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidel and others dismiss such critics, saying there is little question that 
ozone levels have dropped and the CFC ban is necessary. An international panel 
of 150 atmospheric scientists recently reaffirmed the need for a ban, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of actions taken under the Montreal Protocol, the worst fears of 
millions and millions of skin cancers are never going to be realized," he said. 
"Ozone depletion would be higher if there'd been no action." 
</P>
<P>
 But the economic disruptions caused by laws aimed at controlling CFCs are 
likely to give critics a platform as the government struggles to enforce the 
phaseout. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really in the process of conversion, and conversion is going to 
cost a lot of money," said Rowland, the UC Irvine professor. "Most of these 
people aren't necessarily all that enthralled with science anyway." How the Ban 
on CFCs Affects Consumers 
</P>
<P>
 VEHICLE AIR CONDITIONERS: 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a car or truck made before last year, odds are that its 
air-conditioning system runs on a CFC refrigerant. 
</P>
<P>
 That means you will be paying more to refill the coolant, which can leak out. 
Although it will still be legal to use CFCs after the 1996 ban on production, 
their cost is likely to rise steeply as supplies dwindle. While many Los 
Angeles-area garages charged $30 to $40 to refill an older air conditioner 
three or four years ago, some now charge $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get CFCs out of your system now, you can retrofit your unit to 
run on a non-CFC substitute (a common one is HFC-134a). But such conversions 
cost between $100 and $800, according to the EPA (although many mechanics say 
the government figures are too high). 
</P>
<P>
 Many service technicians do not recommend retrofits, saying modified systems 
do not work as well as the original CFC-cooled systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is new," said Sam Adler, owner of A & P Automotive in Van 
Nuys. "Nobody knows how the 134 is going to work with the new components." 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a 1994 model car or truck, you don't have to worry about CFCs. 
Virtually all new vehicles contain substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME AIR CONDITIONERS: 
</P>
<P>
 If your home has an air-conditioning unit, you will be paying more to have it 
serviced -- but not because of CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residential air conditioners use the refrigerant HCFC-22, a compound that 
can damage the ozone layer but not nearly as badly as CFCs are believed to. 
Nonetheless, HCFC-22 is considered enough of an environmental threat that its 
production will be halted in stages, with a complete phaseout by 2030. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are your servicing costs higher? Since 1992, the EPA has required 
repair workers to recycle HCFC-22 gas whenever home units are disassembled. 
Many service firms pass along the cost of recycling machinery by charging 
customers a recycling fee, which may range from $95 to $175, in addition to 
regular maintenance charges. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also have to shell out more for the HCFC-22 refrigerant. A pound now 
costs from $8 to $15, up from about $6 or less a few years ago. The price rise 
is mostly driven by a federal storage tax designed to discourage use of the 
compound. Home air-conditioning units typically require about eight pounds.

PUTTING A NEW SPIN ON MACHINERY OF FUTURE; AGOURA HILLS: START-UP FIRM AVCON 
INC. IS SEEKING BIG MARKETS, INCLUDING AERONAUTICS, FOR ITS ENERGY-EFFICIENT, 
GREASE-FREE MAGNETIC BEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grease is found in everything from typewriters to turbo pumps. It's the magic 
ingredient that has allowed shafts to turn and pistons to clank since the dawn 
of machines. But its monopoly is now being challenged by a small number of 
companies, including a start-up firm called Avcon Inc. in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Avcon makes what the industry calls magnetic bearings. These use magnetism 
instead of lubricants to prevent friction between machine parts, literally 
allowing moving parts to float in magnetic fields. The bearings let a 
crankshaft spin free of friction, dirt or wear. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices seem to defy common sense. Avcon has trouble explaining them to 
customers -- let alone selling them -- and so hands out models of magnetized 
spinning parts at trade conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 But enthusiasts say the potential of these magnetic parts is vast because 
lubricated bearings often fail in extreme temperatures, require costly 
maintenance, or cause fires. In theory, magnetic bearings could solve key 
mechanical problems in devices for the aerospace, power, chemical, textile and 
medical industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Avcon has patented what it contends is smaller, cheaper and more 
energy-efficient magnetic bearings. At the firm's headquarters, a model 
crankshaft appears strangely dry as it spins between the bearings. You have to 
look closely to see that the shaft is suspended a fraction of an inch from the 
metal encasing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most magnetic bearings rely on electromagnetism and require complex electronic 
components, said Avcon president and founder Crawford Meeks, 63, a former chief 
scientist for Hughes Aircraft Co. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Avcon's system uses a combination of electromagnetism and 
permanent magnets, which simplifies them and cuts costs. Also, to save power, 
Avcon bearings direct electric current through a single pole rather than two 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, white-haired Meeks started Avcon in his garage in 1988. So far, the 
firm has produced only prototypes of magnetic bearings. In 1993, the company 
earned a mere $72,000 on revenue of $1.3 million. Avcon failed to raise $8 
million in a public stock offering last June because its underwriter, Reynders, 
Gray Co. Inc. of New York, said it was an unfavorable stock market, Avcon said. 
Meeks said Avcon is in the process of raising about $4 million in a private 
placement instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One investor who is excited about Avcon is Allied-Signal Inc., the 
$12-billion-per-year aerospace components giant, which bought rights to some 
Avcon technology last year and owns 15% of the company. Avcon's magnetic 
bearings could potentially shrink weight, boost power, and reduce maintenance 
of airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are right at the doorstep of an engine revolution," said Fred Klaass, an 
engine specialist for an Allied-Signal unit in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Avcon has landed a contract to produce $250,000 worth of small bearings for an 
undisclosed customer who will use them to manufacture laser equipment. And 
final negotiations for another production contract for power plant equipment, 
worth a potential $3 million, are under way, Meeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Avcon is still a company in the nascent stage. Its current revenues stem 
from a number of research and development contracts. Among the first was a 
$350,000 contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA 
successfully ran tests of a prototype Avcon bearing designed for liquid 
hydrogen-fuel pumps on the space shuttle, said NASA engineer Eliseo DiRusso. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama has since followed up with a 
$500,000 contract with Avcon. And the U.S. Air Force is finishing a three-year, 
$839,582 contract to test various Avcon bearing systems for aircraft. Other 
major contracts include a prototype magnetic bearing in a large oil-field pump 
for Arabian-American Oil Co. (ARAMCO). 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic bearings have been around since the late '60s, but have become more 
practical recently due to advances in electronics. Magnetic bearings "used to 
be viewed as a black box -- they were kind of magical. The initial vendors 
enjoyed that mystique," said David Weise of bearings maker Waukesha Bearings 
Corp. of Waukesha, Wis. Now, Weise said, the industry must demystify the 
bearings and "make them a product everyone can understand." 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear exactly how large the current magnetic bearings business is, but 
the semiconductor and petrochemical industries are thought to be its largest 
customers.  
</P>
<P>
 The acknowledged industry leader is Magnetic Bearings Inc. of Roanoke, Va., 
which has produced magnetic bearings, especially large and expensive ones for 
natural gas pipelines, since the early '80s. Each petrochemical installation 
costs $250,000 or more and MBI claims to have made hundreds of installations, 
said Paul Allaire, a magnetic bearings expert at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Small magnetic bearings are marketed to the semiconductor industry, which 
requires ultra-clean, greaseless machinery. About 3,000 magnetic bearings worth 
$60 million are produced for this industry each year, Allaire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Avcon produces light, energy-efficient bearings designed for 
aerospace, Meeks said the company is also trying to apply its technology to 
other markets. The company especially wants a piece of the lucrative petroleum 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic bearings are getting cheaper, and a race to introduce them to new 
markets, including for more commonplace machinery, is under way. "Whoever comes 
up with a good strategic approach to this industry will walk away with the 
lion's share of the market," said Weise of Waukesha Bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Avcon's competitors acknowledge that Meeks has made contributions to the 
field, but they question some details of his approach. For example, H. Ming 
Chen of Mechanical Technology suggested that permanent magnets used in Avcon's 
bearings might become cumbersome if the company starts designing bearings for 
giant industrial machines, such as oil production equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Big bearings require big magnets, and big magnets are "a pain in the neck," 
Chen said. Everything sticks to them, and they are hard to align, he explained. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks acknowledged limits to permanent magnets. Although Avcon's large 
magnetic bearing for ARAMCO's prototype pump will have magnets, the company 
probably will have to abandon them if they try to retrofit larger equipment, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, permanent magnets can become demagnetized at high temperatures, and 
Avcon has had to eliminate them from one prototype bearing designed for an 
aircraft due to heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even without the magnets, Avcon's systems still have considerable 
advantages, especially flying machines where lightweight and energy-efficient 
equipment is at a premium, Meeks contended.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an easy sell. The costs are large, and the payoffs are not always 
obvious," Meeks said. But in the long run, he added, lighter, cheaper magnetic 
bearings will proliferate, with considerable rewards: more powerful machines, 
drastic cuts in maintenance, and a cleaner environment, to name a few.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HUNTWAY REPORTS DECLINE IN PROFIT FOR 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntway Partners L.P., a Newhall-based producer of liquid asphalt from crude 
oil, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings and revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The 94% decline in profit, to $203,000 in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 from 
$3.35 million a year earlier, came as crude oil processing costs increased and 
prices for Huntway's products fell. Revenue decreased 19%, to $23.9 million 
from $29.5 million, largely due to the closure of its Arizona refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent nine-month period, Huntway narrowed its loss to $1.83 million, 
while its revenue fell 30%, to $56.8 million. In the same period a year before, 
it lost $19.8 million on $80.7 million in revenue.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DOLE'S EARNINGS SLIP ON BANANA OVERSUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dole Food Co. saw its third-quarter earnings tumble 75% as a result of an 
oversupply of bananas and continued weakness in the fresh vegetable market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Village food and real estate concern had net income of $1.29 
million in the quarter that ended Oct. 8, down from its $5.1-million profit a 
year earlier.Its quarterly revenue increased 8%, to $1.08 billion from $1.01 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months of the year, Dole earned $66.7 million, a 32% decline 
from its $98-million profit in the same period of 1993. Its nine-month revenue 
was $2.89 billion, up 10% from $2.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole Chairman and Chief Executive David Murdock said the company is evaluating 
its fresh vegetable business, particularly lettuce, because of the weak market 
conditions in North America.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 3D SYSTEMS REPORTS SHARP EARNINGS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 3D Systems Corp., a Valencia producer of computer-based systems that make 
models of engineered parts, said third-quarter earnings were $733,221, a 
significant jump from last year's third-quarter earnings of $270,305. Revenues 
for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, were $11.2 million, up 39% from $8.05 
million in the same period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company reported its earnings grew to $2.07 million 
compared to a net loss of $920,969 the previous year. Sales were $31.08 
million, up 38% from $22.45 million in the first nine months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the results for the nine months to increased sales, 
especially of its newest product, which allows engineers to make plastic models 
of parts they've designed or molds which aid in fashioning prototypes from 
metal.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: WELLPOINT HEALTH REPORTS SLIGHT DIP IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WellPoint Health Networks Inc., the managed health care company spun off by 
Blue Cross of California last year, reported a 2% drop in earnings in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $49.8 million, down from $51 
million in the same three-month period a year earlier.Revenues in the third 
quarter rose 11% to $698 million from $629 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of the year, Woodland Hills-based WellPoint reported 
earnings of $161 million on revenue of $2.07 billion, compared with 
year-earlier profit of $115 million on $1.82 billion in revenue. Financial 
results prior to Feb. 1, 1993, are presented as if WellPoint had been operating 
as a separate, stand-alone entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Blue Cross spun off most of its nonprofit health insurance programs 
into a for-profit subsidiary, WellPoint. Blue Cross retained an 80% ownership 
stake in WellPoint, and state regulators required Blue Cross to submit a plan 
by which it would compensate the public for the tax-exempt status it had 
enjoyed while it built its insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross unveiled the so-called public benefit plan Sept. 15, promising to 
create a new public charity with assets of more than $2 billion to fund health 
programs throughout the state. That plan is being reviewed by state regulators.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LITTON INDUSTRIES DELAYS MOVING HEADQUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Litton Industries Inc. has delayed the move of its headquarters from Beverly 
Hills to Woodland Hills, originally scheduled for this fall, until Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerospace and industrial concern said it put off the move to give it more 
time to renovate the Woodland Hills facility for use as a corporate office.It 
was formerly used for engineering work. The firm also said it would be more 
convenient to time the move to coincide with the end of the company's 
traditional two-week holiday shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 corporate staff employees will move into the Woodland Hills 
building, which was part of the company's Guidance and Control Systems 
division. The engineering group is moving to another part of the complex, which 
has remained partially unused because of layoffs and the consolidation of the 
division's manufacturing operations at a plant in Salt Lake City.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: JANEX INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janex International Inc., a Woodland Hills toy maker formerly named With 
Design In Mind International Inc., continued to recover from past troubles with 
a $1.06-million third-quarter profit on net sales of $6.46 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter that ended Sept. 30 a year earlier, Janex lost $752,135 on 
$200,572 in net sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest nine-month period, Janex earned $1.08 million, in contrast to a 
loss of $1.74 million a year before. Its net sales grew to $11.6 million from 
$474,315. 
</P>
<P>
 Janex's earlier problems included the ouster about two years ago of its two 
top executives, who pleaded guilty to fraud for siphoning more than $1 million 
in company funds. Janex also suffered from an unsuccessful attempt to market 
licensed three-dimensional imaging technology, which it has since abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed its latest quarter's results to sales of products based 
on the popular Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television characters and the "Lion 
King" movie. It also cited improvements in its marketing and distribution 
system.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unilab Corp., the Tarzana-based supplier of laboratory testing services, 
reported net income of $2.09 million in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, 
compared to a year-earlier loss of $476,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the latest quarter totaled $38.3 million, up 20% from $31.8 million 
in the third quarter of 1993.For the first nine months of the year, Unilab 
posted earnings of $4.2 million on sales of $113 million, compared to a 
year-earlier profit of $2.4 million on revenue of $98.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison purposes, Unilab reported its 1993 results as though the 
company's Nov. 10, 1993, restructuring had occurred on Jan. 1 of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Baker, chief executive of Unilab, attributed the improved results to 
growth in the company's San Jose and Sacramento markets. He also said the 
company has boosted sales in Southern California's burgeoning managed health 
care marketplace.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SYNCOR'S PROFITS DROP IN WAKE OF PRICE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth-based pharmacy services network, said 
it lost $1.1 million for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to earnings 
of $3 million in the same period a year earlier. The loss was on a 35% increase 
in revenue to $81.6 million from $60.4 million in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company reported earnings of $1.8 million, an 80% 
decline from $8.8 million earned in the same period last year. Revenues for the 
period were $238.3 million, up 33% from $179.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its results for the nine months were affected by price cuts 
it made earlier this year. The cuts failed to bring about a projected increase 
in sales. Also, a flat market for nuclear medicine services -- Syncor's core 
business -- and pressure to reduce costs in health care have hurt Syncor's 
margins, despite a strategic alliance struck earlier this year with DuPont Co. 
and Merck & Co. that opened new areas of business, the company said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CABLEVISION WILL OFFER INTERACTIVE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you're ready or not, the interactive TV business is coming to Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision, which has 90,000 household subscribers, about 
70,000 of them in the county, expects to offer interactive programming in the 
second quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an arrangement with ACTV Inc., a New York firm, and Prime Ticket Network, 
the cable company will offer sports, educational and entertainment programming 
that allows viewers to choose camera angles, take tests and play cards, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard N. Yelen, Southern California marketing director for Cablevision's 
parent, Western Communications, said he doesn't know how much subscribers will 
be charged for the service. "One of the big benefits will be for advertisers," 
he said. "Viewers will be able to specify what subjects they want to see 
covered in commercials, so the commercials will be more effective than in the 
past."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PLEASANT TRAVEL SERVICE REPORTS SURGE IN HAWAII TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If tourism is any indicator, Ventura County is staging a modest economic 
comeback, while Southern California and the nation as a whole are doing 
considerably better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel executives at the county's hotels and resorts report revenue gains of 
5% to 10% over 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging as that may be for innkeepers, it pales in comparison to what's 
happening at Westlake Village-based Pleasant Travel Service. Pleasant Travel, 
operator of the Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays package tours, said its business to 
the islands is up 40% to 50% over last year, and is twice as strong as it was 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The big upswing means people are in a spending mood both nationwide and in 
Southern California, which is Pleasant Travel's No. 1 market, company spokesman 
Ken Phillips declared. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Ventura County's largest tourist destinations, the Mandalay Beach 
Resort in Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor, said its business is up 6% to 7% 
this year over 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Room occupancy exceeded 90% this summer and is currently running at better 
than 70%, sales director Liz Stuart reported.. "We're well booked with group 
meetings through Thanksgiving," she said. "Things will drop off after that. 
They'll start coming back in about mid-January." 
</P>
<P>
 Business is up 10% this year at Channel Islands Hotel Properties, a group of 
hotels owned by Oxnard-based Martin V. Smith & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's Casa Sirena Marina Resort in Channel Islands Harbor is attracting 
some off-season vacation guests though not at last summer's hectic pace, 
according to marketing director Beverly Bobo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Smith property, the Oxnard Hilton, located in that city's Financial 
Plaza, is benefiting from an influx of travelers doing business with the new 
Oxnard Factory Outlet mall, Bobo added. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupancy is "definitely up" this year at the Ojai Valley Inn & Country Club, 
but marketing director Alison Brainard declined to be specific. She said the 
well-known inn is offering bargain rates on some rooms this winter. Brainard 
also disclosed that the inn's recently named general manager, Peter Henry, left 
in October. He had only held the position since May. The inn's owner, Chicago's 
Henry Crown Co., cited "philosophical management differences" in announcing 
Henry's sudden departure, Brainard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's tourism coordinator Debbie Solomon said overnight stays by tourists 
were up 5.6% last summer over 1993. Tourism contributed $146 million to 
Ventura's economy in the year ended June 30, Solomon added. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have in the past, Oxnard and Ventura will attempt to lure visitors 
during the holiday season with festivals and harbor parades of lighted boats. 
Admittedly, however, winter isn't the best time of year for tourism in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly the case at Pleasant Travel. "The holidays are one of our 
busiest periods," Phillips said. "Already, our bookings are very tight for the 
two to three days before both Christmas and New Year's Day. I'd advise people 
to be flexible if they're planning to go to the islands in December." 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Travel expects to book 225,000 to 240,000 travelers to Hawaii this 
year. The firm has its own airline and owns five hotels in the islands. It also 
has arrangements to book its clients into an additional 100 hotels and resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom that Pleasant is enjoying in Hawaii isn't being duplicated in Mexico, 
where the company launched Pleasant Mexico Holidays early last year. "Our 
business in Mexico has increased some, but people seem to have been upset by 
the political upheavals there, even though the beach resorts where we're active 
haven't been affected."

BANKS, S&LS SHOW SIGNS OF RECESSION RECOVERY; BANKING: AMID RESTRUCTURING, FIVE 
OF EIGHT LARGEST AREA INSTITUTIONS TALLY PROFITS AFTER YEAR-EARLIER LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Banks and savings and loans in the San Fernando Valley area are still nursing 
financial wounds from the recession and the Northridge earthquake, but 
third-quarter results indicate the banking industry has moved out of intensive 
care and into a recovery ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many banks and thrifts have been hit very hard by the recession," said 
Richard S. Cupp, chief executive of Ventura County National Bancorp. "But we're 
all beginning to see the benefits of the plans to correct those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the eight largest institutions in the Valley area posted solid profits 
after year-earlier losses, and two reported year-to-year earnings gains. 
Fidelity Federal Bank has not reported its earnings yet, but the third quarter 
brought major changes to the Glendale-based S&L, which stepped out from under 
the umbrella of its longtime parent, Citadel Holding Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 One improved institution is Glendale Federal Bank. A year ago it was buried 
under a mountain of bad loans and was on the verge of being seized by federal 
regulators. "We were all going to lose our jobs," Stephen J. Trafton, chief 
executive of Glendale Federal, recalled last week in an interview before the 
S&L's annual shareholder meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week the S&L posted its first quarterly profit since December, 1991. 
It reported earnings of $9.37 million in the September quarter (which is 
Glendale's Federal's first fiscal quarter), in contrast to a $19.9-million loss 
reported in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The results followed a year of major restructuring. In September, 1993, 
Glendale Federal averted federal seizure with a $451-million recapitalization, 
and the S&L is now considered "adequately capitalized" by regulators. Then 
Glendale Federal began selling off delinquent loans, troubled properties and 
all of its out-of-state operations, cutting non-performing assets from $1.02 
billion in February, 1993, to $590 million on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Glendale Federal's assets shrank to $16.8 billion on Sept. 30, 
down 6% from a year earlier. But the remaining assets were much healthier, and 
the S&L set aside just $18.8 million in the latest quarter to cover expected 
loan losses, less than half the $42.4 million set aside in the same quarter of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Trafton said Glendale Federal is now looking to build its deposit base through 
acquisitions, but only in California. The thrift has also spent more than $2 
million in launching an aggressive television advertisement campaign that 
ridicules big commercial banks. "Wells Fargo and Bank of America don't want 
their customers in their branches," Trafton said. "We're taking the opposite 
tack, and we're gaining customers every day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Glendale Federal has plenty of work ahead. Loan demand is spotty, 
Trafton said, and non-performing assets are 3.32% of total assets, a figure 
Trafton hopes to get under 2.5% in the coming months. Return on average assets, 
a statistic that measures how well an institution is using its assets to 
generate income, was 0.22% in the latest quarter, far below the 1% that 
industry experts consider to be a strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, the Oxnard-based parent of Ventura County 
National Bank and Frontier Bank, reported a profit of $565,000 for the 
September quarter, after a year-earlier loss of $4.3 million. Meanwhile, total 
assets shrank 26% to $272 million, as the bank continued to unload problem 
loans. For the first nine months of 1994, the bank reported earnings of 
$480,000, compared with a loss of $8.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank did miss a Sept. 30 deadline imposed by federal regulators to raise 
some of its capital ratios, but no sanctions have been imposed because 
regulators recognize that the bank is "making strong and regular progress," 
said the bank's CEO, Richard S. Cupp. To meet regulators' goals, the bank is 
planning a $5-million stock offering for the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan demand remains weak and uneven, Cupp said. Local companies "just doing 
business in the Valley are the slowest to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp., the Chatsworth-based parent of Great Western 
Bank and the nation's second-largest S&L, reported a profit of $57.2 million in 
the September quarter, reversing a $17.5-million loss the previous year. For 
the first nine months of the year, Great Western posted a profit of $163 
million, double the $80.3 million reported a year earlier. Assets totaled $40 
billion on Sept. 30, up 6% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western's non-performing assets totaled $978 million, down 32% from a 
year earlier and at the lowest level since December, 1988. As a result, loan 
loss provisions in the latest quarter were $51.2 million, compared to $232 
million for the third quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, reported 
earnings of $671,000 for the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier. For the 
first nine months of the year, the bank posted a profit of $1.86 million, up 
23% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, assets declined 5% to $280 million on Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has been on a course of recovery since June, 1992, when about 30 new 
employees arrived with new CEO Stephen G. Carpenter to overhaul a then-ailing 
institution. Carpenter and his team shifted the bank's emphasis from real 
estate to commercial lending and weeded out problem loans. Non-performing 
assets have dwindled from a whopping $30 million in June, 1992, to $113,000 on 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks-based parent of TransWorld Bank, posted 
earnings of $764,000 in the September quarter, compared to a loss of $98,000 
for the same three-month period of 1993. For the first nine months of 1994, the 
bank reported earnings of $1.66 million, up 86% from a year earlier. Assets 
totaled $385 million on Sept. 30, up 19% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank attributed the improved earnings to cost controls and improved asset 
quality. The bank set aside $190,000 for anticipated loan losses in the third 
quarter, down from $695,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank, also based in Sherman Oaks, had an equally strong 
quarter, posting a third quarter profit of $576,000, up 21% from a year 
earlier. For the first nine months, the bank's net income of $1.46 million was 
up 6% from the same period in 1993. The bank's assets totaled $277 million on 
Sept. 30, a record level for American Pacific and up 19% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James Degnan, executive vice president at the bank, said deposit growth has 
been fueled by disaster relief money that has poured into the region since the 
Northridge earthquake. But quake damage continues to disrupt many of the bank's 
business customers who still haven't made repairs, Degnan said. As a result, 
non-performing assets totaled $5.44 million on Sept. 30, up 2% from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy Bancorp, the Ventura-based parent of Bank of A. Levy, posted 
third-quarter earnings of $2.21 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of 
$440,000. For the first nine months of the year, Levy reported net income of 
$5.44 million, compared to a loss of $4.72 million a year ago. Assets declined 
10% to $617 million on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy echoed others in attributing earnings gains to improved asset quality. 
Non-performing loans were 4% of the bank's loan portfolio on Sept. 30, down 
from 10% a year earlier. 
</P>

 The 112-year-old bank announced in June that it has agreed to be purchased by

 Fidelity Federal Bank's former parent company, Citadel Holding Corp., lost $67 
million in 1993. That prompted the Office of Thrift Supervision, the federal 
agency that regulates S&Ls, to increase its oversight of Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise capital, Citadel effectively spun off Fidelity Federal by selling to 
a group of investors who pumped $109 million into the institution. As a result, 
Fidelity is now officially adequately capitalized, and Citadel's share of 
Fidelity is down to 16%. Third-Quarter Report From the Region's Largest

COMEDIAN LAROSE MOVES ON AND MAYBE, AT LONG LAST, UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedy clubs aren't the best place to go if you're in the mood for some Zen 
philosophy, but one of Scott LaRose's enduring bits offers some calming 
thoughts for frazzled Angelenos. He occasionally recalls a particularly 
aggravating day in L.A. that was punctuated by a parking ticket. Fuming, LaRose 
encountered a therapist-type who, in Keanu-speak, serenely advised him to deal 
with it; to wit: "Acknowledge -- and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 The advice worked. "I stood there marveling as I watched this little guru 
skatingaway," LaRose recalls in an interview. "I thought about having it 
printed up on T-shirts, but as soon as that happens, I know the kid'll show 
back up, wanting his cut." 
</P>
<P>
 "Acknowledge and move on" has been a credo for LaRose, 32, who has amassed his 
share of just-misses in 10 years as an actor and comic. He was the guy NBC 
wanted to replace David Letterman when Lorne Michaels quixotically held out for 
Conan O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, it's time to move up. After years of guest spots on TV shows and 
lucrative voice-over and commercial work (he's currently in the ubiquitous 
McDonald's series featuring two wisecracking sports fans angling for Super Bowl 
tickets, a campaign so long and pervasive, he jokes, that "My kids' kids will 
go to college" from the residuals), there's a heat building around LaRose. 
</P>
<P>
 He has become so hot that "Entertainment Tonight" profiled him simply on the 
strength of his guest-starring roles, and one studio has -- take a deep breath 
-- expressed interest in spinning off the characters from those McDonald's 
commercials into a series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like, 'What?' That's the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard," LaRose 
says incredulously. "Those two guys could've been anything. It's not like 
someone wrote the two most incredible guys that you've never seen. They're two 
guys who go to the game and talk about hamburgers. They're not even friends 
anymore. In the first spot they were friends, now they're talking about 
hamburgers. It's not like people ask me, 'How'd you get that character?' It's 
not that big a deal -- he's a guy with a hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the call come, even if it's for a TV show based on a commercial , 
LaRose will be ready. Unlike many stand-up comics, he already has the acting 
chops, having studied acting in college and won the Irene Ryan Award at New 
York University. His training has paid off in guest appearances on shows 
ranging from "Northern Exposure" to "Melrose Place" to "Seinfeld" to 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 An avid movie and TV buff, he mimics everything from the Moviephone voice ("If 
you want to press 2, press 4") to the T. Rex stomping about in "Jurassic Park." 
A new routine concerns how computer technology in movies will be able to 
combine Lou Costello and Chewbacca for a sci-fi variation on the old "Who's on 
First?" routine. 
</P>
<P>
 His home, walking distance from the Improv Comedy Club on Melrose, where he 
frequently performs (his other hangout is the Laugh Factory), reflects his love 
for horror and sci-fi movies. It's decorated with toys, movie posters and 
figures, including a life-size Gremlin and Creature From the Black Lagoon. 
(During the Jan. 17 earthquake, LaRose first made sure his wife was safe, then 
went back into his home to rescue his Darth Vader statue.) He has even called 
his upstart production company Monster Productions, for whom he and his wife 
are developing a sitcom about a special-effects wizard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial and TV money has allowed him to buy a whole houseful of ghouls, 
but LaRose is ready for a little fame to accompany the comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Though LaRose figures it's his time, he admits that has not always been the 
case. "Garry Marshall said a great thing to me when I auditioned for the TV 
series 'Nothing in Common,' " he recalls. "He asked my manager to leave the 
room, and I'm thinking, he's gonna offer me the show. He goes, 'Let me tell you 
why I can't give you this show.' I think, 'What?' He says, 'If I give you this 
show, you're young, you're gonna do drugs and you're gonna die.' I didn't know 
how to respond. He says, 'But it was great to meet you, you're very talented 
and I'm sure I'll see you again for something else.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated him then. But I think back and I go, what a great guy. He was so 
right. That series didn't go long, but I probably would've developed that 
certain thing, because I had just got here and you become this, and you get the 
cocky factor. So he might have been right." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his eye focusing keenly on film and TV, LaRose makes the time to hone 
his stand-up act, even though an evening's performance in a comedy club pays 
but a fraction of a day's work on a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing it to get off on those laughs," he says. "To write something that 
day, and get onstage, and get it out, like it's therapy. It's gone and it's 
great. I was on the verge of getting thrown out of school, because I was stuck 
on making people laugh. It is an addiction. And that's why I'm doing it."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: TO LEARN ABOUT TEENS, GO ALONG FOR 'THE RIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Teens talk straight about drugs, crime and killing on the next 'Donahue!' " 
bellowed the talk-show promo, a reminder of one reason why adolescents watch so 
little television compared with most other age groups. Rarely do they recognize 
themselves on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That bad situation would worsen still without ABC's "My So-Called Life," this 
season's TV headquarters for teen Angst . At times tied up in knots by inner 
turmoil, there's no truer teen on TV than the middle-class 15-year-old played 
by Claire Danes on the Thursday night series that, despite its blemishes, 
deserves a better fate than the likely cancellation awaiting it due to low 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a glossier neighborhood, coming-of-age texture flattens to a sheeny 
smoothness on Fox's durable "Beverly Hills, 90210," which still pulls a sizable 
audience despite its narrow, fancy-pants universe of creamy zitlessness. And 
the youthful characters in the struggling "Party of Five" continue to wear 
halos as impenetrable as plexiglass shields in this week's special deployment 
of that new Fox series in the time slot following "Beverly Hills, 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 "Party of Five" is an idealized ZIP code where the Salinger siblings, ages 
toddler to 24, face an uncertain life of orphanhood with a resoluteness worthy 
of a standing ovation. Problems here are sizable but never unmanageable, thanks 
to scripts that apply tenderness and sensitivity in sweeping, whitewashing 
brush strokes. Although likably gentle and thoughtful, "Party of Five" is 
probably closer kin to the planet Pluto than Earth. It's life as you'd like it 
to be, a middle-class fantasy of softened edges where young people face 
hardship -- on Wednesday the raging hormones of 16-year-old Bailey command 
center stage along with a crucial carpentry project by family head Charlie -- 
with wisdom and maturity beyond their years. And where they, and everyone in 
their realm, seem ultimately to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Do yourself a favor tonight, though, and check out the KCET premiere of "The 
Ride," a quite, extraordinary four-part documentary series in which life itself 
often rages alongside youthful libido. 
</P>
<P>
 Although created and nurtured on a $1-million budget by Shauna Garr, a 
30-year-old Los Angeles filmmaker who has worked extensively for MTV, "The 
Ride" is at once about young people and by them. Ages 17 to 19, Garr's six 
"travelers," as they're called, logged 9,000 miles in a van during two months 
in 1993 in their quest to capture -- cinema verite -style -- the tone of a 
cross-section of youth in Denver, a Native American reservation in South 
Dakota, Chicago, Dayton, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Dallas and Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people to like in "The Ride," and people to dislike. There are 
gangbangers, gangbanger wanna-bes and kids working hard to achieve mainstream 
goals. There are blacks, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans. There are gays 
and gay bashers, poverty and racism -- much of it raw and unfiltered, with many 
subjects displaying amazing openness in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garr had the final edit, the youthful filmmakers shot, interviewed 
and did much of the editing for "The Ride." A series about youth for youth? "I 
wanted something not made by adults and not manipulated by adults," Garr says, 
"but real teen videos that adults may not even want to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they will want to, for the age appeal of "The Ride" -- and its insights 
into young minds and their environments -- are transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 With Garr and other adult mentors staying in nearby hotels, the "travelers" 
hung out and often even lived with their young "guides," the names given these 
subjects who were selected from thousands of applicants responding to ads 
placed in schools and other locations across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to do this was to have young people spend time with other young 
people without adults in the room," Garr says. "It's not that people won't talk 
to somebody 40 years old, but you cannot crawl up in a sleeping bag with a 
15-year-old girl if you're 40." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the eight half-hour segments (KCET is airing two per evening) begins 
with Garr handing out assignments reminiscent of "Mission: Impossible" ("Your 
guide in Illinois is Bobby Nelson. Bobby Nelson is 17 years old. . . ."). Each 
segment interweaves two stories that are usually separate, but sometimes 
juxtaposed in ways that make a narrative point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guides" Mac, 19, and Frank, 18, daily confront the mean streets of 
Philadelphia, for example. "My mother died when I was 6," says Mac, who lives 
alone in a basement room. "How did she pass away?" one of the young filmmakers 
asks. "She was shot in the head," Mac replies. "She didn't pass away." 
</P>
<P>
 Absorbed by other matters in a well-to-do section of town, meanwhile, 
relatively pampered 15-year-old Leslie copes with private school, worries that 
she's fat and decides she needs a therapist to discuss things "you cannot talk 
about with your parents."  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for "The Ride," it opens with one of its weakest segments by 
showing the audition tapes of the "travelers," who were selected from some 500 
applicants, and seemingly takes forever to reach its 17-year-old "guides" in 
Denver, one retracing his Native American roots, the other envisioning a career 
in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ride" has narrative gaps in spots -- there are times when you're told 
less than you want to know -- and it has a real clunker down the road in New 
Orleans, when one of the "travelers" becomes a "guide" herself, her camera 
awareness and mugging temporarily throwing the series off track. The more 
mainstream the subjects, the less compelling are the stories. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the young filmmakers will always have Dayton, where they're 
present when a young "guide" who says he is sexually confused gets himself 
picked up by a "John" while miked, an incredible sequence that briefly causes 
the "travelers" to panic. In the same segment, one of the "travelers," who is 
African American, is confronted by a racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always attracted to people on the edge, regardless of their 
social-economic level," Garr says. Intimate and often mesmerizing, "The Ride" 
is a documentary on the edge, which is why, even if you're long past teen-hood 
yourself, you can't stop watching it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Ride" airs 10-11 p.m. today, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on KCET-TV 
Channel 28.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'STARGATE' HAS MGM STARRY-EYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 MGM's "Stargate," a sci-fi picture starring Kurt Russell, James Spader and 
Jaye Davidson, registered a walloping $16.7 million at the box office--taking 
the industry by surprise and bettering the studio's own pre-weekend estimate by 
nearly $5 million. The opening was the best ever for a September or October 
release and MGM's second highest after "Rocky IV," which opened at $19.9 
million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "With mixed reviews and no star with the box-office clout of a (Sylvester) 
Stallone or a (Arnold) Schwarzenegger, we never expected anything this big," 
says Larry Gleason, MGM's president of worldwide distribution. "People may be a 
little weary of the darker, violent material and looking for an old-fashioned 
Saturday matinee popcorn movie. 'Stargate' is playing to everyone--senior 
citizens as well as kids--doing as well in Boise, Idaho, as in Manhattan. Its 
success proves that MGM is off and running, as capable of record-setting 
grosses as any other studio." MGM has had a sluggish release slate prior to 
"Stargate." 
</P>
<P>
 * While such films as "Squanto," "Silent Fall" and "The Road to Wellville" 
turned in disappointing openings, Woody Allen fans continued to turn out for 
his "Bullets Over Broadway," which racked up a $13,933 per-screen average on 36 
screens nationwide. 04,35,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie

SPEECH! SPEECH!; TOASTMASTERS HAS BEEN TEACHING FOLKS SPEAKING SKILLS FOR 70 
YEARS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In meeting rooms across America, secretaries, engineers and executives gather 
regularly for sessions that often begin with a salute to Ralph C. Smedley. 
</P>
<P>
 They are members of Toastmasters International, and they still pay homage to 
Smedley, who founded the organization 70 years ago this fall in the basement of 
the YMCA in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters, started as a self-help group for people jittery about speaking 
in public, now boasts 8,100 chapters (with about 200 in Los Angeles County) 
whose members have for years been meeting weekly to practice making speeches 
and to critique one another's oratorical efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, Toastmasters is finding a new niche: teaching professionals in 
technical fields how to prepare talks and deliver them effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Engineers are notorious for being bad oral communicators," said William 
Womack, a professor of communications at Chapman University in Orange. "I have 
seen some who are great, but they are definitely the exception." 
</P>
<P>
 They're by no means the only ones. But technological experts are often called 
upon to meet with clients and give presentations; if they do badly, the 
employer's image may suffer. To make sure that doesn't happen, some of Southern 
California's biggest corporations sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, among 
them Fluor Daniel Inc., Bergen Brunswig Corp., CalComp Inc., Rockwell 
International Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Having employees become better communicators is also a way to prepare them for 
upper management, said Renee Christensen, an industrial psychologist and 
president of Employee Support Systems Co. in Orange. Even the brightest and 
most capable people, she said, will be unlikely candidates for executive 
positions if they cannot present themselves well. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives are blunt about the problem: "Engineers tend to be very 
introverted," said Bob Johnson, director of contracts at Anaheim-based CalComp, 
a division of defense contractor Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has an aerospace management background, joined Toastmasters in 
1960 because he suffered almost debilitating attacks of "butterflies" before 
every talk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death when I was called upon to speak at project meetings," 
said Johnson, who was a business manager at Hughes Electronics in Fullerton at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year at Toastmasters, he said, he not only overcame his fear but 
polished his skills to the extent that he has since had the confidence to seek 
jobs that require public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety about giving speeches is quite common, said J. Douglas Andrews, 
professor of business communications and assistant dean at the USC School of 
Business Administration. In fact, according to several studies, many people say 
it is the situation they fear most. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to overcome that fear and to become a calm, effective speaker, 
Andrews said, is simply to practice and get feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters strives to help men and women do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings follow a strict schedule. To ensure that speeches end promptly -- 
they are limited to about seven minutes -- a timekeeper is chosen for each 
session to signal speakers who talk too long. 
</P>
<P>
 A member may play one of a number of roles. The Toastmaster of the Day 
presides over the meeting. A grammarian is appointed to monitor awkward and 
improper uses of language. And the "ah counter" is responsible for tallying the 
number of times a speaker pauses and says, "Ah . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone plays the role of evaluator. At the end of the "table topics" section 
of the meeting, when some members are called upon to give impromptu two-minute 
speeches on assigned topics, everyone else evaluates the presentations. Those 
giving prepared speeches also get critiques. Members also recognize one 
another's achievements by voting on the best prepared speech, the most improved 
speaker and the best impromptu presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the sessions are rigorous -- each includes a brief business meeting and 
about 10 speeches plus evaluations, all in two hours or less -- the atmosphere 
is comfortable and supportive. At the end of each speech, during recognition 
times and even during the business segment, members applaud one another often 
and heartily. The evaluations, even when critical, are couched in kind words. 
</P>
<P>
 A limitation to the method, said Womack, the Chapman professor, is that 
emphasis is on actual presentation of the speech, not on how it is constructed. 
A person might be a bad speaker, he said, because he or she is a bad writer who 
cannot organize material in a logical way that an audience can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews at USC agreed, saying he thinks the best way would be to hire experts 
to coach employees one-on-one. However, given the prohibitive expense of that 
method, he says, Toastmasters is a cost-effective alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which charges $36 per person for annual dues plus a $16 fee 
for materials, gives novice speakers what they need most, Andrews said: a lot 
of practice and continual feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Many chapters, he said, have volunteer advisers who teach others how to be 
good evaluators or who may even do most of the critiques themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters now has 170,000 members across the United States and 50 other 
countries, the organization says. Over the years, more than 3 million people 
have enrolled in the program. Women, excluded for the first 50 years of 
Toastmasters' existence, now make up half the membership, and the organization 
this year has its second female national president in Pauline Shirley, 
executive manager of Sherman R. Smoot Corp., a construction management firm in 
Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Among Toastmasters' graduates are some of America's top executives: Paul 
Orreffice, former chairman of Dow Chemical Co.; Peter Coors, chief executive of 
Coors Brewing Co., and Les McCraw, chief executive of Fluor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies with their own Toastmasters chapters provide a space to meet 
and offer moral support. The employees themselves typically pay their own fees, 
though some corporations pick up part of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas offers another incentive for joining Toastmasters: Time 
spent in meetings can count as part of the continuing education each employee 
is required to complete every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies say they see a definite advantage to having Toastmasters in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely see them improve their speaking skills," said Carol Sherman, 
executive vice president at Bergen Brunswig in Orange, which founded its 
chapter in 1989. "It benefits us because they are participating in meetings 
both inside and outside the company all the time." RAISING THEIR GLASSES ...

RJR TO SELL PUBLIC 19% OF NABISCO FOOD BUSINESS; STOCKS: THE $1-BILLION 
TRANSACTION MIGHT BE THE FIRST STEP IN A COMPANY BREAKUP, INDUSTRY OBSERVERS 
SAY. 
</P>

 RJR Nabisco Holdings said Monday that it plans to sell 19% of its Nabisco food 
business to the public for more than $1 billion in what many industry observers 
said might be the first step in a long-awaited breakup of the food and tobacco 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed stock offering -- proceeds from which would be used to reduce 
bank debt -- met with lukewarm response from many food and tobacco analysts. 
They said the plan does not go far enough in insulating the Nabisco Foods Group 
from the problems and controversy that have loomed over the tobacco business 
and depressed RJR's stock price. RJR indicated a complete spinoff of the food 
company remains far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relatively small percentage of the (Nabisco food) business that is 
being sold . . . it doesn't unlock an awful lot of value," said Anton J. 
Brenner, who follows consumer product companies at UBS Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, New York-based RJR dropped out of a plan to join its 
largest shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., to buy foods maker Borden 
Inc. for about $2 billion because of "certain accounting issues." Kohlberg 
Kravis -- which took over RJR in a $25-billion leveraged buyout in 1989 but has 
since reduced its stake -- said it will continue with the Borden takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling a stake in Nabisco Foods, RJR executives -- who also plan to begin 
paying a dividend on RJR stock -- said they are confident that their proposal 
will lead Wall Street to recognize the full value of the booming food company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program supports our focus on shareholder returns by establishing a 
separate trading value for our food business and providing shareholders with an 
immediate benefit -- a common dividend -- while also reducing overall debt," 
Charles M. Harper, chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, RJR shares rose 12.5 cents a share to close at $7 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where the company's stock was the day's most heavily traded. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of Nabisco Foods, whose brands include well-known names such as 
Oreo cookies, has been overshadowed by threats to RJR tobacco business, 
including growing government restrictions on smoking and numerous liability 
suits. RJR's cigarette brands include Winston, Salem and Camel. 
</P>
<P>
 But RJR, like rival tobacco and food company Philip Morris, continued to 
resist investor pressure for a total breakup of the company's food and tobacco 
units. RJR said it will wait at least two years before considering spinning 
Nabisco Foods to current stockholders. But, it added, there is "no assurance" 
that a spinoff will take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under the company's current proposal, RJR would sell 45 million 
shares of the newly created food company, Nabisco Holdings Corp., at between 
$23 to $26 a share. That would raise between $1.04 billion and $1.17 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 But RJR would remain firmly in control of its food company. RJR would retain 
voting control of Nabisco Holdings through ownership of a separate set of 
common stock. In anticipation of the spinoff, RJR's board already has named the 
members of Nabisco Holdings' board of directors. John Greenias, head of Nabisco 
Foods, would serve as president of Nabisco Holdings, and RJR's Harper would 
also serve as chairman of the new publicly traded foods company. 
</P>
<P>
 Such close ties raise concerns that Nabisco Holdings could remain vulnerable 
to any liability lawsuits filed against RJR's tobacco business. So far, RJR has 
successfully defended itself against such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, RJR Nabisco failed to win support for a plan to issue a new class 
of stock tied to Nabisco Foods' results but that would keep the company intact.

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN: HOW LENO IS CLOSING THE RATINGS GAP WITH LETTERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sense of nausea and panic that used to grip NBC executives every morning 
when they got the ratings flashes on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" is 
easing. For the first time in 14 months, some in Burbank must be thinking that 
they didn't make the worst blunder in television history after all. 
</P>
<P>
 That blunder, of course, was the decision to replace Johnny Carson with Jay 
Leno, and as a result send David Letterman into the arms of CBS, where he won a 
$42-million, three-year contract to go against Leno at 11:35 p.m. weeknights. 
In the initial months since Letterman premiered on CBS, he bloodied Leno by 
more than doubling the ratings CBS was getting in the time period. 
</P>
<P>
 While Leno remains a decided No. 2 behind Letterman, he nonetheless in recent 
weeks and months has managed to close the ratings gap -- to the point where he 
has been beating Letterman consistently in such major markets as Los Angeles 
and Chicago. And in the ratings two weeks ago, Leno and Letterman tied -- which 
for the underdog in TV is often viewed as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, during the first three weeks of October, "The Tonight Show" is up 
about 10% in the ratings while "The Late Show" has slipped about 4%. However, a 
whole ratings point still separates Leno from Letterman -- equivalent to about 
94,000 TV homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leno has come into his own," says Bill Croasedale, president of broadcast 
media at Western Media in Beverly Hills. "The pressures are off. He's more 
comfortable and doesn't feel there's a gun against his head, and that comes 
across with the audience as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there has to be more to Leno's turnaround than his new, shaggier 
haircut. NBC and "Tonight Show" executives attribute the rebound to a number of 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point was the New York trip," says Debbie Vickers, the show's 
producer, referring to the week in May that Leno spent in New York in response 
to Letterman's invasion of his home turf. "He was closer to the audience and 
they were much friendlier to him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leno cherishes the cheek-by-jowl atmosphere of clubs such as the Comedy Store 
on Sunset Boulevard, where both he and Letterman honed their acts back in the 
1970s. Leno's New York stint reminded the producers that Leno works best when 
in close interaction with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 So one of the first things the producers did when they returned to Los Angeles 
from New York was get NBC to build a new $1.4-million studio for "The Tonight 
Show." Until then, Leno had done his show from Carson's old digs. "There were 
ghosts there," Vickers says, laughing. The new studio puts the audience much 
closer to Leno -- literally within a couple of feet -- almost giving it the 
feel of a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the ghosts have been purged by moving the show across the hall, the 
producers are also tweaking Leno's format by having various stars "drop by." To 
supplement the usual lineup of three guests, the producers are inviting a 
fourth celebrity on the show for brief appearances and on-air stunts. Richard 
Simmons, Rip Taylor, Florence Henderson -- even Ross Perot, who showed up with 
some of his famous charts in hand -- have all done recent "walk-ons." 
</P>
<P>
 The new, more spontaneous Leno is probably best exemplified by the on-air tiff 
that erupted between Nickelodeon host Mark Summers and Burt Reynolds a few 
weeks back. Summers, after being egged on by Reynolds, snapped at him, "At 
least I'm still married." Reynolds then tossed his mug of water at Summers. 
During the commercial break, a gleeful Leno leaned over to Summers and 
whispered in his ear, "Man, this is great television!" 
</P>
<P>
 Late-night television, even when it is only moderately successful by 
prime-time standards, can be a gold mine for the networks because it is less 
costly to produce. CBS is estimated to earn between $75 million and $100 
million from Letterman. Leno's show, some contend, earns about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, both CBS and NBC are benefiting from the shakeout in the late-night 
television wars, where "The Arsenio Hall Show," "The Chevy Chase Show" and 
"Dennis Miller" have all fallen by the wayside. New syndicated late-night shows 
such as "Last Call," "The Newz" and "The Jon Stewart Show" are performing 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very intimidating, no matter what are the dollars they throw in your 
face," says Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment. "If you don't 
have the backing of one of the big three networks, it's pretty scary out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield and other NBC executives believe the recent positive trend in the 
major markets such as Los Angeles and Chicago foreshadows what will happen with 
Leno in the rest of the country. Still, the country's largest TV market, New 
York, remains out of grasp. "Dave's always done a show that feels very New 
York," says Littlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Situation wanted: "Multimillionaire TV executive, famed salesman, protege of 
Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio, available to run your company. May be 
interested in buying your company." If there were "situation wanted" ads for 
high-priced TV executives, that's how Gary Lieberthal's might read. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal, the former head of Columbia Pictures' television division and a 
former executive with Lear-Perenchio's production company, is back in Hollywood 
and hinting that he may resurface in the entertainment business. Lieberthal 
trumpeted his "retirement" three years ago and then went off to live on a 
Revolutionary War-era horse-breeding farm in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal is remembered among his peers in television for making a personal 
fortune from his share of the profits in the syndicated reruns of "Who's the 
Boss?" He also spent considerable sums of the studio's money locking up some of 
the biggest TV writer-producers in the business, including James L. Brooks, Ed. 
Weinberger and Hugh Wilson, none of whom generated any hits. More recently, 
Lieberthal has been romantically linked in the gossip columns to Patricia 
Kluge, former wife of billionaire John Kluge.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AUTO CLUB WILL END HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing mounting earthquake exposure in some of the state's riskiest areas, the 
Automobile Club of Northern California announced Monday that it will stop 
writing new homeowners and earthquake insurance effective Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, formally known as the California State Automobile Assn., joins 
most of the state's other large property insurers in restricting the growth of 
their businesses out of fear of another Northridge-style quake. 
</P>
<P>
 With 257,000 policyholders, CSAA is California's fourth-largest homeowners 
insurer. Because it writes exclusively in Northern California, CSAA suffered no 
losses with the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Northern California, particularly in the quake-prone Bay Area, CSAA's 
earthquake insurance business is nearly as concentrated as was that of Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co., which focused on Los Angeles. Losses 
estimated at $815 million from the Jan. 17 Northridge quake nearly put 20th 
Century out of business. Mindful of that example, CSAA is trying to reduce its 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hung in there long after many insurers withdrew from the market, but it 
would be unfair to our existing policyholders to allow our catastrophe exposure 
to expand any further," CSAA spokesman Barry Shiller said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bay Area, more than 40% of CSAA policyholders carry quake coverage on 
their homes, the company said. CSAA will renew coverage for current 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners insurance market "is still functioning, but it's getting 
increasingly difficult to find coverage," said Richard Baum, chief deputy state 
insurance commissioner. The Insurance Department is developing a stand-alone 
earthquake insurance program through the industry's high-risk pool, the 
California Fair Plan.

 Rates Unchanged on Short-Term Treasury Bills: The Treasury Department sold 
$13.7 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.07%, 
unchanged from a week earlier.Another $13.8 billion of new six-month bills was 
sold at an average discount rate of 5.51%, unchanged from the week before. The 
new discount rates understate the actual return to investors: 5.21% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,871.80, and 5.75% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,721.40. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face

 Genentech to Build Plant in California: The South San Francisco-based 
biotechnology company has chosen Vacaville as the site of a new $150-million 
manufacturing plant. The company said it looked at 50 sites in several states 
and Europe before deciding on Vacaville, where it is negotiating to buy a 
100-acre site from Chevron Land & Development Co.The new plant, scheduled for 
completion in late 1997, would initially create 300 jobs. It is expected to be 
the company's main manufacturing facility, officials said. Chief Executive G. 
Kirk Raab said the firm was swayed by local, state and federal incentives in 
choosing the site. Under a law passed by the Legislature last year, Genentech 
received a 6% investment tax credit for new biopharmaceutical facilities and a 
permanent research and development tax credit.

 Unocal Corp. said Monday that its third-quarter profit slipped 14% on lower 
natural gas prices and narrower profit margins on gasoline production and 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based oil company earned $60 million, or 21 cents a share, 
down from $70 million, or 25 cents a share, for the July-September period of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 3%, to $2.02 billion from $1.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger C. Beach, Unocal's chief executive, said reduced refining and marketing 
margins hurt results, as did significantly lower natural gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Beach said, worldwide crude oil production rose nearly 10% 
and natural gas production was 17% above year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
 However, domestic oil production declined 6% -- a trend Beach said will 
continue as Unocal concentrates on natural gas projects worldwide and the 
possible sale of U.S. properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of 1994, Unocal earned $164 million, or 57 cents a 
share, compared to $169 million, or 59 cents a share, for the same period a 
year ago. Nine-month revenue was $5.98 billion, down from $6.38 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $29.25 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. reported third-quarter net income of $123 
million, or $1.70 a share, contrasted with a loss of $94 million, or $1.31 a 
share, in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated revenue was $4.6 billion, compared 
to $4.5 billion for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our health, pension and life insurance businesses continue to produce strong 
earnings and returns," Cigna Chief Executive Wilson Taylor said in a statement.

9 INDICTED IN TELEPHONE CALLING-CARD SCAM; CRIME: RING ALLEGEDLY STOLE AND SOLD 
NUMBERS. ONE OF THOSE CHARGED IS THE SON OF A BEVERLY HILLS DEVELOPER. 
</P>

 The son of a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate developer was one of nine 
people indicted Monday by a federal grand jury in Greensboro, N.C., for his 
alleged role in a ring that authorities say stole and then sold as many as 
100,000 telephone calling-card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing one felony count of conspiracy to defraud is Claude Oliver Bilak, 22, 
of Beverly Hills, who attends USC and was known in the hacking community as 
"Killer." Bilak was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Milton Bilak, who owns El Cerrito Plaza, the Orangefair Shopping 
Center and other local malls and office buildings, denied any knowledge of his 
son's alleged activities and said he was "appalled" by the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also indicted was Joshua Neil Freifield, 19, of Whittier, an information and 
computer science major at UC Irvine who was known as "The Legend" and ran a 
computer bulletin board service called Road to Nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview Monday, Freifield acknowledged his involvement in the 
ring but said he didn't realize how illegal the activities were or the possible 
penalties for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like we were going out there trying to make ourselves rich and 
getting Ferraris," he said. "We just thought it was a small-time kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Others named in the indictment were Ivy James Lay, 29, of Haw River, N.C., a 
former MCI technician who authorities allege stole the credit card numbers from 
MCI's switching centers and supplied them to others for sale; Michelle Lillian 
Goodzuk, 23, of Kirkland, Wash.; Enoch John White, 52, of Philadelphia; Ted 
Anthony Lemmy, 29, of Westmont, Ill.; Leroy James Anderson, 46, of Blaine, 
Minn.; Frank Ronald Stanton Jr., 22, of Wingate, N.C., and Kim Schmitz of 
Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments were the culmination of a six-month investigation into 
calling-card fraud by the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has attracted considerable attention due to Lay's position as an MCI 
employee and the fact that stolen credit card numbers were used to make an 
estimated $50 million in long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the alleged conspirators could each face a maximum of five years 
in prison and a $250,000 fine.

WORKERS AT DOWNTOWN HILTON GET JOB WARNING; LABOR: A STALEMATE OVER HILTON 
CORP.'S MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WITH THE KOREAN OWNERS HAS EMPLOYEES FEARING THE 
WORST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 575 employees at the Downtown Los Angeles Hilton & Towers have been warned 
that some of their jobs are in jeopardy due to a possible year-end management 
change at the landmark hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning, which alarmed hotel workers and their union leaders, stems from a 
stalemate in talks between Hilton Hotels Corp., which manages the hotel, and a 
unit of the Hanjin Group, a South Korean conglomerate that has owned the 
facility since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton's current contract to run the hotel expires Jan. 1, and if no new 
agreement is reached by then, the company is expected to be replaced as the 
manager. That has raised job fears among workers, who technically work directly 
for Hilton and not for the hotel itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to calm worried workers, Hanjin issued a memo to employees late 
last week saying that "all or substantially all" current employees would be 
quickly rehired if a new management company is chosen. A company spokesman said 
Hanjin issued its warning of possible dismissals to satisfy a federal law 
requiring 60 days notice of business closings or major layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But labor leaders expressed fear that the possible management change threatens 
the hotel workers' job security provided by their union contracts. They cited 
language in a Hanjin statement to employees indicating that if a new management 
company came in, the workers would have to go through a new probationary 
period, during which they could be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Elena Durazo, president of Local 11 of the Hotel Employees and 
Restaurant Employees Union, said Hanjin was trying to reassure workers without 
giving them any real assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be fooled by empty gestures," she said. "We want absolute 
guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Hanjin, who refused to be identified by name, said the company 
wanted to give its new management firm "an opportunity to take a fresh look at 
everyone" working at the hotel. He added, however, that Hanjin "is not an 
anti-union company" and is not attempting to undermine the unions representing 
the hotel workers. No personnel changes will take place if Hilton is retained. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns over the Hilton's future come against a recent history of bitter 
labor disputes in Los Angeles' hotel industry. One conflict involved another 
South Korean company, Koreana Co., that fought an unsuccessful 10-month battle 
to oust the hotel workers union from the Radisson Wilshire Plaza after buying 
it in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Rivera, a housekeeper at the Hilton who attended a Monday afternoon staff 
meeting concerning the possible management change, said she is trying to remain 
hopeful that she will still have a job in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can do is hope and pray," said Rivera, a 19-year hotel employee. "It 
gives you something to think about, especially those of us who were thinking 
about retirement."

BURLINGTON NORTHERN SAYS IT WON'T RAISE BID FOR SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Inc., under pressure to raise its bid for Santa Fe Pacific 
Corp. following a higher offer by Union Pacific Corp. over the weekend, will 
stand pat, a Burlington spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern has already signed a friendly merger agreement with the 
owner of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad for $3.2 billion, up from an 
original $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Its latest offer was topped Sunday by Union Pacific, which said it will pay 
$3.8 billion if Santa Fe will break its earlier deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington spokesman James Sabourin said the comments made by Chairman and 
Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein to industry analysts Friday still stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a responsible and realistic proposal, which represents Burlington 
Northern's best and final bid," Grinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe said Sunday that it will consider the higher offer from Bethlehem, 
Pa.-based Union Pacific, but it sent a clear signal that it still favors a 
merger with Burlington Northern. 
</P>
<P>
 It said a merger with Burlington Northern would clear federal regulatory 
hurdles, while a combination with Union Pacific would probably be blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Monday that Union Pacific's higher offer still does not 
address regulatory concerns that a combination of the two companies' rail 
systems would be opposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission on antitrust 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ups the ante a little bit, but it doesn't attack the major question Santa 
Fe has raised, and that is: Will this be approved by the Interstate Commerce 
Commission?" said NatWest Securities Corp. analyst Michael Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's bid is worth $20 a share, about 16% higher than the $17.13 a 
share that Ft. Worth-based Burlington offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Santa Fe closed up 12.5 cents at $15.625 on 
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Union Pacific slipped 25 cents to 
$48.875 and Burlington Northern was off 75 cents at $49.875.

THE ECONOMY; EARNING MORE, SPENDING LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The indicators: Personal income and consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * What they did: Incomes climbed 0.6% in September -- the eighth straight 
increase -- while spending rose just 0.2%, the weakest showing since it dropped 
0.3% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it means: Americans are taking home more money and also saving more, as 
the economy continues to grow at a steady, moderate pace. The new data on 
income and spending means Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- was up to 4.1% in September, from 3.7% the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlights: The income data was a little stronger than many analysts had 
expected and spending figures were a little lower. Analysts said stock market 
traders paid little attention to the report. "Consumer spending is not the 
mover of the economy now; it's the follower," said Laurence Meyer, who heads a 
St. Louis forecasting firm. He noted that auto sales, after a particularly 
strong August, leveled off in September and helped hold down overall spending. 
Spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, 
was up for the fifth straight month and the seventh out of the last eight.

 Biotech Firm Halts Drug Development: Biogen Inc. has discontinued development 
of one of its two most important drugs, Hirulog, after the drug flunked a 
clinical trial.The Massachusetts-based firm said the anti-clotting medicine 
based on leech saliva failed to outperform a control drug, heparin, during a 
test on patients who underwent angioplasty. Biogen was trying to prove that 
Hirulog helped prevent complications from the procedure, in which doctors try 
to clear blocked arteries with inflatable balloons. The biotech company took a 
$25-million pretax charge against its earnings, which contributed to a 
third-quarter loss of $26.4 million, contrasted with year-ago net income of 
$11.3 million.

 Magma Rebuffs California Energy Bid: The San Diego-based power supplier said 
its board unanimously rejected the revised California Energy Co. offer for 
about 51% of Magma Power Co.'s stock, finding that it is not in the best 
interests of Magma stockholders.Omaha-based California Energy on Oct. 19 raised 
its offer to $38.50 per Magma share from $35. The new bid consists of $28.50 in 
cash and $10 in stock per share for 12.4 million Magma shares. In making the 
rejection, Magma said it considered a variety of factors, including the revised 
offer's conditional nature and the terms of California Energy's financing.

 East Coast Leads Country in Foreign Investment: The region has become the 
leader in direct foreign investment, taking the top spot away from the West 
Coast due to increased participation from European investors, a survey by 
International Business magazine and consultants Arthur Andersen said. Foreign 
investors put $26.2 billion into U.S.-based companies and American real estate 
last year, up 71% from 1992.Investments by the British went up fourfold, and 
many other European nations also increased their U.S. portfolios, which offset 
a 30% drop in investments by financially ailing Tokyo. The report says Britain 
has continued its U.S. investment spree in 1994 and will probably end the year 
as America's largest foreign investor -- a position it lost to Japan in 1992. 
New York displaced California as the most popular spot for foreign investors, 
the survey found, because Europeans favor the East Coast over the West.

 Ziffs Sell Database, Trade Show Units: The family sold two assets of the 
former Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. -- its database and trade show operations -- 
for about $667 million.The deals follow Thursday's sale of the core properties 
of Ziff-Davis Publishing, its computer magazine and market research firms, for 
$1.4 billion. The three sons of Bill Ziff Jr., who built the magazine empire 
into a dominant force in computer marketing, decided in June to sell the 
properties and use the proceeds for an investment firm. Thomson Corp., a 
Canadian media company, bought Information Access Co., which provides a 
database of more than 6,400 publications to libraries, for $465 million. 
Softbank Corp., a Japanese software distributor and computer publisher, bought 
ZD Expos for $202 million.

FIRMS NOW SPEND MORE ON OLD, NOT NEW, CUSTOMERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conquer new terrain or retain old territory? It's a perennial business 
question, but for the first time ever, corporate America is spending more on 
keeping customers than on capturing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer Marketing Metrics, a Paramus, N.J., consulting firm, conducted a 
survey of the marketing strategies of 165 U.S. companies. It showed that a 
collective 53% of their marketing budgets was allocated to retaining customers, 
47% to winning new ones. Just three years ago, the percentages were 54% on 
conquest and 46% on retention. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the respondents said a majority of marketing resources should be devoted 
to keeping customers; 30% said the bulk should go to winning new ones; 20% said 
the spending should be equal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately this will mean a shift of funds out of advertising into customer 
service programs," predicts Terry G. Vavra, president of Marketing Metrics and 
author of "Aftermarketing: How to Keep Customers for Life." "The goal has 
shifted from gaining share of market to increasing share of the customer, 
intensifying his loyalty," Vavra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many marketers share the view of Thomas J. Vos, vice president of marketing at 
Bowne & Co. financial printers. "If you have high market share, concentrate on 
retention," he says. If you have a low share, focus on attracting new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vavra, however, said retention marketing is equally effective and possibly 
more important for companies that are third or fourth in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 65% of a company's business comes from current customers. It costs 
five to 10 times more to acquire a customer than to serve an existing one, and 
current customers are more likely to buy other company products. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, some 91% of dissatisfied customers vow they'll never again buy from 
the company that disappointed them, experts say. Most will not complain to the 
company but will tell nine acquaintances.

COMPANY TOWN; 3 BABY BELLS, CAA PROMISE RESULTS FROM JOINT VENTURE; MEDIA: 
MICHAEL S. OVITZ WILL ADVISE THE FIRM, DEVELOPING A MARKETING STRATEGY FOR NEW 
PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three regional Bell companies and Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency on 
Monday confirmed their plans to jointly develop the programming and technology 
that will allow consumers to receive video by phone, a move the businesses 
contend will accelerate the construction of the much-delayed information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. said they will 
invest $100 million each to form two companies: one to generate programming and 
one to develop the technology to deliver it. Each firm will have its own chief 
executive and about 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The ventures will become part of the Bell companies' independent strategies to 
compete with cable companies in providing video services to consumers, an 
undertaking expected to cost each company billions of dollars annually through 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 CAA, headed by Michael S. Ovitz, will advise the media firm, developing a 
marketing strategy for the new programming and guiding the phone companies as 
they begin to explore the culture of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As they enter a competition that pits them against the $12-billion U.S. cable 
industry -- and perhaps against a separate coalition of three other Baby Bells 
now in negotiations with Walt Disney Co. to start an interactive venture -- the 
phone companies hope Ovitz will be their trump card. 
</P>
<P>
 As they joined the powerful talent agent Monday to conduct press interviews at 
the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, top Bell executives -- in light of the 
collapse of various other ambitious schemes to develop the information 
superhighway -- took pains to say that Monday's announcement would have 
tangible results. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the principals are Pacific Telesis Chairman Philip Quigley, whose plans 
to roll out a video network in California are nearly a year behind schedule, 
and Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith, whose planned acquisition of cable giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. became synonymous with the infobahn until the 
acquisition fell apart earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not smoke and mirrors," Quigley said repeatedly during a brief 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a definite agreement. The deal is done. The search is on," echoed 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The three phone concerns said their collaboration will enable them to avoid 
duplications and achieve economies of scale in purchasing equipment and 
developing software, notably the "navigator" that will help consumers find what 
they want in the world of infinite numbers of channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic and Nynex serve more than 30 million households 
in six of the top seven media markets in the country: Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would hope to happen is that the scale will accelerate all of this 
much more quickly," said Nynex President Ivan Seidenberg, who began talking 
with Ovitz two years ago. Assuming federal regulatory approval, the initial 
programming will be available late next year, Bell executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ovitz said the deal will provide more opportunity for existing 
and new talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our business, talent has such a rough time getting a start," he said. 
"Nothing could be better for this business than new outlets like this."

 Most observers said they don't see the Parsons appointment directly affecting 
the heads of Time Warner's operating units, some of whom currently enjoy a 
great deal of autonomy. Top officers will continue to report directly to 
Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin, who will relinquish the title of 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner includes such businesses as the Warner Bros. studio, Warner Music, 
Time Inc., Warner Books, Home Box Office and the Six Flags theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it creates a bigger, centralized power base without cutting off the 
lifeline of the operating heads," Smith Barney analyst Jill S. Krutick said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some see Parsons' job as emphasizing corporate financial activities in the 
wake of the retirement of Chief Financial Officer Bert Wasserman, who is 
leaving at year's end. Time Warner is loaded with debt stemming from the 1989 
merger of Warner Communications and Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with hiring Parsons, Time Warner promoted financial executive Richard J. 
Bressler to senior vice president for finance. He will report to Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, both Levin and Parsons said Parsons' job will be broader than 
just financial, involving a wide range of corporate and strategic matters. 
Levin said he called Parsons a couple of weeks ago to see if he could entice 
him to join the company. Parsons said the opportunity was too big to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time Warner is the frontier. It's the future," said Parsons, who will 
continue to serve on Time Warner's board. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment makes Parsons, already one of the top African American 
executives in the nation, one of the most senior black executives in the 
entertainment business. Others include Walt Disney Chief Financial Officer 
Richard Nanula, Motown Records Chief Executive Jheryl Busby and Elektra 
Entertainment Chairwoman Sylvia Rhone. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons, who chaired New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's transition team, is 
also one of the nation's most visible black Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons' appointment follows a major shake-up in one of Time Warner's music 
operations, though Levin said there is no connection. Last week, Doug Morris 
gained control of Time Warner's domestic music division in a power struggle 
with Robert Morgado, the firm's top music executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Val Azzoli, Atlantic Records executive vice president, will 
succeed Danny Goldberg as head of the label. Goldberg has accepted the job of 
chairman at Warner Bros. Records. Sources also said Warner is wooing Phil 
Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, to join Warner Bros. Records 
as president.

COMPANY TOWN; CAP CITIES, IMAX JOIN IN VENTURE FOR GIANT-SCREEN MOTION PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Imax Corp. said Monday they have formed a joint 
venture to make giant-screen motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for Imax to distribute the films, which would be jointly 
financed by the two companies.There are currently 115 Imax theaters in 18 
countries. About 35 more are scheduled to open in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture will focus on topics such as natural history and space 
exploration, which the companies said have a broader appeal than traditional 
Imax films on educational and travel-related subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture will also explore projects related to the ABC television 
network's coverage of news and sports and look into videocassette, CD-ROM and 
multimedia applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto-based Imax, founded in 1967, specializes in giant-screen and motion 
simulator films. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ABC-TV network, Cap Cities operates eight television 
stations, the ABC radio network and 19 radio stations. The New York-based 
company also produces programming for cable television.

CLINIC OFFICIAL'S MURDER TRIAL BEGINS; COURTS: PROSECUTOR SAYS ADMINISTRATOR 
TRIED TO COVER UP PATIENT'S DEATH. VICTIM DIED BEFORE ABORTION WAS PERFORMED 
AND AUTOPSY WAS BOTCHED, DEFENSE COUNTERS. 
</P>

 An abortion clinic administrator on trial for murder had a "monetary motive" 
when she began performing the risky procedures without medical training and 
then tried to cover up the January, 1993, death of a young patient, a 
prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense attorney for Alicia Hanna, 32, agreed with some of the prosecution's 
allegations but denied that Hanna was guilty of murder, saying the victim died 
before an abortion was performed and a botched autopsy has concealed the true 
cause of the woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Nieto Sanchez, 27, of Orange died Jan. 19, 1993, after going to Hanna's 
Bristol Street clinic for an abortion. Sanchez began vomiting and foaming at 
the mouth, after Hanna injected her with an unknown drug, yet Hanna refused to 
let an assistant call 911, prosecutor Rick King told an Orange County Superior 
Court jury during opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant said, 'No, I'll save her -- we'll get in trouble,' " and hung 
up the phone, said King, who depicted Hanna as a financially ailing 
businesswoman looking to make fast money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant made a conscious choice to cut out the middle man -- the 
doctors -- and the defendant decided to perform abortions on her own," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna is charged with murder in Sanchez's death and with performing or 
attempting to perform abortions on two other women in the fall of 1992, even 
though she is not licensed to do so, King said. In one of those cases, the 
procedure did not work -- a fact the woman did not learn until several weeks 
later, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Steve Biskar told jurors his client was only performing 
illegal abortions to help desperate, impoverished women who believed they had 
nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also told jurors a "negligent" coroner did not preserve 
sufficient autopsy specimens for further testing and said the autopsy fails to 
prove how Hanna died. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no scientific, defined explanation" for Sanchez's death, said 
Biskar, who said his client frantically tried to perform CPR and use other 
measures to save the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Sanchez's three children were waiting for their mother outside the 
clinic when she died, King said. Hanna had an assistant tell the boy and girl 
that their mother had already gone home, and sent the children home with an 
uncle who came to pick them up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Hanna was asking friends to help her dump Sanchez's body and 
her car in Tijuana, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sanchez's relatives returned to the clinic to find her, they discovered 
Hanna attempting to hoist the dead woman's body into the trunk of Sanchez's 
car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar told jurors his client tried to cover up her actions because she was 
afraid law enforcement officials would discover she was performing illegal 
abortions at her clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She panicked and she tried to cover it up," Biskar said.

DEBATE HEATS UP OVER INITIATIVE ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Proposition 188 has been virtually eclipsed by the national notoriety 
of Proposition 187, its neighbor on the statewide ballot, the measure to repeal 
California's restrictions on smoking has still managed to stir passions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the proposition is pitting smokers against nonsmokers and 
health groups against restaurant owners amid controversial scientific findings 
that secondhand smoke can cause cancer and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Health concerns aside, the debate also focuses on whether state lawmakers 
should have the power to determine smoking policies inside privately owned 
businesses and the workplace. Some health officials in Orange County think so. 
Some local restaurant owners think not. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the tobacco industry-backed initiative would repeal the statewide 
ban on smoking in the workplace -- scheduled to take effect next year -- and 
give business owners the ability to choose whether they want to create limited 
smoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also repeal all local and state regulations, undoing tough 
anti-smoking ordinances in some South County cities, where tobacco vending 
machines are banned and puffing is prohibited in at least 75% of the floor 
space in all restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might even see an increase in death in the county," said Jim Nethery, 
chairman of the Tobacco Use Prevention Coalition for Orange County. "I think 
it's sick that these carpetbaggers from North Carolina can come in and run the 
state and ram any legislation they want down our throats. But then again, 
they've always controlled smoking issues in the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, says Dan Marcheano, owner of the Arches, a restaurant in Newport 
Beach, where smoking is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody walks into a restaurant and is surrounded by smoke, they have 
every right to walk out," he said. "But the state is trying to take that right 
away from us. The state can't balance the budget, it can't handle crime or the 
illegal immigration or clean up the air outside. And now it wants to take on 
smoking indoors? This should be between the consumer and the operator." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Councilman Jay Humphrey argues that Proposition 188 is an attack on 
local law. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should vote against Proposition 188 because it abrogates local law," 
he said. "Whatever happened to the one-man, one-vote (provision)? I thought 
that's what democracy was all about -- having the public involved with the 
decision process." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the possibility of the initiative's passage has postponed a City 
Council vote in Yorba Linda, which was considering adopting an ordinance 
banning smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting to the point where many cities think it's silly to pass an 
ordinance that will only be reversed in the next two months," says Phil 
Falcetti, a prevention specialist for the Orange County Health Care Agency, 
which helps cities prepare health care-related ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Lida Lenney, a Laguna Beach council member, said if Proposition 188 passes, 
the city's anti-smoking efforts in the last four years will be extinguished -- 
including the ban on tobacco vending machines in town and on smoking in all 
restaurants, starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Laguna Beach isn't alone. Huntington Beach, Dana Point, Laguna Hills, San 
Juan Capistrano and Santa Ana have passed similar anti-smoking ordinances 
banning either cigarette vending machines or smoking in restaurants that will 
face reversal if the measure is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 "takes control out of the hands of the local community," 
Lenney said. "I just hope people can read through it, and realize that it is 
backed by the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, known as the California Uniform Tobacco Control Act, would 
regulate smoking statewide and create a uniform law, said Lee Stitzenberger, 
the campaign director for Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions, a 
backer of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current climate in California is that there are 300 different ordinances 
on smoking and it's just too confusing," Stitzenberger said. "You can cross the 
street in Anaheim and face different laws in Garden Grove; you can cross the 
street in Los Angeles and face a different set of rules in Beverly Hills. We 
think your rights should be the same whether you're a smoker or a nonsmoker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 would give private businesses the right to choose whether to 
establish smoking in lounges, cafeterias, private offices, conference rooms or 
company cars. It would let restaurant owners decide whether they want to 
designate 25% of their space as smoking sections, provided they meet 
ventilation standards, which are set by the American Society of Heating and 
Refrigeration and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also would permit bars, restaurants and liquor stores and any 
other businesses to bring back vending machines in cities where they are 
currently banned, as long as they are placed in supervised areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is businesses have the right to make a conscious choice," 
Stitzenberger said. "But they also have the absolute right to deny smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 But health groups and anti-smoking advocates claim more people will be exposed 
to secondhand smoke because ventilation standards will never be met, and that 
the initiative will turn back the progress gained in the last decade since 
secondhand smoke was identified by the U.S. surgeon general in 1984 as a 
carcinogen.

HOLIDAY TREATS -- AND TRICK; DISNEYLAND: A MONSTER TRAFFIC JAM DURING MORNING 
RUSH KEEPS MANY FROM JOINING FREE FUN THAT PARK PROMISED ANYONE IN HALLOWEEN 
COSTUME.

 Disneyland hosted a Halloween megabash for nearly 50,000 people Monday, but 
the real horror show was outside the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The meanest, most bloodcurdling creatures this side of Transylvania may have 
been the folks who donned costumes to qualify for the promised free admission 
to the amusement park only to be turned away when the titanic traffic jam they 
helped create prevented them from getting to Disneyland before the parking lot 
closed at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were stopped bumper to bumper for an hour and 45 minutes. It was 
disgusting," said Helen Caswell of Chino Hills, who arrived too late to deliver 
three grandchildren, ages 5 to 11 and dressed as a ballerina, a cowboy and an 
Indian. A 15-year-old grandson and his friend had bolted from the car and 
bought admission tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little ones were disappointed," Caswell said. "Real disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush-hour traffic throughout Orange County was slowed for more than an hour, 
and the southbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway got so badly knotted that 
authorities dispatched trucks with signs warning of delays ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a virtual parking lot from about 6 a.m. to 9," said CHP Officer Ron 
Johnson, whose electronic traffic-management monitor was lighted in red -- 
indicating that the flow of freeway traffic approaching the park was stuck 
below 20 m.p.h. "It was all red. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Event co-sponsors estimated that 50,000 party-goers arrived in time for the 
park's first-ever Halloween fest, and the liveliest were already waiting when 
the lots opened at 5 a.m. Park officials didn't know how many were left out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman said Disneyland stuck to its promise to let in free anyone in 
costume who was at the main entrance by 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sorry for anyone who didn't enjoy Halloween with us," spokesman John 
McClintock said. "The rules were pretty clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was co-hosted by Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM and promoted for 
a week on host Rick Dees' morning show. The publicity paid off with crowds that 
swamped local streets and freeways, already bulging with rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a major event coupled with rush-hour traffic, you're going to 
have delays," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Fred Roush, who had the unenviable job 
Monday of supervising local traffic control. "There's a saturation point." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the park, ghouls, witches and machete-toting murderers gathered at the 
Haunted Mansion, joining the closest Disneyland has to a scary crowd -- Captain 
Hook, a couple of evil queens and Jafar of "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really done anything. We decided if we were going to do 
something, it should be pretty big," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caswell packed her brood back into the car for consolation stopovers at the 
Disneyland Hotel -- not much going on there, it turned out -- and a nearby 
restaurant for lunch and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never tried anything like this before," she said later. "I wouldn't try 
that again."

HOLIDAY TREATS-AND TRICKS; CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT YOUNG 
PATIENTS CAN'T GO OUT ON THE STREETS AND RING DOORBELLS -- THE HOLIDAY COMES TO

 For about an hour on Monday morning, 9-year-old Eric Viola escaped his 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black and wearing sunglasses with red, blinking eyeballs over his 
breathing mask, Eric joined about 50 other young patients at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County in trick-or-treating down corridors transformed into 
Halloween alleys.  
</P>
<P>
 On Viola's left hand were two IV tubes, connected to a unit maneuvered by his 
father. In his right was a bagful of treats, including a candy necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 The necklace was "for my little sister, Robin," he said in a soft, 
high-pitched voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital workers donated their time and money to festoon the hospital with 
orange and black. The admitting department became a dungeon with spider webs 
draped against a dark gray wall. Doors were decorated with pumpkins and 
goblins, and toys and candy waited at stations throughout the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribbie, the mascot of the California Angels, distributed an ample amount of 
hugs along with team paraphernalia. A few Mighty Ducks players and officers 
from the Orange Police Department also joined the party. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eric, it was the first outing since he was found to have leukemia more 
than a month ago. Although he said he missed walking around his neighborhood 
with his brother and two sisters, the Halloween bash at the hospital provided a 
flavor of home -- plus more tangible treats such as caramel apples. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first thing I'm going to eat," Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witches, Wonder Woman and Popeye's own little Sweet Pea paraded through the 
halls, some in wheelchairs and some led by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Craig Kelsey, who visits the hospital regularly, said the party gave 
the kids a chance to get out of bed and collect some goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of going out in the streets," Kelsey said, "we're bringing the 
streets to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Gonzales zoomed by the baskets of toys and candy on his green Little 
Tykes tricycle. After visiting one Halloween station, the bespectacled 
7-year-old rode over to a friend and said, "I have bubbles, do you have 
bubbles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others had their own preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sarah's just after anything pink," said Melissa Barba of her 4-year-old 
daughter, who has been receiving cancer treatment for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed as Princess Jasmine of Disney's "Aladdin," Sarah scurried through 
three floors of the hospital holding a Halloween bag in front of her. In the 
elevator between floors, she took time to count her spoils. Not waiting to get 
back to her room to eat, she unwrapped some pink bubble gum and popped it her 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 At each station, in addition to candy, there were toys for those like Benjamin 
Deering, 3, who couldn't have sweets due to medical conditions. Benjamin, 
wrapped in a red, white and blue terry-cloth robe resembling the American flag, 
filled his Halloween bag with stuffed ghosts, pencils and other gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never been able to do this before," said Benjamin's mother, Sharon. 
"He's having the time of his life."

CLERK FINDS MORE LAPSED TAX APPEALS; BUREAUCRACY: GRAND JURY EXPRESSES INTEREST 
IN BREAKDOWN OF PROPERTY TAX PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The scope of the county's property assessment appeals blunder continued to 
grow Monday, with Clerk of the Board Phyllis A. Henderson confirming that the 
deadlines on another 28 cases expired before their appeal hearings had been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cases alone mean an additional discrepancy of as much as $155.6 million 
between what the owners say their property is worth and what the county had 
assessed them at, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the total snafu in at least 201 cases in its appeals 
process could cost the county, school districts, cities and other governmental 
agencies $10.7 million or more in lost tax revenue over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of the Orange County Grand Jury on Monday asked to meet 
with Supervisor William G. Steiner regarding the breakdown in the appeals 
process, an indication that the panel intends to investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I would welcome the assistance of the grand jury and its audit firm 
to help sort this mess out," Steiner said. "While this is bad news, I'm 
reassured that the clerk of the board is finally getting a handle on this and 
we won't continue to hear more bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner added: "There needs to be a conclusion brought to this fiasco so the 
taxpayers can be reassured that their appeals are being handled appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the deadlines on at least 201 property assessment appeals have 
expired, forcing the county assessor to accept property owners' value of the 
property, instead of his own. In one case alone, involving the Bank of America, 
there was a more than $100-million difference between what the bank estimated 
the property was worth and the county's estimated value. 
</P>
<P>
 The total valuation difference in all the cases exceeds $427 million in 
taxable property for 1992 alone, county officials said. For the county, that 
could mean a total loss of $640,000 for the General Fund over the next years, 
officials said. The average tax rate in the county is 1.25% of the property's 
assessed value, of which 6% goes to the General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mistakes on the appeals have angered the Board of Supervisors, prompting 
some members to look into possible disciplinary actions against Henderson and 
Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs. The two department heads blame each other for the 
foul-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one supervisor has suggested that Henderson consider resigning from 
her post. Henderson, who was appointed to her position in 1992, reports to the 
Board of Supervisors. Jacobs, who is an elected official, does not. Among the 
disciplinary action being considered, county officials said, is revoking the 
clerk's and assessor's salary raises, which were approved earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Monday he is investigating 
the matter to determine who is responsible and how to prevent the problem from 
recurring. A preliminary review of the appeals process, however, has found that 
the county's methods are flawed, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state officials, Orange County is the only county in the state 
that requires residential and business owners to appeal tax bills to the 
assessor instead of the clerk of the board. The practice raises potential 
conflict-of-interest issues, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional 28 appeals that have expired in the county's system were found 
by Henderson, who worked over the weekend to determine the scope of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done anything but work on files," Henderson said. One of the files 
Henderson found over the weekend involved an unidentified parcel where the 
difference between the county's value and the owner's value was nearly $96 
million. Henderson said she believes she has found the last of the expired 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs declined to discuss the matter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said last week that she disciplined one of her employees because of 
the recent mistakes. She declined to identify the worker, but county sources 
have said the employee is her top assistant, Nancy Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county officials said the appeals snafu was partly due to an overloaded 
and overworked appeals process that started bursting at the seams when property 
values in the county took a dive, prompting many property owners to appeal tax 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last year, the county faced a backlog of 68,000 appeals. That 
number was cut to 36,000 appeals after the Board of Supervisors allocated funds 
to the assessor to hire more assessment workers.

TEEN SURVIVES ATTEMPTED SUICIDE IN CLASSROOM; INCIDENT: ALISO NIGUEL HIGH

CONDITION. FRIENDS SAY THE JUNIOR WRESTLER WAS DISTRAUGHT OVER THE END OF AN 
18-MONTH RELATIONSHIP.

 An Aliso Niguel High School junior, distraught over a breakup with his 
girlfriend Monday, put a gun under his chin and fired in front of her and other 
classmates, but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old boy was in critical condition Monday night at Children's 
Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, after the bullet went 
through his mouth and out the base of his nose, hospital officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Miraculously, he's going to be OK," said Jacqueline Price, a spokeswoman for 
the Capistrano Unified School District. The boy never lost consciousness and 
apparently suffered no neurological injury, hospital officials said. However, 
he is likely to need extensive reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the boy went home from school Monday morning after the 
breakup and returned with a .45-caliber, semi-automatic handgun. The shooting 
occurred at 12:44 p.m., during his fifth-period photography class. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Denise Danne said that the student's former girlfriend, a sophomore 
and student in the class, saw the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If you break up with me, I'm going to kill myself,' " Danne said. 
"We think this was something he thought about over the past couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Taz Murtaugh said he had been walking down the hall when he noticed 
students scurrying out of the photography classroom. He went inside and saw the 
boy lying on his back with blood running from his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I was mad at my girlfriend,' " Murtaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murtaugh said he put a T-shirt under the boy's head and tried to keep him calm 
while waiting for paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of the girl's said the boy had "always said he was going to do it. He 
had said it before." 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy did not seem distressed during a first-period class, the friend 
added. "He's a totally cool, down-to-earth person." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the boy, a standout on the school's wrestling team, said he had 
told classmates at lunch Monday what he planned to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends told me that (he) said, 'I'm going to go home and get a gun and 
shoot myself in front of her,' " said one of the boy's friends who was at the 
hospital Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend said the 16-year-old and his girlfriend had just broken up after 
being together for about 18 months. "I never thought that he would do something 
that desperate," he said. "This was a great shock to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's family was sequestered in a private waiting room at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said that because the boy's family was 
going through "an extreme amount of trauma," investigators had not yet 
investigated where the gun came from. 
</P>
<P>
 School counselor Ric Stephenson said that the students who saw the shooting 
were "pretty much in shock." They were ushered to the school's media center, 
where counselors and psychologists from throughout the district had been 
summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few young ladies were very emotional, some were crying," said Tom Anthony, 
an assistant superintendent. "But no one was hysterical or out of control. The 
psychologists and counselors did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of those in the class were called, and students were allowed to leave 
with them, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they planned to discuss the incident with students 
today, beginning with a talk by the principal over the school's cable TV 
system, and talks by individual teachers. Counselors and psychologists will be 
on the campus for any students, parents or employees who want to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we want to get out to students is that it is OK to talk to an 
adult at school, or any adult who is important in a student's life, about 
problems like this," Price said. "There are a lot of people out there to talk 
to. Just talking about a problem sometimes makes a problem not seem as large as 
it may seem." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's shooting was the fourth gun incident -- and the first involving a 
shooting -- in the school district's history, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, students at San Clemente and Capistrano Valley high schools 
were found with guns in a two-day period, Price said. Two years ago, a student 
at Niguel Hills Middle School brought a gun to school because he said he was 
afraid of being bullied. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has a zero-tolerance policy on all weapons on campus, school 
officials said, and the middle school student was expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, the district purchased 12 hand-held metal detectors to be used 
for spot checks for weapons. However, Anthony said, they have been kept in a 
warehouse until school personnel can be trained to use them.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOLS NOT LIABLE FOR INJURIES OF 
KINDERGARTNER HIT BY CAR 
</P>

<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury decided Monday that the Santa Ana Unified 
School District is not liable for permanent injuries suffered by a 5-year-old 
kindergarten student who left school unsupervised and was hit by a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district will still pay the girl $225,000, however, because of an 
earlier out-of-court settlement that set damages, said attorney A.J. Pyka, who 
represented the district during the trial.The district made the agreement, he 
said, to protect itself against a potential multimillion-dollar loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra Reyes, now 7, left Wilson Elementary School in Santa Ana when her 
baby-sitter failed to show up to take her home during the lunch hour on Jan. 
28, 1993. She was being supervised by monitors who didn't notice she had gone, 
Pyka said. The girl had been warned by teachers and her mother against leaving 
the campus without an adult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident, near the intersection of 15th and Flower streets, left the child 
with permanent brain damage, a speech impediment and paralysis in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Hunter, the girl's attorney, argued that the school was liable under a 
state law that holds school districts accountable for students' off-campus 
injuries if they result from negligence by school personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the jury was sympathetic to the plight of the girl, who appeared in 
court in a wheelchair, jurors agreed unanimously that school personnel had done 
what they could do to protect her, one juror said. They also agreed after only 
a half-hour of deliberations that the child was old enough to know better than 
to leave the school alone. SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

 With the City Council election just a week away, some candidates have begun 
borrowing heavily from their personal funds to pay for advertising and campaign 
mailers, according to the second round of disclosure statements for the period 
between Oct. 5 and Thursday. Mark Malatesta pumped $12,000 into his campaign, 
the largest personal loan by a candidate in the council election.In contrast, 
he has received only $150 in outside contributions and has spent just $1,263 so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Forsberg loaned his campaign $5,000 while taking in $804 in 
political donations, according to the statements. Among the checks written to 
Forsberg's political committee were $100 from the Saddleback Valley Assn. of 
Realtors and $200 from the Manufactured Housing Education Trust, a group 
representing mobile home park owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Herzog put $4,000 into his campaign, which received $2,341 in 
contributions. The largest contributor was developer Baker Ranch Properties, 
which gave $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other active fund-raisers were Joe A. Hernandez Jr. and incumbent Councilman 
Richard T. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez took in $3,140, reporting $2,041 in contributions of less than $100. 
</P>
<P>

Ranch Properties and waste hauler Browning-Ferris Industries, which contributed 
$500 each. Dixon also received $400 from the Manufactured Housing Education 
Trust.

<P>
 Other candidates receiving contributions include incumbent Mayor Marcia 
Rudolph, whose campaign received $1,219. The largest donation was $400 from 
developer Foothill Ranch Properties. 
</P>

$100 while Dewayne Stark reported $300 in political donations. A political 
action committee supporting Rudolph, McCullough and Thomas M. Whaling raised 
$1,570, all contributions of less than $100. 
</P>
<P>

 Federal investigators on Monday joined local authorities probing an early 
morning blaze that caused $1 million in damage to a Westminster restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the fire, which broke out at Texas Loosey's Chili Parlor 
& Saloon in the 14000 block of Beach Boulevard shortly after 1 a.m., said Capt. 
Craig Campbell of the Westminster Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the cause of the fire is under investigation, with the 
assistance of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents. The 
agency is called upon in fire cases involving large losses, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was closed at the time and no one was inside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 36 firefighters from four cities about 45 minutes to bring the fire 
under control, Campbell said. The blaze caused an estimated $700,000 damage to 
the contents and $300,000 to the building, he said. KEN ELLINGWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider whether to rejoin the League of 
California Cities, eight months after withdrawing from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ho Chung is asking the council to reconsider the move, which he 
said has isolated the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the council voted 3 to 2 to quit the league, saying that the city 
does not reap enough benefit from its $28,000 in annual dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater said at the time of the vote that the Orange 
County division of the organization has become a "social club." He added that 
the city has an equal vote with smaller cities that pay lesser dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mark Leyes and Robert F. Dinsen joined Broadwater in voting to 
withdraw from the league. Mayor Frank Kessler and Chung voted to remain a 
member of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler has cited the isolation that the withdrawal created as one of the key 
reasons why he decided not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County division of the league works on countywide and regional 
issues on behalf of the cities.  
</P>
<P>
 The state league is composed of 470 cities. Redlands is the only other 
non-member. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 A Costa Mesa man was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in 
connection with the shooting death last week of his 15-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 David Curtis Stinson, 39, of Costa Mesa did not enter a plea during his brief 
appearance at Harbor Municipal Court.He is expected to enter a plea Friday when 
the arraignment continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the shooting occurred Thursday evening at the Stinsons' apartment 
in the 3100 block of Coral Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinson's daughter, Collister, was shot in the neck, apparently while he was 
cleaning or checking a gun as the two talked in his room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Stinson, a warehouse supervisor, apparently had been drinking 
before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's proceedings, Judge Craig E. Robison reduced Stinson's bail 
from $250,000 to $25,000 upon the request of his attorney, Deputy Public 
Defender James Spellman, who had asked that bail be lowered to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a white prison jumper, Stinson was solemn throughout the 
proceedings. He quietly answered Robison's questions from the inside of a 
plexiglass-enclosed area and only glanced briefly at his mother and two sisters 
who sat toward the front of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took it pretty hard," said Stinson's mother, Anne, after the proceedings. 
"I just can't believe what happened. It's like a bad dream. I just hope it 
works out for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty for involuntary manslaughter is usually two to four years in 
prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pear said. However, because a firearm was 
involved, Stinson could face nine years in prison if he is convicted, Pear 
said.NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; HOME'S DOME DEMOLITION LOOMS IN 2 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The countdown is on for the demolition of the notorious 30-foot metal dome on 
top of a Marina Hill house. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after its construction, and 14 months after the City Council 
ordered the dome removed, city officials recently told homeowners Mark and 
Elizabeth Thompson that the demolition of their observatory dome must begin by 
Nov. 14.They have until the end of this week to submit revised plans for the 
top of their Sandpiper Drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 After complaining for years, next-door neighbor Jerry Andersen said he'll 
believe it when he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not going to go out and celebrate yet," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen began his campaign against the dome in 1990, when it was in the 
planning stage. An anti-dome petition he circulated was signed by 200 
residents. But the dome was constructed with approval from the city Planning 
Department. In August, 1993, the City Council voted to make the Thompsons 
remove the dome, saying that it had been misrepresented to city officials and 
was in violation of zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thompsons, owners of Grandma's Ice Cream in Seal Beach, could not be 
reached for comment. Lee Whittenberg, city director of development services, 
said the Thompsons have been cooperating with city officials, and he sees no 
need for legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Barry Curtis said the Thompsons were told last week to remove 
telescopes and other equipment from the observatory and not to live in the dome 
area. He said their new plans call for replacing the dome with a pitch roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will match the rest of the house," Curtis said. "The dome has to be 
removed and construction must be started by the end of next week." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH/COSTA MESA; BOARD EXTENDS PACT FOR 
SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>

<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District Supt. Mac Bernd's contract was extended 
by one year Tuesday, until June 30, 1997, over the objections of two board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissenters in the 5-2 decision said the board should have waited until 
after the Nov. 8 election that will replace at least three of seven trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing board member Sherry Loofbourrow said she could not vote in favor of 
the extension knowing that a month from now, the community's elected 
representatives would be different. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the extension was premature. Previously, boards extended 
contracts seven to 14 months before the existing contracts expired, she said. 
Bernd's contract had another 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Martha Fluor agreed and said the decision should be made at the 
annual re-evaluation of the superintendent, not at the midyear review. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward H. Decker disagreed, noting he had voted on former 
superintendent John Nichol's contract renewal as a new trustee, and that he had 
felt ill-equipped to evaluate someone who had been with the district so much 
longer than he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came onto the board, one of the first things that faced me was the 
evaluation of a longstanding superintendent," he said. "It is obviously the 
most important responsibility we have, and I do not shirk it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd's $104,000 salary plus benefits remain the same under the extension.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BUSINESS COMPLEX FEES WILL BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business fees in the Irvine Business Complex will be reviewed in the wake of a 
$215,718 fee reduction granted last week to a planned self-storage business by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The IBC Consortium, a committee of business professionals and city officials, 
will review fees to determine if they are out of line with surrounding 
communities and report back to the council by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was prompted by an appeal by Los Angeles businesswoman Betty Jo 
Humiston, who has been trying to build a self-storage business in the complex 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was approved in 1986 but subsequently hit a snag with city 
regulations. In 1989, the Irvine Co. wanted to change the building design, 
which the city had already approved. Humiston lost her construction loan during 
the delay and the recession has kept the project on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Humiston obtained zoning approval in February to start the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the council's motivation for the nearly 65% fee reduction was the 
expectation that the self-storage facility would generate little traffic 
compared to the other businesses and office buildings in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Chamber of Commerce President Brian Kjos told the council that all 
Irvine Business Complex fees are too high compared to surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Michael Ward said the fees are used to help the city cope with the 
increased traffic generated by new businesses. "Businesses won't want to locate 
here if their employees can't get to work," Ward said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR AMPHITHEATRE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spectacor Management Group, the operator of the Long Beach Convention Center 
and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, will have to wait to see if it is next 
to operate the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fair Board on Thursday postponed a decision so it could 
further review a protest that was filed by Irvine Meadows Partners, one of five 
companies that submitted bids to run the 8,500-seat facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair board has been looking for a management group that has experience in 
operating amphitheaters and is willing to accommodate the neighbors on noise 
issues -- a factor that led the fairgrounds to buy back the amphitheater in 
April, 1993, from Nederlander Organization for $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-member panel two weeks ago recommended that SMG manage the 
amphitheater. Jill Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fairgrounds, said 
the Department of General Services, a state agency in Sacramento, will first 
have to conduct a review. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how long it's going to take," Lloyd said. General Services 
"could choose to come down and hold hearings here. And that could take awhile, 
but, then again, it might not take that long at all. We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an Oct. 19 complaint filed by Paul Hegness, an attorney 
representing Irvine Meadows Partners, the company was the lowest bidder and 
should have been recommended by the four-member panel, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 SMG asked, in its proposal for $125,000 a year, to operate the facility under 
a three-year contract. It also was asking for 25% in net profits. Irvine 
Meadows Partners, however, was not going to charge an annual fee to manage the 
facility. It was only asking for 25% of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But bidding is only part of the application process, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the panel considered experience and operational plans. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; A LESSON IN CITIZENSHIP, STRUGGLES OF 
IMMIGRANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Acacia Elementary School, who on Monday dressed as immigrants from 
different countries, found that becoming a U.S. citizen is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of scary coming into the United States," said 10-year-old Maureen 
Rowland, dressed in a kimono and sandals."It's hard to give up customs or 
accept new ones. Immigrants have it hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen and about 90 other fifth-graders and 11 fourth-graders enacted the 
arrival of millions of people at Ellis Island during the late 1890s and early 
1900s. Also, some of the students represented countries that had no U.S. 
immigration in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a job and a lot of relatives needed my help, so I came to America," 
said Janelle McGowan-Sylvan, 9, representing an immigrant from Trinidad and 
Tobago. "Now, I took the hard citizenship test and all the (health) tests so I 
can become a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's event was more than just a day to dress up and pretend, teachers 
said. It was part of a lesson on cultural diversity and U.S. history, teacher 
Becky D'Arrigo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student immigrants walked into classrooms made up to resemble Ellis Island 
and were given fake medical examinations while Neil Diamond's "Coming to 
America" blared in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 countries were represented by the students, and different ethnic 
foods were served. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's activities ended with a swearing in of the new citizens by the 
school's principal, Georgia Menges, who dressed the part of a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned so much about being an immigrant and all the suffering my parents 
went through to become citizens and how it was a long time ago," said Van Bui, 
10, whose parents emigrated from Vietnam. "Dressing up and acting was better 
than reading it in a book." MIMI KO

 A carload of gunmen opened fire while driving around a restaurant parking lot 
early Monday, and at least two persons were injured before the armed men were 
chased down and captured by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shots were still being fired from the car when a police cruiser arrived at 
Diamond Restaurant and Dancing in the 900 block of West Orangethorpe Avenue, 
said Sgt. Glenn Deveny. The suspects' car collided with the cruiser before the 
suspects led police on a short chase that ended nearby in Anaheim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people were taken into custody, and police recovered two 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistols believed used during the 12:17 a.m. incident. All were 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a firearm. One of the men was also booked 
on suspicion of receiving stolen property, because one of the guns had been 
reported stolen, Deveny said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those hurt was a restaurant manager who suffered minor injuries when he 
tried to break up a fight between two groups of men, Deveny said. A second 
victim was treated at Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana for cuts and puncture 
injuries that may have included a bullet wound, Deveny said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated shooting, a Fullerton man was wounded by gunfire Sunday 
afternoon when alleged gang members showed up at his house to claim a bicycle, 
Deveny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo E. Arias, 21, and two friends were in the garage of his home in the 
3100 block of Topaz Lane when a group of about 10 gang members arrived to claim 
a bicycle allegedly stolen the night before, Deveny said. A fight broke out and 
at least two shots were fired, he said. Arias suffered a superficial gunshot 
wound to the back of the head, Deveny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arias was treated and released from UCI Medical Center in Orange.KEN

 Police on Monday were probing the fatal stabbing of an Anaheim teen-ager 
during a fight in a parking lot Sunday on Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Alexander Young, 18, ran bleeding for a block before collapsing in front 
of a business, Police Lt. Jim Weuve said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had no suspects and it was not known what the fight was 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses said they saw the fight but not the stabbing, which took place 
about 5:30 p.m. at a business complex in the 6200 block, Weuve said. The 
attacker fled on foot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bystander called 911 and police officers found Young bleeding heavily. 
Paramedics provided treatment, but Young was pronounced dead at Los Alamitos

VILLA PARK TO JOIN 17 CITIES ON PROPOSED FIRE AUTHORITY; PANEL: THE LONE 
HOLDOUT AGREES TO MEMBERSHIP ON GOVERNING BOARD, EXPECTED TO BE LAUNCHED JAN. 
1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of threatening to go it alone, the City Council on Monday night 
voted 4 to 1 to join a new, countywide fire authority. 
</P>
<P>
 This little city thus became the last among those served by the Orange County 
Fire Department to accept the proposed Joint Powers Authority. The authority, 
which is expected to be launched Jan. 1, will be a new governing board for the 
county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Patchin cast the lone opposing vote. He said he wanted some 
changes in the fire authority, including removing Irvine as the lead agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The other council members, including Mayor Barry L. Denes, said they were 
satisfied with changes Villa Park had been able to obtain in the fire authority 
document. Denes noted that Villa Park had especially worked hard to get a cost 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have succeeded in our goal to limit our (cost) exposure," Denes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen cities, including Villa Park, will be the charter members of the 
proposed new governing board for the county Fire Department. The cities include 
Buena Park, Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Lake 
Forest, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Placentia, San Clemente, San 
Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, Stanton, Tustin and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 They had previously approved the Joint Powers Authority with virtually no 
controversy. But the issue became heated and contentious in Villa Park, mainly 
because most on the City Council contended that the authority's rules were 
originally poorly drafted and could lead to cost increases within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the City Council proposed that Villa Park explore contracting with 
the city of Orange's Fire Department rather than joining the new countywide 
authority. That proposal ignited a political controversy. Villa Park 
incorporated as a city 32 years ago to escape Orange's jurisdiction, and many 
longtime residents of Villa Park have said they do not want any connection to 
their neighboring city. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Denes has been negotiating with Irvine City Manager Paul O. 
Brady Jr., who is coordinating the cities' efforts to form the new fire 
authority. Denes told the City Council on Monday that a cost cap is now being 
written into the authority's agreement. Denes said the cap protects Villa Park 
and other cities, and he recommended that the council approve the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady on Monday said he was pleased all the cities have now ratified the JPA. 
He said the proposed pact will come before the county Board of Supervisors on 
Nov. 11.

IRS FINES ORANGE SCHOOLS $8,500 FOR FAILING TO SEND PROPER FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District had to pay the Internal Revenue Service 
$8,500 in fines after an audit revealed that the business office failed to send 
proper tax statements to consultants for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The item was on a list of bills the school board needed to approve at Thursday 
night's meeting.Trustee Robert H. Viviano asked school officials to explain the 
need for the check to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the district has not sent a particular form to consultants, 
acting Assistant Supt. Harvey M. Grimshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was assumed before that if someone said he was an independent contractor 
or a business person that he did not require a 1099 (form)," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The district learned otherwise after the IRS audited records with regard to 
independent contractors for 1990-92. Grimshaw noted that other school districts 
have been under the same scrutiny and that the audit was part of a "growing 
awareness" of the need to send the tax statements to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The district sent out 40 of the 1099 statements last year and 400 of them this 
year, Grimshaw said. "We are now in the process of cleaning up the situation," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimshaw said he was uncertain about 1993 statements, but that he did not 
believe the district would have further liability.

OFFICIALS IN ORANGE PLEDGE TO HELP UNIVERSITY ACQUIRE LAW SCHOOL SITE

 Chapman University officials said they may have to build their new law school 
outside the city unless they can buy a historic building owned by the Orange 
Unified School District. City Council members offered unanimous support for the 
law school at Tuesday's meeting and pledged to help the university acquire the 
district's old administration building on Glassell Street.They directed City 
Manager David F. Dixon to continue talks with the university and the school 
district to try to cement a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long term, we want a permanent law school built and built here in 
Orange," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Cheshire, Chapman's vice president for community relations, said the 
building is overwhelmingly the university's first choice because it is across 
the street from the main campus. But he noted that three other cities are 
trying to lure them. 
</P>
<P>
 The law school is scheduled to open in temporary quarters, probably outside of 
Orange, in September, 1995, Cheshire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We so much want the (permanent) law school to open in Orange," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The district building, which was built in 1914, is registered as a national 
historic site and Chapman would preserve the building's facade, Cheshire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange schools Supt. Robert L. French said the Board of Education hopes to 
make an announcement about the building in early November.

PROP. 187 CONTROVERSIES IN SCHOOLS HEAT UP; VAN NUYS HIGH: STUDENT ACTIVISTS 
SAY THEY OPPOSED FRIDAY'S WALKOUT AND ITS LACK OF ORGANIZATION. THEY WANT TO 
HOLD AN INFORMATIONAL MEETING ON CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While thousands of students walked out of schools last week to protest 
Proposition 187, Latino student activists at Van Nuys High School who had 
organized marches and a cable television campaign against the measure stayed on 
campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the school's MEChA chapter said Monday that they were disappointed 
in the behavior displayed by the Latino youth who protested Friday outside 
their campus and at the Van Nuys Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got pretty annoyed. It wasn't organized. It wasn't planned," said Jose 
Alberto Cardenas, a Mechista who watched through his classroom windows as 
hundreds of Latino students challenged rows of police officers just outside his 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people didn't realize how powerful this baiting by politicians . . . 
how much this has affected people," observed Charles Wilken, a Van Nuys teacher 
and Green Party candidate for the 38th State Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Penagos, 18, said that as one group of students marched past Van Nuys 
High, they asked him to join their protest. "You are the vice president of 
MEChA. You should come out here," Penagos said they demanded of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's right," Penagos said he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last several weeks, Van Nuys High School members of MEChA, a Chicano 
and Latino heritage organization for youth, had been busy organizing weekend 
marches and making anti-Proposition 187 commercials now being aired on cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 An open-forum discussion of both sides of Proposition 187, which would deny 
education and health services to illegal immigrants, was held at Van Nuys High 
last Wednesday as recommended by the Los Angeles Unified School district as a 
way to quell student unrest over the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really liked what we did on Wednesday. . . . People did listen," Penagos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of more mass student walkouts are flying about campus, said MEChA 
president Dennise Perez. She and other Mechistas plan to ask the school 
principal if they can sponsor a schoolwide demonstration at the campus 
Wednesday, rather than have students boycott school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of a walkout, we want to have a sit-out where we can have speakers 
come down here," Perez said. "We need more education." 
</P>
<P>
 The MEChA chapter at Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley also has criticized 
Friday's protest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was embarrassed by people," said Polytechnic MEChA president Gustavo 
Gonzalez. "A lot of people were out there for the wrong reasons. They were 
saying, 'Yeah. Let's walk out of school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Pelayo, a Polytechnic student and the coordinator of the Valleywide 
MEChA group, said that at his high school any MEChA member who walks out of 
school will be kicked out of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to make sure that no one is going to walk out," said Pelayo 
about the student walkouts expected to take place Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelayo will meet with MEChA leaders across the Valley tonight to discuss 
Friday's student unrest and plan other more constructive forms of protest.

LACK OF POLICE MODERNIZATION PLAN CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials studying the Los Angeles Police Department's shortage of modern 
crime-fighting tools criticized top police brass Monday for failing to develop 
a long-term plan for modernizing the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police administrators acknowledged the need for a modernization plan but said 
they are hesitant to propose it because such efforts have always been rejected 
in the past for lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, police 
used videotapes and charts to show how outmoded equipment and 
turn-of-the-century filing systems have hampered their ability to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the information superhighway, we are on a dirt road," said Sgt. Mike 
Moore, who testified about the need for modern radios and portable computers 
for beat officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the presentation, Councilman Marvin Braude, who chairs the 
panel, criticized police officials, saying he would fight to fund the 
department's modernization plan if only police would submit the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are we going to see what the plan is?" he asked police officials. "The 
problems are overwhelming. We need answers now." 
</P>
<P>
 Police agreed that a comprehensive plan was needed and vowed to work on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple fact of the matter is we don't have a comprehensive plan," said 
William F. Russell, commanding officer of the LAPD's support services bureau. 
"We have bits and pieces of plans that have been developed over the past 15 and 
20 years, but nothing has been brought forward to update all those plans, to 
bring them all together and to focus them as a long-term strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, a vocal supporter of the modernization effort, 
suggested that the city form a police task force, headed by a private 
consultant, to develop a modernization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Braude tabled the item for two weeks, saying he wanted to discuss the 
matter further with top LAPD brass. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, police said they have not proposed a modernization plan 
because they fear the City Council would simply reject it for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said a modified plan proposed about five years ago was killed because 
the city could not afford it and police fear the City Council will reject any 
other proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't made any efforts for the past five or six years," he said. "The 
money has simply not been available." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to Danny Staggs, head of the police union, has been 
that the City Council does not want to be put in the politically embarrassing 
position of rejecting a modernization plan for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to take responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staggs and Russell both agreed that the council is now more inclined to 
invest in the Police Department because of last year's election of pro-police 
Mayor Richard Riordan and four new council members, including Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she is also optimistic that a modernization plan will win support 
from the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we never looked at it before," she said after the meeting. 
"I wasn't here before, but we are working on it now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, police listed several examples of how outdated technology 
has slowed the department's crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, police played a videotape that showed that almost all crime 
records at the LAPD's Newton Division are kept on paper stuffed in filing 
cabinets, in binders and stacked up to three feet high on desks. Some desks 
were so cluttered that telephones ended up in waste baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 One homicide investigator said that he is often forced to use public pay 
phones at the scene of a crime to call for backup investigators because the 
department does not provide cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever tried to find a pay phone in South-Central?" asked Detective 
Dick Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also heard from business owners who are participating in the Mayor's 
Alliance for a Safer L.A., a private effort to raise $15 million to jump-start 
the LAPD's modernization effort. If successful, the effort will pay for a 
$10-million computer system with 1,700 workstations throughout the department.

 The Encino Chamber of Commerce will hold its second annual Community Service 
Awards luncheon Nov. 10 to thank eight individuals -- from police officers to 
letter carriers -- who perform often thankless jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their dedication and commitment is what makes this a great place to live and

honor them for everything they give us." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the honorees at this year's ceremony will be Frank Bush of the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually don't do building and safety, but this gentleman went above and 
beyond the call of duty after the (Northridge) earthquake," said Jan Sobel, 
chamber executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Others to be recognized at the luncheon are: Officer Sandy Cline and Detective 
Craig Rhudy of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division, Officer 
John Futrell and Senior Lead Officer Victor Monroe of the LAPD's West Valley 
Division, engineer Patrick Leddy and Firefighter/Lead Paramedic Dennis Archie 
of the Los Angeles Fire Department, and letter carrier Linda McGaha of the U. 
S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is welcome at the luncheon, to be held at 11:30 a.m. at the Braemar 
Country Club, 4001 Reseda Blvd., Tarzana. The cost is $15 for chamber members

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; VOLUNTEERS TO PLANT 1,000 ACORNS IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers will plant about 1,000 acorns Sunday at Malibu Creek State Park in 
a joint reforestation effort by the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation 
District and the Mountains Restoration Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 volunteers will participate in the planting, said Jo Kitz, a 
program director for the nonprofit, Malibu-based Mountain Restoration Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to see some trees come back in naturally, already," she said. 
"We'd like to give the area a jump start." 
</P>
<P>
 The acorns, she said, will be planted directly into the ground -- instead of 
planting them in containers to be transplanted later, a common practice. 
Planting acorns directly, she said, allows root systems to take hold early, 
increasing the likelihood that the tree will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers also will transplant several small oak trees that are being 
kept in one-gallon pots. 
</P>
<P>
 The planting, Kitz said, coincides with California Oak Day, a day set aside to 
honor the state's oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation officials have noticed that oak trees all over the state are 
having difficulty reproducing, said Rosie Dagit, a conservation biologist for 
the conservation district. No one is sure why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that in this part of the state the biggest reason is soil 
compaction and the introduction of non-native grasses when the Spanish came to 
California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory, she said, holds that nature's reseeding process -- through 
bird droppings, for example -- could have been hampered for some reason. More 
recently, drought might have stymied the reproduction process of acorns. 
</P>
<P>
 A planting last year at the park was largely unsuccessful because there was 
little rain, Kitz said. Most of the acorns did not sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this year, there has been more rain, so we would hope to have a survival 
rate of 90%," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a special program, people can have oak trees planted in their name for 
$25 to $200 at the Malibu Creek State Park, she said. Anyone who donates $200 
will get their names inscribed on a plaque that will be housed in the park's 
visitor center. Those seeking information should call (310) 456-5625. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; BASIC TRAINING ENDS FOR DISASTER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake Village's first-ever disaster response team is one step closer to 
reality, now that about 35 volunteers have completed basic training in disaster 
preparedness, city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city's emergency preparedness and disaster response committee 
will meet Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the council chambers at City Hall, 4373 Park 
Terrace Drive, said Mike Mathews, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is modeled after the Agoura Hills Disaster Response Team, which 
helped train the Westlake Village volunteers, Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Village volunteers are "a very dedicated and enthusiastic group," 
said Scott Brewer, director of the 6-year-old Agoura Hills team. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic training consisted of six classes spread out over six weeks, Brewer 
said. Topics were earthquake preparedness, first aid and basic life-saving 
techniques, hazardous materials safety, urban search-and-rescue techniques and 
fire safety and suppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of fires last year and the Northridge earthquake this year, Brewer 
said, many residents now want to learn how to prepare for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 On the agenda for Wednesday's meeting in Westlake Village will be the status 
of a disaster response handbook put together by the committee, Mathews said.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee will also discuss its ongoing work on a disaster response plan, 
Mathews said. Under California law, each city must write its own plan that 
complies with state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 City staffers have been doing much of the writing of the roughly 350-page 
document, Mathews said. Citizen input also has been sought throughout, he said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; STUDENTS HELP REPLANT OAKS AT AHMANSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Zajdman was stooped over, her forehead crinkled in concentration, 
her fingers moving deftly as she busied herself at her task. 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of 55 sixth-graders from Medea Creek Middle School in Oak Park who 
planted oak trees at Ahmanson Ranch last week as part of a program to replace 
trees cut down to make way for a more than 3,000-home development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing this for the community," Jacqueline said. "We want to keep it 
beautiful here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to plant trees to give animals shelter, and also, to give us more 
moisture and rain out here," said another student, Adam Bushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who are studying plants, benefit by getting hands-on experience, 
said one of their teachers, Nancy Kollander. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been studying plants all quarter, and this is an excellent tie-in," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids gathered acorns at one end of the property and brought them back to a 
nursery behind the office of Ahmanson Ranch in the southeast corner of Ventura 
County. There, they planted the acorns in small containers where they will be 
kept until they mature. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a year, the young oaks will be transplanted into larger containers, 
where they will be kept for two more years, said Gil Nielsen, senior vice 
president of Ahmanson Land Co., the housing project's developer. The plants 
from those containers will then be planted on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Boy Scouts planted about 2,000 acorns, according to Ahmanson Land 
officials. Those trees, which are still in containers, are now about 
five-feet-tall and are ready to be transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land officials eventually want to plant 4,000 trees, as part of a 
development agreement in which they must plant five trees for every tree they 
destroy to build the development, said Donald Brackenbush, company president. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near the 
Ventura County-Los Angeles County border. Many area residents oppose the 
project and several lawsuits have been filed to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
 In an environmental review of the project, it was estimated that 1,300 oak 
trees would have to be cut down, Brackenbush said. The company has altered its 
project and reduced the number to 700, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting trees to replace trees destroyed by the project is a good idea, said 
Jacqueline, who added, "But they are going to cut down these hills, and it's 
not going to be beautiful here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But classmate Ryan Poyer said he is not sure if the planting was worth the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take 100 years for (the acorns) to get as big as" the large, 
established oaks in the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaks trees in general seem to be having a difficult time regenerating in the 
area, said Rosi Dagit, conservation biologist for the Topanga-Las Virgenes 
Resource Conservation district. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts aren't sure why, she said, but overgrazing could play a factor. It 
could also be, she said, that the natural reseeding process -- through bird 
droppings, for example -- has been stymied, for some reason.  
</P>
<P>
 The recent drought, too, may have hampered acorn reproduction and air 
pollution could also play a role, Dagit said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MAN ACCUSED OF SETTING CAR ABLAZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police believe a Glendale man who accused his neighbor of stealing a parking 
space from him retaliated Thursday by setting the neighbor's car on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, police say, implicated himself by using junk mail imprinted with 
his home address as the torch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Hernandez, 20, was arrested at his apartment in the 1500 block of Dixon 
Street about 5:50 a.m. Oct. 27, just a few hours after firefighters were 
summoned to extinguish a burning 1988 Hyundai Excel about a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the car, Megerdich Panosian, 58, at first told police he had no 
idea who might have set the vehicle ablaze. But when asked if he had gotten 
into any fights or arguments recently, the man recalled arguing with Hernandez 
over a parking space in the neighborhood about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rear window of the car had been smashed, and burning rags and papers were 
found inside the car and in the street. Among them were several circulars that 
had been mailed to Hernandez's address, police said. 
</P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; GOLF COURSE DENIED CONDITIONAL PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city zoning official has denied the Studio City Golf Course a conditional 
use permit, noting that while he feels the operation is a welcome swath of 
green in the otherwise urban area, he has no choice but to deny the request 
until legal questions surrounding the course's lease agreement are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to approve the permit," said Assistant Los Angeles Zoning 
Administrator Horace Tramel. "Partially on the advice of the city attorney, I 
denied the request." 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in the lease between Studio City Golf and Tennis and the Weddington 
Investment Partnership -- which owns the 17-acre site -- has become the 
sticking point in the struggle over the land. 
</P>
<P>
 First signed in 1958, the 50-year lease states that it will become null and 
void if the course does not have a conditional use permit. The course's permit 
expired in 1985, and operators failed to seek a new one.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Weddington partners learned just this spring that the permit had 
expired, they sought to evict the golf course and sell or lease the land at a 
higher rate. Under the original lease, the course pays the Weddington partners 
just $1,000 a month for the prime piece of real estate, a deal partner Guy 
Weddington McCreary has called "miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the parties have met on at least one occasion to try to renegotiate the 
lease, both sides said Monday a settlement appears unlikely, and that who 
controls the land will probably be decided by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not optimistic that the parties can reach a new lease agreement," said 
attorney Larry Iser of Century City, who represents the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary said there are no longer plans to develop the site, and if the 
partnership prevails in court, another golf course operator would probably be 
brought in, although a new lease could still be offered to Studio City Golf and 
Tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held Nov. 10, in which the golf course will ask the judge to 
rule in its favor without a trial, Iser said. The trial is scheduled Nov. 15.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT PANEL BACKS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport Authority voted unanimously Monday to certify an updated 
environmental study concluding that quadrupling the size of the airport 
terminal will not result in any significant noise impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials were under orders to redo the project's environmental impact 
report after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge determined the potential for 
noise, traffic and air pollution had not been properly studied. 
</P>
<P>
 But the updated study, released in June, came to the same primary conclusion 
as the first report: The number of passengers using the airport will be the 
same, regardless of whether a new terminal is built. Thus, any increase in 
aircraft traffic will occur with or without the project. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding angered residents living under the airport's flight paths, who 
argued that a larger terminal with double the number of flights will invariably 
increase noise. They support the idea of a new terminal, but do not want to see 
it much larger than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert H. O'Brien is scheduled to hear the case again on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the authority's nine commissioners, Robert Garcin, was absent from 
Monday's meeting. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CHILD CLINIC OFFERS LATE-NIGHT SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 10 p.m. and the kids feel feverish. They're turning a sickly shade of 
green. You suspect food poisoning from those unsavory ballpark hot dogs they 
chowed down on at the game.What do you do?  
</P>
<P>
 Take them to the new Pediatric After-Hours Referral Clinic in Burbank. There, 
board-certified pediatricians from St. Joseph Medical Center and Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles have formed a unique cooperative network to provide 
full-service after-hours pediatric care.  
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is located on the first floor of the Robertson Tower at St. Joseph 
Medical Center, 501 S. Buena Vista St., Burbank. The clinic, which opened last 
Monday, has treated a steady stream of ill children already, said Stephanie 
Dean, a spokeswoman for the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 The program operates Mondays through Fridays from 6 p.m. to midnight. On 
weekends and holidays the center is open from 10 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is designed for routine pediatric care only, and patients must be 
referred there by a pediatrician, family physician or emergency room physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an emergency clinic -- you can't take your kids there to get 
stitches, for instance," Dean said. "It's designed to assist working parents 
who might not have the chance to bring their child to the doctor during the 
day."  
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is staffed at all times by at least one physician and a nurse. An 
after-hours phone call to the clinic will enable parents to preregister for an 
appointment. After the child is seen, a record of the visit is sent to the 
child's physician. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to register for an appointment, call (818) 840-7902.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; RETIRED MATH TEACHER HONORED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take 14 years of teaching mathematics at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched 
Studies. Add 22 years more experience in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District.Multiply with a devotion to learning and teaching the newest 
developments in mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 That equals this year's winner of the George Polya Memorial Award of the 
California Mathematics Council, an organization made up of 15,000 math 
instructors that annually recognizes one California educator who has shown 
excellence in teaching mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's award was given to Marian Pasternack, who retired last year from 
the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's recognition by your peers and that's the best recognition there is," 
said Pasternack, a Chatsworth resident. Although she is not teaching anymore, 
she is still involved in working with math teachers and attending conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at her career, Pasternack said she recalls most fondly the 
advances made in mathematics education in the late 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Those advances allowed students "to really learn from the materials rather 
than from someone telling them, but that all sort of died out," Pasternack 
said. "But it's coming in again and students are discovering for themselves 
again."  
</P>
<P>
 Between 1972 and 1975, Pasternack took part in an experimental educational 
project at Devonshire Elementary School. "Students had a great deal of choice 
in what they did during the day," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasternack said many teachers at the school were not in favor of the project 
because the students refused to walk in a line and were too noisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the math-related projects she looks forward to is helping at the schools 
her two granddaughters will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasternack boasted that her younger granddaughter, who is 1 1/2, when asked if 
she can count to a million, will reply, "Yes." MAKI BECKER

ELECTION '94; 43RD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Schwada 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale), 37, was first elected to the Assembly in 
May, 1994. A former Municipal Court judge, Rogan is married and has two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challenger Adam Schiff, 34, a Burbank resident is a former 
assistant U.S. Attorney. He is single. 
</P>
<P>
 This race will be a big test for Rogan and the Glendale-based conservative 
Republicans who have long controlled the 43rd District. In May, Rogan won a 
special election to fill the seat left vacant after Pat Nolan, the area 
representative since 1978, pleaded guilty to a political corruption charge and 
went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43rd District has lately shown signs of slipping from its old GOP moorings 
in part because a 1992 reapportionment plan pulled Silver Lake and parts of 
Hollywood into it.  
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a law enforcement background, Schiff has portrayed himself as a 
moderate Democrat while calling Rogan a captive of the Christian 
fundamentalists who have given his campaign more than $55,000. Rogan recently 
helped add to this picture by declaring he supported teaching creation theory 
in the public schools, albeit alongside evolutionary theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan has bristled at Schiff's charge that his Christian fundamentalist 
supporters would use the machinery of government to advance their religious 
aims. Schiff's real concerns here having nothing to do with separation of 
church and state, Rogan has charged. Rather, he has said, they stem from a 
liberal's fear that his own secular views, long dominant in the political 
culture, are being challenged by Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former Democratic Party activist who became a highly publicized GOP 
convert in 1988 (then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson welcomed him into the party), 
campaigns as a tax-fighter and defender of Proposition 13. He also supports 
Proposition 187, the measure to deny benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff opposes the controversial Prop. 187 and has disputed Rogan's claim to 
fiscal conservativism by noting that the incumbent has agreed to accept a pay 
hike approved for legislators by a citizens panel. 
</P>
<P>
 District registration is 45% Democratic, 41% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian Willard Michlin, a real estate broker from 
Hollywood. John Schwada

MOST OF QUAKED-BATTERED LAUREL PLAZA MALL TO BE DEMOLISHED; NORTH HOLLYWOOD: 
ONLY ROBINSONS-MAY WILL BE SPARED. THE NEWS COMES AS A BLOW TO MANY OF THE 
SHOPPING CENTER'S 33 MERCHANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly all of the earthquake-battered Laurel Plaza shopping mall in North 
Hollywood will be demolished, the shopping center's attorney said Monday, 
putting an end to hopes that the 26-year-old mall owned by Forest City 
Enterprises would be refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the intention of Forest City to have the portions of the mall other 
than May Company-Robinsons torn down," said Tom Leanse, attorney for the local 
subsidiary of the Cleveland-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients have no present intention of building an expanded shopping center 
at that location." 
</P>
<P>
 The news comes as a blow to many of the mall's 33 merchants, including the Ice 
Chalet skating rink, which had reopened Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've probably got 1,000 people who will picket and fight this tooth and 
nail," said Mike Robertson, manager of the rink that opened in 1968. Customers 
started calling over the weekend, he said, worried about Ice Chalet's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had very little damage and that's what is frustrating to us," he said. 
Only about 200 to 300 ceiling tiles fell onto the ice and were cleaned up, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink reopened, he said, with improvements such as an expanded boutique and 
a new snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the popularity of the skating rink is not reason enough to refurbish the 
mall, according to Leanse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leases for the other tenants expire on January 31," he said, "and those 
tenants are not satisfied with the volume of traffic they are receiving at 
their present location." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the Robinsons-May department store and the skating rink, an art 
shop and a travel agency are the only businesses that have reopened at the mall 
since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility remains that Forest City will eventually build a new mall on 
the site. For several years before the earthquake it had sought city permits 
and other rights to expand and modernize the mall. The Los Angeles City Council 
was expected to make a final decision on the plans, which included space for 
three department stores and 5,400 parking spaces, sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanse said that if the city does approve all the permits, the developer may 
choose to use those entitlements to create a new mall with new tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between many of the mall's pre-earthquake merchants and the 
management company has been strained over the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanse said that few merchants responded to requests that they meet with 
company officials individually to discuss the situation. But Joel Greenberg, 
the owner of a Laurel Plaza photography studio that has since moved to Eagle 
Rock, said the tenants strived for months following the earthquake to get the 
attention of mall management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many tenants, myself included, made efforts to discuss lease renewals with 
Forest City's leasing department back in May and June," said Greenberg. "Why 
weren't they communicating with us five months ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants said they were not surprised at the mall management's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't unexpected," said Vicky Goldstein, manager of Claire's Boutique, 
who has been unable to get into her store since the temblor. "We kind of 
figured it would happen after nine months of being closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said she is worried about getting her merchandise out before the 
mall is leveled, but Leanse said tenants have had the option to retrieve their 
merchandise for months, as long as they sign an agreement relieving the mall of 
liability from the risks of entering the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ice Chalet, Robertson was urging his steady customers to somehow 
persuade the management company to let the rink continue in operation. When his 
customers ask about the fate of the rink, he tells them: "We're planning on 
being here permanently."

YOUTH, 17, DIES AFTER BEING SHOT IN DRIVE-BY ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy died from gunshot wounds Monday after he was hit during a 
drive-by shooting, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Valdez, who was apparently shot several times while making a telephone 
call, was pronounced dead at Holy Cross Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Valdez was using a public phone in the 7400 block of Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard about 10:55 p.m. Sunday when he was struck by gunshots fired 
from a brown American-made car, said Detective Charles Uribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no provocation, no warning," Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that Valdez was either a gang member or was friendly with the 
gang that controls the area where he was gunned down, Uribe said. Detectives 
believe he was shot by members of a rival gang. The murder weapon was a 
large-caliber handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About three weeks ago, Valdez was transferred from North Hollywood High School 
to John Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley because of academic and 
discipline problems, said North Hollywood Assistant Principal Dave Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Valdez transferred from Poly to North Hollywood High due to similar 
problems, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Smith said, "None of the problems he had here were gang-related. It's a 
shame; it's very sobering."

VALLEY INTERVIEW; OPERATIONS WIND DOWN IN DISASTER THAT WAS THE BIG ONE FOR SBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the nation's costliest disaster struck Los Angeles in the early hours of 
Jan. 17, it has created a workload of unprecedented proportions for federal and 
local disaster officials. The U.S. Small Business Administration faced the task 
of screening the loan applications of hundreds of thousands of earthquake 
victims to decide who would get money to rebuild homes, businesses and 
apartment buildings. The agency's disaster assistance program is headed by 
Bernard (Berky) Kulik, an administrator whose job requires him always to have a 
packed suitcase nearby so he can head out to the latest national disaster at a 
moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When did you start your operation here?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: In February. The numbers here are incredible. When we started out on 
this disaster, we had just slightly under 900 people, and that was a high 
number (to have in this location) because the Midwest floods were just winding 
down. By March we were at 3,000 employees. We peaked at 3,300 in March or April 
working on the Northridge disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When do you plan on winding down?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are already winding down, but the applications are still coming in. The 
backlog, to all intents and purposes, has been wiped out. We have been able to 
process 98% of the applications we have in house. The less than 2% remaining 
are the ones that are coming in now. So we are back on our original time goal 
of seven to 20 days of processing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: To what do you attribute the number of applications still coming in?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What is happening now is we are getting people who started out saying, "I'm 
not going to bother with an SBA loan. I can handle this myself." Then when they 
really get around to doing it, they start tearing out the walls and look behind 
and it turns out it's a lot bigger job than they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 You've also had rain. So, all of a sudden people are saying, "Where is the 
water coming from?" It turns out the roof is leaking. 
</P>
<P>
 That, I think, is why we are getting a lot of applications now. Also, the 
insurance settlements are coming in, and people are realizing what the 
shortfall is. Plus, the announced deadline is coming up on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When do applicants start seeing money?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The money can start going out immediately, but we do not give full checks. 
If I give you a loan for $100,000, I do not give you a check for $100,000. For 
one thing, there is a little-known provision of the law that makes you liable 
to the federal government for 1 1/2 times the amount of the original loan if 
you use the funds some way other than specified. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you say, "Hey great, I've got $100,000, I need a new car," 
zap, you are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what we do is we give you the money out serially. We will give you an 
amount up front, usually $10,000 until the collateral is worked out. After that 
we'll give you another $25,000. Show us how you use that $25,000 and we'll give 
you more. If you have a construction contract, give us the contract, and if it 
calls for payment on some schedule, we'll meet that schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did this particular disaster prompt SBA to change the way it does its job?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Let me put it this way: This was a mega disaster. We've never had one this 
big before. In the last four years we've had a hell of a lot of disasters 
around the country. You start off with Hurricane Hugo that hit the islands of 
the Carolinas. You had the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco. You had the 
Los Angeles civil disorders. You had Hurricane Andrew in southern Florida and 
Louisiana. You had Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii. And you had the nine-state 
Midwest floods last year. This single disaster was bigger than all of them 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of getting involved in this disaster, we have taken a number of 
steps to make it simpler to apply for loans. We reduced the definition of major 
source of employment so more businesses can qualify. We doubled the cap for 
loans to individuals, from $100,000 to $200,000. We made landlords eligible for 
economic injuries for the first time. We loosened up on our affiliation rules 
within the limited partnership area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Midwest floods last year, we completely redid our business 
loan applications. Congress also tripled our lending cap to small businesses, 
so instead of $500,000 we can now loan up to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There have been many complaints from business owners and others that the 
SBA has not been flexible enough, that the loan program is a one-size-fits-all 
effort. What is your response?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We get that all the time. The trouble is that the same people who now 
complain that we're too tough at making our loans, that we should have a higher 
approval rate, are the same people who three years from now are going to ask, 
"Why is your loss rate so high?" 
</P>
<P>
 We play a balancing act. We are aware of the need for speed and compassion, 
but we are talking about taxpayer money. These are loans, and we do try to get 
them back. I'll tell you, we are more liberal than any other lending 
institution anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, we are lenders, and this is taxpayer money even though it's going 
out to disaster victims and it's subsidized funds. In fact, because it's 
subsidized funds, every dollar we lend out adds to the federal deficit. If I 
lend it out here at 3 5/8% and the federal government is paying 7% for the 
money, right away that adds to the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The SBA made applications for landlords in the ghost towns a top priority 
for processing but offered no special loan rates. Why?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The ghost towns, so far as we are concerned, are the same as any other 
business or any other home. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is we can't require you to take a loan. If you have some people 
who say they would rather walk away, unfortunately California probably has the 
most liberal mortgage walk-away laws in the country. Some people say, "The hell 
with it. I'm so far in debt now, if I rebuild this place I've got to borrow 
more money and put myself more in debt. It's easier for me to just walk away 
from my equity." I can't tell those people that they are wrong. I can't tell 
those people that I wouldn't do the same in their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you dealing with fraud attempts?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Unfortunately, wherever there is money, there is fraud. We are very much 
aware of it, and we have been working very closely with the inspector general 
on fraud cases. We encourage the inspector general to immediately move in and 
catch as many fraud cases as possible and make a splash with it and get the 
media interested in it, because that is how you are going to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 When a disaster hits, everybody on a block talks to each other and then you 
get people saying, "Listen, I've got these 14 checks. Why don't you do what I 
did?" Well, if we can indict that guy, the guy who is guilty of fraud and is 
now spreading the word, that stops it right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you do about it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We have a number of safeguards. For example, we pull a credit check by name 
and Social Security number for every applicant. We don't take your statement as 
to what your damage was. We do our own independent verification. We require tax 
returns. In other words, don't tell me how much you make, show me your returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In this disaster, for the first time we tell people they don't have to give us 
a tax return. All they have to do is sign a release, and we will get the 
information from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any ideas being floated for making it easier on future disaster 
victims?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Right now Congress is very seriously discussing the concept of catastrophic 
insurance. As a concept, I have to tell you that we are very much in favor of 
it. The fact is, it would be a whole lot easier if victims could rely on 
insurance for their homes. I mean, let's face it, when people buy a home, they 
buy to the limit of their credit, particularly in an area of high-priced real 
estate like Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 If two or three years after buying a home you get hit by a disaster and we 
come along and say, "We'll give you a 30-year loan at 3 5/8%," the fact is, 
it's still a loan. If you are living up to your limit, we can't even offer it, 
because you can't repay it. So if there was some form of catastrophic 
insurance, a lot of people would be better off.

POLICE LOOK OVERSEAS FOR CLUES IN GLENDALE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While Glendale police are working with law enforcement agencies overseas to 
reconstruct the events leading up to the Oct. 5 murder of a local travel agent, 
an attorney for one of the suspects in the case says police should instead be 
searching for a professional assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Benita Mikailian was killed by two clients who operated a 
service specializing in travel arrangements between Armenia and Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 While Mikailian was working after-hours at her office, authorities say they 
believe Garen Zakarian, 30, and his sister Anait, 22, shot her to death and 
stole vouchers for about 80 one-way airline tickets from Paris to Los Angeles, 
worth about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The indications are that there was a transaction taking place between 
(Mikailian) and the two defendants," said Glendale Police Lt. Ray Edey. "It 
appears the defendants were without the resources to pay for what they had 
ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zakarian siblings operated Econo Trans Travel, 1220 S. Central Ave., and 
also had an affiliated office in Yerevan, Armenia, that recently closed, Edey 
said. The company arranged charter flights from Yerevan to Los Angeles, 
purchasing plane tickets in bulk from other travel agents. Edey said Glendale 
police are consulting authorities overseas to learn more about the Zakarians' 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of the murder, police also are investigating whether the 
pair may have been involved in previous crimes, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants have both been connected through physical evidence to the 
murder weapon, and all indications are that both were present during the 
commission of the crime itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer used a medium-caliber, semiautomatic pistol equipped with a 
silencer, Edey said. "You can call that a European- or Middle-Eastern-style 
professional hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikailian's body was discovered the morning of Oct. 7 inside her agency, 
Benita's Travel Town, 1110 N. Brand Blvd. Garen Zakarian was arrested that day 
at the Glendale home he shares with his wife and sister. Anait Zakarian was 
arrested Oct. 11 during a traffic stop in Glendale, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident who lives near Mountain Street and Maryland Avenue, just one block 
away from the victim's office, found a bag containing two guns Oct. 8 on his 
property. Police said they recovered a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol, which 
is believed to be the murder weapon, and a .45-caliber semiautomatic assault 
rifle that had been modified to be fully automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Guleserian, an attorney representing Garen Zakarian, said his client 
is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be way out of character for him to do something like this," 
Guleserian said. "The police theory is that he was under tremendous financial 
strain and he flipped out and went and got a gun and killed her, but that's not 
consistent with this case."  
</P>
<P>
 Guleserian said his client went to Mikailian's office on the day of the 
killing to pick up the airline tickets he had ordered. But because he did not 
have enough money to pay for the tickets, Mikailian gave him only the ticket 
vouchers, agreeing to give him the tickets when the bill was paid later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Mikailian and his client had a long business history and this 
transaction was not unusual. The type of weapons discovered in the case "smack 
of a professional hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edey said the investigation is continuing and police have not ruled out the 
possibility of more suspects in the case, although they are not actively 
searching for another person. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and robbery and 
are being held without bail. A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled 
Nov. 17 in Pasadena Superior Court.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAKING IT LEGAL; DRIVE-THROUGH NEWLYWEDS GET 
COURT OK TO FORGET PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated trying to end her last marriage, a Santa Clarita woman went ahead 
and married her boyfriend late Friday at a Las Vegas drive-in wedding chapel 
before her divorce was final. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of honeymoon bliss, the couple spent the weekend worrying whether they 
were bigamists. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, a judge said Monday. "We'll take care of it," Supervising Judge 
Judith Ashmann of the North Valley District of Superior Court said during a 
call to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmann signed papers Monday that dated the woman's legal divorce as of last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had realized this before we went to Las Vegas," said the bride, 
Laura Molidor, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new husband, James Linder, 34, agreed, saying there had been "a cloud 
hanging over us" until they learned of the judge's action Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the couple said, they can enjoy their long-scheduled reception for 75 
friends and family this weekend, before moving to their new home in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Molidor said that she was assured by her attorney in early September that her 
uncontested divorce would become final in four to six weeks. But last week, as 
her husband-to-be moved from Texas to join her here, her attorney's office told 
her the courts were slow in processing the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, her divorce papers filed on Sept. 26 were rejected because they were 
completed incorrectly, according to John O'Brien, court clerk. The papers were 
resubmitted Oct. 19 by the office of her attorney, James Reape of Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Molidor, who separated from her first husband four years ago, said her 
attorney did not tell her that the papers had to be resubmitted. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the attorney said that Reape declined to comment unless he 
had permission from his client, who was in transit in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Molidor said earlier that she and her new husband were going to her old 
husband's house in Palmdale on Monday so she could accompany their two children 
trick-or-treating on Halloween night. Linder planned to watch football on 
television with Molidor's first husband. 
</P>
<P>
 And about that drive-in wedding chapel: They exchanged vows while sitting in 
their car for the 10-minute ceremony Friday night as the minister leaned out 
the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sure they were going to hand out French fries and a Coke along with the 
marriage license," said Molidor.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN LANCASTER ROBBERIES; 
CRIME: HOME-INVASION INCIDENTS WERE CONDUCTED BY GUNMEN IN SKI MASKS WHO 
SOMETIMES TIED UP RESIDENTS. AUTHORITIES SAY OTHERS MAY BE INVOLVED.

<P>
 Three men and a juvenile male have been arrested in connection with a recent 
string of violent home-invasion robberies in Lancaster, sheriff's deputies said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, all from Bakersfield, are in custody as suspects in nighttime 
robberies committed by assailants wearing ski masks who forced their way into 
residences to take money, jewelry and other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers carried handguns and in some cases assaulted and tied up 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A major break in the case occurred Friday afternoon when Bakersfield police 
spotted a 1986 Pontiac Trans Am that had been reported stolen during one of the 
robberies last week on Crestwood Court in Lancaster, said Lt. Tom Pigott, 
investigations supervisor at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield police arrested the driver, Delwin Maynor, 19, and notified 
deputies in Lancaster, who took him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigott declined to say how deputies obtained the names of the other three 
suspects, but deputies began looking for them over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang unit deputies spotted the three Saturday night driving near 6th Street 
East and Avenue H-14 in Lancaster, Pigott said. The driver, Paul Evans, 27, was 
arrested as the vehicle stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 His two passengers -- Ronnie Watkins, 20, and a 17-year-old boy -- were 
arrested after a short pursuit on foot, Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reason to believe one or all of these suspects are involved in all 
three of the recent home-invasion robberies," he said. He added that the 
investigation was continuing and additional arrests may take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynor, Evans and Watkins were being held Monday in the jail at Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station in lieu of $100,000 bail each. The juvenile, whose 
name was not released, was taken to Challenger Youth Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the arrests, Pigott recommended that residents continue to exercise 
caution when someone knocks at the door, particularly at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Home-invasion robberies -- as opposed to burglaries that occur when no one is 
at home -- have been rare in the Antelope Valley, but Pigott said the recent 
incidents indicate that might be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should always be alert to this type of crime because it is gaining in 
popularity," he said.

ELECTION '94; 25TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Schwada 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), 53, is seeking second term 
in congress. McKeon, who co-owns a chain of western wear stores, is married and 
has six children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challenger James Gilmartin, 60, is an attorney who is running for a 
second time against McKeon. Gilmartin is married and has six children. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, a member of one of Santa Clarita Valley's leading families, got off to 
a quick start in Congress by getting himself elected president of the House's 
51-member GOP freshman class. The position, he has insisted, has given him a 
rare opportunity to promote his plans to reform the systems of seniority and 
secrecy that rule Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-key, affable McKeon enjoys good working ties with Democrats even while 
remaining a rock-solid Republican with votes against the budget deficit 
reduction plan, the crime bill and most other Clinton administration 
initiatives, including ones on family leave and to drop barriers to gays in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon opposed restricting private ownership of military-style assault weapons 
(the crime bill banned many of these guns), saying that as a Mormon he recalled 
that Mormons were denied the right to bear arms in Missouri, then chased from 
that state in the mid-19th century by gun-toting locals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was McKeon's vote to support the North American Free Trade Agreement 
that caused a flap back home, because it appeared to be a reversal of a 
campaign pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin has accused McKeon, who has run as an experienced and trustworthy 
businessman, of being part of a reckless management team at the local Valencia 
National Bank that made sizeable insider loans to members of the bank's own 
board that later became delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Gilmartin's critique is lifted from allegations made in a lawsuit 
filed by a former president of the bank. That lawsuit did not name McKeon as a 
defendant. McKeon, who has denied any wrongdoing in the matter, borrowed more 
than $1 million from the bank. His staff has claimed that he was never 
delinquent with his repayments. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in this district is 48% Republican, 38% Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot is Libertarian Devin Cutler of Canoga Park. John Schwada

ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION HEARING SET; UTILITIES: ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS GET A 
CHANCE TO HEAR ABOUT A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL TO GIVE CUSTOMERS OPTION TO SHOP 
FOR THEIR ENERGY SUPPLIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County residents will have an opportunity Wednesday to learn firsthand 
about a controversial proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission to 
deregulate the state's electric industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would allow consumers to select their own electricity suppliers in 
the same way they now choose their providers of long-distance phone service. 
The issue will be discussed at a public hearing scheduled by the commission at 
7 p.m. Wednesday at the Garden Grove Community Center, 11300 Stanford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has changed to the point where the commission believes it has to 
change its regulation," said Dianne Dienstein, a commission spokeswoman. 
"Electric rates in California are too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agency's proposal, all industrial, agricultural, commercial and 
residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, 
Southern California Edison, Sierra Pacific and Pacific Power and Light would be 
able to purchase electricity directly from any supplier, based on competitive 
prices and services tailored to their needs. They would also have the option of 
staying with their local utility company, which under the proposal would have 
its rates regulated by the utility commission according to performance, 
efficiency and rate of inflation rather than costs, as now is the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest industrial customers, according to the proposal, would have 
"direct access" to electricity suppliers beginning in 1996, with all other 
commercial customers following in 1999. By 2002, the proposal suggests, all 
consumers -- including residential customers -- would have the ability to 
choose their own electricity suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 California's electric utilities have expressed hope that any dramatic changes 
by the state be well thought out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep reminding ourselves that what comes out of this proceeding 
will have a far-reaching effect on people, businesses and communities 
throughout California," John E. Bryson, chairman and chief executive of 
Southern California Edison Co., said at a public hearing held earlier this year 
on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 PUC officials say the proposed restructuring would lower electric rates 
significantly through competition, create jobs and improve California's 
economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists and advocates for low-income customers, however, oppose 
the proposal as vague, environmentally unsound and economically unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all for competition," said Lori Jablonski, a spokeswoman for the Center 
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, an independent nonprofit 
advocacy group that is spearheading opposition to the proposal. "But we don't 
think the plan as written will be good for California." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, she said, her group opposes the proposal on at least four 
counts: 
</P>
<P>
 * That it would "re-establish a direct link" between utility profits and 
electricity sales, "thereby removing any incentives for energy-efficient 
investments and conservation." 
</P>
<P>
 * That customers would be tempted to look elsewhere for cheaper sources of 
electricity, such as coal production in Wyoming or Utah. "You would have coal 
power in Utah providing electricity for California customers," Jablonski said. 
"In other words, we'll dirty the sky in Utah for cheap electricity in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 * That huge industrial customers will "lock up" good electricity deals in the 
first several years, during which individual residential consumers will be left 
to suffer increased costs caused by the larger customers' retreat from 
regulated fixed-cost providers. 
</P>
<P>
 * That the increased emphasis on lowest prices in the short term would 
encourage utility companies to eliminate special programs to assist low-income 
people who otherwise couldn't afford service. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those issues are likely to be explored during a series of public 
hearings that began this week and are scheduled through Nov. 10. In addition to 
Garden Grove, hearings have been held or are scheduled in Bakersfield, Ventura, 
Carson, San Bernardino and Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is seriously considering all the alternative proposals as well 
as the comments the public is making," Dienstein said. While the commissioners 
had originally hoped to reach a decision this year, she said, the complexity of 
the issue now makes action unlikely until early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge to the commission," Dienstein said, "is to see whether this is 
a good idea or whether it requires any modification."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: VIRGIN INTERACTIVE TO BUY COMPANY'S GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive Entertainment, a video game and entertainment software 
company based in Orange County, said Monday that it has agreed to buy 
multimedia computer games from a financially troubled Northern California 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of Virgin's acquisition of the software titles division of Media Vision 
of Fremont were not disclosed, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Virgin will obtain several popular games for 
CD-ROM-equipped personal computers, including the popular "Critical Path" 
futuristic adventure. The games combine motion pictures and animation. It also 
will get several games under development. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allows Media Vision, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, to 
concentrate on making sound cards and other hardware for computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin in Irvine is a division of Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. of Los 
Angeles, which closed Monday at $12 a share, up 12 cents, in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. Media Vision closed at 22 cents a share, up 9 cents in 
trading on the Nasdaq.

 Westminster Mall, in a news release dated Monday, quotes economists as 
predicting a "prosperous Christmas for Orange County retailers." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Westminster Mall, an economist with KeyCorp, an Albany, 
N.Y.-based banking company, predicts that Orange County consumers will spend 
between 7% and 10% more than they did during last year's holiday season.  
</P>
<P>
 What will that buy? Westminster Mall's marketing director, Stephanie Greene, 
is betting that consumers will be buying luxury personal items, large-screen 
televisions, toys and high-tech electronics products.

 Privately held 3-C Medical Inc., which distributes dialysis products in 
Southern California and Mexico, was acquired Monday for an undisclosed price by 
a major Indianapolis pharmaceutical and medical products distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bindley Western Industries Inc. said it went through a subsidiary, Priority 
Healthcare Corp., to purchase the stock of 3-C's sole owner, Robert McConnell, 
and will continue to operate the company in Orange County as Priority-3-C 
Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell became Priority's vice president for Western operations and will 
continue to run the Santa Ana office with three other 3-C employees. McConnell 
said his wife is the only employee to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 3-C generates about $3.2 million in revenue a year distributing dialysis 
products under exclusive contracts with manufacturers. Priority's Cerritos 
warehouse ships about $10 million worth of alternative care products for 
dialysis, oncology and AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority's warehouse will be consolidated with the Priority-3-C operation at a 
new Orange County site yet to be selected, said Bindley Western's chairman, 
William E. Bindley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bindley Western, a public company whose stock is traded on the Nasdaq market, 
is now generating revenue of about $4 billion a year, Bindley said.

NEWPORTER IS A NO-SALE; 5 BIDS FOR HYATT RESORT ALL TOO LOW, RTC SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The landmark Hyatt Newporter Hotel, on the market for more than four years, 
has again failed to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five bidders made offers in early October for the 410-room resort, 
but the federal Resolution Trust Corp., which took over the Newporter in 
January, 1991, and had invited bids, turned them all down, saying that the 
amounts were just too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not acceptable," said Mike Fulwider, spokesman for the federal 
agency that acts as conservator for failed savings and loans. "We've going to 
continue to market this building." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bids was reportedly only $5 million -- about one-fourth of the 
hotel's appraised value four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC took over the Hyatt Newporter after its owner, Beverly Hills-based 
Columbia Savings & Loan, was seized in 1991. That made the federal agency the 
hotel's sixth owner since it opened 33 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The first big resort hotel built in Newport Beach, the Newporter is actually a 
series of four sprawling buildings and four California-style villas surrounded 
by a nine-hole golf course. Columbia Savings bought the hotel for $26 million 
in 1985 from Ridgeway Ltd. of Newport Beach and spent millions of dollars 
renovating it. The Hyatt Corp. took over management of the property in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC has encountered several obstacles while trying to find a buyer for the 
property, the main one being the terms of its lease. The land on which the 
hotel sits is owned by Rosenberg Real Estate Equity Funds in San Francisco, 
which bought the 26-acre site from the Irvine Co. in June, 1992. Rosenberg 
leases the hotel itself to the RTC under an agreement that is to run through 
2048. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate industry insiders said the Newporter's potential buyers are 
concerned that rates or other terms of that long lease might change. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the hotel has failed to keep pace in the rapidly changing hotel 
industry, real estate experts say. Over the years, newer hotels have lured away 
its clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with the Newporter is that the world has changed around it," said 
Donald W. Wise, a vice president with the hotel division at CB Commercial Real 
Estate Group in Newport Beach. "The business traveler is going to stay in the 
John Wayne Airport area, and the tourist is going to stay along the coast in 
newer hotels." 
</P>
<P>
 Wise estimated that the hotel, valued at about $20 million in 1990, is now 
worth $10 million to $12 million. Possible buyers, he said, could include a 
hotel company or a Wall Street-based investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Lewin, manager of the Newporter, said Monday that the hotel has been 
doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had close to 66% occupancy," he said, and "there's been a lot of 
interest from buyers. The RTC is just trying to find the right buyer at the 
right price."  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County hotel business in general has posted gains recently, 
especially in the airport area, where the occupancy rate this year through 
August was up 7.2% from the same period of 1993. Countywide, the occupancy rate 
through August was 68%, according to PKF Consulting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this improvement doesn't help the Newporter like it helps the first-class 
hotels in the John Wayne Airport market," Wise said. "Those hotels service the 
business travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Randy Karns, a partner with national accounting firm Arthur Andersen 
and a specialist in hotels, said the entire Orange County hotel market should 
continue to improve, boosting the Newporter's chances of finding a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen some recent improvement in hotel rates and occupancies, mostly 
because so few hotels are being built these days," said Karns, who is based in 
Irvine. "This improvement will help the Newporter."

sales per unit rose by 12.8%, well above the 6.8% average increase registered 
during previous months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Operating Officer Ray Perry linked the increase to the introduction of 
El Pollo Loco's new barbecued chicken menu items. "We have had such success 
with new products over the past year, we were confident something as divergent 
from our traditional menu as barbecued chicken would work," Perry said.

MORE EXECUTIVES LEAVE SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL IN SHAKE-UP; AUDITING: THE WASTE 
COMPANY AGAIN DELAYED RELEASE OF A REVIEW OF ITS FINANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 
THAT ENDED JUNE 30. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a continuing shake-up, Security Environmental Systems Inc. said Monday that 
four more top managers, including the chief financial officer and controller, 
had left the waste management company. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, other senior company executives had left or been terminated 
by company President Ellen Batzel, including the company's founder Alfred 
Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman was removed as chairman of the board on Oct. 10. His two sons, 
Stephen and Jonathan, resigned in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Batzel declined to offer explanations for the most recent departures. "All I 
can say is it was in the best interest of the company that they no longer work 
here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental said it has rehired William Sheridan, who had been its 
chief financial officer from October, 1992, through June, 1993, as interim 
chief financial officer. He has replaced Feleke Teka, who joined Security 
Environmental in September, as chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Drusilla Westall, a 10-year veteran of Security Environmental who was 
controller in the company's South Carolina office, has been appointed interim 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Owens has joined Security Environmental as transportation manager in 
Fontana, Calif. He was formerly with Rollins OPC, a hazardous waste 
transportation company in Los Angeles. No replacement for the company's billing 
manager has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which provides waste remediation and transportation services, 
also said Monday that it would further delay reporting the results of an audit 
of its fiscal year ended June 30. It had previously announced that it would 
release the audit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earlier said that it expects to restate one or more quarterly 
statements for fiscal 1994 and continues to study the possibility of restating 
its financial statement for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "The audit turned out to be more difficult than we thought," Batzel said. 
"There are issues that have been raised in it that surprised me. I am not at 
liberty to discuss them." 
</P>
<P>
 Batzel said that Security Environmental now expects to file the necessary 
documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental's stock closed at $1.81 on Monday, up six cents in 
Nasdaq trading.

VIRGIN BRAND EMBRACES DIVERSITY ; PRODUCTS: BRITISH ENTREPRENEUR RICHARD 
BRANSON ADDS VODKA, COLA AND COMPUTER LINES TO A FIRM IDENTIFIED WITH AN 
AIRLINE AND MUSIC STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virgin, new to the business game 25 years ago but now experienced in the art 
of sales seduction, is stretching its brand in new directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known in America for its cheap flights to London on Virgin Air and its 
big-city music department stores, the British company thinks it can easily 
branch out into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a core (business) thing," founder Richard Branson told 
Reuters at the launch this month of Virgin Vodka, which, with Virgin cola and 
Virgin computers, are his latest bright ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love new challenges. . . . We love investing in new challenges where we 
think the rivals have Achilles heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Branson's eclectic business tastes are not new to Orange County. In addition 
to his company's Virgin Megastore, which is the biggest attraction at Triangle 
Square in Costa Mesa, his Virgin Group is the former owner of Orange County's 
largest video game publisher -- Virgin Interactive Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson's foray into interactive video game publishing began in 1987 when the 
Virgin Group's video game unit purchased an Orange County video game company 
run by Martin Alper. Though Branson's name is often associated with Hollywood 
through his years with Virgin Music, the leap into high technology was a change 
for the man who built his fortune on airlines, retail and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Branson sold his stake in the company to minority owner 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., which bought controlling interest in the 
company for about $165 million. The game company is now operated as part of 
Spelling Entertainment Group Inc., of which Blockbuster owns more than 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising experts say very few brands are elastic enough to bind together a 
clutch of diverse products without snapping. But then, that's not what Branson 
is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much a product he stands for," said John Murphy, chairman of 
Interbrand, an international brands consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stands for values -- youth, iconoclasm, cheeky perky informality. Cola is 
a very good example of something that applies to." 
</P>
<P>
 Branson, 44, broke the mold of British businessmen with his casual clothes, 
friendly approach and infectious enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 His talent for self-promotion and desire to take on the established big-shots 
have won him an impressive track record in the music and retail businesses and 
in transatlantic airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But is that enough? David Baker, head of planning at ad agency J. Walter 
Thomspon Europe, said that, although brand owners have often been slow to 
leverage their brands, simply slapping a well-known logo onto a new line is no 
guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a brand like Virgin to succeed, it's got to have an edge above the Virgin 
name," he cautioned. "It's certainly not enough to make a cola that's just a 
'me-too' product." 
</P>
<P>
 Branson prefers to think positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over-extending "is something we're very careful about, but as long as we do 
products people can identify strongly with, that are quality and fun, one will 
enhance the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there had been ventures he had backed without using what would have 
been an incongruous brand name, like Mates, the cut-price condoms he launched 
as part of an anti-AIDS drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was well aware of the strength of the group's personality and the 
potential mileage to be gained from the label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virgin is a name we treasure," he said. "If any name in the world had a 
chance to run with cola, it's Virgin." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the empire grown from a mail-order record firm that Branson started as 
a teen-ager, fancies itself a British version of a Japanese "keiretsu" -- a 
corporate structure where disparate satellite companies share a core brand name 
and image. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson said Virgin was showered with new business ideas but only picked those 
it believed were high quality and unlikely to harm the name. Financial services 
is one possibility currently under consideration and a spokesman said the group 
would even market marijuana if it were legalized and deemed medically safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing and drinks analysts have grave reservations about how well Branson 
will meet his extravagant projections when he pits his Virgin cola against U.S. 
giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drink, made by Canadian specialist Cott Corp., has been given the 
thumbs up in taste tests and looks set to sell well in a deal with Tesco, a big 
British supermarket chain. Virgin also has high hopes for its vodka, made by 
Scotch whiskey specialists William Grant & Sons. It will be priced 
competitively at 10.99 pounds ($17.50 U.S.) when it goes on sale next month and 
will be the only vodka sold on Virgin planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also putting its badge on a range of computers made by 
Japanese-owned ICL, under a deal announced in September. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been flops, like a government-sponsored litter collection plan in 
the 1980s. Branson made a quiet exit. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent survey found the Virgin name very resilient, with 93% of 
respondents identifying it as a music business, even though the group sold the 
Virgin record label to Thorn EMI in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great brand, but there is a danger" in expanding, said Murphy, 
adding that Branson's "got to be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Charismatic, with long hair and a beard, Branson has livened up business with 
the verve that helped him smash world records for crossing the Atlantic by 
powerboat and hot air balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 A multimillionaire, he gives the impression of doing business for fun. The 
10-year-old Virgin Atlantic Airways is popular but profits have been patchy, 
and Branson said recently that, even if it failed, in the end he would have 
enjoyed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But his track record augurs well, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending your brand is "a bit hit-and-miss," said Richard Sanderson at the 
Panmure Gordon brokerage. "But then I didn't think he was going to succeed with 
the airline."

ST. LOUIS IS GAME -- BUT ARE THE RAMS?; SPORTS: OFFICIALS IN THE MUCH-MALIGNED 
FOOTBALL TOWN ARE PULLING TOGETHER TO ENTICE TEAM AWAY FROM O.C. 
</P>

<P>
 There's a sports renaissance in St. Louis with the recent opening of the Kiel 
Center, a palatial, 19,260-seat arena for the National Hockey League's Blues, 
and construction of a luxurious, 70,000-seat domed football stadium for . . . 
for . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Whom? 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing, really. Laughable to some. Seven years ago, when St. Louis had a 
National Football League team and its owner wanted a new stadium, bickering 
among politicians and apathy among fans resulted in no new facility and the 
team moving to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, the city has no NFL team and is building a stadium many 
believe will be one of the nation's finest -- just another bizarre twist in the 
history of America's most maligned football town. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis nearly blew its chance to lure the Los Angeles Rams this year 
because, until September, city and county officials couldn't wrest control of 
the new stadium lease from a stubborn beer distributor who had the desire, but 
not the money, to buy an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was considered a lock for an NFL expansion team in 1993, but 
conflicting ownership groups and financial problems doomed that bid. Charlotte, 
N.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., were awarded teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the St. Louis Cardinals. The Big Red, they were called. Or was 
it The Big Dread? They had only 10 winning seasons in 28 years (1960-87), never 
played host to a playoff game and had one of the most despised owners in 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much for the city's NFL archives. 
</P>
<P>
 But strange things have been happening lately under The Arch. Politicians and 
business leaders are cooperating on the football issue. The beer distributor 
put his ego aside for the good of the city. Elected officials and community 
leaders have helped revive the spirit of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the city has emerged from its football Dark Ages to become an 
extremely attractive alternative for the Rams, who are expected to decide soon 
whether they'll remain in Anaheim or move to St. Louis or Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will we get the Rams? Who knows?" said Al Kerth, spokesman for Civic 
Progress, a coalition of executives from the area's 26 largest companies that 
has been extremely active in negotiations with the Rams. "Could we have done it 
any better? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we're successful or not, I've gone from thinking we'd never get an 
NFL team to being really confident we'll get a team." 
</P>
<P>
 But to grasp how far St. Louis has come in its quest for an NFL team, one must 
fathom the depths from which the city has risen. The Futile Franchise 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-1970s, when they enjoyed three consecutive winning seasons 
under Coach Don Coryell and made two of St. Louis' only three playoff 
appearances, they were known as the Cardiac Cardinals because of a penchant for 
winning close, tension-filled games. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of their St. Louis tenure, the Cardinals barely had a pulse. They 
went through nine head coaches in 28 years. Their play usually ranged from 
average -- they hovered at or near the .500 mark for eight years -- to 
mediocre. Remarkably, they went 4-9-1 for three consecutive seasons (1971-73). 
</P>
<P>
 Fans also perceived that the front office, headed by owner Bill Bidwill, was 
unwilling -- and unable -- to improve the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals were notorious for their draft-day gaffes, which included 
wasting first-round picks on the likes of Tim Gray, a defensive back who was 
traded to Kansas City after one season; Steve Pisarkiewicz, a quarterback who 
was cut after three seasons; Steve Little, a kicker who was cut after two 
seasons, and Clyde Duncan, a receiver who caught only four passes in two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about St. Louis' picks, former Cardinal tight end Jackie Smith, who 
was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame last summer, chuckled. "Elmer 
Fudd was picking them out," said Smith, 54, who now works in the marketing 
department of a St. Louis-area riverboat casino. "It always seemed like they 
picked some guy no one had ever heard of to prove they had some mysterious way 
of judging talent, but so many never panned out." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1986 series examining the Cardinals' woes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
asked former Cardinal linebacker Tim Kearney whether Joe Sullivan, team general 
manager from 1972-82, knew anything about football. "To tell you the truth, I 
don't think he knew if it was blown up or stuffed," Kearney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidwill, who still owns the Arizona Cardinals, has been described as aloof and 
lacking in public relations skills. Though he made many charitable 
contributions in St. Louis, he is not remembered fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any kind of marketing, this is a wonderful area," Smith said. "But Mr. 
Bidwill abused these people so bad, and they still showed up. I don't think he 
did it intentionally, but he almost insulted the fans on a regular basis by the 
way he did things. I don't remember any fan appreciation days, and there were 
never any days to honor the great players." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charlie Gitto, whose Pasta House near Busch Stadium is frequented by many 
fans, professional athletes and coaches: "Bidwill just wanted your money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals did not respond to several requests for an interview with 
Bidwill. Expansion Follies 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis lost the Cardinals in 1987 primarily because of a bitter battle 
between then-Mayor Vince Schoemehl and then-St. Louis County Executive Gene 
McNary. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoemehl wanted a new stadium downtown. McNary wanted it in the suburbs. 
Bidwill, tired of leasing Busch Stadium from a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch and 
cantankerous August A. Busch Jr., got sick of the whole mess and left. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a mere tussle compared to the heavyweight battle waged during the 
1993 expansion race. But it wasn't St. Louis vs. Charlotte, Jacksonville, 
Baltimore and Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was St. Louis vs. St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Round 1: Fran Murray vs. James Orthwein. Murray, a Philadelphia 
entrepreneur, teamed with St. Louis beer distributor Jerry Clinton to form the 
St. Louis NFL Partnership in 1989 with an eye toward expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Murray, who owned 49% of the NFL's New England Patriots, ran into 
financial problems in 1990, Orthwein, a wealthy St. Louis businessman, was 
commissioned to shore up the St. Louis partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray borrowed millions from Orthwein and couldn't pay him back. Orthwein 
eventually foreclosed on Murray's share of the Patriots and St. Louis 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Down goes Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 * Round 2: Orthwein vs. Clinton. The two had a strong dislike for each other, 
and by September of 1993, Orthwein was so disgusted with the ongoing conflict 
that he sold his majority share of the St. Louis NFL Partnership to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Orthwein retained his 65% share of the new stadium lease, which the 
Regional Convention and Visitors Commission signed over to Murray and Clinton 
in August, 1991. Clinton held 30% of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 A draw. 
</P>
<P>
 * Round 3: Clinton vs. Stan Kroenke. Clinton couldn't afford the $140-million 
fee for expansion. In October, 1993, just days before the league's expansion 
vote, the Gateway Group, headed by Columbia, Mo., real-estate magnate Stan 
Kroenke, began pursuing a team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton did not withdraw NFL Partnership's application or give his share 
of the lease to Kroenke. Charlotte was awarded a franchise Oct. 26, and the 
league postponed its vote on a second team, giving St. Louis, many believed, a 
chance to get its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city is on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Round 4: Clinton vs. Kroenke II. They couldn't reach terms on the lease -- 
Clinton wanted $3 million and 10% of the would-be team, Gateway offered $3 
million and 5% -- and the night before the second expansion vote, Clinton and 
Murray sent letters to NFL owners threatening legal action if Kroenke got the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't; Jacksonville did. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser by knockout: St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league looked at us as completely disorganized and a situation in which 
they would get involved in another lawsuit -- and that is a sorry state for the 
city of St. Louis," Charles F. Knight, a member of the Gateway Group, said at 
the time. Clinton and Murray "continued to muddy the waters to the eleventh 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, reeling from the loss, needed some smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community had lost all faith in the business leadership and some faith in 
elected officials," Kerth said. "But things have turned around considerably." 
New Lease on Life 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the expansion disaster, St. Louis County Executive George 
(Buzz) Westfall and St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. formed the nonprofit 
FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium) in an effort to settle the lease 
dispute and pursue an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a glimmer of hope in January when Kroenke made a strong bid to buy 
the Patriots, but Orthwein, keeping a promise to favor local investors, sold 
them to New England-based businessman Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
 FANS then shifted its efforts to the Rams. And the lease. The group made 
progress in June when Orthwein, who netted more than $50 million in his sale of 
the Patriots, gave his share to FANS for $1, but Westfall and Bosley could not 
reel in Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing the stalemate, Rams President John Shaw broke off talks with St. Louis 
on Aug. 10, vowing not to negotiate until the lease was resolved. St. Louis 
responded quickly, appointing former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, a partner in a St. 
Louis law firm, as FANS chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I was picked was I was not in tune to the whole saga," said 
Eagleton, who for a short time served as running mate to Democratic 
presidential nominee George McGovern in 1972. "I had no pre-existing scars 
dating back to the expansion effort. I wasn't on anyone's side. I was a neutral 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration came five weeks later when Eagleton, on Sept. 15, came to 
terms with Clinton. FANS gave the beer distributor $4 million and promised 
another $4 million if St. Louis were to obtain an NFL team. Clinton also 
received a luxury suite in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't my great talents or genius that brought it about," said Eagleton. 
"I was just someone who could pursue it continuously to the exclusion of other 
distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 It helped that Eagleton's pitch came with a greater sense of urgency. By 
summer, Orange County had enhanced its offer to the Rams, and Baltimore Orioles 
owner Peter Angelos had made several trips to meet with Shaw and Rams owner 
Georgia Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phrase I used (with Clinton) was, 'The train was leaving the station.' " 
Eagleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: Los Angeles. Football Town? 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton, Kerth and two other St. Louis representatives traveled to Los 
Angeles on Oct. 12 and met for 4 1/2 hours with Shaw. In addition to offering 
the Rams all revenue from the new stadium, they outlined a plan to raise $60 
million to $90 million to pay for the many costs associated with a move. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one hurdle emerged during the meeting: Fan support in St. Louis. 
Eagleton said Shaw "questioned whether St. Louis was an intense football town, 
and he said he thought Baltimore had a greater zealousness among fans." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an image St. Louis has been fighting ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis is a great, great baseball town, and few cities could rival their 
passion for baseball in any sport," said NBC commentator Bob Costas, who has 
lived in St. Louis for 20 years. "Will it ever be as great a football town? No. 
Can it be a very good football town? Yes. The bad rap is because we had a 
comically poor franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective person would have to say the problem here was the Cardinal 
franchise, not the city of St. Louis. If you had been here, you would say it's 
amazing fans supported them as well as they did with all they put up with." 
</P>
<P>
 A study of attendance figures shows that crowds in St. Louis were a little 
better -- and crowds in Baltimore not quite as good -- as most people think. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts regularly sold out Baltimore's 60,000-seat Memorial Stadium during 
their glory years, when they played in five NFL championship games from 1958-70 
and featured stars such as Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, Gino Marchetti and Art 
Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 13-year period from 1972-84, the Colts (who went 72-115-1 in that 
time span) averaged only 47,186 fans per game, or 78.6% of capacity. St. Louis 
(91-95-3) averaged 45,240 fans a game, 90.5% of Busch Stadium's 50,000 
capacity, during the same period. Cardinal attendance tailed off considerably 
from 1985-87, amid Bidwill's continual threats to leave, and the team has not 
fared well in Phoenix, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand why Mr. Shaw would question the resolve of fans in St. 
Louis," Jackie Smith said. "But I don't think he'd believe what he'd see if 
they came here. I think he'd be overwhelmed by it." 
</P>
<P>
 One bartender has started a St. Louis Rams Fan Club, which meets on Sundays to 
cheer on the Rams. FANS has commitments to lease 90 of the 100 luxury suites 
and all 6,200 club seats in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community is just waiting for the words, 'Let's go,' " Westfall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Rams say, "Let's stay," or "Let's go to Baltimore," the comparisons 
to St. Petersburg, Fla., the city that built a beautiful domed stadium but 
hasn't attracted a major league baseball team, will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a big concern for the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports 
Complex Authority. The football stadium is part of a convention center and 
sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall said the stadium would actually be more profitable without an NFL 
team, because those 10 football weekends could be opened for conventions, which 
generate much more hotel and restaurant business -- and tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not just about the bottom line. It's about a city's image taking a 
major blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't haunt me -- I don't wake up in the middle of the night screaming 
-- but it's a community hurt," Eagleton said. "Here we have this tremendous 
stadium with no team. It's like that old phrase: We're all dressed up with no 
game to play."

TIMES O.C. POLL; VOTERS SOUR ON CONGRESS, DON'T KNOW MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Orange County voters do not like the way the nation's business is being 
handled in Washington. But if they wanted to write to their congressman to 
complain, they would not know where to send it because most don't know who 
their congressman is. 
</P>
<P>
 The six members of the Orange County congressional delegation -- all 
Republicans -- are as invisible as Halloween ghosts, according to a recent 
Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to name any of the local congressmen, the poll found, almost two 
out of three draw a blank -- they cannot name any of the county's delegation -- 
zip, zero, nada. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 600 voters questioned for the survey could name all six. 
</P>
<P>
 And only 5% of voters feel the local delegation has "a lot of influence," 
though 48% said they had "some" influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling their frustration with Washington politics, Orange County voters 
equally blamed Republicans, Democrats and President Clinton for gridlock at the 
federal level. Local voters also are more likely than voters across the country 
to demand "new people in Washington, even if they are not as effective as 
experienced politicians," according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their counterparts across the nation, who were polled earlier this year 
for the 1994 Times Mirror Survey, 52% of the Orange County voters said they 
want a third major political party in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, a random telephone survey, was conducted Oct. 22-25 by Mark 
Baldassare and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange homemaker Patricia James, 52, shares the anger expressed by most local 
voters. She doesn't know who her congressman is -- not that it matters, she 
said, because he probably does not have much political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 James also thinks congressmen do not listen to the voters at home, and is 
"sickened" by the partisan bickering between both major political parties that 
keeps anything from being accomplished. Although she is a Democrat who 
sometimes votes Republican, she is ready for a third political party. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fight each other so much that they don't even think of the people," 
James said. "They just (vote) their way." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the job approval rating of the Orange County delegation has dropped 
eight points since four years ago, when a similar poll was conducted. When 
asked to rate how well local congressmen are representing the interests of 
local residents, only one-third said the delegation is doing an "excellent" or 
"good" job. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said the drop had "less to do with the overall performance rating 
of the delegation and more with the general national trends and a sense of 
dissatisfaction with the government in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-fourths of Orange County voters said, for example, that government 
operations are usually inefficient and wasteful -- just seven points higher 
than voters nationwide. And two-thirds said that government regulation of 
business "usually does more harm than good" -- similar to what voters said 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who would rather have government do too little than too much, Lake 
Forest resident John Donahue, 21, said he does not mind the stalemate in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of like gridlock because a lot of things (congressmen) do would cost 
more money," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is among those who does not know much about his congressman and may not 
vote in that race on Nov. 8. But if he does, it will probably be for whoever is 
the Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Some voters guessed wrong when they were asked to give the names of anyone in 
the local congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 One voter offered the name of possible Republican presidential hopeful Jack F. 
Kemp, the former Republican Cabinet secretary who once represented a 
congressional district in New York state, not Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Others drew on familiar names. Donahue, for example, thought his congressional 
representative was Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, while others named 
former Orange County Republican Rep. William Dannemeyer of Fullerton or Dan 
Lungren, who has been serving as state attorney general for the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that they cannot name an (Orange County) congressman means that 
there's a serious disconnect between what's going on at home and what's going 
on in Washington," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 So which current congressmen has the highest visibility? 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). Twenty percent of voters were able to 
come up with his name unaided. His much-talked-about late-night appearances on 
C-SPAN and the Rush Limbaugh radio talk show have probably done more for his 
visibility than all the newsletters he has mailed to voters in his central 
Orange County district. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to voters being able to come up with Dornan's name unaided, he is 
the only congressman in the county about whom more than half the voters have an 
opinion. Some 27% of voters gave Dornan a favorable rating, while 26% said they 
have an unfavorable view of the Garden Grove Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other members of the local delegation, Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) was mentioned unaided by 14% of the voters, followed by Rep. 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), whose name came up 11% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) was named unaided by 4% of the voters, while 2% 
mentioned Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), and 1% identified Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar). Packard's and Kim's districts extend into other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to a similar poll four years ago, the proportions of those who hold a 
"favorable" opinion of Dornan (27%) and Packard (15%) have each decreased by 
five points, while those with a favorable view of Cox (29%) and Rohrabacher 
(22%) have each increased by six points. There is no similar comparison for Kim 
and Royce because they were not in office in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the Republican incumbent congressmen are expected to win reelection 
in conservative Orange County, the lack of name recognition means voters do not 
place a lot of importance on their representatives, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense that these are not important politicians in most people's 
lives," Baldassare said. "There's not a huge thought process that people are 
going to go through on Nov. 8 about who to send back to Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other findings contained in the poll and comparisons with the 1994 
Times Mirror national survey: 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County voters are less likely than voters across the country to agree 
that government "should guarantee every citizen enough to eat and a place to 
sleep." Only 43% of local voters "completely" or "mostly" agreed with that 
statement, compared to 59% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it comes to protecting the environment, Orange County voters said more 
regulations are needed, with 73% supporting stricter environmental protection 
laws -- nine points lower than the nationwide figures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Similarly to the rest of the country, two-thirds of the voters believe the 
federal government "controls too much of our daily lives," and four out of five 
agreed that elected officials in the nation's Capitol "lose touch with people 
pretty quickly." However, 45% said they "mostly" or "completely" agreed when 
asked if all elected officials -- not just federal government -- care what 
people like themselves think. That rating was 12 points higher than the 
national figure. Also, 41% of the local voters surveyed agreed that the 
government is run for the benefit of everyone.

 * Nearly half of the local voters -- 45% -- believe the push for equal rights 
has "gone too far." This result is also similar to that of the national poll. 
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted Oct. 
22-25 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated random sample of 
telephone numbers was used. Once a household was reached, we asked to speak 
with a registered voter. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or 
minus 4% at the 95% confidence level. That means it is 95% certain the results 
are within 4 percentage points of what they would be if every registered voter 
in Orange County were interviewed. The margin of error would be larger for 
subgroups, such as likely voters (plus or minus 5%). 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Results might not add up to 100% because of rounding. Dornan Is 
Delegation's Lightning Rod 
</P>
<P>
 Just one voter in three can name any of the six congressmen serving Orange 
County. And among those who can, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) is 
mentioned most often, by 20%. Dornan is also the only one about whom more than 
half have an opinion. Who's to blame for gridlock in Washington? The fault is 
apportioned about equally among the President and the Democrats and Republicans 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 When you think of Orange County's representatives in the U.S. Congress, what 
names come to mind? 
</P>

STUDENT WALKOUTS CANNOT BE PREVENTED, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Election Day a week away, Los Angeles school administrators acknowledged 
Monday they are unable to keep students from leaving campus to protest 
Proposition 187 and can do little besides mark them truant. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents say they consider the walkouts potentially dangerous and believe 
administrators should find ways to control students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are terrified about kids leaving campuses," said Harriet Sculley, 
president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn., which covers the 
San Fernando Valley. "We are encouraging parents to be . . . on school campuses 
as much as possible. Kids on the streets is an incredibly dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of students took to the streets last Friday in Chatsworth and Van 
Nuys, leading to a citywide tactical alert by police and scattered fighting and 
vandalism. While some students scaled fences, others were permitted to leave 
through open gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools were mostly peaceful Monday. Los Angeles Unified School District 
officials reported anti-187 protests at Canoga Park and Hamilton high schools 
and Sepulveda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department maintained its command post in Van Nuys, but 
no incidents of trouble were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the students decide to walk, principals say they are greatly 
outnumbered and therefore powerless to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like trying to kill ants when you've got an ant swarm," said Joan Elam, 
principal at Monroe High in North Hills, where at least 100 students left 
campus Friday. "Our kids scale a fence like you and I walk over a crack. Do we 
stand there and say, 'You do not go over that fence'? That doesn't work at all 
with a gang or mob situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to administrators, school district officials said the schools must 
respect the students' right to free expression but that they must also ensure 
the youths are safe. School district spokesman Bill Rivera said schools should 
dissuade students from leaving classes by holding forums on the controversial 
ballot measure, which would deny illegal immigrants public education and other 
government services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense locking gates because they go right over them," Rivera said. 
"If you have 150 kids going out the door, who's going to be able to hold them?" 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Our policy is to let them go but try to dissuade them by talking 
with them. We're trying to encourage kids to participate in forums on the 
school campus rather than walking out." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools also must try to ensure the students' safety when they leave, district 
officials said. At several schools last week, administrators -- in cars and on 
foot -- followed students, urging them to stay on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sepulveda Middle School Principal Bob Reimann sent two school buses 
to pick up about 100 students who left campus during a midmorning break. "If 
you have 100 kids facing you and you're one person, you let them go," Reimann 
said. "You can only do so much." 
</P>
<P>
 While parents, such as Sherryl Zurek, the PTSA president at Van Nuys High 
School, acknowledged the difficulty in keeping students on campus, they say the 
schools should do more to encourage students to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (students) should be kept on campus -- definitely," Zurek said. "If 
the schools are not equipped to keep them on campus, they should do more to 
encourage them." 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda High, administrators succeeded last week in keeping students on 
campus. When scores of students from other schools showed up at the Reseda 
campus to lure students, administrators locked gates and stationed football 
players at school exits to keep students in class. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to forestall a walkout, Chatsworth High administrators scheduled 
a forum on the ballot measure. But when they tried to end the forum, the 
students bolted through the school gates. Between 1,500 and 2,000 students -- 
nearly the entire student body -- left campus, and most marched for several 
blocks before returning to the football field for a daylong anti-187 rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Lunkusky, the former PTSA president at Chatsworth High who has two 
children there, said she was upset by Friday's demonstration and that the 
administration should never have scheduled the forum. "Things got out of hand 
there," Lunkusky said. "I'm really distressed about this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry Moore, a district administrator, said he believes the Chatsworth 
students planned the walkout and had agreed to leave before the forum began. 
Students disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had closed the gate, they would have stormed it and jumped," Moore 
said. "That would have been unsafe."

 The way to a football team might be through the club president's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 4 1/2-hour meeting in Los Angeles last month, former Missouri Sen. 
Thomas Eagleton, who is heading St. Louis' efforts to land an NFL team, said 
Rams President John Shaw seemed a bit concerned about the caliber of 
restaurants in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Shaw asked me if St. Louis was a gourmet town, and I said, 'Well, we have 
some nice restaurants,' " Eagleton said. "Then he said, 'Tell me, is it like 
San Francisco?' Well, no. He said, 'How about New Orleans?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Well, in some respects, we're a raucous Des Moines!' " MIKE

STAN KROENKE IS THE STRONG BUT SILENT TYPE; PROFILE: THE MISSOURI REAL ESTATE 
INVESTMENT MAGNATE'S PURSUIT OF THE RAMS HAS BEEN AS PRIVATE AS THE JET HE 
OWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He's the money man behind St. Louis' bid to land the Rams, but to many in Los 
Angeles and even St. Louis, Stan Kroenke might as well be The Invisible Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Peter Angelos, the colorful Baltimore Orioles owner who has spoken 
openly about his attempts to purchase a minority share of the Los Angeles Rams, 
Kroenke's pursuit of the team has been as private as the twin-engine jet he 
owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia, Mo., real estate investment magnate, whose last-minute bid to 
land an NFL expansion team in 1993 fell short, does not return reporters' calls 
or grant interviews about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 He has issued two football-related statements in the past 10 months, one when 
St. Louis settled a controversial stadium lease dispute in September and one 
when his bid to purchase the New England Patriots failed in January; but he has 
not spoken publicly about his NFL aspirations since last November's expansion 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke, 47, watched the Rams' Sept. 25 game against the Kansas City Chiefs in 
Rams President John Shaw's Arrowhead Stadium suite, but even Kroenke's close 
friends are in the dark when it comes to his negotiations with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be surprising to you, but he doesn't talk about it," said Missouri 
Athletic Director Joe Castiglione, who jogs with Kroenke a few mornings a week. 
"I honestly don't know how involved he is with the Rams because he never talks 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Kroenke has remained behind the scenes is that city and county 
officials have spearheaded negotiations to attract the Rams and consider 
Kroenke's bid to purchase the team separate. In Baltimore, Angelos has overseen 
all aspects of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Enos Stanley Kroenke, who was named after two St. Louis Cardinals 
baseball greats -- Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial -- was in the forefront of 
negotiations, it's not likely he'd be as candid as Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Kroenke, a "regular, high-level contributor" to the Missouri 
athletic department, according to Castiglione, say he takes a reserved, low-key 
approach to all his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan's not the kind of guy who makes a contribution just for accolades. He 
does it for the right reasons," Castiglione said. "He's a very down-to-earth 
guy with a terrific wit. He's a wonderful family man who does not keep a high 
profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke, who married Ann Walton, the niece of the late Sam Walton and daughter 
of Wal-Mart co-founder James L. (Bud) Walton, made his fortune developing 
shopping centers. Though his net worth has been estimated at $500 million and 
he lives in a 10,600-square-foot mansion in Columbia, friends say Kroenke is 
true to his modest, small-town roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would never know he's a millionaire by talking to him," said Al Eberhard, 
Missouri's director of athletic development. "He's one of the most sincere and 
honest people I've ever met. He doesn't need the national attention or media." 
Nor does he want it. 
</P>
<P>
 After being criticized for his less-than-inspiring performances at news 
conferences during the NFL expansion race last year, Kroenke hired the 
Fleishman Hillard public relations firm to field questions and coach him on 
dealing with the media. The former high school basketball star who continues to 
play in adult recreation leagues is a shy, private man but that doesn't mean he 
wouldn't be a successful NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be a rock-solid NFL owner," Castiglione said.

ANALYSIS; RAIDERS SET COURSE FOR CALMER SEAS

 When the Raiders sailed into San Francisco to open the season, many people 
figured this team was on the first leg of a voyage to Miami for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders left, many of those same people believed the team was on a 
voyage of the damned. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis piled upon crisis in the ensuing weeks. The quarterback couldn't throw 
a spiral. The starting tailback couldn't gain any yardage. The backup tailback 
couldn't get any carries. One fullback was lost because of a season-ending 
injury. One defensive end was marching in and out of camp as if he had a 
part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were blowups everywhere. Player vs. player on the practice field. 
Assistant coach vs. assistant coach in the press box. Head coach vs. 
quarterback on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Who had time for football? 
</P>
<P>
 Even by Raider standards, this was ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, halfway through the 16-game season, the turmoil seems to have 
subsided and the Raiders appear to be back on course. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4-4, a game behind the three conference teams that would be wild cards if 
the season were to end today, the Raiders have to be considered a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll have to show more than they did Sunday in struggling to defeat the 
1-7 Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious concerns remain about the power struggle waged in recent weeks over 
offensive philosophy between Coach Art Shell, offensive coordinator Tom Walsh 
and quarterback Jeff Hostetler. The offense has been inconsistent, the defense 
has had alarming lapses at crucial times and the special teams were not so 
special early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 A position-by-position breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTERBACK -- Hostetler's arm seemed to be hurting in the first two games and 
he looked like a pitcher who had lost both his fastball and his control. The 
fastball is back, but the control remains questionable. Hostetler already has 
thrown nine interceptions, one short of his season total last year, a career 
high. But he also has thrown 11 touchdown passes and seems to have genuinely 
made peace with Shell after their infamous sideline argument in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Optimistic. Hostetler showed the skills are still there with his 
game-winning touchdown pass to Tim Brown on Sunday. With his arm and 
philosophical problems apparently healed, there seems to be no reason he can't 
be as good as ever in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 RUNNING BACK -- The question is why it took the Raiders six games to realize 
Harvey Williams should be the starting tailback over Ty Montgomery. In his last 
two games, Williams has established career highs in rushing with 107 and then 
128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Good, as long as Williams keeps getting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 WIDE RECEIVER -- The Raiders assembled a track team, but, so far, Hostetler 
seems willing to hand the baton to only one man, Brown. He has caught 44 
passes. The rest of the wide receivers have shared 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Troubling. Hostetler and Brown keep operating via radar, but, 
sooner or later, the defenses are going to intercept the signal -- and the 
passes. Hostetler has to spread the ball around more. 
</P>
<P>
 OFFENSIVE LINE -- Who would have thought the Raider line would be most 
effective opening holes with Gerald Perry in a cast and Robert Jenkins and Greg 
Skrepenak in the starting lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Surprising. Looking deeper than ever, this line might be able to 
keep the offense on track. A little better protection for Hostetler wouldn't 
hurt, though. 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENSIVE LINE -- The comings and goings of end Scott Davis could have been a 
distraction. But the ability of tackle Jerry Ball to make the starting lineup 
as a pass rusher has been a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Solid. They're not racking up lots of sacks but they are putting 
pressure on the quarterbacks. If Davis regains his form, watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 LINEBACKER -- The questions of training camp have been answered. Greg Biekert 
was ready to take over at middle linebacker. Top draft choice Rob Fredrickson 
was able to make the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Promising. The young linebackers only figure to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 SECONDARY -- Another Pro Bowl year by Terry McDaniel and the addition of 
Albert Lewis have made a good unit better. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: Strong with no discernible soft spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the special teams players, only kicker Jeff Jaeger's numbers are 
appreciably down, and that has more to do with the new rules than anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 So when broken down by unit, the Raiders look better than a .500 team. But, 
factor in the turmoil, the penalties, the dropped passes and the defensive 
lapses and the record becomes understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders can somehow factor all those things out in the second half, 
they might yet have a bon voyage.

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; GYM RAT TURNS INTO BIG CHEESE; RAISED IN BASKETBALL 
ENVIRONMENT, MURRAY AIMS TO MAKE LEAP FROM CAL TO CLIPPERS

 Lamond Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, was dunking before he was out of 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's father, James, who played basketball at UC Riverside in the early 
1970s, used to hold Lamond over his head so that he could dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was 3 years old he wouldn't play with his Tonka toys, Big Wheels or 
anything," James Murray said. "Just a basketball. He used to sleep with the 
ball and the ball was bigger than him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played at Riverside, they had a temporary nursery set up in the corner 
of the gym and the cheerleaders would baby-sit while we practiced and all he 
ever heard was the thump of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he got potty trained, he went everywhere I went. If I said he couldn't 
go with me to play basketball, he'd hide in the trunk (of the car) or the back 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
 James Murray instilled the spirit of competition in Lamond too, at that early 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we played, I played not to take any hostages," said James Murray, who 
had served a two-year hitch in Vietnam before starting college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules of war stipulate that if you take a hostage, you're supposed to 
give him medical care and feed him, but over there you just shot them in the 
head again because you couldn't be dragging them through the jungle. And that 
was my mentality when we played. If he had the ball, he was the enemy and we 
just played rough." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray practically lived and slept on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a basketball hoop above the garage and he'd play until he got 
exhausted," James Murray said. "Once I found him asleep, leaning up against the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray's obsession with basketball has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh player selected in the NBA draft, the 6-foot-7 forward from 
California was so highly regarded by the Clippers that they chose not to meet 
All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins' price. Wilkins signed with the Boston 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are counting on him to be an integral part of the future of this 
franchise," Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "No one is saying he's 
going to come in and turn everything around. He's not Shaquille O'Neal or 
Michael Jordan, we all understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Murray, "I think there'll be a lot of pressure, but I haven't really felt 
it yet because I'm not on the floor. But I think I'll be able to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his future, Murray has basketball in his genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin Tracy, a former UCLA star, plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. 
Tracy's younger brother, Cameron, a 6-1 guard, is a freshman at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were close until his family moved up to Northern California," Tracy Murray 
said. "We'd go play ball on the weekends and stuff. Lamond always had a nice 
hook shot. He got that from his dad." 
</P>
<P>
 James Murray, 45, and his brother, Robert, 46, were star basketball players at 
Blair High in Pasadena in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 James, a 6-foot-4 power forward who was an outstanding rebounder and post 
player, went on to play at Pasadena City College in 1970, after serving his 
Army hitch, then transferred to UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Invited to open tryout camps by the Seattle SuperSonics and the Portland Trail 
Blazers, Murray declined because he had a wife and son to support and couldn't 
afford to leave his job. He decided he would live through his son's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was a big influence on me because he played ball in college," Lamond 
Murray said. "He taught me a lot about the game, not just about shooting or 
defense, but about how to think the game, which I think is essential to you 
doing well out there on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Murray, a 6-3 1/2 guard and an outstanding outside shooter, played at 
Cal Lutheran. Son Tracy, who set a state scoring record at Glendora High before 
going to UCLA, where he became the Bruins' fifth leading scorer, inherited his 
father's shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy and Lamond played together every day last summer in pickup games with 
other NBA players at UCLA in an attempt to prepare Lamond for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to do just fine," Tracy Murray said. "Just let him get adjusted. 
When he gets adjusted and he's calm and playing his game where he feels 
comfortable, you're going to see the real Lamond." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's another Murray on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond's girlfriend, Carmen Allen, is pregnant with their first child and due 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Murray might not be with Allen for the birth of their son because 
he's set to make his NBA debut Friday in Yokohama, Japan, against the Trail 
Blazers and cousin Tracy. The Clippers, who left today, will return Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan's not the best place to be because it's a long flight back and by the 
time I get back it'll probably be over with," Murray said. "I want to be here 
for the birth of my first child. It's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't he skip the games in Japan and stay here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I can do that," Murray said. "For the amount of money they're 
paying me ($13.5 million for five years), I don't know if I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray and Allen, who plan to get married next summer, have already decided to 
name their son Maurice, which is Murray's middle name. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has had trouble catching up with the Clippers after missing the first 
two weeks of training camp because of a contract dispute. He shot 24% in three 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 After practicing with the team for two days, he made his debut in last 
Wednesday's 101-98 exhibition victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Murray played 12 
minutes, missing all six shots he took, including three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't much better in an exhibition tournament in Mexico City last weekend, 
making six of 19 shots in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murray's poor shooting doesn't alarm him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about that at all," he said. "I'm just getting used to 
shooting the basketball. My elbow's a little sore right now. I'll work through 
it. I'm not worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said Murray is a quick learner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamond Murray has been as good a latecomer as I've ever had coaching," Fitch 
said. "Walking into a camp as late as he walked in, he's walked in with very 
good conditioning and a great attitude. He's been impressive to me. Now, he's 
got to play himself into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the game. Very few rookies that come in know the game. I've had a 
lot of guys who've come out of college who didn't know the game as well as he 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamond has a lot of talent, poise and skill," Vaught said. "I like the way he 
shoots the ball from deep. When he has the ball in his hands he takes his time. 
A lot of rookies rush, panic a little, but he seems very poised. I think he's 
going to be great for our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who is so quiet that he was nicknamed "Mute" by his high school 
teammates, doesn't talk much on the court and isn't very demonstrative. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I learned to play," he said. "I couldn't be like the rest of 
the guys and talk and do all those antics and still concentrate on the game. My 
way of concentrating is to be quiet and think things out in my head about what 
I need to do the next play." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch thinks some may misinterpret Murray's demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are going to misread him because his passion for the game 
(isn't readily apparent)," Fitch said. "He's one of those 'still waters run 
deep.' He's a very within-himself guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you spend some time with him, you know he's got a desire to succeed 
and win as a member of a team. That's what I like about him. He's got a 'member 
of a team' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the college level, he found time to rest. But if he learns to play in his 
high gear, he's going to be a very good player. He was so good at the college 
level he could turn it on and turn it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray admits that he occasionally loafed in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some nights I took it easy and some nights I played very hard," he said, "but 
now I've got to play very hard every night because the competition's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray didn't have much competition at Kennedy High in Fremont, where he 
averaged 30.7 points, 14.6 rebounds, three assists and three blocked shots a 
game as a senior in 1991, en route to being named the state Division III player 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with California, Murray chafed under former Bear Coach Lou 
Campanelli, who tried to refine his game. But Murray flourished after 
Campanelli was replaced by assistant coach Todd Bozeman midway through the 
1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 24.5 points in his last six games as Cal advanced to the Sweet 16. 
And he outplayed Duke forward Grant Hill, the third player selected in the 
draft, scoring 28 points and grabbing 10 rebounds as the Golden Bears upset the 
defending NCAA champions in the second round of the 1993 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's stock rose with NBA scouts last season when he broke the school 
scoring record set by guard Kevin Johnson, now with the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray and All-American point guard Jason Kidd decided to leave school early 
for the NBA after Wisconsin-Green Bay ousted Cal in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament last March. 
</P>
<P>
 Some maintain that Murray might have trouble playing without Kidd, the No. 2 
selection in the draft, to feed him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without Kidd as a freshman, Murray averaged 13.8 points and shot 
47.4%. However, he averaged 19.1 points and shot 51.7% as a sophomore after 
Kidd's arrival. The leading scorer in the Pacific 10 Conference last season, 
Murray averaged 24.3 points and shot 47.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray thinks he'll flourish even without Kidd, now with the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason, when he did get there, took a lot of pressure off me and helped me a 
lot with his assists," Murray said, "but I think I was a pretty good player 
before he got there, and I think he was a pretty good player before he got to 
Cal. I think we complemented each other, rather than made each other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers waived guards Stephen Thompson and Orlando Vega on Monday to 
reduce their roster to 13 players. The Clippers will decide whether to keep 
center Matt Fish after they arrive in Yokohama, Japan for Friday night's season 
opener against the Portland Trail Blazers.

PANEL'S SPRINT DECISION KOS D'HALLEVANT; HORSE RACING: RON MCANALLY'S 
4-YEAR-OLD COLT DOESN'T MAKE THE CUT FOR OVERSUBSCRIBED BREEDERS' CUP SPRINT ON 
SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Less than two weeks after he arrived, the 4-year-old colt D'hallevant was put 
on another plane today and sent back to California. D'hallevant will be running 
Saturday, as scheduled, only the race will be the $75,000 Morvich Handicap at 
Santa Anita instead of the $1-million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 This development has not made a happy man out of Ron McAnally, the trainer of 
D'hallevant. McAnally, who has won two Breeders' Cup races with Bayakoa and one 
with Paseana, has four other starters Saturday -- Johann Quatz in the Turf and 
the better regarded On Target and Mr Purple in the Juvenile and Call Now in the 
Juvenile Fillies -- but he's not pleased with the exclusion of his sprinter by 
the seven-member panel that completes the fields when races are oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do their homework," McAnally said at his Churchill Downs barn 
Monday. "They should make sure that the horses they pick are better than any of 
those they leave out." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-furlong Sprint is a source of discontent as well for other horsemen 
who won't be able to run. Saratoga Gambler, winner of the Ancient Title 
Handicap at Santa Anita on Oct. 15, is out, as is Concept Win, whose five 
starts this year have all been solid. When Looie Cenicola saw that his 
3-year-old gelding, Uncaged Fury, was further down on the also-eligible list 
than those horses, he ran him last Saturday at Santa Anita and he won the 
California Cup Sprint Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor over the Breeders' Cup Sprint started when 25 horses were 
pre-entered. Only 14 are permitted to run, with the first eight spots going to 
horses that have accumulated the most points for first-, second- and 
third-place finishes in graded stakes throughout the year. The six other horses 
are picked by committee. 
</P>
<P>
 D'hallevant, who won the Pat O'Brien Handicap at Del Mar in August and was 
second, beaten by a neck, to Lykatill Hill in the Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' 
Cup Stakes in September, was tied with Chimes Band for eighth place on points. 
The panel, whose chairman is Eual Wyatt Jr. of Hollywood Park, followed a 
Breeders' Cup option by allowing Chimes Band to run because of points, and then 
tossed D'hallevant's name into the hopper with the 17 horses that would be 
considered after their records were evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 The last three horses eliminated from that group were Saratoga Gambler, 
D'hallevant and Concept Win. None of the 14 horses ahead of them have dropped 
out, which would have been the only way the three might run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Leonard Lavin, who owns Concept Win. "The rules leave 
a lot to be desired. The horses that were picked by the panel are not as good 
as all these sprinters from the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 California-based horses have won half of the previous 10 runnings of the 
Sprint, among them Thirty Slews and Cardmania the last two years. But Cardmania 
is one of the horses that McAnally and Lavin object to this year. The 
8-year-old gelding has run only twice in 1994, breaking a cannon bone while 
winning the San Carlos Handicap at Santa Anita in January, then making a 
comeback with a fourth-place finish in the Ancient Title, on a day when 
Saratoga Gambler, Uncaged Fury and Concept Win were the first three finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the selection committee chose Gilded Time and Thirty Slews to run in 
the Sprint even though neither horse had won a race in 1993. Gilded Time hadn't 
started since he won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1992, the same year that 
Thirty Slews won the Sprint. They finished third and fourth, respectively, last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Sprint favorite, Birdonthewire, was sick before the race and 
finished 11th, and the 5-year-old will try again Saturday, even though he's 
winless, with one second and two thirds, in six starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent more time judging the Sprint than any other race," Wyatt said. 
"Birdonthewire made it in because of the competition he'd been running against, 
more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, Birdonthewire lost by a length to Meritocrat, who goes into the 
Sprint with a five-race winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it got down to the end, we had two holes to fill and five horses to 
consider," said Howard Battle, the Keeneland racing secretary who is a member 
of the selection panel. "We got the films out and looked at some of the races, 
the first time we've ever done that." 
</P>
<P>
 To serve on the panel, members need thick skin. A decision more incendiary 
than those in this year's Sprint excluded Quiet American from the $3-million 
Classic at Belmont Park in 1990. Quiet American was second in the Strub Stakes, 
won the San Diego Handicap and ran second to Dispersal in the Woodward, which 
was run six weeks before the Breeders' Cup. The Belmont linemaker said that he 
would have made Quiet American the third or fourth choice had he been allowed 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Gary Jones screamed about the alleged injustice, then saddled his 
horse for a victory in the New York Racing Assn. Mile the week after the 
Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavin, chairman and chief executive officer of Alberto-Culver, discounted a 
report that the hair-care manufacturer would discontinue its sponsorship of a 
Breeders' Cup race. Alberto-Culver, which is the sponsor of Saturday's Distaff, 
has been a Breeders' Cup backer since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I said about that, to one of my trainers, was taken out of context," 
Lavin said. "Something I don't like about the Breeders' Cup rules is that 
people who nominate their foals are passed over by horses that get supplemented 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's Sprint, three horses that weren't nominated -- Cherokee Run, 
Soviet Problem and Exclusive Praline -- will be running because their owners 
paid a supplementary fee of $120,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lavin's Glen Hill Farm will be represented by a long shot, One 
Dreamer, in the Distaff. Since Lavin's company sponsors that race, it's 
possible that he could be presenting the trophy to himself in the winner's 
circle. That might make up for Concept Win's not running in the Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet Problem has been favored in all 17 of her races. The 4-year-old filly 
has 14 victories and two seconds. . . . Another distaffer, Lochsong, carries 
the hopes of the British in the Sprint. The 6-year-old mare has won five of 
seven in England and France this year. . . . A favorite hasn't won the Sprint 
since Eillo in the first running, at Hollywood Park in 1984. . . . Miss Golden 
Circle, who has sore shins, is out of the Juvenile Fillies.

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; HE'S DEL, NOT DULL; THOSE WHO KNOW HIS BACKGROUND 
INSIST NEW LAKER COACH DEL HARRIS IS ANYTHING BUT BLAND AND HAVE EXAMPLES TO 
PROVE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "Have you heard about the story where I dumped a drink on a guy at a game?" 
Del Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was in Houston, the bad year," the new coach of the Lakers continues. 
"There was this one goofy fan who kept on me the whole year, and he was so loud 
and there wasn't a lot of noise there anyway because we were losing all our 
games so people weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were exiting at the end of the game, it was my first chance to really 
get a good look at him. He had just been a big ol' voice from the balcony 
before. Now, the voice has got a face and he's all the way down on the court. 
Not only that, he's got a drink in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, as fate should have it, as we were walking off the court after the 
final buzzer, I had an itch on the back of my neck. I reached up to scratch it. 
As one of my arms went up, I hit the cup and the drink flew all over him. As 
much as I tried to pass it off as an accident, I ended up making a public 
apology to the guy in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have you heard about how he got nicknamed Dull Harris and all his friends and 
family laughed? 
</P>
<P>
 Try selling that one in Tennessee. That's where he went to school, at Milligan 
College, which is so small that his graduating class had about 55 people. They 
saw how focused Harris could be. One day, for instance, he was thinking about 
something so intently that he pulled up to the post office, left his '49 Ford 
running while he went inside, came back outside, then walked back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Try Indiana. Delmer William Harris was born there 57 years ago and got his 
first big-time coaching job there, at Earlham College. The Earlham team, legend 
has it, was so bad before his arrival in the fall of 1965 that his predecessor, 
knowing it was the end of the line after going 2-19, didn't even bother to 
attend the awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris didn't merely take Earlham, long a gimme on opponents' schedules, to a 
14-8 record that first year and a Hoosier Collegiate Conference title by the 
third season, he was doing Bobby Knight before Bobby Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 That time he stepped on the court and took the charge on Michael Adams, his 
famous blooper-reel move years later with the Milwaukee Bucks? It was nothing 
to anyone who had seen Harris running down the middle of the floor during a 
game to have words with a referee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can get upset with people, although you'd really have to push him past his 
limit," said Ron DeMao, who covered Harris' Earlham teams for the newspaper in 
Richmond, Ind., and became one of his closest friends. "He's a fearless guy. I 
know one time when we were in a near riot after one game. . . . Del turns to me 
and says, 'Let's take our belts off and wrap them around our hands just in 
case.' We didn't have any problems, but we were ready. He's got a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing Harris was a minister -- he was ordained by the Christian Church in 
1958 -- or he might really have gotten riled. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't go for that Dull thing in Texas, either. He spent four years there 
as coach of the Houston Rockets, upsetting the Lakers in the 1981 mini-series 
en route to a Western Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, Tommy Henderson was taken out of the lineup because of a 
weight problem, although the guard denies he added pounds, and later was 
reinserted, after slimming down. Robert Falkoff of the Houston Post tried to 
play it down the middle and wrote that Henderson was playing again because he 
allegedly lost weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris called Falkoff over in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allegedly?" the coach said pointedly. "That's a word used in criminal cases." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your team wins seven in a row and you get cocky?" Falkoff retorted before 
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a pitcher who played semi-pro baseball until he was 32, fired an 
orange slice at the back of Falkoff's head. Strike. And you already know about 
when he gave that fan a drink to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin? That's kind of a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent four years as a scout and an assistant to Don Nelson in Milwaukee 
before becoming coach in 1987-88, and players say some of his practice and 
pregame speeches were l-o-o-o-n-g and drier than Salt Lake City during 
Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there was that 1989 first-round playoff matchup against Atlanta, 
after the Hawks had won all six regular-season meetings and had the home-court 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris predicted that the Bucks would come home with at least a split and then 
spent about $1,000 on tickets and gave them to charity because the locals 
weren't going to sell out Game 3 on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks won the opener by eight points, before the Bucks responded with a 
10-point victory in Game 2. The coach was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he bit off even more: If the fans would come to the Bradley Center and 
support their team, he said, the Bucks would win there too. For good measure, 
he told them to bring cowbells, in honor of living in the dairy state. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris didn't get the sellout for Game 3. Bells, he got. Lots of bells. He 
also got a victory. But after a tough loss three nights later, the doubters 
took the wheel of the bandwagon again as the series shifted back to Atlanta for 
the deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, there were no predictions, not with two starters, Paul Pressey and 
Terry Cummings, out because of injuries, and a third, Jack Sikma, hobbled with 
problems in both ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, a 96-92 victory and afterward, after a masterful coaching 
job, Dull Harris went to the podium at the postgame news conference and did the 
strangest thing. He got tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Similar to what they must feel when they win Miss America," he says now, a 
feeling that getting swept in the next round by eventual NBA champion Detroit 
could not diminish. "How come those people always cry? I had put myself on the 
line in that series." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is in a wait-and-see mode. The players already have felt the 
effects of his classroom sessions during two-a-days in Honolulu -- one came out 
asking if they could start putting coffee in the Gatorade -- but he made 
another kind of impression the first day into his three-year contract. At the 
news conference in May to announce his hiring, Chick Hearn asked the new coach 
what he thought the Lakers needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need a new broadcaster," Harris said, breaking up the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dull thing will always shadow him, no matter how many of the people who 
know him best -- family and close friends like DeMao, Jerry West and Virginia 
Commonwealth Coach Sonny Smith -- swear to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 He is meticulous. He is intelligent. He is humorous. He is great about 
remembering names and people he hasn't seen in dozens of years. But, no matter 
what, no matter whether it's deserved or not, he is forever Dull Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sometimes he tries to fight that, but against nobody who's really 
fighting with him," said son Larry, a scout and video coordinator with the 
Bucks. "He brings it up when nobody else brings it up. You may interview him 
after one game and he'll say, 'Hey, that's not bad for Dull Harris.' He's 
always been that way. He's confident, but he does like reinforcement, just like 
anybody else does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's always kind of on the defensive a little bit, wanting people to 
know what he's accomplished and what he's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Del, "I think that's probably accurate enough. There is a certain aspect 
of coaching a professional team that leads one to paranoia because there are a 
lot of times when you feel like there's just you and your dog. But it's not 
something that gets out of hand, I would say." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are times when you don't even have the dog. Harris was there in 
the late '60s, having revised the original plan of being a coach and a religion 
teacher at some small college to wanting to become a big-time coach, only to 
realize one important factor: No one knew he existed. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have anyone to open doors for him. He didn't belong to any cliques. 
He was from a small town, had gone to a small school and worked at a small 
school. Funny how this is the same guy people would eventually be calling a 
retread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Del was one of those people who had to keep people aware of Del," said Smith, 
a college teammate and close friend ever since. "That kind of thing is done 
more by people who start that far down. I don't think he would have done that 
if he was a disciple of Bobby Knight or was a former NBA player or something. 
He wouldn't have needed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris spent six summers in the Puerto Rican Superior League and coached 
against Doug Moe, Jack McKinney, Paul Westhead, Tom Nissalke, Bernie 
Bickerstaff, Gene Bartow and Rollie Massimino. Soon, Smith introduced him to 
West, and Harris quickly relied on the recently retired Laker star as a mentor 
as much as a friend, even though West was about a year younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Nissalke became Harris' doorman, hiring him away from Earlham to become 
one of his assistants with the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Assn. When 
Nissalke went to Houston a year later to coach the Rockets, he took Harris 
along. When Nissalke was fired after three seasons, Harris inherited the 
position. He would never be an outsider again. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris sweated that rookie season because he had a one-year contract and 
thought he would be fired if the Rockets didn't at least get out of the first 
round of the playoffs. They did, beating San Antonio, and followed that in 
1980-81 with one of the most improbable runs in league history, going from a 
40-42 record and a second-place tie in the Midwest Division, 12 games behind 
the Spurs, to the Western Conference title. He got fired there after the 14-68 
collapse in 1982-83 -- the bad year. 
</P>
<P>
 The end with Milwaukee was different. There, the walls collapsed around him 
the first month of the 1991-92 season. There he was, trying to hold an 
injury-plagued veteran team together for one last run, after having had a gall 
bladder operation and a vasectomy that summer; a cyst that developed after the 
vasectomy was really bothering him; he was doing double duty as coach and club 
vice president, and he had a year-old son at home. He simply wore down. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost sleep and dropped below 200 pounds for the first time in 15 years. 
Then Magic Johnson announced that he was HIV-positive and Harris worried about 
the possibility of other players making similar disclosures. He anguished over 
Johnson's plight and became depressed. Then the Gulf War came and he was 
transfixed by the events on television, even though he didn't have any friends 
or family serving, and he became even more depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets so involved and he works so hard on (coaching), he will start to lose 
his voice and start coughing," DeMao said. "He just gets so emotionally 
involved, it's scary. His close friends really get worried sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smith, "Every once in a while he needs to step back and take a long look, 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, 17 games into the season, immediately after an 18-point victory over 
Indiana and a 32-point trouncing of the Lakers, he stepped down as coach, but 
remained in the front office. When Mike Dunleavy decided to go back to 
Milwaukee, in the same dual role Harris once had, he became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be the last regular-season game Harris coached -- Dec. 3, 
1991. Against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have you heard the story that he thinks he can be what the Lakers are looking 
for? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, the guy with the white hair and, of all things, a track record. The 
non-Riley, non-Dunleavy, non-Pfund, non-Johnson. The old look as the new look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of, you know, old fashioned," point guard Nick Van Exel said. "He 
doesn't seem like the typical Laker coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Said owner Jerry Buss, "He seems professorial." 
</P>
<P>
 To West, he seems like part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, we probably did not hire him before because he was 
such a good friend," West said. "I have always felt that should never interfere 
with a job position or people's relationship. It shouldn't inhibit the hiring 
or the not hiring based on that. But, still, there is always some reluctance to 
hire a friend because of the volatile nature of this business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in our situation here, we don't have those kind of marquee names 
playing like we did before. We have so many young players. We thought that 
someone who had a lot of experience, someone who has been around the block 
before, would have a much greater impact with the team than another young 
coach. Just looking at our situation here, we felt this is the thing that maybe 
we should have done even before." 
</P>
<P>
 Only in this setting -- and with this person -- could familiar be so 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows who's right for this or that," Harris said. "You know only in 
retrospect. But if they're looking for somebody who knows the game and works 
hard at it and is willing to teach young players what he knows about the game, 
well then I'm the right guy. If our players get better, and secondly if getting 
better translates into wins, then I'm the right guy. If they don't get better 
and we don't win, then I wasn't the right guy." Del Harris in the NBA

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; CREDIBILITY OF LEAGUE JEOPARDIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter what economic reforms the NHL eventually rams down players' throats, 
no gain can justify the damage the league is causing to its credibility by 
sustaining the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting ugly on all fronts. Players criticize owners' greed, but they 
talk about signing minor league contracts that would take away the job of some 
$30,000-a-year hopeful. Negotiators call each other liars and churn out enough 
statements, charts and multicolored graphs to denude a forest. Charges of 
antisemitism, whispered about for weeks, are openly leveled by Senior Vice 
President Brian Burke against some critics of Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutter-level stuff. Slime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, fans are getting out of the habit of going to games or 
watching hockey on TV. They're going to movies, watching football and finding 
other ways to spend their money. Ticket sales have stalled everywhere and 
merchandise sales have slowed after several boom years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've dropped right off the face of the earth," said Roy Mlakar, chief 
operating officer of the Pittsburgh Penguins and former president of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-core fans will return, but the casual fans, the ones the NHL needs to 
broaden its scope, are disillusioned and unlikely to return. Bettman claims he 
wants to make a deal, but he hasn't offered an alternative to the proposal he 
rejected Oct. 11. He's too busy sending Burke around North America on a 
propaganda tour. And Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., 
is too busy calling owners' financial data deceptive when he could use figures 
of what is reported to estimate the difference, and proceed from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA accepted its players' no-strike, no-lockout pledge, but Bettman 
wouldn't accept an identical offer from his players in late September. The NBA 
could be in the same position as the NHL a year from now, but basketball's 
history of productive labor negotiations provides reason to believe the NBA 
will avoid this mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look brilliant and intelligent and we look like dummies," said Neil 
Abbott, an NHL player agent. "Our game is being hurt. . . . I think there's a 
drop-dead date coming up at about mid-December if we haven't started playing by 
then. You can't start the season Jan. 21." 
</P>
<P>
 It's painful to say, but maybe hockey's critics have been right all along. 
Maybe it is a minor sport. Bettman has a major problem if he thinks killing the 
season is the way to make the game grow. HAVE PUCK, WILL TRAVEL 
</P>
<P>
 Penguin winger Jaromir Jagr had to be helped off the ice Sunday after taking a 
crunching hit while playing for HC Kladno in the Czech Republic. Jagr said he 
wasn't seriously hurt, but he decided not to play for his homeland in the 
German Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Think the Penguins were a little concerned? And what happens if Wayne Gretzky 
tears up his knee during the European tour he wants to organize? 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance would cover his medical expenses, but the Kings could never recoup 
what he's worth to the franchise if he suffered a career-ending injury. They 
can't stop him, but he -- and every player participating in the exhibition 
tournaments that are springing up -- must consider whether the games are worth 
the risk. If players are restless, there are charities and youth hockey groups 
that could put their energy to good use. MODEL CITIZENS 
</P>
<P>
 Six NHL players are featured in a fashion layout in the November issue of GQ 
magazine, wearing expensive overcoats. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Vancouver's Bret Hedican, Quebec's Curtis Leschyshyn, Edmonton's 
Jason Arnott, New Jersey's Martin Brodeur, St. Louis' Brendan Shanahan and the 
New York Rangers' Mike Richter won't be locked out cold. LABOR OF LOVE 
</P>
<P>
 Out-of-work players, executives and broadcasters are finding interesting ways 
to stay busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary's Ronnie Stern is a bouncer in a bar. Bruin forward Jamie Huscroft, 
who was to have earned $200,000 this season, found work as a landscaper. New 
Jersey Devil Coach Jacques Lemaire went to Montreal to play in some pickup 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo defenseman Denis Tsygurov joined Lada Togliatti, a touring Russian 
team, for a series of games against Colonial Hockey League teams. He probably 
got a great deal: His father, Gennady, is Lada Togliatti's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Ross, analyst on New Jersey Devil radio broadcasts, is writing 
informational blurbs for the backs of hockey trading cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, someone has to. THEY'RE NOT LEAVING ON A JET PLANE -- YET 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to get the Edmonton Oilers to move to Minneapolis, the folks at 
Target Center are wooing the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Warg, Target Center's executive director, told the Minneapolis Star 
Tribune "the stars are in the right direction" for the Jets to be there by the 
1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a bit hasty. There's a group trying to keep the club in Winnipeg by 
building a new arena, and it has asked corporations and individual ticket 
buyers to indicate whether they would be willing to buy luxury suites and club 
seats. If the response is good, they will try to persuade the government to 
kick in some funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for Minnesotans to be wary: Oiler owner Peter Pocklington used 
the threat of moving there as leverage to get a better lease in Edmonton. He's 
still at the Northlands Coliseum. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of the cost-cutting Calgary Flames, the Dallas Stars fired 
13 people and cut the pay of all remaining staff members. The New Jersey Devils 
and Edmonton Oilers are expected to lay off employees Nov. 15. . . . The 
retirement of Max McNab, the first person hired by the Devils when they moved 
to New Jersey, deprives hockey of one of its best-liked and most enduring 
figures. McNab, 70, spent 48 years in professional hockey as a player, coach, 
general manager and executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Wickenheiser, the No. 1 pick in the 1980 draft, is undergoing treatment 
for a cancerous growth on his left wrist. He spent the last two years in the 
minors and played in Europe the two seasons before that. . . . In a poll of 
1,503 Canadian adults, 37% supported the owners in the lockout, 19% supported 
players and 34% said they backed neither side.

NO END IN SIGHT AS NHL LOCKOUT ENTERS SECOND MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for the NHL and its players' union skated in circles again Monday, 
reporting no progress toward ending a dispute that today begins its second 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The league is expected soon to announce the cancellation of 14 games -- 
one-sixth of the season -- from each club's schedule. It has so far canceled 
only four games, delaying the necessity for most clubs to issue ticket refunds. 
Through Monday, 168 games had been missed because of the stoppage, the longest 
in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's five-hour session in Washington was the first in a week. Bob 
Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., detailed his objections 
to accounting techniques used when NHL owners also own the arena or the 
television network that shows their games. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the Canadian Press, "If the NHL is going to make statements about its 
general financial health and that of its member clubs, it must make an accurate 
statement of all revenues related to the club and all affiliated entities." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by their inactivity, players continued to find ways to play. 
Toronto's Mats Sundin joined his old Swedish team, Djurgarden; King forward 
Robert Lang joined Litvinov in the Czech Republic, and a group of Russian NHL 
players organized a five-game charity tour of their homeland, to begin Friday 
in Moscow. The team will include products of the old Soviet "Red Machine" such 
as Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov, now of the San Jose Sharks, as well as 
youngsters Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit center Sergei Fedorov 
and Buffalo right wing Alexander Mogilny. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, President Tony Tavares of the Mighty Ducks criticized the NHL's 
laxity in notifying players that it had stopped paying medical insurance 
premiums Oct. 15. Defenseman Tom Kurvers was initially told his insurance had 
been terminated when he sought emergency treatment for his pregnant wife last 
Thursday. Tavares complained to the league about the slow notification process, 
even though players effectively remained covered.

ANALYSIS; IT ALL ADDS UP TO UCLA'S LOSING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Saturday evening, and Wayne Cook was musing over what he had done and 
seen earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way our offense was supposed to look," he said after passing for 
296 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-30 victory over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 But the offense hasn't looked right, and neither has the defense, which held 
the Cardinal to six second-half points. That's why the Bruins needed the 
victory to break a six-game losing streak, one short of the school record and 
one longer than anything Terry Donahue has gone through in 19 seasons as the 
school's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, media and coaches gathered in a Westside hotel and predicted 
Arizona would be the Pacific 10 Conference representative in the Rose Bowl. 
That USC would push the Wildcats, but not very hard. That UCLA would be close. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arizona would stumble, because it always stumbles. It's why the Wildcats 
have never played in Pasadena on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 USC? The evaluation was based on a returning senior quarterback, Rob Johnson, 
one of the conference's best, and a recruiting class heavy with junior college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the quarterback were injured? And what if the new players weren't 
ready for four-year football? 
</P>
<P>
 There was UCLA, the Pac-10 Rose Bowl entry last season, with a returning 
quarterback, a Heisman Trophy-candidate receiver, a fair start on a rebuilt 
offensive line and a history of opportunistic defense. A second Rose Bowl in a 
row? Could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't been. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers didn't add up. 
</P>
<P>
 85 
</P>
<P>
 That's the number of scholarships available to Division I football teams, and 
it has dwindled by NCAA edict, leaving less room for the recruiting mistakes 
that have been made at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In between this week's practices, the Bruin coaches will scatter around the 
country to correct those mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins need a blocking fullback, a dominating tight end and defensive 
backs with the size to cover big wide receivers and the willingness to take on 
a running game head-on. But what UCLA needs most are offensive linemen. It got 
none in its last recruiting class, and this season's unit is a mixture of 
juniors and redshirt freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of thing best remedied by a visit to the junior college store, 
but that's not the way UCLA does things. Among Pac-10 schools, only at Stanford 
is it tougher to enroll a junior college transfer. For that matter, only at 
Stanford is it tougher to enroll any player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The standards of the school are high," said Gary Bernardi, the Bruin 
recruiting coordinator and tight ends coach. "And that's OK. We know that 
starting out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a level playing field," said Donahue of the Pac-10, "but that's not 
a reason. We can get in the players to win." 
</P>
<P>
 If they're the right players. 
</P>
<P>
 7 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many defensive starters were expected to return but who haven't 
been available most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Marvin Goodwin, linebacker Jamir Miller and nose guard Bruce Walker 
left a year early for the NFL; injuries ended the careers of linebackers Andrew 
McClave and Brian Tighe before the season, and safety Tommy Bennett's legal 
problems have left him suspended from school. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the biggest loss, cornerback Carl Greenwood broke his ankle on a 
play in which he was not hit during the Southern Methodist game, UCLA's last 
victory before Saturday and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week, the Bruins were hammered, 49-21, by Nebraska's option 
offense that rushed for 484 yards. "If I'd been there, I don't think that would 
have happened," said Greenwood, who was proficient at dealing with the sweep 
and taking on ball carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 In their places, youth has been served, with eight freshmen or sophomores 
among UCLA's 10 defensive backs. Changes have been made, with Rod Smalley 
moving from the outside to inside linebacker. And stopgap measures have been 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense has given up an average of 416.2 yards and 28.1 points a game 
after giving up 335.9 yards and 19.2 points last season. It is tied for last in 
the conference in sacks with 2.4 a game and, after an opportunistic year that 
included 40 turnovers and ended in the Rose Bowl, has gotten the ball only 12 
times via fumble recovery or interception. 
</P>
<P>
 And UCLA is last in the conference in holding the opposition on third-down 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 18 
</P>
<P>
 That's the jersey number of J.J. Stokes, who was injured on UCLA's fourth 
offensive play of the season and played only two halves in the first seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 He was his old self Saturday, with five catches for 94 yards, his first 
touchdown after a season in which he had 17 and a two-point conversion that won 
the game with 3:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 When Donahue went home from the UCLA opener, a 25-23 victory over Tennessee, 
he told his wife, Andrea, that he thought this would be a good season. A week 
later, when it was discovered that Stokes' injury would keep him out of his 
first game since seventh grade, Donahue figured the Bruins could handle the 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't. As the injury lingered, and the losses mounted, it became 
apparent that, without Stokes as a target, Cook was limited. Wide receiver 
Kevin Jordan stepped up -- he has 63 catches for 1,015 yards to lead the Pac-10 
-- but didn't draw the defense's attention as Stokes did. With the two in the 
lineup, the team wins. With only one, the team loses six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 4 
</P>
<P>
 That's the number of new offensive coaches this season, and, at times, each 
has had to wonder what he has gotten into. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive coordinator Bob Toledo came from Texas A&M with visions of returning 
to the forward pass with Cook, Jordan and Stokes. When last season's top 
running back, Skip Hicks, injured his knee while long jumping in the rain with 
the UCLA track team in the spring, Toledo visited Florida State to take a look 
at the four-wideout offense that brought the Seminoles a national championship 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He came back with plans for an aerial circus. Then Stokes was injured, and 
nobody joined Jordan as an offensive threat. Four wideouts work when you have 
four wideouts. When you have one, three extra receivers are merely spread 
around the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sherman came with Toledo from Texas A&M to coach an offensive line that 
had sent two players from last season's unit to the NFL. What was left included 
juniors Mike Flanagan at center and Jonathan Ogden at left tackle, both of whom 
were Rose Bowl starters; guard James Christensen, last season's starting center 
until he was injured, and Matt Soenksen, the team's strongest player; and right 
tackle Paul Kennedy, who finally made the starting lineup in his fifth season 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy went down first, blowing out a knee in the SMU game. Christensen has 
missed three games because of knee problems and is playing with a partially 
torn ligament; Soenksen missed three games because of an arch problem. Sherman 
has worked into the night with redshirt freshmen Chad Overhauser, Chad Sauter 
and Sean Gully to try to develop them more quickly, but the most lasting lesson 
came in the Washington State game, a 21-0 loss in which Cook was sacked seven 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine offensive linemen have started games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi has turned tight ends into tackles, to try to give Cook extra 
protection, and Norm Andersen, in his second tour as a UCLA assistant after 
working with the Bruins in the good old days, has tried to eliminate dropped 
passes, a problem all season. 
</P>
<P>
 1 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins bear a scar from the Jan. 1 game in Pasadena, during which they 
looked around at their home field and thought they were in Camp Randall Stadium 
in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 A sea of red -- some estimates have put the Wisconsin crowd at 78,000 among 
the 101,237 -- spoke of profit-taking by UCLA fans and shocked players who had 
anticipated a home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear about the Rose Bowl, it doesn't do as much for me," said one 
player, who asked to remain anonymous, after the loss to Arizona put the Bruin 
streak at six. "They sold us out." 
</P>
<P>
 1,000 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins try to run a balanced offense and have a tailback, Sharmon Shah, 
with 912 yards. That he's doing it without a blocking fullback makes the 
accomplishment even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has turned tailbacks Daron Washington and James Milliner into fullbacks, 
and they want to carry the ball. True, they would rather play fullback than not 
play at all, but both were recruited on the basis of resumes built around high 
school achievements with the ball in their hands, not their helmets in some 
linebacker's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 1989 
</P>
<P>
 That was a similar season, said Donahue, to whom little is new after 19 years 
as coach. After that season, five changes were made in the coaching staff, with 
three assistants fired and two moving on to other jobs voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 season probably won't have similar results. Donahue said he 
anticipates no changes among the staff, pointing out the unforeseen problems 
brought about by the injuries and NFL defections and saying that the current 
staff deserves a chance to right the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories in the final two games, against Arizona State on Nov. 12 and USC on 
Nov. 19, would help because, though the six-game losing streak will linger, 
finishing with three victories in a row will remove some of the sting and send 
the Bruins into next year with a little more spring in their strides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already know that we'll be better next season," said Donahue, pointing to 
the junior offensive line; to Shah and Hicks, who will be juniors next season; 
to Jordan, who will be a senior; and to the defensive backs, who are having to 
grow up on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season will end on Nov. 19, because the numbers didn't add up. And 
because they subtracted from what could have been.

 Nick Trani, the softball coach at Orange Coast the last six seasons, is 
leaving to take the same position at Saddleback, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trani hopes to eventually get a full-time teaching position at Saddleback.He 
worked at OCC as a walk-on, teaching only the softball class. He will teach 
three classes at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the challenge," Trani said. "It's a great area for 
talent and the administration is excited about the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Trani had a 180-92 mark at OCC, including reaching the State tournament three 
of the last four seasons. His 1992 team won the Orange Empire Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Trani will be joined by his OCC assistants Jesse Sims and John Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was telling the players (at OCC)," Trani said. STEVE KRESAL

ANGELS TO PURSUE FREE-AGENT GROSS; BASEBALL: THREE OTHER TEAMS ALSO VYING FOR 
FORMER DODGER PITCHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers think they can do just fine without Kevin Gross, but the Angels 
consider the right-handed starter a possible key to their 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have decided to strongly pursue Gross in the free-agent market, 
joining the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers among teams 
vying for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who led the Dodgers with 124 strikeouts and was on pace to pitch at 
least 200 innings for the eighth time in the last 10 years, would become the 
Angels' top right-handed starter. He has won 40 games during the last four 
years, and was 9-7 with a 3.60 earned-run average this season. 
</P>
<P>
 An Angels' right-hander has not won 10 games in a season since 1991, when Kirk 
McCaskill went 10-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who was paid $2.7 million last season, is an attractive free agent to 
several clubs because teams will not be required to provide compensation to the 
Dodgers. The Dodgers refused to offer Gross arbitration rights, enabling a club 
to sign the Los Angeles native without giving up a draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers informed Gross, 33, they might be willing to talk with him later, 
but Dodger General Manager Fred Claire said Monday they have no current plans 
to present a contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, who has had several discussions with Gross' 
agent, Tony Attanasio, also has expressed interest in free-agent Mickey 
Tettleton of the Detroit Tigers. Tettleton, who has averaged 28 homers and 93 
runs batted in during the last four years, earned $1.5 million last season. He 
underwent surgery Sept. 22 to remove a bone spur and growth in his left heel. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are successful in acquiring Tettleton, 34, they would play him 
at first base, and occasionally in the outfield and at catcher. His acquisition 
probably would precipitate a trade of first baseman J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also have expressed interest in right-handed starter Billy Swift, 
formerly of the San Francisco Giants. But Swift is coveted by many teams, and 
is expected to command at least a four-year contract worth more than $4 million 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going after people," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We're 
going to be very aggressive. We may not have the money to compete with the big 
boys, but we're going to make an effort."

PREP VOICES; AN EVEN FIELD?; ARE BOYS' AND GIRLS' ATHLETIC PROGRAMS TREATED 
EQUALLY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination 
under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Title IX, signed by President Richard Nixon, June 23, 1972 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Title IX, a federal law, banned discrimination in high school 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Results: Girls' participation in high school sports rose nearly 1,000% -- from 
294,015 in the 1971-72 school year to a high of 2.98 million in 1977-78, 
according to surveys conducted by the National Federation of State High School 
Assns. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the survey said the figure fell to 2.12 million, partly attributed 
to a decline in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of boys participating in high school sports went from 
3.67 million in 1971 to a high of 4.37 million in 1977-78 (those Baby Boomer 
years), back to 3.48 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 So that means no discrimination, right? That means girls are getting the same 
opportunity as boys to play high school sports, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another survey by the National Federation found that a typical high school 
offers eight girls' sports with 15 teams and 10 boys' sports with 18 teams. A 
majority of schools responding indicated an increase in girls' programs and 
virtually no increase in boys' programs. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have come a long way, baby, but just try to find an athletic director 
anywhere who will go on the record saying high school girls' sports are getting 
treated the same as the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Brabander, who retired in 1992 after 29 years as the Estancia High 
girls' athletic director -- including 25 as badminton coach -- is a lifetime 
advocate of girls' sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Before there was Title IX, there was the Girls Athletic Assn., which stressed 
participation over competition, and having fun over winning. And the girls 
loved it, Brabander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia had 350 girls in the program on average. Today, only about 200 girls 
play on Eagle teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from annual dues -- 50 cents per girl -- and proceeds from an annual 
car wash provided the program's entire budget. Girls supplied their uniforms, 
the school custodian drove them to away games on the bus, and parental pressure 
didn't exist. Neither did specialization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls didn't practice two hours a day like they do now," said Brabander, who 
lives in Huntington Beach. "They didn't play (one sport) year-round. The best 
athletes were all-around athletes. I think it made for more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 When Title IX was signed into law, it signaled a serious turn for girls' 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It has had, perhaps, the most impact on college programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to bring their athletic departments closer to compliance with 
the federal statute, many universities have dropped traditional men's programs 
and added non-traditional women's programs so comparable numbers of men and 
women would have a chance to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton dropped men's gymnastics and women's volleyball but was 
forced to reinstate the volleyball program after the school was found to be in 
violation of Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, once a national power in men's swimming, no longer fields a team. San 
Diego State has a women's track and field program, but not a men's program. And 
USC added women's water polo as a varsity sport this year. Getting in line with 
Title IX, at the collegiate level, is a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys have shown that a majority of operating budgets are still spent on 
men's teams, and an even larger majority of recruiting funds are spent for male 
athletes. Accordingly, many women choose not to pursue athletics in college. 
Fewer opportunities discourage aspiring high school athletes, who have fewer 
role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Most high school girls can't even look to their own coaches as role models. 
Research last January showed that only 31% of the varsity head coaching 
positions for girls' sports in Orange County were held by women. In large-team 
sports such as soccer and track, the percentage is less than a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times in 1992, Mark Trakh, then coach of the 
Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team, observed the plight of women's coaches in 
the county: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look around the county and every time there's a job opening for a 
girls' coach, chances are it will be a walk-on position. If it's a boys' coach, 
chances are it will be an on-campus teaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I coach all-star teams, I'll ask the players, 'Are girls' basketball 
teams just as important as the boys' teams on campus?' And the kids say, 'No 
way, are you kidding? (Boys) get the gym. And they care more about the boys 
than they do us.' I get that answer 80% to 90% of the time. You won't get that 
answer at Brea." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, by the way, has won five State championships in girls' basketball 
and often outdraws its boys' team, raising an interesting question: 
</P>
<P>
 Do high schools put less money into girls' sports because people don't like to 
watch them, thus generating less revenue for the school? Or are these sports 
less interesting because less money and attention is given to them? 
</P>
<P>
 In this installment of Prep Voices, The Times Orange County asks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Are boys' and girls' athletic programs treated equally at the high school 
level?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No, they are not treated equally. It is improving, but it is taking a 
painfully long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports have been so thoroughly male-dominated for so long that it will be many 
years in the making before there is true gender equality in high school sports. 
The so-called high-profile sports (ie. football, boys' basketball, etc.) will 
continue to dominate because they are revenue-producing and because most 
current coaches and administrators grew up with it just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 We will most likely have to wait until the post "Title IX Generation" begins 
to take its place in the ranks of administrative and coaching positions before 
we can see any appreciable change. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is exacerbated by the fact that males have a far greater 
opportunity to go on to a professional level than do females. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Viens, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Public high schools are doing their best to comply with Title IX. There are 
plenty of concerned parents and responsible athletic directors watching over 
things at the school level. Girls' athletic programs are thriving and college 
scholarships are widely available for the boy and girl athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, girls' and boys' athletic programs are treated equally at the high school 
level, but no, they are not treated equally by the media and society. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society has been geared to men's sports since the first Olympics. It 
cannot change quickly without help. To attain sports gender equity and 
popularity, two things must happen: First, legislation must provide women's 
sports with more than equal affirmative-action type funding until parity is 
reached. And second, a Title IX-type law is needed to prevent sex bias and sex 
discrimination in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Houston, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' teams at my high school do not receive nearly as much publicity as all 
the male teams do. All-female teams and especially the performing teams, such 
as color guard and dance team, seem to be thought of as inferior to the boys' 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike our well-known football team, we are not supported by the school and 
seem virtually unknown. Many male athletes are known and revered by the school 
and community, but how many female athletes do you know of? 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Rivett, Los Alamitos High sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I do believe that boys' and girls' sports are treated the same in high 
school, at least at Tustin High. I think that Title IX is ruining sports at the 
college level. 
</P>
<P>
 High school is one thing, college is another. In high school, they're treated 
fairly and equally. In college, they're trying to make it fair and equal, but 
it's killing the small, minor sports, especially water polo. A number of 
universities have dropped men's swimming and water polo. Schools are having to 
drop other programs, such as UCI's baseball team and UCLA dropped swimming, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the high school level, I feel they're treated equally. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salvino, Tustin High water polo coach 
</P>
<P>
 I definitely believe that boys' sports are treated better than girls' sports 
just for the simple fact that we had a guys' basketball team that was probably 
7-15 (actually, 11-14) and a girls' basketball team that was 32-1, and still 
the guys got treated better than the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Henderson, Woodbridge, Class of '94 
</P>
<P>
 Title IX was passed because the powers that be in high school and college 
sports were not treating women's sports fairly. The object of Title IX should 
have been to ensure an opportunity for women in sports. Instead, it is a law 
that is very unrealistically designed around a quota basis. 
</P>
<P>
 One premise of Title IX is that unless the percentage of male-to-female 
athletics or sports teams is not near the (ratio of) male-to-female population 
of the school, then the school is in violation of Title IX. It is unrealistic 
to believe that under any circumstance the number of women interested in 
participating in a sports program in high school or college will ever approach 
the percentage of males that are doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The quota requirement has resulted in schools dropping minor sports for males. 
This trend has only started and will be magnified in the near future unless 
Congress changes the approach of this law. Unless this law is amended, it will 
eventually cause the demise of all male-based non-revenue sports in both 
college and high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's athletics have realized tremendous growth in recent years, partially 
because of Title IX, and that needs to be acknowledged. But there are many 
other factors that have also contributed to this growth. We need leadership at 
the high school level to find the appropriate level and programs for women's 
sports, because without this foundation, sports for both males and females will 
continue to be adversely affected at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, the coaches for both male and female non-revenue sports will band 
together to provide this leadership. Without it, the coaches of non-revenue 
male teams have no future, and the coaches for the female teams will be 
fighting the coaches from the male teams for their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlyn F. Obert, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 We have an incredible disparity in what the boys' athletics receive at 
Foothill and what the girls do. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is right now, there is not one woman (who is a) full-time or even 
part-time P.E. teacher at the school -- they're all males. All the large boys' 
sports have full-time coaches who have been offered teaching positions at the 
school. This is the first time in probably seven years that the girls' 
basketball program actually has a coach -- who's a male -- who's been hired to 
be a teacher. For seven years, they've only offered walk-on (positions) and all 
the other sports for girls are walk-ons except for the ones that are combined 
with the boys' sports. Those male instructors or coaches also have teaching 
positions at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 All the boys' laundry is done, their uniforms are taken care of and 
everything. The girls have to do all theirs themselves. All the coaches for the 
girls' sports have to be completely responsible for every aspect of their 
program, where the boys' sports have a multitude of staff members to assist 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity is incredible at our high school, and it doesn't seem to be 
changing very quickly. It's been going on for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Helm, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that I don't think is fair is that girls' cross-country gets made 
fun of a lot by football players, because the guys think they're so great and 
get more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie McNew, Pacifica High junior 
</P>
<P>
 In major ways such as salary and respect for coaches, yes, there is equality. 
But in many, many little ways, there is not. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, my high school girls' varsity team just this past Thursday had to 
carry their own water jugs while the JV boys' football team got the water 
driven to them in a motorized cart. They had five cheerleaders cheering their 
JV football game while we had no one supporting our varsity girls' tennis 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 This is 1,000% better than the situation was when I was in high school, so I 
don't complain. I enjoy my work. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Judd, Troy High girls' tennis coach 
</P>
<P>
 I believe boys' and girls' programs are treated equally. I believe we lose 
sight of the fact that schools are built for education. If boys' sports or 
girls' sports are played, then the money generated by that individual sport 
should be spent to pay for that individual sport -- whether it be the stadium, 
the equipment that the people use, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tremendous cost, athletics are on a downhill slide today. I 
think the institutions are failing to realize why they were built, which is an 
education purpose, not an athletic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Grothus, Balboa Peninsula 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school soccer coach in 1992, I interviewed for a girls' head 
coaching position with a high school in northern Orange County. The interview 
took place in a room with the principal, athletic director and eight to 10 
people, mostly men. 
</P>
<P>
 I was asked why I was applying for the girls' position when there were three 
positions open: girls' head coach, boys' head coach and boys' junior varsity. I 
had not been aware of the boys' openings and I told them that I wanted to coach 
girls because they always got the short end of the stick, such as the muddy 
field or weakest referee. From coaching girls and realizing the treatment they 
got, I had become a women's rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 I was then asked, if given the job, did I know someone who would coach the 
girls' JV for free, as this was not a paid position. I told them no, I did not 
know of anyone who would coach the girls' JV for free, and guess what . . . I 
was not selected for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was quite comical and sad that officials of a high school would 
demonstrate such low regard for girls' equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Kent, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 I am an eighth-grader at Doig Intermediate School in Garden Grove. At our 
school, girls' and boys' sports are equal because everything we play, they play 
too, except football. They play tennis, baseball, soccer, swimming and golf. 
Guys play these sports too. Sometimes I think girls get better stuff because 
they get better equipment for sports and we get the old equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lopez, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 At my high school, the football team has held tryouts and girls are equally 
encouraged to try out and perform their best at that level and in other sports 
as well. Our school is not sexually biased. The coaches do give an equal 
opportunity to males and females. Everybody is treated fairly.

CHRIS FOSTER; THE POINT MUST BE MADE, AND SHE WILL WRESTLE IT TO THE GROUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a couple things we take for granted in this wacky, male-dominated 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Men are physically superior. 
</P>
<P>
 2. When rule No. 1 doesn't apply, find an excuse and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 So meet Goldie Yavari, Los Alamitos senior and female wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldie wasn't trying to make a point beyond her match scores. Nope, she just 
wanted to wrestle. Trouble was, there aren't any female wrestling teams out 
there, not in high school. So Goldie joined the boys' junior varsity team last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first match was a first-rate male ego-bruiser. No, she didn't win, but she 
came close. She lost by one but gave up two points because of mistakes. She 
hadn't completely learned the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, her opponent had experienced quite enough gender equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates were congratulating Yavari on her performance. Her opponent, 
meanwhile, began complaining about this ankle injury, which had obviously 
affected his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, good ol' rule No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in this wacky, male-dominated world, we seem to pick and chose just what 
sports women are capable of playing. For their own good, mind you. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis. Fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball. OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball. Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, we guys were magnanimous enough to toss in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to the he-man stuff, well, that's where gender equity stopped 
being equal. 
</P>
<P>
 So, guess you can pardon one poor sap for being embarrassed about getting tied 
in knots by a girl . He just couldn't deal with it.  
</P>
<P>
 He and other folks in Orange County wrestling circles had better learn. 
There's a good chance that Yavari will be the 103-pound wrestler on the varsity 
this season. So, guys, have your alibis handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavari doesn't spout off about gender equity. She's just Exhibit A in the case 
to support it. She's proving that women can pick and choose their own sports. 
</P>
<P>
 She picked wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavari had been active as a kid in soccer, swimming, volleyball, basketball -- 
your basic youth-sports tour of duty. But she never played sports at Connelly, 
an all-girls high school. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to understand, Connelly just isn't the center of the athletic solar 
system. It's more like Pluto. But Los Alamitos, now, that was a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavari wasn't looking to push out the envelope in this wacky, male-dominated 
world when she transferred to Los Alamitos before her junior year. But she was 
flabbergasted by what the school had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics. Lots of them. That old competitive fire burned. She had to play, 
but which sport? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrestling was revered in her family. Her father, Parvic, had competed as a 
young man in Iran. He waxes nostalgic about it, and his only child gobbled it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she still had a thing or two to learn about the sport. Top of the 
list being it was a men's club. That soon changed, at least at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents weren't exactly thrilled at first. But once they saw their 
daughter compete, the Yavaris were sold. Besides, her mother, Lila, had been 
the only female student in her engineering class. So she knew what a woman 
could achieve, given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldie, it turned out, was a natural. She had never wrestled before, but more 
than held her own against her teammates. She participated in two junior varsity 
matches, losing both. 
</P>
<P>
 Not satisfied, Yavari set out to improve. She was not going to be a novelty. 
She attended a wrestling camp and made a pest of herself at open gyms. It paid 
off.

 Yavari competed in the women's nationals in Las Vegas last spring. She heard 
about the competition a week before the event and just showed up. She finished 
fourth out of 16 wrestlers in her weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad. But there is still some unfinished business. Yavari is ready for this 
season and, in her mind, capability is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's the only rule to live by in this wacky, male-dominated world.

ARE BOYS' AND GIRLS' ATHLETIC PROGRAMS TREATED EQUALLY?; YES: TITLE IX HAS 
HELPED PROMOTE INTEREST IN, AND FUNDING FOR, GIRLS' SPORTS PROGRAMS.

 As an athletic director, I continue to battle for "my kids" -- all my kids, 
regardless of gender. We at Katella High School do not choose to divide and 
conquer. We strive to provide the most and the best possible for our athletes, 
not male or female, but athletes . 
</P>
<P>
 There is one budget. Funds are not initially doled out to "major" sports 
programs before the whole picture is analyzed and needs are assessed. 
Fund-raising, of course, is a must for all. Each coach submits a wish list at 
the end of the school year. The athletic directors prioritize the items on all 
of the lists and allocate the budget accordingly. Revenue-producing sports 
naturally are going to reap the benefits of budget appropriation, since those 
sports do help subsidize other areas of the athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 Through our All Sports Booster Club, we attempt to initiate projects that 
benefit all student athletes. Community support is a godsend. Without the 
thousands of hours volunteered by parents and surrounding community each year, 
our athletic program would be severely handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of the beast, however, girls' sports programs have 
generally been simmering on the back burner. Since the emergence of Title IX, a 
renewed concern has kindled the flame. Instead of focusing on the past and 
dwelling on those things that have been missing for so long (things that should 
be a given), let's take a look at where we are going and the major strides that 
have been made. Again, I am defining Katella High's disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the support of Anaheim Memorial Hospital, we have gained a full-time 
trainer who administers to male and female athletes. As it should be. 
Scholarship opportunities are equally available to both genders. As it should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of coaching stipends is the same in like sports, such as boys' and 
girls' basketball. Fund-raising efforts and bingo profits subsidize additional 
coaching positions. Coaches in like sports are paid the same stipend. As it 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutoring is available for male and female student-athletes who are 
experiencing difficulty in the classroom. Administrative support is strong with 
an administrator in attendance at most varsity games, home and away. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a plan to create an athletic team room for female athletes. 
Currently, there is no such area for the girls' sports programs. The boys' 
program has two team rooms. We are not dwelling on the negative, though. We are 
moving forward and implementing the positive. As it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 If your school is lacking in terms of program equity, perhaps you might choose 
to begin with identifying the problem and begin a positive, systematic approach 
to securing fair, quality personnel throughout your program. If equity does not 
exist, by all means, address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, of course, is to create a situation that is fair for all . 
</P>
<P>
 As it should be.

ARE BOYS' AND GIRLS' ATHLETIC PROGRAMS TREATED EQUALLY?; NO: ON THE SURFACE, 
TITLE IX HAS GIVEN GIRLS' PROGRAMS A BOOST, BUT RESULTS ARE MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In 1972 when Title IX passed, I was 10. I remember reading about Title IX and 
discussing it with my parents; like me, they were excited about the 
opportunities it would provide for girls and women in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Title IX seems to have done what it was supposed to do: open 
the door for girls to have the same opportunities and experiences in sports 
that boys have traditionally had to themselves. Certainly from a player's point 
of view, I was able to benefit from quality coaching, equal facilities, a 
heightened level of competition, and the opportunity to play under scholarship 
at the NCAA Division I level. I am sure that most high school and college 
athletes would agree that Title IX has accomplished bridging the gap between 
men's and women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in 1994, after 10 years of coaching at both the high school and collegiate 
level, I have some mixed feelings concerning the current level of equality in 
men's and women's and boys' and girls' programs. 
</P>
<P>
 First, without a strong head coach, girls' and women's programs are often 
"walked on" regarding gym time, uniforms, money, equipment, salaries and the 
hiring of qualified assistant coaches. Secondly, without strong administrative 
and community support, even successful women's programs do not get the 
publicity and recognition they deserve. Thirdly, providing strong positive role 
models for women's sports needs to be more of a priority for school 
administrators. There are qualified, experienced coaches out there, whether 
they are on campus or within the community. The administrators in our schools 
need to take more time to find and hire the most qualified, rather than the 
most convenient person for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, when Title IX passed, more than 90% of women's sports teams were 
coached by women. In 1990, only 47.3% of female teams were coached by women, 
and the numbers continue to drop every year. With so many more girls 
participating in sports and going on to earn scholarships playing at the 
collegiate level, there should be an increasingly larger pool of qualified 
applicants for the jobs available. Today's high school and college coaches for 
female teams need to encourage their players to consider coaching as a viable 
career, and provide a role model that their players would be proud to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Title IX has definitely brought the inequalities to the surface, and since its 
inception, girls' and women's programs have grown in leaps and bounds. Along 
with the gains and the benefits, women's programs have also begun to experience 
some of the problems of men's athletics: illegal recruiting, academic 
ineligibility, specialization in one sport at an early age, and a "win at all 
costs" attitude. As professionals working for what is best for the 
student-athlete, regardless of gender, we must continue to strive to provide 
quality programs with quality instruction and guidance for all athletes.

PROP. 187 UPROAR DISPLACES SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of outrage in Mexico over Proposition 187, the Tijuana Cultural Center 
has canceled a scheduled joint concert Friday in Tijuana between the San Diego 
Symphony Orchestra and the Baja Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than let the event die, however, the San Diego Symphony has rescheduled 
the joint concert, to feature a Mexican version of "Romeo and Juliet," to 
Copley Symphony Hall in downtown San Diego on the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is crazy to have art and politics mix like this," said San Diego 
Symphony executive director Michael Tiknis. "We've been banned from Mexico. For 
what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Pardo Aceves, sub-director of the Tijuana Cultural Center, notified 
Tiknis last week that the Proposition 187 controversy had caused Mexican 
sponsors to withdraw support for the concert. Also, Aceves said that the center 
could not ensure the safety of the San Diego musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Symphony was to be paid $30,000 for the joint concert, to 
feature Guillermo Briseno's version of "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-member Baja Orchestra includes 12 Russian emigre musicians living in 
Tijuana. TONY PERRY

EUROPE: FIVE YEARS LATER; THE BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WALL FACTS The Wall began as a barrier between the east and west sides of 
Berlin, but it was later extended to surround West Berlin, sealing it off 
entirely from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concrete structure that faced the West was made up of three-ton panels 
on average 11 1/2 feet tall, 3 1/2 feet wide and 8 to 10 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 * In some places, the barrier had up to nine elements, including guard towers 
and a vehicle barrer trench. 
</P>
<P>
 * 45,000 panels were used. Each cost 856 marks to manufacture, or $572 at the 
current exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * The panels were originally intended for use as building blocks for corn 
silos. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wall-peckers" was the nickname given by Berliners to the entrepreneurs who 
chiseled out and sold chunks of the Wall as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * East Germany sold 70 of the most interesting panels at auction in Monaco 
with plans to apply the proceeds to improving health care and restoring 
historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average price at auction: 30,000 marks, or about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the 230 panels not sold at the auction have left Berlin as gifts, 
from the East German government or through private sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the rest of the Wall has either been ground up for paving material 
or sent back out into the eastern German countryside to be used in construction 
of corn silos. WHERE THE WALL IS NOW 
</P>
<P>
 Panels from the Berlin Wall are now at sites scattered all over the world, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Freedom Forum World Center in Arlington, Va., a human rights and press 
freedom center, which has 10 panels and the Checkpoint Charlie guardhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * The John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Danish artist Jens Galsciot Christophersen, who has two 
panels in Denmark and others on reserve in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 * The border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Gibauderie, the Paris home of cognac heiress and former Yugoslav actress 
Ljiljana Hennessy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hotel Metropole Palace in Monte Carlo. This panel was a gift of the East 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Vatican, the gift of clergymen from the former East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Jaguba Rizzoli in Cap Ferrat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * The German town of Dingelstedt, which has made the panel into a sundial. 
</P>
<P>
 * The collection of Thomas Steffen, a master baker in the southern German town 
of Waldshut-Tiengen.

 It came suddenly. The Central Committee of the East German Communist Party 
announced at 7 p.m. that it had decided to relax travel restrictions. Then the 
state radio indicated that checkpoints along the infamous Berlin Wall would be 
opened. The flood began. Thousands of East Germans headed, without exit visas, 
for West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those scenes fixed forever in the memories of correspondents 
like myself and all the others who were there in Berlin on that flood-lit night 
of Thursday, Nov. 9, 1989. It was the most dramatic event in Europe since the 
end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 East German border guards, instead of shooting, stood by as Berliners passed 
through the hated and impregnable Wall that had divided their city. Hundreds of 
jubilant Germans from the East climbed atop the graffiti-scrawled section in 
front of the massive columns of the Brandenburg Gate to hail the unity of 
Berlin and all it portended. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long, exuberant pre-dawn hours, everyone around me was full of 
excitement and filled with relief that it had happened without violence. Berlin 
that night became a capital of hope.
