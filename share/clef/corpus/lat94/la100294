WHY ELVIS?; FORGET THE MESSIAH WITH THE GUITAR -- THE KING WAS JUST A SWEET

 'Last Train to Memphis," part one of Peter Guralnick's projected two-volume 
biography of Elvis Presley, starts off slow and easy -- not with Elvis himself, 
but with Sam and Dewey Phillips, the two men who years later would send him 
down the road to stardom. This is on purpose. Guralnick aims to give us not the 
Elvis we already know -- the larger-than-life Elvis of myth and merchandising 
-- but "the real Elvis Presley" as he emerged from the fertile soil of the 
Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts much of the focus on people such as Sam Phillips, the Memphis 
recording entrepreneur whose Sun label issued Elvis' first recordings, and 
Dewey Phillips (no relation), the Memphis deejay who first put them on the air. 
It also involves setting the record straight on any number of questions, like 
who Sam Phillips really was and what he had in mind when he brought the 
19-year-old Presley into his little storefront recording studio. For instance: 
Did Phillips really say, as the late Albert Goldman maintained in his 1981 
biography, "Elvis," that he was looking for "a white boy who could sing like a 
nigger"? As capital of a vast cotton-growing region where black labor yielded 
white wealth, Memphis was a rich stew of folk cultures kept distinct by strict 
racial taboo. When Dewey Phillips, a white boy spinning colored platters 
nightly on WHBQ, began to pick up a white audience, that taboo started to wane. 
Sam Phillips' recording of Elvis was the logical next step. Was Phillips acting 
out of casual, unthinking contempt for black music, or out of passion and 
respect? It's a critical question, because in the mythology of rock 'n' roll, 
the racism of Phillips' ambition as reported by Goldman stands out as something 
like original sin. 
</P>
<P>
 Guralnick paints Phillips as a man whose devotion to rhythm & blues made him a 
serious nonconformist in the Memphis of the early 1950s -- hardly the kind of 
man who'd say "nigger." He also says Goldman got the quote wrong, but he saves 
that information for a source note that fails even to acknowledge the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 What we have here is a biography that is at once magisterial and quirky. A 
Massachusetts writer who in such earlier books as "Sweet Soul Music" and 
"Searching for Robert Johnson" has explored with affection and intelligence the 
Southern music that gave rise to rock 'n' roll, Guralnick has produced the 
definitive chronicle of Elvis' early years -- of his rise from obscurity and 
his launch to unparalleled stardom. But in his zeal to scrape away the glittery 
encrustation of myth, to "rescue" Elvis from the mass adulation he inspired, he 
is relentlessly singleminded. He refuses to delve into messy questions of 
motivation and psyche. He declines to acknowledge exactly what it is he's 
rescuing Elvis from. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the torrent of books on Elvis, from sizzling exposes by disgruntled 
ex-attendants to the tart confessional of ex-wife Priscilla, only one other 
writer has attempted a full-scale biography in the 17 years since his death. 
That was Albert Goldman, who ridiculed Elvis and his world so mercilessly that 
Greil Marcus -- a critic with whom Guralnick has much affinity -- accused him 
of attempting "cultural genocide." It's probably beside the point to suggest 
that Goldman might have been acting partly out of self-loathing, that he might 
have identified with Elvis in some way he was or was not prepared to admit. Yet 
despite its carpetbagger mentality, its eagerness to dismiss Elvis and all 
around him as woefully ignorant hillbillies, his "Elvis" is a fried 
peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich of a book, as irresistibly over the top as a 
performance by the King. 
</P>
<P>
 Guralnick, calm and meticulous, is more akin to Sam Phillips, the musicologist 
he once described as a "lifelong hero." His Elvis is neither dumb yokel nor 
rock 'n' roll messiah, just a pimply, poor white mama's boy from the Mid-South, 
untutored and inarticulate, whose vague yearning to be a star lands him in 
worlds he never dreamed of. Though he seems nearly as much a function of time 
and place as of talent and personality, his rise was clearly no accident. 
Guralnick presents him as the vessel, Sam and Dewey Phillips as the catalysts, 
and rock 'n' roll as a historical inevitability that sweeps all before it like 
a Mississippi flood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why him ?" other Memphis boys kept asking in the summer of 1954, when Sun 
issued his first single, "That's All Right Mama" backed with "Blue Moon of 
Kentucky" -- country blues with a hillbilly twang slapped back to back against 
a bluesy rendition of an old Bill Monroe blue-grass hit. It was a strange 
interlude in the Elvis story, a brief stop-time between total obscurity and 
mass adulation, and Guralnick lets it unfold in slow-motion, the days ticking 
off one by one while fame looms ahead like an oncoming freight train. There 
were a hundred other kids in Memphis with talent and ambition, any one of them 
more accomplished than this greasy-haired truck driver who wore weird clothes 
and sometimes worried about whether or not he'd make a competent electrician. 
Why him? To Marion Keisker, Sam Phillips's assistant, "he was like a mirror in 
a way: whatever you were looking for, you were going to find in him. . . . He 
had all the intricacy of the very simple." 
</P>
<P>
 This ability to mirror the dreams and yearnings of others is the hallmark of 
every great star, from Judy Garland to Marilyn Monroe to James Dean. Within two 
years, Elvis would be one of them. Variety would declare him a millionaire on 
the basis of back-to-back hit singles and nationwide television appearances and 
coast-to-coast concert dates and multiple motion-picture deals. His mother 
Gladys wished he would just quit right now, marry some nice girl and settle 
down in Memphis; but of course he couldn't, he was hooked, not just by sudden 
wealth and fame but by the only-child's need for friendship and acceptance, 
which in his present circumstances took the form of an entourage. And, of 
course, he had the Colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Tom Parker -- ex-carny, Southern-fried sharpie, hustler extraordinaire -- 
was the central figure of Elvis's adult life, the instrument of his success and 
destruction. By shouldering aside his previous manager and signing him with RCA 
Records, Nashville music publisher Hill & Range, and the William Morris Agency 
(which in turn made his television, motion picture and merchandising deals), 
the Colonel lifted Elvis above his regional horizons and made him a national 
sensation. At the same time Parker deliberately limited his contact with other 
creative artists, such as songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (authors of 
"Hound Dog"), whose attempts to befriend Elvis and lead him off the 
merry-go-round were thwarted repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leiber went to the Colonel's cronies with a proposal from producer 
Charlie Feldman to have Elvis star in "A Walk on the Wild Side" with Elia Kazan 
directing, the response was unequivocal: If Leiber continued to interfere, 
they'd make sure he never worked with Elvis again. So the Colonel circumscribed 
Elvis' existence, kept him isolated and infantilized, and ensured that his 
career would be run as the Colonel saw fit, which is to say, for maximum 
short-term advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colonel Parker is more or less like a daddy when I'm away from my own folks," 
Guralnick has Elvis telling a New York newspaper columnist in 1957, when he was 
living in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and making "Jailhouse Rock" at the MGM lot 
in Culver City. That a 22-year-old singing sensation would feel a need for a 
daddy goes a long way toward explaining what went wrong. Even so, Elvis' 
willingness to let himself be exploited is a mystery that Guralnick does little 
to clear up. It suggests a passivity that went beyond mere country-boy 
innocence to become a core personality trait. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again, Elvis let himself be led into situations that mocked his 
talents and diminished his possibilities. His notorious July, 1956, appearance 
on "The Steve Allen Show," when he agreeably donned white tie and tails in 
order to croon "(You Ain't Nothin' But a) Hound Dog" to a basset hound, was 
just a warm-up. A few months later he arrived in Hollywood with visions of 
becoming the next James Dean -- a not-unrealistic expectation, given his 
head-start as a rebel figure and a natural talent that was recognized by 
everyone from Walter Matthau to director Michael Curtiz. Instead he found 
himself breaking into song in the middle of formula musicals that parodied 
everything he stood for. 
</P>
<P>
 Guralnick makes it clear that by 1957 Elvis was in way over his head. Yet the 
discrepancy between the ambition that propelled him toward stardom and the 
passivity that undercut him once he got there was only one of the 
contradictions in his makeup. He was -- to quote Sam Phillips correctly -- the 
white boy with "the negro sound and the negro feel." He was also the Christian 
believer whose music was derided as the devil's work, the drug-hating performer 
who would become hopelessly addicted to pills, the mama's boy who personified 
teen rebellion. His intense mother-fixation was as central to his personality 
as his innate passivity, and probably had a lot to do with it. But you won't 
find much explanation of that here, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Guralnick repeatedly resists the temptation -- or ignores the opportunity, 
depending on how you look at it -- to speculate on motivation. His job is 
simply to document. It's a puritanical technique, a strait-laced, hair-in-a-bun 
approach, as if insight were a transgression that might lead pell-mell down the 
path to the wildest form of psychobiography. Occasionally he slips into 
reverie, allowing himself to imagine the details of Elvis' daily existence in 
magical passages that carry the mystery and seductiveness of a sepia 
photograph. "Does she give the man a quick kiss?" he writes, describing Gladys 
as she greets her husband and their little boy at the end of a day no one 
bothered to record. "Perhaps. The picture is blurred. But she hugs the boy as 
if he might have been gone for years." Deeper than this he will not venture. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're left with is a cautionary tale, an elegiac lament for dreams come 
true. Less than two years after winning the jackpot in the sweepstakes of fame, 
Elvis is as dissatisfied with his prize as he is paralyzed from fear of losing 
it. "Last Train to Memphis" stops abruptly in September, 1958, when, still numb 
with grief after his mother's unexpected death, Elvis boards a U.S. Army troop 
ship for Germany. It's a good place to pause, not just because Gladys' demise 
is often regarded as a blow from which he never recovered, but because this 
unwelcome hiatus in his career might have given him a chance to grow up, to 
break free from the Colonel's grip and seize control of his destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't, of course. But to think about Elvis is always to feel the lure of 
what might have been -- if he hadn't fallen under the Colonel's sway, if he 
hadn't thrown his talent away on hack work, if he hadn't been so nice . The 
virtue of Guralnick's approach is that it forces us to forget what might have 
been and see what was. Only then can we trace the intricate contradictions 
beneath the surface simplicity that turned Elvis into the mirror we cannot put 
down today.

THE PLEASURES OF FAREWELL; ANTAEUS 75/76: FINAL ISSUE, FALL, 1994, EDITED BY 
DANIEL HALPERN (ECCO: $17; 396 PP.)  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For some months now, rumors have been slithering quietly along the floor of 
the literary world that Antaeus, one of the most important magazines of the 
last 50 years, would be publishing its last issue. And here it is at last, "the 
distinguished thing," as Henry James once said on the occasion of another 
death, and it's actually a double issue, numbers 75 and 76 together. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should a magazine that most people haven't heard of, let alone read, whose 
circulation was, at tops, about 10,000, be so mourned? To put it simply, 
Antaeus reminded us how good writing could be. It provided a measure of 
greatness, not only for writers, but for other magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's editor, Daniel Halpern, published its first issue in the fall 
of 1970, and since then has been the single judge of what each issue will 
include. Halpern, raised in Los Angeles, had originally met Paul Bowles while 
that legendary writer was teaching at Cal State Northridge; then accepted 
Bowles' invitation to spend some time with him in Morocco. It was Bowles' offer 
of $900 as a stake, and his introductions to other writers (including John 
Fowles, Jerzy Kosinski, Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams), that convinced 
Halpern to begin the publication. Then, and throughout Antaeus' 25 years of 
life, its goal was to "mix the well known and the unknown," the American and 
international, the works of the canon with unusual. Always a centrist 
publication, Antaeus was never one of those magazines (also valuable) 
established to promote a single literary point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this last issue, as if we needed one, is a reminder of the stature of all 
that went before. The table of contents of those contributing fiction alone is 
a Who's Who of contemporary writers, including Margaret Atwood, Russell Banks, 
Ann Beattie, Paul Bowles, Sandra Cisneros, Don Delillo, Richard Ford (the 
definitive motel inspector story), Nadine Gordimer, Stephen King (!), R. K. 
Narayan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jane Smiley, William Trevor and Tobias Wolff. And 
whether by coincidence or design, the subjects of the fiction in this last 
issue cover murder, death, kidnaping, disappearances, theft, lost causes, lost 
sight, lost homes, lost souls, lost children, lost love and lost birds -- a 
long wave of goodby from its contributors over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The poetry is equally accomplished, though more varied in tone, and the 
section called "Documents," which reprints some material from previous issues, 
offers us essays by Calvino and Gass, the notebooks of Bill Clinton (before he 
was elected President, and amazing in their impersonality -- as if already they 
are meant to be delivered from a public podium), some previously unpublished 
poems of Hart Crane and what used to be the first two chapters of "The Sun Also 
Rises," before they were cut, partly it seems, on the very good advice of F. 
Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 What a feast this whole issue is, and if some of the pieces, as inevitable in 
a tribute of this kind, seem a bit brief, they are tasty, and as before any 
trek across a barren country, readers would do well to stock up. Fortunately, 
Antaeus' offshoot and now its bereaved parent, Ecco Press, will continue, for 
as unimaginable as it is to mark the end of the magazine, to lose Ecco, one of 
the nation's most indispensable presses, would be unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best magazines are done," Halpern says, not by professionals, but by 
"people starting out who feel strongly." So other magazines will appear in 
time, and perhaps one of them will come to assume the importance of Antaeus, 
and then eventually its editor, if he or she is wise, will also step down, "not 
wanting to repeat myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the loss of Antaeus will be felt deeply, and perhaps the most 
fitting elegy of its passing is to be found within its own pages -- the Greek 
poet, Cavafy, writing of the great poems (or magazines) as if they were sailing 
ships: "During our lifetime we see two or three of them at most. And we forget 
them quickly. Equal to the radiance of the vision is the swiftness of its 
passing. And after a few years have gone by, if -- as we sit passively gazing 
at the light or listening to the silence -- if someday certain inspiring verses 
return by chance to our mind's hearing, we do not recognize them at first and 
we torment our memory trying to recollect where we heard them before. With 
great effort the old remembrance is awakened, and we recall that those verses 
are from the song chanted by the sailors, handsome as the heroes of the Iliad, 
when the great, exquisite ships would go by on their way -- who knows where."

THE AUDACITY OF THE MAN; MRS. THATCHER'S MINISTER: THE PRIVATE DIARIES OF ALAN 
CLARK, BY ALAN CLARK (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $30; 421 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nigel Nicolson, Nigel Nicolson was a member of Parliament in the years after 
World War II. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Clark, having achieved only junior ministerial rank under Margaret 
Thatcher, is now as famous in Britain as any of the leading members of her 
Cabinet. How so? First because he has publicly told unpleasant truths about the 
sale of weapon-making machinery to Iraq shortly before the Gulf War, and this 
will soon result in a crisis for John Major's government. Secondly because he 
was cited a few months ago as the lover of a judge's wife and her two 
daughters, simultaneously. And above all, for the publication of these diaries 
for the years 1983-91, when he was at the center, if not at the top, of British 
government. They form the most indiscreet, the most readable, the wittiest 
record of how modern politicians actually behave. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not a maverick nor a libertine. He is a man of sharp intelligence, 
unusual literary gifts, abounding energy, great wit and a capacity for scorn 
that rivals Pontius Pilate's. He is that rare person who never shirks the 
truth. Almost any other man would have been flattened by the judge's 
revelations. Clark simply admitted them, and it was the judge who was made to 
look foolish, while Clark turned to more important things, like climbing 
mountains on his Scottish estate, racing his old roadsters and writing up his 
latest escapades for eventual publication (one hopes) in another installment of 
his diary. 
</P>
<P>
 He has now left politics. He entered the House of Commons with Mrs. Thatcher, 
and left it with her, but without the peerage she achieved. He adored her, and 
she to some extent returned his admiration, relishing his audacity, his delight 
in political maneuvering, his ambition and his courage, all qualities she 
shared; but not his amateurishness, his dilettante style, his longing to escape 
the political treadmill for the Alps or the moors, for she was a workaholic 
with no outside interests, while Clark had many, not least the company of 
attractive girls. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was Kenneth Clark of "Civilization," to whom Alan was never close, 
and who died, according to his son, "poisoned" by his second wife. Alan 
inherited a great art collection, a castle in Kent and a fortune that enabled 
him to take risks with his career that poorer men would avoid, like publishing 
these diaries. He doesn't care that at the next dinner party he attends (for he 
is still very sociable) he might meet an ex-colleague whom he describes in the 
diary as "a sanctimonious little creep," or John Major's present chancellor, 
Kenneth Clarke, "a pudgy puff-ball," or the Prince of Wales, "pretty useless," 
or King Hussein of Jordan, "that oily little runt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to shock," he writes, but he was also capable of great affection, 
particularly for his admirable wife Jane to whom these confessions (they can 
scarcely be described otherwise) are dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were all vituperation and self-aggrandizement, the book might become 
tedious. It is not. It describes from the inside, but not the innermost, the 
drama of British politics during those nine years of Thatcher's premiership, 
when Clark was successively the middle-ranking minister for employment, trade 
and defense. It was the period of the Falklands War, the Gulf War and of 
Thatcher's brutal removal from Downing Street. At first Clark, new to office, 
was alternately bored and scared, as in war, but as his confidence mounted, he 
threw caution to the winds, achieved some successes, suffered some devastating 
setbacks and rode politics like a roller coaster, hungry for publicity and 
fame: 
</P>
<P>
 "How I do enjoy my job! And how full of vitality I feel. . . . So where do I 
go from here? The objective must be now -- and I mean now, very shortly, July 
at the latest -- to displace the Secretary of State" (June 22, 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course he never did. Most men, if bold enough to publish their diaries so 
soon after the event, would omit or amend such passages. Not so Alan Clark. His 
honesty in publishing equals his honesty in writing. He wishes us to share his 
ambition, his gusto, his defiance of convention, his amusement at the caprice 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 You do not need to read this book straight through nor be familiar with the 
grammar of English politics. All you need is an understanding of human nature 
and a wish to share with Alan Clark the belief that nothing is shocking except 
cruelty. Otherwise anything goes: Brazen is best. A politician must be as 
unlike a bureaucrat as possible. He must ski and drive and climb at speed, 
outsmart a rival, succor a lame duck, act contrary to all advice, break 
precedents, never fear to insult, never stoop to flattery and, if a conference 
drones on and on, always look forward to the possibility that there might be a 
pretty girl at the reception.

NOT THE GUY HE KNEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wonderful interview piece on America's favorite gridiron strategist, hardware 
huckster and autumn-weekend-afternoon companion, John Madden, and his move to 
Fox ("Gridiron John," by Sean Mitchell, Sept. 4). How'd you get it? 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years ago, Madden was a 1959 graduate student and freshman 
football coach at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. New San Diego State Coach Ted 
Tollner was Madden's quarterback that year. I was a freshman sportswriter on 
the school paper, El Mustang, and was lucky to get six words out of Madden in 
many a 30-minute interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The first few times I saw Madden on TV I could hardly believe it was the same 
person. Someone's elocution academy is missing out on a helluva testimonial.

AN ORCHID IN A LAND OF THORNS 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times staff writer Denise Hamilton was in the Balkans last 
year on a Fulbright Fellowship.

 Night had fallen and the power was out again so we got out the Coleman lantern 
and huddled around it. Outside, a torrential rain was transforming the dirt 
side streets into mud swamps. Inside, it was humid and smelled of bug spray. 
After much discussion, we decided not to visit the trendy club where Albanian 
nouveaux riches threw greenbacks at Russian girls who stripped on stage. When 
someone brought out a novel by Ismail Kadare, talk turned from the salacious to 
the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadare wasn't just famous in his small, impoverished, mountainous country. 
When I was in Albania last fall, the author, whose prose glimmers with the 
magic realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the bleakness of Jean Paul Sartre 
-- was up for a Nobel Prize in literature. I had even spotted him one night at 
the National Theater debut of "Waiting for Godot" -- the first time such bleak 
but appropriate fare had been staged by Albanian actors in their own language. 
</P>
<P>
 Albania's most famous export looked like a 1960s European intellectual: thick, 
black horn-rimmed glasses, piercing hawk eyes and wavy gray hair, holding court 
in the theater lobby as well-wishers paid their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to their nation's literary lion, Albanians remain deeply 
ambiguous. On one hand, they are proud because he is the only artist they have 
who commands the world stage. But they also feel betrayed, they will tell you, 
their hollow faces arching into grimaces, because Kadare abandoned them for a 
cushy berth in Paris in 1991, when his presence would have succored them after 
Communism fell and mobs destroyed factories, looted food warehouses and forced 
the closure of Tirana University. 
</P>
<P>
 And how to explain Kadare's long friendship with Enver Hoxha, Albania's 
Draconian leader until he died in 1985, who shielded the writer while most 
intellectuals were hounded -- often to death. Was Kadare, who came from Hoxha's 
hometown in a country where clans are all-important, the dictator's alter ego, 
his pinprick of conscience, expressing universal truths that Hoxha knew in his 
bones but could not countenance from anyone else?

 Albania has a long history of backwardness, obscurity, brigandry, gun worship 
and blood feuds. Despite small, elite clusters of Western-educated 
intellectuals prior to World War II, the country never experienced the 
Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Age or, until 
after World War II, the age of literacy. In a Communist regime that subverted 
all art to the politics of socialist realism, Kadare's survival was even more 
enigmatic. He was a hothouse orchid blooming in a land of thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't bring any of this up that night. Instead, I picked up his 
autobiographical novel, "Chronicle in Stone." 
</P>
<P>
 Its narrator is an unnamed Albanian boy who recounts with childhood sobriety 
how the Italians, the Greeks and finally the Nazis conquered his "gray immortal 
city," which is also never named in the book, but is understood to be his 
hometown, Gjirocaster. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a city where you could "walk down the street, stretch out your arm and 
hang your hat on a minaret," Kadare wrote. "Everything in the city was old and 
made of stone, from the streets and foundations to the roofs of the sprawling 
age-old houses covered with grey slates like gigantic scales. It was hard to 
believe that under this powerful carapace the tender flesh of life survived and 
reproduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a steep city, perhaps the steepest in the world, defying the laws of 
architecture and city planning. . . . It was surely the only place in the world 
where if you slipped and fell in the street, you might well land on the roof of 
a house -- a peculiarity known most intimately to drunks." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by these descriptions -- and the knowledge that Albania gets more 
beautiful as one leaves Tirana -- some friends and I hired a cab to visit 
Gjirocaster, which had writhed and moaned under the invaders' boots but 
survived the war, much like the Albanians themselves: 
</P>
<P>
 In Central Albania, we traversed steep mountain passes barren save for scrub 
and the occasional goat whose dun colors blended into a land deforested by 
poverty and deliberate environmental manipulation. It was a land and a mood 
that Kadare also evoked in "General of the Dead Army," which recounts the 
travails of an Italian officer who travels Albania to dig up and ship home the 
bodies of his fallen comrades during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hours later, we arrived, in air so pure and cold that it hurt to breathe. 
Kadare's city was severe and beautiful, perched on a mountain like an eagle's 
aerie. It looked unchanged since the Middle Ages, when a Crusade had passed 
through on the way to the Holy Land. Lyric Lord Byron had also graced these 
parts, passing through Tepolina on his way to die ignobly and too early in 1824 
at Missolonghi, Greece, fighting for Greek independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, the stunning cityscapes set against towering mountains 
remain, but other parts of Gjirocaster looked downright sinister. On the 
vertical streets, townspeople tugged protectively at our arms and warned: "You 
must be careful; there are bad ones among us." But they vied for the honor of 
inviting us into their whitewashed stone houses to bring out the traditional 
sweets and coffee. Inside the homes, long Turkish cushions still lined the wall 
much as Kadare had described, where women had sat to drink tea and gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Wandering in the waning light, we found the sheltering fig trees and grape 
arbors of Kadare's childhood. The stone homes still stood with their heavy 
doors and solid iron fittings. But the Addis Ababa cafe described by the 
anonymous boy in "Chronicle in Stone" is long gone. Today, thin men in shabby 
suit jackets hunker over syrupy coffee and raki -- the ubiquitous and fiery 
grape brandy -- in grim cafes that exude little of the charm such watering 
holes evoke elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Chronicle in Stone," Kadare describes how Gjirocaster's young radicals 
discussed Karl Jung and idly flipped a globe, dreaming of its wide and unknown 
expanses. Those youths, whose Western educations contrasted so starkly with 
their environs, took to Communism like thirsty plants during World War II. But 
did I detect a note of ambiguity as Kadare described how they ran off to the 
mountains to join the partisans? 
</P>
<P>
 "Young boys and girls are getting together in the cellars to sing forbidden 
songs," he wrote. "They say they want to destroy the old world and rebuild a 
new one. . . . They say that blood will have to be spilled for this new world 
to be built." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 40 years blood would gush, as Albania's paranoid Stalinist leader 
sentenced hundreds of thousands to forced labor or internal exile -- often down 
into the fourth generation. Now even that was over, but Albania still seethed 
with discontent. Today only Italian TV, alcohol and hopes of immigration 
provide opium to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning we left, we took a rickety taxi out, down the same path that 
Kadare's narrator fled on foot when the Nazis arrived. "Chronicle in Stone" 
ends on a slim note of hope, with the residents of Gjirocaster trudging 
resignedly back to their city. The will to live is strong and people will 
always return home because they know no other way. Albania was small and 
defenseless, its people had to be pliant to survive. And they did, through one 
of the most brutal Communist regimes ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The epiphany hit then: Kadare was writing about himself as well as his people. 
He was a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Concert," translated by Barbara Bray from the French translation by Jusuf 
Vrioni is available from Morrow. "Chronicle in Stone" is available through New 
Amsterdam Press in New York. Also recommended and published by New Amsterdam: 
"General of the Dead Army."

PARTY TIME? NOT REALLY

 I enjoyed Joe Morgenstern's article on gay conservatives ("Another Gay Party 
Line," Sept. 4), especially the mention of Luke Sissyfag's important 
contribution to American politics. 
</P>
<P>
 I am straight, white, male and Protestant, so I'm technically part of the 
nation's power structure. Though I consider voting a religious duty, I often 
have problems with it, because there are so many candidates about whom I know 
nothing other than their names. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I don't try to pass as a conservative and I do believe in equal 
political opportunity, I try to vote for names that indicate minorities, a 
procedure that's not always effective. Even some women have names that read 
like names of what former L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates once referred to as 
"normal people." 
</P>
<P>
 If candidates would choose a ballot name judiciously, much as they would 
select a stage name, they'd make it easier for me to decide whom to vote for. 
As for Luke, anybody willing to call himself Sissyfag in our great, big, 
strong, manly country has my vote.

 Morgenstern's article was a surreal trip, particularly Ritch Colbert's deluded 
musing that gays and lesbians should be Republicans, "given the tenets of the 
party regarding . . . rights of privacy and personal freedom . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Ritch! What the Republicans deeply revere are the rights of property and 
business. No vast armies of conservative Republicans stormed the barricades of 
racial injustice during the '60s. And they sure aren't leading the fight for 
gay rights in the '90s, once again a cause of those damn liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is something tragic about the five smug, starched-and-khaki'd gays 
in your picture. They remind me of the photos of those few naive Jews who faced 
the Nazi hatred directed at them in the late '30s with eyes that pleaded: "Talk 
to us. Let us find areas of agreement. Don't hate us. Don't fear us. We are 
just like you. "

 Morgenstern quotes Robert Dawidoff as saying, in reference to early activists 
in the movement, "It took guts for the Mattachine people and the Stonewall 
people and the odd Quentin Crisps of the world," and "(writer Bruce) Bawer is 
angry with people who made him possible, made us possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry? On the contrary, in the New Republic essay that Morgenstern cites, I 
describe the Mattachine Society pioneers and the Stonewall rioters as heroes; 
my point was that Stonewall began a process that brought gays some civil rights 
but didn't increase acceptance. That will be won in the future not by a 
Stonewall-born utopianism but by activism that may have to look to 
pre-Stonewall models and recognize political action as only part of the 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem is not with the "odd Quentin Crisps" -- I admire Crisp's guts -- 
but with the widespread tendency to present eccentric, exotic individuals as 
representative of all gay people. Such narrow, misleading images of an 
extremely diverse population only serve to perpetuate misunderstanding and to 
reinforce stereotypes.

 Members of the religious right who reside in the GOP seem to work tirelessly 
in an effort to keep gay people from having what they refer to as "special 
rights." These include the right to employment, to housing and to medical 
insurance that we have the money to pay for but are denied nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP hierarchy may claim to be embarrassed by the view of its 
ultra-powerful fringe membership, but its main concern is to keep its fingers 
on the financial resources of that group. Until the Republicans force the 
religious right out into its own politico-religious party, saying that gay 
people logically should be Republicans is like saying that an illegal immigrant 
should logically seek employment with the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service.

 It's very telling that when Chavez mentions four Korean-American merchants who 
were murdered in 1986, she doesn't mention their names. Unlike the attacker of 
Soon Ja Du (Latasha Harlins), Korean murder victims aren't lucky enough to have 
hate-peddling PR agents.

COVER STORY: WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The directors were the stars of two recent Showtime original movie series: 
"Fallen Angels" and "Rebel Highway." But with the cable network's latest 
series, "Directed By," stars are the directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Directed By," which premieres Sunday, showcases short original films directed 
by accomplished actors Peter Weller ("RoboCop"), Laura Dern ("Rambling Rose"), 
Danny Glover ("Lethal Weapon"), JoBeth Williams ("Poltergeist"), Kathleen 
Turner ("Peggy Sue Got Married") and Treat Williams ("Prince of the City"). 
</P>
<P>
 The showcase is the brainchild of Oscar-winning executive producer Jana Sue 
Memel, whose Chanticleer Films has produced numerous short films for Showtime 
as well as the full-length "Lush Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think actors, out of all the first-time directors I have worked with, make 
the best crossover directors because you can surround people with a director of 
photography, production designers and everybody else who can make them good," 
Memel explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ultimately, no one can go up and talk to the actors other than the 
director. And the person who I think talks to an actor best is an actor. I was 
incredibly knocked out by all six of the people I worked with." 
</P>
<P>
 Memal discussed story ideas with each novice director. But, she adds, "there 
was a lot of carte blanche. Treat pitched me a bunch of ideas, but he knew he 
wanted to do something about flying. Laura co-wrote hers, so she really knew 
what she wanted to do. Kathleen read this entire collection of Lynn Mamet 
stories and found one which really resonated within her and so did JoBeth. 
Danny wanted to do sort of a feminist piece, which is what he definitely did." 
</P>
<P>
 Weller received a 1993 Academy Award nomination for best short subject for his 
comedic "Partners," which he adapted with Ebbe Roe Smith from Tom McGuane's 
short story. Griffin Dunne stars in this freewheeling story about a rising 
young attorney whose career nearly comes to a halt when he rekindles a romance 
with an old flame (Marg Helgenberger), now married to the firm's biggest 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 Directing has always been a passion for Weller, who majored in it at the 
University of North Texas. "I just put it on the back burner," he says, until 
directors with whom he worked suggested he try directing. "Robert Redford 
invited me to the Sundance Institute, and I directed at Sundance. Then I 
dropped some irons into the fire. One of them was at Chanticleer. I took Jana 
Memel's advice and did a comedy. I was going to do a serious film. I think it 
was good advice." 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have done the heavier dramatic pieces (for a first film) have a 
harder time advancing in their careers," Memel explains. "People who have done 
the comedic pieces, somehow, studios are willing to risk letting someone who 
has done something funny do something dramatic. It seems they are less willing 
to risk somebody who has done something dramatic do something funny. They think 
there's a trick to comedy. If you can do that trick, you can do any trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Weller relished being the boss on the set. "I put my thumb in everybody's 
pie," he says, laughing. "That's the fun part. I said to the set designer, 'I 
want all the offices in primary colors. I want yellow over here, red over here. 
I want this dining room blue, because it's a sign of control, you know. I want 
ducks here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before he began production on "Partners," he wrote letters to several 
directors who have been major influences, including Woody Allen, Steven 
Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Mike Nichols, informing them he was "going to 
rip them off. I literally ripped them off. Woody, he wrote me a great letter 
back saying, 'Go ahead, directing is no big deal. It's just solving problems.' 
Scorsese said something to the effect, 'We have all ripped everybody else off.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Though Weller still loves acting -- he has a cameo in "Partners" -- he wants 
to concentrate on directing. Early next year he is scheduled to begin 
production on his first feature, "Incognito," a thriller about art forgery for 
Morgan Creek/Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Dern opted to do an original story, "The Gift," which she co-wrote with 
Emily Tracy, who also penned the screenplay. Mary Steenburgen stars, along with 
Peter Horton, Isabella Rossellini, Bonnie Bedelia, Mary Kay Place and Dern's 
mother, Diane Ladd. 
</P>
<P>
 Directing something she co-wrote, Dern says, made the task easier for her. "I 
was so connected to the story because it's something I worked on with the 
writer," she explains. "I really had a lot of answers to the questions in my 
head of what I imagined it to look like. The idea is something I feel very 
strongly about, learning to be connected with each other and help each other 
through things. I think writing it alone would have been an impossibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Before production began, Dern thought dealing with the camera would be the 
hardest part of directing. "Actually, I had the most fun with it, just learning 
about it and having great people around me to teach me. I think the most 
difficult aspect was just physical stamina, you know, just trying to pace 
myself on very little sleep and really be open to answering all the questions, 
figuring out what I wanted, trying to never compromise and also being 
opinionated and saying to people, 'No. This is my idea. I want it this way.' 
It's kind of rough. I find that a difficult thing as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress isn't certain actors make the best directors, "but I think those 
who are great, they're probably just wonderfully gifted at directing, anyway. 
At the same time, I think there's an amount of patience that makes it more fun 
to work with actor-directors because they understand, having been through it, 
what doesn't feel good and what is not appropriate. I think they're kinder on 
the set." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that was her experience being directed by Clint Eastwood last year in 
"A Perfect World." "He was really nice to everybody," she says. "There was a 
casualness with which he approached everything, which always made me more 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dern can't wait to try directing again. "I love it," she says with enthusiasm. 
"I want to do something completely different. This was a piece about women and 
behavior and I wanted it to be that because that is what I was interested in. 
But now I'd like the opportunity to do something with more camera work, so I 
can learn more in a more visual area." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Treat Williams, his directing opportunity "literally fell in my lap." 
He acknowledges, though, he was not initially courted to direct because, "I 
wasn't a big enough name." But he harbors no resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just business," he says matter-of-factly. "The deal was the name the 
actor has in Hollywood and, as you know, I've been doing television films. My 
career has not been slow, I'm a steadily working actor, but ... " 
</P>
<P>
 His manager, though, came up with an idea of Williams directing a film written 
by David Mamet and pitched it to Showtime. "All of a sudden, it changed," 
Williams says. "There was a much more positive attitude. My manager called me 
and said, 'I got good news and bad news.' He said, 'You are going to direct 
your first film and David Mamet is writing it.' I said, 'God, what could be the 
bad news?' And he said, 'David Mamet doesn't know it yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Williams, who has appeared in Mamet plays, called the award-winning 
writer-director and asked him if he would write a script. "It was very hard for 
me to do, but I called him and asked if he'd have the time and energy to write 
a short film for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams told Mamet the idea and Mamet agreed to do write "Texan," a film noir 
mystery with a twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "David is an old-school guy," Williams says. "He's a very loyal man, the most 
loyal man I have ever known, particularly in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Directing "a Mamet" wasn't easy. "You'd think with Mamet, it would direct 
itself," Williams says. "But it is very, very tough because it takes much more 
technical proficiency than a behavioral film where people are naturally 
overlapping. David's writing is meant to sound like natural language, so you 
must go into the editing room and take these technical breaks and try and put 
them together so they start to have a rhythm. In a way, as a first-time 
filmmaker, my work in the editing room was very tough because it was so 
specific rather than a loose, artistic behavioral kind of first film where 
there are lots of shots of trees and people taking long pauses. I didn't have 
that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had rhythms which I knew were in David's writing. In the editing room, I 
would bang my head against the wall saying, 'This doesn't sound right. We've 
got to go back in there and keep pulling these pieces out.' It was sometimes 
like surgery to get it to where I felt it had a rhythm that is genuinely what 
David had intended. To me, that's the essence of good directing, to really 
realize the writer's intent." 
</P>
<P>
 As a director, Williams says, his purpose was to tell a story well that 
someone wrote. His favorite directors, he adds, are not "the fancy shooters. I 
mention William Wyler. When you see his films, they can be any period. You 
never know who was directing, you just see the novel realized. He's my role 
model. I really want to be a a guy who is a conduit. You take the material and 
you walk on the set and your job is to realize you are helping the actors be 
these people in the story. Once you get the camera put where it is supposed to 
be, you have done your homework. When you work with the actors, man, it's 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "Directed By" premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime with David Mamet's 
"Texan," directed by Treat Williams, followed by JoBeth Williams' "On Hope" at 
10:30 p.m.

 Disney has reworked Jack London's White Fang (KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.), a social 
parable of a wolf-dog transfored by love, into a sometimes gooey but overall 
likable 1991 film of a boy and his dog. A new character (Ethan Hawke) is 
introduced, obviously modeled on London himself. A TV movie that aired earlier 
this year, Vanishing Son II (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 1 p.m.) is 
about two brothers (Russell Wong, Chi Muoi Lo) from China who go their separate 
ways in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Campbell's notable 1991 suspense-thriller Defenseless (KCAL Sunday at 
10 p.m.) is a satisfying genre film, set in Los Angeles and enlivened by a 
splendid cast headed by Barbara Hershey as an attorney suspected of murder -- 
and stalked by a killer. 
</P>
<P>
 The real violence in the 1991 V.I. Warshawski (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is 
directed not toward anyone on the screen but rather against Sara Paretsky's 
popular novels, which are the nominal inspiration for this tepid thriller. A 
well-cast Kathleen Turner is mired in a mishmash of a plot having to do with 
the Chicago private eye trying to find out who murdered an ex-hockey great with 
whom she had been flirting. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Narrow Margin (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.), despite Gene Hackman's 
reliably strong presence and some good action sequences, is a textbook example 
of how not to remake a classic -- in this case Richard Fleischer's 1952 film 
noir set aboard a train and starring Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dutiful son of a New York slumlord, Joe Pesci has the title role in the 
good-natured yet pertinent 1992 comedy The Super (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.), in 
which Pesci is sentenced to living 120 days in his own derelict East Village 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg is fun as a flashy, sassy undercover cop, but the ultra-bloody 
1987 Fatal Beauty (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) succumbs to hypocrisy in trying to 
preach against drugs while exploiting violence to the hilt. Not helping matters 
is the emasculation of the romance between Goldberg and Sam Elliott, head of 
security for a bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hyams' 1986 Running Scared (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.) stars Billy Crystal 
and Gregory Hines as undercover Chicago cops dreaming of opening a bar in Key 
West but waylaid by plenty of exploits in the Windy City. It's a stylish genre 
film enlivened by the stars' exceptional rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET is offering a memorable Marlene Dietrich Saturday night double feature, 
The Blue Angel (at 9 p.m.) and A Foreign Affair (at 10:45 p.m.).

 I enjoyed the article about Lisa Kudrow in Sunday's (Sept. 11) TV Times.I am 
glad that you have taken notice of her. I must object, however, to your 
description of her as an "Ivy League grad." Though Vassar is a fine school, 
your description is reserved for those who graduated from the universities 
Pennsylvania, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Cornell or Dartmouth.

 SCHOOLGIRLS: Young Women, Self-Esteem, and the Confidence Gap by Peggy 
Orenstein (Doubleday: $23; 335 pp.) In 1900 the American Assn. of University 
Women conducted a study involving more than 3,000 children between the ages of 
9 and 15.The conclusion, which cut across ethnic, regional and socioeconomic 
lines, was sad, but hardly surprising considering our culture. By the time they 
reach adolescence, an enormous number of girls experience a dramatic loss of 
self esteem, emerging into adulthood with much less confidence than their male 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Orenstein, a journalist and former editor of Mother Jones magazine, 
decided to find out more. She spent a year following a group of eighth grade 
girls from two extremely different Norther California schools as they wrote 
papers, spent time with friends and tried to deal with their emerging 
sexuality. The resulting book, "SchoolGirls," is an informative and sometimes 
tragic look at exactly what causes so many girls to warp their personalities 
and often their bodies in the hopes of fitting into a male dominated world. 
</P>
<P>
 Orenstein's writing is excellent. She knows exactly when to end an anecdote, 
when to insert herself and when to give statistics. In addition, "Schoolgirls" 
is flawlessly researched. One area not examined here is the inborn differences 
between girls and boys, differences many studies have shown actually exist. It 
might have been interesting to see how Orenstein thinks biology has contributed 
to inequality in the classroom, and what could be done to take advantage of the 
natures of both sexes without repressing either one. 
</P>
<P>
 "SchoolGirls" is a fascinating book. Hopefully, it will be read by the right 
people -- parents and educators who could change the experience of young girls 
in the future.

 The Thing Called Love (Cinemax Tuesday at 10:30 a.m.) has not yet been 
released theatrically. It is Peter Bogdanovich's 1993 film with Samantha 
Mathis, who dreams of Nashville stardom, and is most notable for one of River 
Phoenix's last performances.He is impressive as another singer, the kind who 
keeps his emotions to himself.

 Praying with Anger (Showtime Thursday at 5:15 a.m.), M. Night Shyamalan's 1993 
debut film, made when he was only 21, is a beautiful, accomplished work about a 
young man (played by Shyamalan) who reluctantly becomes an exchange student in 
India, the land of his parents' birth, and ends up discovering himself.

 GETTING OVER TOM by Abigail Thomas (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill: $16.95; 
204 pp.) Women who fall for the wrong men is the primary subject of Abigail 
Thomas' first collection of short fiction, "Getting Over Tom."Spanning about 40 
years, these stories are pleasant, easy to read and a safe gift for someone you 
don't know very well. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Virginia, who narrates four pieces set in the fifties. Married and 
pregnant much too young, she tries to make the best of a terrible situation. 
"To tell the truth, I liked it better before, when we didn't do it," Virginia 
thinks. " . . . I liked it better in cars when your breath sounded like 
something inside you had broken. I liked not doing it better than I like doing 
it." Then there's Louise, a menopausal mother of four who begins an affair with 
a 20-year-old construction worker. "Louise feels like a summer house this kid 
has broken into, pushing his way through doors that haven't been opened in 
years. . . . A fine, honorable old house, and he appreciates the way it has 
been made, the way it has lasted, the strength of its structure, noble old 
dimensions." Thomas never bashes men and her women are not helpless victims. In 
the one truly dark story, "So Far So Good" a disturbed man picks up a runaway 
teen-age hitchhiker, and somehow, one feels sorry for both of them, even as the 
man does a terrible thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' stories are well conceived, witty and touching. They will not break 
many hearts nor glue them back together. This is the type of book one can read 
in a few days, laugh a little, feel sad and then put it on the shelf.

 THE SPECTACLE OF THE BODY by Noy Holland (Alfred A. Knopf: $20; 190 pp .) 
Perhaps the most frustrating kinds of short story collections to read are the 
uneven ones.They can not be dismissed as bad writing because obviously the 
author has talent, nor can they be wholeheartedly endorsed. Noy Holland's first 
book "The Spectacle of the Body," is such a collection. 
</P>
<P>
 First the good news. The centerpiece, basically a novella at 85 pages, is a 
true stunner. "Orbit" seems to be a kind of twisted homage to Faulkner's "As I 
Lay Dying," right down to some of the imagery. Cissie and her little brother 
Orbit live in a dream-like, frightening twilight zone with no boundaries or 
guidance as they wait, alone in the house, for their sick mother to die. An 
unspecified amount of time passes, maybe months, and things fall more and more 
out of control. They tie a dead filly up in a tree to protect it from dogs, and 
bury their mother's possessions. They sleep in the garden. Animals take on a 
hallucinatory quality. "We had a great stash of morphine, a run of hot nights 
of a sweetened cast that clotted in our throats. We had gizzards. We grew 
scales. We had feet. We were bottom-feeders." By the end, which is expected, 
but still shocking, the story itself has broken boundaries in much the same way 
its characters did. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Holland's other work isn't as effective. Her experimental style 
remains the same, but somehow emotional impact is missing. One wishes she had 
either expanded "Orbit" into a novel, or held back until her other writing was 
of the same caliber. Still, Holland has a real gift, and it will be interesting 
to see what she does next.

PENN CENTRAL: NEW HAVEN LINE, BY EVE KOSOFSKY SEDGWICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future moment is the moment of guilt,  
</P>
<P>
 and it imposes on one, until it is reached,  
</P>
<P>
 the intolerable strain of remaining innocent.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Northrop Frye 
</P>
<P>
 Things race back. 
</P>
<P>
 They wander swiftly back 
</P>
<P>
 around a distant, maybe invisible point 
</P>
<P>
 that lingers along up. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Room where I catch up with my lust 
</P>
<P>
 hardly knowing it is mine (but I catch it). 
</P>
<P>
 But it combs so straight along the revulsions 
</P>
<P>
 of nature, and that's a gesture I know. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything racing back toward status origin. 
</P>
<P>
 My lust and I rattling with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 This motion over time is a space, that buys me 
</P>
<P>
 nothing. Like the love 
</P>
<P>
 of a man for his mother, it is not a metaphor, 
</P>
<P>
 but there is no making it good, but he carries it 
</P>
<P>
 with him, 
</P>
<P>
 and now and again it flushes him out, in some 
</P>
<P>
 absent sense: 
</P>
<P>
 other things may fill him but this suddenly 
</P>
<P>
 always makes him 
</P>
<P>
 empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Least of all it works in bed, which is 
</P>
<P>
 too relevant to be real. I am putting it gently: 
</P>
<P>
 what language thinks it has to do: he does 
</P>
<P>
 continue, 
</P>
<P>
 and it is that bad. This motion, this innocence 
</P>
<P>
 that's original and not to be breached or lost 
</P>
<P>
 will be neither acted nor suffered: I withdraw 
</P>
<P>
 from it 
</P>
<P>
 as swiftly as from these lines and apply myself 
</P>
<P>
 with the 
</P>
<P>
 same steadiness to it. Never in time 
</P>
<P>
 because lust is tardy when it comes at all 
</P>
<P>
 or forward and importunate with its own 
</P>
<P>
 sickness: 
</P>
<P>
 my lust and I grinding down the line divide 
</P>
<P>
 the second's pulse. 
</P>

 USER by Bruce Benderson (Dutton: $19.95; 272 pp.) Imagine taking a tour 
through the seediest part of New York. Your tour guide -- a young, gay 
prostitute who will do anything, truly anything, for a bag of heroin -- shoves 
you directly into the lives of various desperate street people. There are 
drug-addicted transvestites, angry homeless teen-agers, hustlers, crack dealers 
and any other imaginable type of nighttime dweller. When, after a couple of 
hours, you tell your guide (who's named Apollo) that it's time to go home, he 
says, "Sorry, Sweetheart, there's still a lot I want you to see." That is more 
or less how it feels to read the first 20 pages of Bruce Benderson's novel, 
"User." 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 pages the feeling changes. This man is an amazing writer. Benderson 
gathers his characters inner selves, their conflicts with each other, and 
relationship to the world and creates a brutal overlapping collage. Somehow 
these people become so understandable, so alive that it no longer matters if 
their actions are sympathetic or even make any sense to mainstream society. 
They are presented without judgment of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the beginning of "User" Apollo fights and almost kills Casio, the bouncer 
at a Times Square porn theater where he turns tricks. Casio's son swear 
revenge. Apollo's subsequent attempts to lay low from police and pull his life 
together while Casio's son looks for him form just enough plot to keep the 
pages turning. But, "User," isn't really about plot, it's about, among other 
things, different kinds of addiction. "He stood in the light of the sex movie 
to use its pale colors to tie up and shoot the bag. He realized that he had 
missed the burial of the needle in flesh as much as he had missed the dope. 
It's not the dope that makes the big difference, he thought as it seeped into 
his flesh. It's doing it." "User" is a book for a very specific audience, but 
that doesn't change the fact that it is unmistakably brilliant.

 HOUSE WORK by Kristina McGrath (Bridge Works: $19.95; 192 pp.) Anna has a hard 
life. Her husband, Guy is not only an alcoholic, but is debilitated by mental 
illness.Her three children demand constant attention. Money is short. It is 
Pittsburgh in the fifties. Shifting points of view between Anna, Guy and 
Louise, their youngest daughter, "House Work," Kristina McGrath's first novel, 
is more a series of circular inner monologues than a story. 
</P>
<P>
 People who think a lot about what may be biological differences between men 
and women would probably say that this is a very feminine novel. It pools 
outward instead of forward, is entirely emotionally based, and has an abstract, 
watery power not easily pinned down by linear-based thinking. Here is Anna 
considering her relationship with Guy. "There were moments all along when they 
both understood there was something (What alotta hooey) beyond him (Get away 
from me) that was in need of her (You're nothing), that would accept her 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The best qualities about "House Work" also make it the most difficult to read. 
This is a book that takes chances and requires a reader to slide along with its 
unusual rhythms. Time feels fluid. There are no quotes around the dialogue, and 
no consistent narrative style -- McGrath moves from third person into first 
then into a collective viewpoint, a "we" voice I've rarely even seen. In 
addition, the plot sometimes takes an unpredictable turn, going into a long 
flashback for example or suddenly focusing on previously unknown characters. 
However, the writing is full of kind of quiet dazzle that lights up Anna's sad 
family, and ultimately offers hope to all of us.

 In a settlement agreement reached Sept. 8 with the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights, the Medical University of South 
Carolina has agreed to stop telling Charleston police and prosecutors when 
pregnant women test positive for cocaine ("In the Name of the Children," by 
Barry Siegel, Aug. 7).  
</P>
<P>
 The federal Office for Civil Rights had been investigating charges of racial 
discrimination in the hospital's policy toward pregnant substance abusers. The 
office's agreement with the medical center ends the threat of the hospital's 
losing federal financial assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid funds. The 
settlement does not affect a $3-million suit filed on behalf of pregnant 
hospital patients by the Center for Reproductive Law & Policy. That lawsuit 
remains in the pretrial stage in federal district court.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; LARISA OLEYNIK FINDS THE SECRET IS 
TO HAVE FUN AS 'ALEX MACK'

<P>
 The last thing your average grunge-loving teen-ager wants is to get all 
covered with icky stuff. That would ruin the carefully put together 
"I-don't-care-how-I-look" look. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Nickelodeon series "The Secret World of Alex Mack," 13-year-old 
Alex (Larisa Oleynik) is less than thrilled when a tank of ooze slimes all over 
her when she's on the way home from school. Then Alex discovers the icky stuff 
is actually an odd chemical that gives her superpowers -- she can morph into a 
puddle of liquid and she can will items to come to her, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 She's like a teen-age "Bewitched." And in the tradition of the nose-twitching 
Samantha, Alex uses her powers to just get through life, not catch criminals or 
save the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon hopes the series fills the void on Saturday night's Snick block 
that was left by the popular "Clarissa Explains It All," no longer in 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Bay area-native Larisa, who is the same age as the teen-ager she 
plays, may have wished for some superpowers a few days before meeting a 
reporter in Santa Monica. The eighth-grader arrives perkier than her TV 
counterpart, but with a bold purple shiner under her left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly embarrassed, she giggles through her explanation: "I was over at a 
friend's house, and he has a big trampoline. I was practicing my flips and I 
landed really, really hard on my bottom and my head hit my knee. Hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She picks up her egg-salad sandwich and smiles. "I didn't have any idea it 
would be this bad," she says apologetically. She's assured it doesn't look that 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a plaid jumper, Larisa looks the picture of the private school student 
she is -- quite a switch from Alex's grungy garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa's also more serious about school than Alex. Lest there be no 
misunderstanding about why she's in L.A. on a school day, she quickly explains 
that even though she's flown in from San Francisco to promote Alex Mack, she 
attended school in the morning -- including her hardest class, grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 But she's just as quick to launch into how much fun she's had being Alex. 
"She's like me in some ways," she says. "She has a crush on this boy ... and 
every girl has those. She has a best friend and she has a hard time deciding 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 episodes were shot in Valencia in August, and Larisa was thrilled to 
become friends with actress Meridith Bishop, who plays Alex's older sister, 
Annie. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an only child like me!" she says. "And we got really close. I just love 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 An animated Larisa swings into high gear when she discusses the show's last 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to fall into a mountain and down a mine shaft!" she says. "It was 
great!" 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledges, however, that most of the tough stuff was done by a stunt 
double. Does she think her stunt double looks like her? 
</P>
<P>
 "No!" she answers emphatically. "God, she was really old. " 
</P>
<P>
 "She's exactly my age," her mother, Lorraine, responds dryly, but with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, in comparison to Larisa, she's old," chimes in a Nickelodeon 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa's mother smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleynik indulged her daughter -- then 8 -- when Larisa begged to audition for 
the San Francisco production of "Les Miserables." She got the role. After a 
year on stage, Larisa was hooked. Each year after that the Oleyniks summered -- 
during pilot season -- in Los Angeles. In the summer of '93, Oleynik realized 
how serious -- and good -- Larisa was when she won the role of Alex Mack over 
300 other girls. "It was a nice surprise," the proud mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larisa had such a great natural instinct. It was stunning," adds creator and 
producer Tom Lynch, joining the table. "She made the character richer and more 
shaded." He says he didn't want a girl who "looked like she worked too much in 
television, had the kinds of reactions you always see, the smile, the look, the 
acting with eyes and all that kind of thing. Larisa was just perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is a good thing for Frente!, Stone Temple Pilots and Cranberries lover 
Larisa -- since she's now completely motivated to continue to act: "You get to 
be a different person each time. I really want to do more stuff. Movies. A 
movie would be great. Neat." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Life of Alex Mack" premieres on the Snick block Saturday at 8 p.m. 
on Nickelodeon. For ages 5 and up.

FOCUS; DOUBLE TALK; POP QUIZ: NAME TWO ACTRESSES WITH NEW CHAT SHOWS. CLUES: 
'THREE'S' A THIGHMASTER AND AN 'EVENING' AFTER 'TAXI'

<P>
 Suzanne Somers and Marilu Henner have more than a few things in common. 
</P>
<P>
 They're both veteran sitcom actresses -- "Three's Company" and "Step by Step" 
for Somers and "Taxi" and "Evening Shade" for Henner. They've both written 
revealing books about their personal lives. They both have big, white toothy 
smiles and blue eyes with crinkles in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 And in their 40s, they're enviably fit. For Somers, 47, white flour is off 
limits, and yes, she really uses the Thighmaster, the exercise gizmo she 
pitches. Henner, 42, who despite having a baby a few months ago looks anything 
but postpartum, describes her dietary regime: "No dairy, no chicken, no meat, 
no shellfish, no sugar, no chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 There's more. They're both mothers to sons (Somers' son Bruce is 30, Henner's 
son Nicholas is 4 months old), as well as stepmothers. They're married to 
producers (Somers to Alan Hamel; Henner to Rob Lieberman). They're extremely 
open -- Somers talks freely about growing up with an alcoholic father. In her 
book, Henner tells all about her intimate relationships with John Travolta and 
other celebs. 
</P>
<P>
 They've both spent years as guests on the talk circuit -- from Carson to 
Letterman to Leno. Somers says she's still trying to get over a recent raunchy 
chat with Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these women are hosts themselves. "The Suzanne Somers Show" and "Marilu" 
were launched on the same September day -- adding two new voices to the already 
cacophonous daytime talk-show arena. 
</P>
<P>
 When you've been in show biz for years and you've done the sitcoms, the movies 
and, for Somers, the Vegas act, is syndicated talk-show hostdom the only place 
left to go? Both Somers, who will continue to star on ABC's "Step by Step" 
while doing her new show, and Henner insist that talk is not an ending point, 
but a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like this is something I was born to do," says Henner, still 
enthusiastic at 9:30 p.m. after a day of taping shows back to back. She has 
believed in the power of talk since the Henner clan held family meetings when 
she was young. "I've always felt that life is like a talk show." 
</P>
<P>
 Somers says that life has prepared her to do a talk show. "I think it was the 
comedy background. I think it was the lecture circuit. It think it was writing 
books," she explains. "I've lived -- I have perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Will her perspective be enough to set her show apart from the crowded 
talk-show field? Both Somers and Henner say that their shows will tweak the 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Somers' game plan "is to take a main celebrity guest and build a show around 
the guest." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: On a recent day on the Universal Studios set, Somers' 
guest is actress Susan Dey, whose mother died when Dey was 9. The topic is 
daughters whose mothers have died. The author of the book "Motherless 
Daughters" joins in. During the show, both Dey and Somers get teary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you feel differently about Susan Dey?" Somers asks later in her dressing 
room. If the answer is yes, she's accomplished her show's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since celebrity chat is far from unique, Somers is relying on her own style. 
"The show is also me," she says. "I have a point of view. And I like to 
understand what makes people tick because I've spent most of my life so far 
trying to understand what makes me tick." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henner's show is more traditional talk in the Winfrey/Donahue style, 
she also says that her personality will make or break it. "I'm not looking to 
be an actress who's been cast in the role of talk-show host," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do you personalize already-been-done topics like body image and 
stepparenting? Throw in those anecdotes. On the show about body image, Henner 
shares a picture of herself 50 pounds heavier. And when former "Taxi" co-star 
Tony Danza comes on, she teases him about a "tuft" of hair he has on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the show's topics are an outgrowth of Henner's interests. "We did one on 
breast-feeding, one on the biological clock. I spent three years trying to have 
a baby, so I know a lot about that subject." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some uncomfortable growing pains behind the scenes at 
"Marilu," however. Executive producer Mary Ellen DiPrisco left the staff after 
the first episode aired on Sept. 12, but no one on staff will talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Henner, too, is making some adjustments to talk. At a recent taping of a show 
on child performers, she makes heavy use of the TelePrompTer for her lines 
until she begins to loosen up. Later, she says, "I think the more you do it, 
the more natural you get at it." While Henner isn't worried that talk will put 
a damper on her acting career, Somers is more hesitant. "I wonder if I'll 
become such a celebrity out of this that I'll be forgotten as an actress," she 
says, then reconsiders. "It didn't happen with the Thighmaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Marilu" airs weekdays at 9 a.m. on KNBC. "The Suzanne Somers Show" airs 
weekdays at 1 p.m. on KCOP.

<P>
 -- Alfred Nobel 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Swedish dynamite inventor (and sometime poet) Alfred Nobel died in 
1896 at age 63, he left an explosive legacy. His estate -- worth an estimated 
$9 million at the time and scattered across eight countries -- was to be 
invested in blue-ribbon securities. The annual income was to be divided in five 
equal parts and used to bestow five annual awards "as prizes to those who, 
during the course of each year, have been of the greatest service to mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel, who never married and had no immediate family, apparently believed that 
large fortunes should not be inherited. Nobel's nieces and nephews -- save one, 
Emanuel -- vigorously fought the terms of the will for three years, at one 
point even engaging the King of Sweden to argue with Emanuel that his uncle had 
"been misled by peace fanatics." Nobel's fellow Swedes were none too happy when 
the details of his bequest became public. Many inhabitants of the impoverished 
and largely agricultural country were unhappy with the idea that such a vast 
fortune might benefit foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel instructed that three of the awards were to recognize discoveries in 
chemistry, physics and medicine, three areas in which he had worked or dabbled. 
The Peace Prize was to be given to the person who had done the most "for 
fraternity among nations, for abolition or reduction of standing armies, and 
for the holding and promotion of peace congresses." Nobel delegated this task 
to the Norwegian parliament to honor the union of Sweden and Norway. Although 
the two countries parted in 1905, Norway still presents the prize. An annual 
prize for economics, established and financed by the Bank of Sweden, was 
established in Nobel's name in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The final award was to go to the person who had produced the most outstanding 
literary work of an "ideal tendency." In addition, Nobel wrote: "It is my 
express wish that, when the prizes are awarded, there shall be no kind of 
racial discrimination, wherefore the most worthy person shall receive the 
prize, whether he is a Scandinavian or not." 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of haggling over Nobel's will and estate, the executors 
finally created the Nobel Foundation to oversee the institutes that administer 
the prizes, and to enforce the prize rules. The Swedish Academy of Letters -- 
an association of writers and academics established by King Gustav III in 1786 
to promote Swedish language and literature -- was charged with choosing the 
annual winners of one of the world's richest literary awards. Members of the 
Academy are Swedish writers and literary scholars and critics who are elected 
for life by the Academy itself. That Special Something 
</P>
<P>
 Each generation of the Academy has redefined its sense of what Nobel meant by 
"ideal tendency." The prizes first reflected a conservative version of "ideal 
tendency": a firm belief in God's order on Earth based on the family. Later, it 
was decided (by interpreting a letter from a close friend of the inventor) that 
Nobel meant a critical stance toward religion, the monarchy, marriage and the 
social order as a whole. In the 1920s and '30s, newly elected Academy members 
took "ideal tendency" to mean profound human sympathy and broadly humanitarian 
authorship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s there was renewed emphasis on Nobel's wish to promote authors who 
were still active and the Academy began to emphasize what it called neglected 
pioneers, masters, genres, languages and cultures. Members of the Academy also 
thought the prize should bring attention to writers not necessarily known to a 
worldwide audience. One Academy member said the prize should bring attention to 
writers on "efforts which are not gaining the respect they deserve." Making the 
Short List 
</P>
<P>
 No writer can apply for a Nobel Prize. Indeed, self-nomination can rule one 
out for life. Rather, according to the Academy statutes: "The right to nominate 
candidates for the prize shall be enjoyed by members of the Swedish Academy and 
of other academies, institutions, and societies, who are similar to it in 
constitution and purpose; by professors of literature, Nobel prize winners of 
literature, and presidents of those societies of authors that are 
representative of the literary production of their respective countries." 
</P>
<P>
 A subgroup of the Academy -- the Nobel Committee -- reviews the nominations it 
receives from former laureates, academics and various institutions worldwide 
that have an interest in literature. From this list, the committee forms a 
secret "short list" of writers whose works are to be scrutinized and debated by 
the entire Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of May, the "short list" is distributed to all Academy members so 
that they can spend their summer holidays reading and briefing themselves for 
the fall discussions that lead to the choice of that year's laureate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations must be received no later than Feb. 1 of each year (Tolstoy's 
backers learned this rule the hard way: In 1901, they failed to nominate him in 
time, and the first Nobel went to Sully Prudhomme of France, despite the fact 
that it had been quite some time since he had produced his great works. Tolstoy 
never did receive a Nobel.) Writers also apparently cannot hope to reach the 
final stages of consideration unless they have been nominated several years in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual list of candidates is a closely guarded secret, as are the details 
of the group's deliberations. (But the Academy's records are opened after 50 
years, and this has allowed insight into why some candidates were accepted or 
rejected, resulting in numerous books and articles on the selection process 
itself.) The names of the nominees are not published, there is never any 
announcement regarding the proportion of votes, and the decision of the Academy 
cannot be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Academy makes its decision, 12 of its 18 members must be present or 
have sent in ballots. If no candidate receives more than half the votes, the 
awarding of the prize is postponed, and may be reserved until the following 
year. This has happened 13 times in the history of the awards, primarily during 
World Wars I and II, when the world situation prevented the gathering of 
information required to reach a decision. If the prize is not awarded in the 
second year, the prize money reverts to the foundation. And the Award Goes to . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Nobel laureates typically receive a gold medal, a diploma with a short 
statement listing the Academy's reasons for awarding the prize, and a check for 
the prize money. The statutes declare that the winner will give a lecture 
within six months of becoming a laureate, but this rule has not always been 
observed. If a laureate refuses the honor for any reason (or has been made to 
refuse) but later requests that the prize be awarded, the medal and the diploma 
may be awarded without the money because it has already been returned to the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 From the august manner in which the prize is announced -- the Academy's 
permanent secretary reads a short statement from the Academy's headquarters 
atop the magnificent Royal Stock Exchange building in Stockholm at exactly 1 
p.m. on a Thursday in October -- the casual observer might think the final 
decision is made in a peaceful, orderly manner. Such, apparently, is not the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy members understandably have favored candidates, and tempers often 
flare as they argue on their behalf. Back-room dealing surfaces as members 
agree to vote for candidates in return for support for their favorites in 
subsequent years. Historically, such infighting has been kept within the walls 
of the Academy; the only way for a member to protest was to boycott the group's 
weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although politics is not supposed to enter into the Academy's decision making, 
it obviously has. In 1982, when Gabriel Garcia Marquez won the prize, political 
implications were apparent when the Academy cited Marquez's fiction as 
"strongly committed politically on the side of the poor and against domestic 
oppression and foreign economic exploitation." In 1990, three members of the 
Academy resigned, accusing the group of failing to protest strongly enough 
Iran's death threat against British author Salman Rushdie. One Academy member 
said Rushdie was "too controversial," and hadn't yet "attained the literary 
standing necessary for serious consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Academy member Artur Lundkvist -- a radical novelist in his youth and 
1958 winner of the Lenin Peace Prize -- broke the Academy's pledge of silence, 
telling reporters he didn't think that year's winner -- British novelist 
William Golding -- deserved the prize. Lundkvist claimed the Academy had split 
its vote between Golding and his choice -- Claude Simon, a Frenchman who 
Lundkvist claimed had had a "Faulknerian" influence on Latin American writers. 
The Academy secretary said, however, that the group voted by a "great majority" 
in favor of Golding, whom Lundkvist denounced as "a little English phenomenon 
of no special interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Over more than 90 years of prizes, the Academy has been criticized for giving 
prizes mostly to Western European and American writers (out of 89 literature 
prizes, only 30 went to non-Western Europeans), although this has changed in 
the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Swedes show none of their initial hesitation over Nobel's 
charge that they administer the awards. The annual ceremony and banquet to 
honor the Nobel laureates is one of the highlights of the Swedish social 
calendar, and foreign press coverage of the awards almost always places Sweden 
in a favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's prizes will be announced later this month, and Prize Day is Dec. 
10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you think you or someone you know is Nobel fodder, you had better get 
busy. The deadline for next year's nominations is fast approaching. Remember 
Tolstoy. THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE

</P>
<P>
 1) Write not one but many great pieces. The prize recognizes a body of work 
rather than a single great book. In most cases, authors can't hope to reach the 
final stages of consideration unless they have been nominated several 
consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Nominations are made by Feb. 1 of each year to the Swedish Academy of 
Letters, an association of writers and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Self-nomination isn't permitted. Under academy statutes, nominations are 
made by members of the academy and other similar institutions; professors; past 
Nobel literature prizewinners and others involved in serious literature. 
</P>
<P>
 4) When the academy makes its decision, 12 members must be present or have 
sent in ballots. If no candidate has received more than half the votes, the 
awarding of the prize is postponed and may be delayed until the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 5) The names of nominees are not published, nor is any announcement made of 
how voting went. The academy's decision can't be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 6) The Nobel Prize For Literature is announced from the Royal Stock Exchange 
building in Stockholm at exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in October. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Prize Day is Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Winners typically 
receive a gold medal, a diploma with a short statement listing the Academy's 
reasons for awarding the prize and a check for the prize money. NOBEL 
CURIOSITIES 
</P>
<P>
 * Jean-Paul Sartre refused his 1964 Nobel, saying he feared it would turn him 
into an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * George Bernard Shaw very nearly declined his in 1925, but eventually donated 
the prize to a fund for the translation of Swedish literature into English. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Soviets refused to allow Boris Pasternak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn to 
accept their awards in 1958 and 1970, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * After missing the deadline in 1901, Leo Tolstoy was rejected because he 
"preached theoretical anarchism and mystical Christianity," and because he gave 
"sheer coincidence a decisive role in world events." 
</P>
<P>
 * Thomas Hardy was snubbed because his heroines "seem to lack any religious 
and ethical substance." 
</P>
<P>
 * Emile Zola was rejected because of his "crudely cynical naturalism." 
</P>
<P>
 * Henrik Ibsen was turned down because of he was "negative and puzzling in an 
offensive way." 
</P>
<P>
 * August Strindberg, who often opposed the Swedish establishment and referred 
to the award as "dynamite money," was never considered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Graham Greene was often nominated but never a winner. (Academy member Artur 
Lundkvist revealed once that he considered Greene too popular and that, in any 
case, he didn't need the money.) Nobel laureates you've probably never heard 
of: Jacinto Benavente Giosue Carducci Grazia Deledda Rudolph Eucken Paul Heyse

ON THE TOWN: WHERE THERE'S NO SMOKE; A FIXTURE OF THE TOBACCO AGE, THE ASHTRAY 
HAS GONE THE WAY OF THE DINOSAUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison

<TEXT>
<P>
 In spite of periodic housecleanings on the order of the sacking of Rome, I 
still can't part with the most vestigial objects I own: ashtrays. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody smokes in my house. Nobody. My own mother, who has smoked since they 
were called Lucky Strike Greens, knows that she and her noxious weed must 
commune outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But I always have an ashtray for her; at least I am that polite a hostess. 
Which one will it be? The oblong one from the Turquoise Room of the old Super 
Chief, when trains had restaurants worthy of their own ashtrays? How about the 
silver-dollar-sized one from the Lame Duck Motel in Selma on Highway 99, once 
the mother road of the Central Valley? Maybe the bubble-like one showing the 
chic clientele of the defunct Nikabob cafe at Western and 9th, "finest foods 
since 1928." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of all the ersatz Hollywood memorabilia that gets shoved into our 
hands -- whoever really met the Flintstones? -- why not appreciate objects that 
once had utility, even meaning? 
</P>
<P>
 I never boarded the Super Chief, never stayed at the Lame Duck Motel, never 
ate at Nikabob; yet my ashtrays conjure these vanished places. A Northridge 
woman recently paid $1,100 for a black ceramic ashtray from an office at 
Graceland; if she just wanted to keep the bridge club from putting out their 
cigarettes in the planter, she could have saved herself $1,099 and the trip to 
the Elvis auction.  
</P>
<P>
 I have a photo of my parents on their honeymoon. They are at Jack Dempsey's 
bar in New York City, looking young and terrified, and they are tapping the ash 
of their cigarettes into what is very likely a souvenir ashtray. If they swiped 
it, they never let on. Everyone swiped ashtrays. It was expected; ashtrays were 
a marketing ploy, keeping the hotel or restaurant name in front of you, 
suggesting the establishment's merits every time you lighted up. 
</P>
<P>
 But when was the last time you saw an ashtray worth swiping? Not the bland 
glass squares you see these days (someone with whimsy and nerve could make a 
pile manufacturing ashtrays with skulls and crossbones on them), but pink 
Depression-glass boudoir ashtrays, big ceramic bowling-alley ashtrays, ashtrays 
from the Normandie, from Pan Am (yes, mijos, people used to smoke on 
airplanes).  
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gein, the original "Psycho" killer whom even Hitchcock had to tone down, 
made ashtrays out of the joints of bodies he dug up from the cemetery -- a true 
memento mori. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians scattered them like . . . I was about to say Pentagon contracts, 
but that's no longer the case. . . . like invitations to fund-raisers, which 
may be the provenance of two of my ashtrays: 
</P>
<P>
 One is an oval smoked-glass number bearing the seal of Los Angeles and the 
signature of Mayor Sam Yorty. The other is shaped like a cowboy hat, its 
10-gallon crease big enough for a cigar. On the brim are the seal and signature 
of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The '60s were a Golden Age for smokers and 
politicians alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashtrays were what kids made for their parents in crafts class because nobody 
was anywhere near good enough to make a soup tureen. Ashtrays were where movie 
spies dropped incriminating microfilm and burned it to a cinder just as they 
got shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashtrays were the gifts brought back from vacation, the haul from a panicked 
boarding-call spree through the airport gift shop. They were the souvenir 
T-shirts of their age, useful but expendable, subtly recalling some pleasant 
location or event. Smoke won't be missed, but ashtrays will hang in the limbo 
of remembered irrelevance, the way we still say "dial" a phone when we mean 
"push the buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 A smokeless ashtray was among the objets sealed into a City Hall time capsule 
last year. What will they make of it 99 years hence? I'll tell you: People will 
wonder what the fuss over Bill Clinton was all about; in 99 years, nobody will 
be inhaling.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; DISCOVERING THE ROCKER WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Sabine's friends worry about her -- she runs with such a fast crowd, 
they say. Megadeth, Malice, Sugartooth: Are these the kind of people a 
self-respecting 70-year-old wants hanging around? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, since they're her students. Sabine is the voice guru to some of the 
toughest singing acts in town. With a regimen of tantrum therapy and tough 
love, she helps rock gods like Axl Rose belt out screaming highs and pounding 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Her curriculum has been tailored for the MTV generation. Scales are never part 
of her lessons and the words sharp or flat are never mentioned. Students are 
encouraged instead to get either "sad" or "happy" and to release the emotion 
within. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to another guy once but he just told me stuff I already knew," said 
Jack Olivier, a grungy Valley rocker, who decided to come to Sabine after he 
found himself unable to use the full force of his generational Angst. "She 
doesn't dwell on technique. She's into what it's all about: acting like a kid 
and screaming and having emotion. You can have all the technique in the world, 
but without inspiration, you got nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabine is serious about her lessons, so there is punishment when students like 
Olivier refuse to release their anger -- Sabine is not above the well-timed 
rabbit punch if a student cannot seem to reach the proper octave.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can be stern," she said, "because I am a voice of enlightenment," says 
Sabine, who has been called the "Auntie Mame of Metal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabine has been a voice coach in L.A. for 15 years, and when heavy metal 
rockers started knocking on her Studio City door she turned on MTV. After 
watching a few days of primal screams and hair tossing, she figured out what 
the men of metal lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I didn't know how I could help them, because I was classically 
trained. But then I could hear what they were needing. It wasn't exercise, it 
was tantrums," she says. "They were holding their breath like little kids and 
they needed to let it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's tutoring up to five singers a day and sometimes teaches classes on 
the side. "I encourage people to be daring, to take a chance and imagine 
themselves as something they may not seem to be," she says. "I was sent here to 
help the planet, particularly young people, and the best way I can do that is 
with rock." Kit Roane

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; AT LEAST THEY'RE FLAMMABLE

 "It's not a bra for every day," the saleswoman confides. "It makes you look 
too perfect." Is it possible for my breasts to look too perfect? I'm skeptical, 
but entering the Broadway dressing room, Wonderbra draped on my arm, I am about 
to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, it seemed, the women of Los Angeles had been waiting -- teased by 
reports from New York and San Francisco -- for this miraculous undergarment 
that is supposed to create cleavage where once there was merely neckline. I'm 
not the sort to succumb to hype about a bra -- I'm modestly endowed, and having 
come of age in the feminist era, I'm not really much of a bra-wearer at all -- 
but, I have wondered what life is like for the voluptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Voluptuousness, of course, is what the Wonderbra and its counterparts pledge 
to deliver through a complex piece of engineering that -- says the ad -- 
creates "a deep, deep plunge and pushed-together effect." Even I wasn't immune 
to such an alluring promise. 
</P>
<P>
 But tracking down a Wonderbra wasn't so easy. The Downtown Robinsons-May 
didn't have it in stock. "People are asking for it every minute," a saleswoman 
told me. Same story at the Broadway. Robinsons-May at the Glendale Galleria had 
a mere handful left except in fire-engine red. Not even for cleavage would I 
purchase a bright red bra. I finally found a white one in my size at the 
Galleria Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fitting room, I contemplate the effect. Hmmm. Not bad. The optional 
padding is a bit much, and I remove it. But the "pushed-together effect" is in 
operation, giving me my own modest version of the Cosmo-gal look. There's no 
denying the novelty, for a 34 A, of having cleavage. I spend a good 15 minutes 
admiring myself from different angles in the dressing room mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I doubt my new $26 Wonderbra will become part of my wardrobe, which runs 
more too jeans and T-shirts than plunging necklines. And with all that lifting 
and pushing, it isn't as comfy as less aerodynamically complicated lingerie or 
going au naturel. But I'm not sorry to have a specimen tucked in my drawer. You 
never know when you'll need a little push. Nancy Wartik

 Like most parents, Marilyn Noonan of La Jolla constantly worried about her 
four young boys when they played in the street. "I used to be horrified to 
watch cars speed down my street," she says. "We tried begging, pleading, asking 
my neighbors to watch out for the kids, but they would forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan knew that there was no way she could keep the kids contained in a yard. 
"We're trying to deal with reality. Children do play in streets -- especially 
in subdivisions that don't have large back yards," says Noonan. And, she notes, 
traffic accidents are one of the leading cause of death among children ages 6 
to 12." 
</P>
<P>
 So she bought some orange safety cones, used a Magic Marker to put cartoon cop 
and the words "Children Playing" on them and put them a few feet out in the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed some visible, polite reminder for people when the children were out 
playing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Cars slowed down and Noonan breathed a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 After other parents in her neighborhood began to ask her for their own cones, 
a friend suggested that Noonan, a housewife, might be on to something that 
would do some good -- and make some money. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan thoght it over and eventually pitched the idea to a Toys "R" Us 
executive. A year later, she found herself with a brand new business -- Noonan 
Design, which markets the cones as the Sidewalk Sergeant. More than 25,000 of 
the $10 cones have been sold since last year; they're carried in Toys "R" Us 
stores, as well as in several chains on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sidewalk Sergeant serves as a constant reminder to people to slow down and 
watch out for the kids," says cone owner Kathleen Hearst, a La Jolla mother of 
two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 The cones are even getting some support from the police. "This type of citizen 
involvement helps us do our jobs. It's a good, safe idea," says San Diego 
Police spokesman Bill Robinson. "It could supplement what we're doing to 
prevent accidents."Sharon Whitley

 Many decades have passed since literary journals such as the Exile (Ezra 
Pound, ed.), Hound and Horn (Lincoln Kirsten, ed.) and View (Charles Henri 
Ford, ed.) set the pace for serious writing. It wasn't all that long ago when 
an interview with E. M. Forster, Dorothy Parker or Aldous Huxley would clear 
the shelves of the latest issue of the Paris Review, or a Susan Sontag essay in 
Partisan Review (remember "Notes on Camp"?) inspired the full force of the 
media to horn in on a topic "everyone" was talking about. Nowadays, literary 
periodicals seem to be the least welcome items on newsdealer's shelves -- 
crammed into the lower corners of out-of-the-way magazine racks or placed so 
high above the piles of Time, Newsweek and People you practically need a 
cherry-picker to get at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Why have literary journals fallen out of favor? Most of them subsist on the 
good graces of universities, state cultural commissions and the increasingly 
beleaguered National Endowment of the Arts, so it's to be expected that they 
might play it safe editorially. One way of doing this is by casting the net 
wide: A few stories by big literary stars, a smattering of offers by newcomers 
and a wisp of a unifying theme for each issue. The "Novellas Issue" of 
Conjunctions, for example, sports sub-par works by John Barth (an orgy of funny 
names and strained colloquialisms) and John Hawkes (a gruesomely twee tale of 
toilet training), good stories from Lynne Tillman (about love and computers) 
and Allan Gurganus (AIDS and friendship), and a potpourri of fair to barely 
tolerable items by nearly a score of others.There's a brief opening note that 
makes mention of the novella form; an in-depth essay was called for. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily the latest issue of a new journal called Global City News (a New York 
journal funded by a network of grants) shows that the theme issue conceit can 
work (and often makes for a better, more focused journal) -- if it's done 
properly. Issue No. 3, subtitled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," takes its cue from 
the subtext of Robert Louis Stevenson's story: the way the upper classes 
(Jekyll) regard the lower classes (Hyde) as monstrous versions of their 
"secret" selves. There are several stories about psychologically split 
characters; the best being a variation on Superman by B. Brandon Baker, in 
which our hero becomes jealous of his own alter ego, Clark Kent. But the 
highlight of the issue are two essays: Marguerite Feitlowitz explains how the 
lower classes of the Paris suburbs have become a fetish object among modern 
litterateurs, and Marina Budhos looks at the way the so-called "mainstream" 
regards anything outside its white European purview as worthy of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more journals like Global City Review, and literary periodicals just 
might get a bit more news rack respect.

LA DOLCE VITA; STUNNING GELATO AND MODERATE PRICES MAKE ALTO PALATO A SWEET 
DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Italian, to say someone has alto palato -- literally, "high palate" -- is 
to say that they have impeccable taste. It's an expression that could easily 
describe Mauro Vicenti, the demanding, Roman-born owner of Rex il Ristorante in 
Downtown Los Angeles, who has given that name to the new West Hollywood 
restaurant he owns with Danilo Terribili. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's more born-again than brand new, occupying the site of Vicenti's 
old restaurant Pazzia, which he closed in January. It looks very much like 
Pazzia -- the same large-scale space, sleek, tapestry-covered chairs and 
abstract paintings as big as rugs. A few of the waiters are familiar too. But 
where Pazzia was elegant, formal, expensive, Alto Palato is casual, friendly in 
feeling and moderate in price. It's a good neighborhood trattoria that, instead 
of taking up a little storefront, occupies this rather grand room. The partners 
also added on a soaring space that fronts La Cienega, where they have installed 
a bar, gelato display and wood-burning pizza oven, giving Alto Palato entree to 
a lively new late-night scene along La Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzas, thin-crusted and blistered at the edges, are very Italian, spare 
by California standards. One has a thin veil of melted mozzarella overlaid with 
pungent, peppery arugula and silky slices of prosciutto ribboned with fat; 
another delicious version is topped with potatoes, rosemary and caramelized 
onions. One night in the outdoor courtyard, decorated with potted lemon trees, 
I watched a large table of young Italians put away pizza after pizza, folding 
the slices in half, talking, smoking and, finally, polishing off their informal 
meal with house-made gelato -- and, of course, tiny cups of espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 Alto Palato is still a restaurant in progress, and its menu of salads, soups, 
simple pastas, fish specials and grilled meats has its ups and downs. You can 
count on a decent and varied antipasto plate that has a miniature caprese of 
tomato, basil and mozzarella, a little bresaola (air-dried beef) , salami and 
prosciutto, and fig and melon, all for $7. A lemon-drenched seafood salad is, 
depending on the day, a mix of tender squid, shrimp, scallops and octopus. I 
like the polpette , meatballs in a simple tomato sauce, better than the suppli 
, fried rice balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Soups are rustic and filling: there's an earthy chickpea soup infused with 
fresh rosemary, or pappa al pomodoro , a porridge-like Tuscan soup of bread, 
tomatoes and basil -- very much an acquired taste. Pastas are just as un-fancy: 
wide pappardelle noodles tossed with a meaty ragu laced with mushrooms and 
peas, and rigatoni all' amatriciana , made with Roma tomatoes, pancetta and 
sharp Romano. You can order your spaghetti tossed with sauteed zucchini weighed 
down with cheese, or with ricotta seasoned with lots of lemon peel, pungent 
nutmeg and black pepper -- another acquired taste. To get prices down without 
compromising on the quality of the ingredients, the owners have excluded 
high-ticket items like lobster, scampi, duck and game birds. But they still use 
good tomatoes, prosciutto, cheese and produce. (Salad greens, however, could be 
a little less ragged.) Something like the economical rollata di vitello, a roll 
of veal stuffed with spinach greens, mortadella and frittata, is more 
interesting than a piece of grilled meat any day. Spezzatino tastes just like 
what it is, a veal stew, cooked forever, until the meat is soft as old rags. 
The grilled prime rib is just OK -- for $11.95 a person (for two), it's not a 
big surprise. However, the special veal chop offered one night, roasted with 
rosemary and served in its juices, was remarkable for its deep flavor and 
tenderness, the best veal chop I've had in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching the uninspired two-page list for an interesting Italian wine to 
accompany the food is something of a chore. The best you can hope for is 
Antinori's '93 Orvieto ($16) or '89 Chianti Classico Riserva ($28), a '92 Bolla 
Chardonnay ($17) or a '91 Plozner Merlot ($18). 
</P>
<P>
 A glass table in the center of the room holds the dessert assortment: an 
apricot crostata, a traditional open-face fruit tart with a thick, cookie-like 
crust; a fine-textured chocolate cake made with bread crumbs, apples and 
amaretto; a rather dry ricotta cheesecake, and straightforward creme caramel. 
Given the choice, I'd pass up all these sweets for the gelato every time. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the waiters, Gino Rindone from Turin, makes the absolutely first-rate 
gelato. The best is the hazelnut, made from fragrant nuts from Piedmont. His 
chocolate is deep and dark, while fior di latte, produced with eggs and cream 
(no vanilla), shows off the pure taste of cream. Sometimes he offers refreshing 
Sicilian granita di limone (lemon ice) and one of summer's greatest pleasures, 
granita di caffe , a rough slush of espresso ice crowned with loosely whipped 
cream. He also creates perfect espresso and cappuccino, topped with foam soft 
as clouds. That alone makes Alto Palato worth a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Alto Palato, 755 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood; (310) 657-9271. Closed 
Sundays. Bar open until 1:30 a.m. serving pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers and 
desserts. Dinner for two, food only, $30 to $60. Corkage $10.

ON THE RECORD: DVORAK'S SIXTH HAS ITS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert Glass, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rigidity of the standard symphonic repertory, that is, the difficulties 
encountered by any work written after Brahms in breaking into this exclusive 
club, is exemplified by the case of Dvorak's Sixth Symphony, in D, Opus 60. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixth possesses every quality one might think necessary for inclusion 
among the symphonic favorites: big, luscious, memorably distinctive tunes, 
colorful orchestration, rhythmic energy and harmonic surprises that please 
rather than disturb listeners. Yet it remains a rarity outside its native 
(Czech) precincts. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has done better by it than most 
American orchestras, having performed it on several occasions -- for the very 
first time as recently as 1978, under the late Calvin Simmons, but never under 
one of its music directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two recorded arrivals of the last month are the best possible arguments for 
the wider dissemination of this gorgeous score. Both are from Czechoslovakia, 
and each is from a conductor, alas deceased, to the manner born.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously unavailable commercially is the version conducted by the 
non-stellar Vaclav Smetacek, with the Prague Symphony, a Prague Radio taping of 
a 1975 concert (Praga/Chant du Monde 254 045). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a warmhearted beauty, played with a kind a native flavorfulness -- woody, 
bucolic clarinets and oboes, big, vibrant brass -- that has virtually 
disappeared even from East European orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 Smetacek allows the great rolling melodies of the rich opening movement to 
unfold with utmost naturalness and neatly propels the cross rhythms of the 
Scherzo-Furiant third movement. But the heart of the symphony, and of 
Smetacek's interpretation, is the moonstruck slow movement, whose principal 
theme is as haunting as anything Dvorak, or perhaps any Romantic symphonist, 
ever created. 
</P>
<P>
 The recorded sound is on the strident side but more than adequate, and the 
unfamiliar accompanying material, also by Dvorak and from the same forces, is 
welcome: the early, nationalistic cantata, "Heirs of the White Mountain," 
gutsily sung by the Prague Radio Chorus, and the terse "Armida" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Dvorak Sixth is a reissue of the celebrated 1966 edition by the 
Czech Philharmonic under Karel Ancerl (Supraphon 111 926, mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble is a more glamorous one than Smetacek's, and its execution more 
taut, if hardly less pungently idiomatic in tone color. Ancerl's view of the 
score is hard-edged beside Smetacek's, with Ancerl favoring sharply inflected 
climaxes in the corner movements and a propulsive Scherzo, flicked-out like so 
many lashes of a whip. 
</P>
<P>
 As an entity, it may be less temperate -- nervous and modern beside Smetacek's 
expansive, Old World beauty -- but ultimately no less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional material here consists of three splendid Dvorak concert 
overtures, "The Hussites," "Carnival" and "My Home," delivered with fiery 
splendor by Ancerl and his orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be late in the day to ask Carlo Maria Giulini to expand his repertory 
with the addition of Dvorak's Sixth. Still, one might have expected the 
inclusion of Dvorak's Eighth Symphony, another longtime Giulini specialty, in 
the artistically rewarding but temporally skimpy, full-priced two-CD set (Sony 
58946) presenting the conductor's latest thoughts on the Seventh and Ninth 
("New World") Symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 With Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra responding to the 
octogenarian's urgings with all the individual skill and ensemble richness of 
tone of which it us capable, Giulini produces performances of irresistible 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempos may be on the slow side -- or slower than in his previous recorded 
encounters with these scores -- but he never allows the rhythmic pulse to go 
slack, and Giulini, whether today or 20 years ago, wrings every drop of 
sentiment from the slow movement of the D-minor Symphony without making it 
sound mawkish. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its high points are less lofty, there is much to admire as well in a 
reissue of Colin Davis' dashing 1975 Dvorak Seventh, also with the 
Concertgebouw Orchestra, part of a budget-priced set (Philips Duo 438 347, two 
CDs) from these artists comprising the last three symphonies and the Symphonic 
Variations. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and the Dutch orchestra have always been a highly compatible team, and 
these performances sizzle with virtuosity and vitality.

RECORD RACK: CARPENTER'S ACHY, BREAKY SMARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman

<TEXT>
<P>
 MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER 
</P>
<P>
 "Stones in the Road" 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter has really been treading an interesting line, balancing between her 
folk instincts on one side and what the country market will bear on the other. 
"Stones" gives the line-dancing set almost nothing to latch onto, other than 
"Shut Up and Kiss Me," a perfunctory attempt to recapture the upbeat sass of 
her hit "I Feel Lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of this very subdued set is even more unaccommodating than 
usual for Carpenter: It's a sad lament for boomers' lost ideals that's more 
"Boys of Summer" than boot-scoot. 
</P>
<P>
 When at her extraordinary best, Carpenter is a lyricist to rank with John 
Prine. In "Jubilee," she extends forgiveness to a bitter pariah with such grace 
it might be God's own. Then she's the loner in "Outside Looking In" and "Where 
Time Stands Still," a romantic, pensive unmarried wondering where the dream 
went. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkable as this word-craft is, you might still wish the melodies had nearly 
the rapture or rhapsody to put the words across for all they're worth, and to 
balance a vocal delivery that tends toward the dispassionate. But Carpenter has 
the rare combo of smarts and sentiment to make her ache your ache. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

FROM THE VAULTS; SAM COOKE, RECORD MOGUL

<TEXT>
<P>
 *** 1/2; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Sam Cooke's SAR Records Story" ( ABKCO ) 
</P>
<P>
 Beware: Though the front cover of this two-disc set is an adoring drawing of 
the late Sam Cooke, this isn't a greatest-hits package. Indeed, Cooke -- whose 
sweet, soulful singing style influenced everyone from Otis Redding to Rod 
Stewart -- is represented vocally only on a few rarities, including the demo of 
his 1957 hit "You Send Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let that keep you away from the package, however, if you are a serious 
fan of the man behind such early-'60s gems as "Bring It on Home to Me" and "A 
Change Is Gonna Come." The set offers a fascinating look into the musical 
vision of one of the chief architects of modern soul music. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was he co-owner of SAR Records, but he also wrote or produced several 
of the tracks, combining gospel, R&B and pop in exciting ways as he worked with 
such artists as the Soul Stirrers, Johnnie Taylor and the Valentinos (who did 
the original "It's All Over Now," later a hit for the Rolling Stones). 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't as essential as Cooke's own recordings, but the set adds greatly to 
our appreciation of his contribution to modern pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent). 
A rating of five stars is reserved for deserving reissues and compilations.

 THE CRANBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 "No Need to Argue" 
</P>
<P>
 Island  
</P>
<P>
 * * 
</P>
<P>
 Few bands have served up two pop-rock treats as irresistible as last year's 
"Linger" and "Dreams" in an entire career, so it's unreasonable to expect this 
young Irishquartet to duplicate the magic of those songs the second time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the absence of similar treats would be less troubling if the group had 
better resolved the question of its songwriting depth.Even if you couldn't help 
turning up the volume whenever "Dreams" came on the radio, it was hard to avoid 
wondering whether there was more to the Cranberries than seductive production 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
 As if aware of the doubts, Dolores O'Riordan, an appealing singer with a flair 
for swooping, dramatic vocal twists, and songwriting partner Noel Hogan have 
shed much of the hugely successful debut album's youthful innocence in favor of 
weightier themes, mostly about the tensions of relationships. The lyrics, 
however, are mostly obvious, and the production touches have become largely 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cranberries either have to refocus on the catchy elements in their music 
(which would probably be a mistake) or find something more revealing to say in 
the lyrics. At the moment, they are in danger of ending up in a no-fan's land.

POP EYE: GENDER-BENDING 'SUPERSTAR' DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of pop stars have been accused of playing God, but here's a new twist: 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls actually is playing Jesus on a new recording of 
"Jesus Christ Superstar." It will be released Nov. 8 by Daemon Records, the 
small, Atlanta-based label that she owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone's looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christian conservatives were not too pleased with the original musical in the 
first place," says Tim Graham, assistant editor of Media Watch, a conservative 
media newsletter based in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the idea of a woman playing Jesus seems at least bizarre. . . . 
It's going to get a little freaky when they sing 'I Don't Know How to Love 
Him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But even Graham says he finds the idea amusing: "A giggle is my first 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray says that though the Indigo Girls are well-known for taking liberal 
stands, her playing Jesus is not meant to offend religious sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't present it as 'Jesus as a woman,' but Jesus as Jesus -- played by a 
woman," she says. "My mom has no problem that I played Jesus, and she's pretty 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for Ray to take the part came from the album's producer, Atlanta 
musician Michael Lorant, who insists that it's not a vanity project for Ray or 
her Indigo partner, Emily Saliers, who plays Mary Magdalene. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more concern to conservatives is the fact that the album's proceeds will 
benefit handgun control, a personal cause of Lorant's, who was mugged and shot 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of the musical is probably more crucifix control than gun 
control," says Graham. "When you do a musical about Jesus that's benefiting gun 
control, it's like saying Jesus is on the side of handgun control." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Ray's role reversal, the album actually plays it pretty close to 
the original album production, the breakthrough collaboration of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber and Tim Rice that spent three weeks at No. 1 in 1970. (Deep Purple's Ian 
Gillan sang the role of Jesus on that recording.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, in town recently to see concerts by his "Lion King" partner Elton John, 
said that he hadn't heard about the new version of "Superstar," but found the 
notion of a woman playing the title role "interesting, as long as it isn't 
meant mockingly." Steve Hochman

 A new Bob Dylan song, "Dignity," will be included on his "Greatest Hits Vol. 
3," due in January and featuring songs dating back to 1974's "Knockin' on 
Heaven's Door." Dylan hasn't released an album of his own new songs in four 
years and there are apparently no plans for one at this time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dylan is also one of the contributors to "Till the Night Is Gone," an album 
honoring the late songwriter Doc Pomus, due in February.Dylan does "Boogie 
Woogie Country Girl," while other participants include Aaron Neville ("Save the 
Last Dance for Me"), Lou Reed ("This Magic Moment"), Los Lobos ("Lonely 
Avenue"), Shawn Colvin ("Viva Las Vegas"), plus John Hiatt, Brian Wilson, B.B. 
King and Dion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Joey Ramone, who's spent the last 20 years singing with his pretend brothers 
in the Ramones, has collaborated with his real brother, Mickey Leigh, under the 
fitting name of Sibling Rivalry. A three-song single is being released by 
Alternative Tentacles, the label owned by Jello Biafra. 
</P>
<P>
 Live recordings of Rosanne Cash dueting with David Byrne, Shawn Colvin dueting 
with Mary Chapin Carpenter and Bruce Cockburn backed by Lou Reed and Cash are 
among the selections collected from the "Columbia Records Radio Hour" program 
for an album due in January. Others featured are Leonard Cohen, Darden Smith 
and Peter Himmelman.*

THE CHARTS: LONGEST 'NIGHT'

 A&M Records' perserverance certainly paid off in the case of Sheryl Crow's 
"Tuesday Night Music Club" album. It came out in August of last year, but only 
recently started scoring on the pop chart -- No. 6 on the Times' Southern 
California chart and No. 8 nationally. A hit single, "All I Wanna Do" (No. 13 
on the local pop singles chart) is fueling the surge. There was no dropoff on 
Anita Baker's second-week numbers (No. 2 in Southern California and No. 3 
nationally), indicating that, despite the long layoff, she probably still has a 
sizeable fan base that could keep the album in the Top 10 for a while. TOP 10

 COVER UP: The Black Crowes' new album, "Amorica," won't hit the stores until 
Nov. 1, but the band is already anticipating some friction regarding the cover 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a picture of a female crotch, adorned with a skimpy American flag bikini 
with a tuft of pubic hair showing at the top.The photo was originally the cover 
shot of the 1976 Bicentennial issue of Hustler magazine, and Crowes singer 
Chris Robinson thought it was a perfect illustration of the title concept, 
which plays on the words America , amore and amoral . 
</P>
<P>
 Crowes manager Pete Angelus says that one record store chain has already said 
it won't carry the cover (he wouldn't name the chain). An alternate cover has 
been prepared, with the skin and hair blacked out leaving just a triangle of 
flag material. The band is still deciding whether it will offer the alternate 
to stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK to see guns and violence, but God forbid if we see pubic hair," says 
Angelus. Steve Hochman

 HOLLY WOULD: Frankie Goes to Hollywood was generally more known in the 
mid-'80s for provocativeness than music, and the latest release from the 
group's former singer, Holly Johnson, keeps that tradition going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)," Johnson's first new release since 
revealing early last year that he is HIV-positive, consists largely of a list 
of people whom Johnson believes were or are homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The names range from Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci to more recent pop 
heroes including the late Andy Warhol and Boy George, as well as Johnson 
himself. There's been some confusion over one name: Michael Mouse, which is not 
a reference to Disney's Mickey but to a gay character from author Armistead 
Maupin's "Tales of the City" stories.  
</P>
<P>
 "The people I mention made a large contribution to the culture of the planet 
-- not only heterosexual culture, but queer culture," Johnson says. "Basically 
it's my thank you to the gay community because there aren't enough 
life-affirming experiences for gay people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Johnson reportedly had difficulty finding a distributor for the 
record due to fears of legal repercussions. He finally struck a deal in Britain 
with PolyGram. Dave Jennings, from London

 MORE FROM LONDON: Sinead O'Connor has assembled a new band, but don't put down 
deposits on concert tickets yet. The group will back O'Connor on a series of TV 
and radio appearances in the U.S. this month to promote her new "Universal 
Mother" album, but those close to the controversial singer are still uncertain 
whether she'll return to the concert stage.Her last live appearance was two 
years ago at the Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden where she 
was booed mercilessly by people upset over her tearing up a photo of the Pope 
on "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, O'Connor has contributed her song "Three Babies" to the compilation 
album "A Woman's Heart 2 -- The Fiery Musical Pulse of Ireland." The record is 
a follow-up to a collection of Irish women singers' music released in that 
country two years ago that is still a Top 5 seller there. On the new album, 
O'Connor is joined by Mary Black, Maura O'Connell, Dolores Keane and other folk 
and pop singers. Dave Jennings, from London

CRITIC'S PICK: 'MR. SATURDAY NIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Written by the hot team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, this 1992 look at a 
half- century in the life and times of battling comic Buddy Young Jr. (Billy 
Crystal, pictured) is as funny a film as Crystal has done.He not only stars in 
the film but also makes his debut as a director -- an instance of overreaching. 
Crystal spent nearly a decade developing the material on the Borscht Belt 
generation of stand-up comics who moved on to the plusher pastures of TV. While 
Crystal must be credited for the pains he has gone to show us the unappealing, 
egocentric side of Buddy, his heart isn't in making the comic a moral monster. 
Unfortunately, Crystal's turn toward sentimentality, not sentiment, is the 
film's least appealing tendency (Showtime Wednesday at 9:35 p.m.). Kenneth 
Turan

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; POP REDMAN OUTDOES SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Heckman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jazz, with a few exceptions, has never been much of an arena for 
father-and-son acts. Tenor saxophonists Dewey and Joshua Redman are among the 
rare contemporary examples, and these two new albums -- which include both 
individual and tandem performances -- provide a fascinating opportunity for a 
generational view of the improvisational art. 
</P>
<P>
 DEWEY REDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 "African Venus" 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence Music  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 The uniquely loose-and-easy style that the elder Redman brought to his 1960s 
association with Ornette Coleman (and in the '80s to Old and New Dreams) 
persists in his still-provocative playing. 
</P>
<P>
 His highly personal approach to melody, most noticeably apparent in his solos 
on "Echo Prayer" and "Take the 'A' Train," results in a slippery liquid line 
that spreads around the rhythm -- almost, but not quite, threatening to throw 
off the meter. The technique is more vocal than instrumental, and extends (on 
the title track) into a lengthy chorus on an African double-reed woodwind and a 
subsequent passage that might best be described as scat singing in tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Redman joins the band for three tunes. The younger player's line is 
more precise, more to the point and far busier than that of his father -- a 
clear juxtaposition of the differences between the probing, find-your-own-way 
improvising of the '60s and the rapid-fire, rush-to-judgment, 
fill-in-all-the-gaps styles of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 JOSHUA REDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 "MoodSwing " 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 * * 
</P>
<P>
 Superlative jazz improvisation -- whether the consequence of a lucky gene 
pool, sheer natural ability or hard work (and maybe all three) -- is something 
that Joshua Redman does with exceeding ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps too much ease. Make no mistake about it, this is excellent music 
(despite a too-heavy dose of soul jazz tunes), especially in those moments in 
which Redman is exchanging licks with gifted bassist Christian McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 But Redman, at this stage in his career, is more easily identified by the 
extraordinary rapidity of his articulation and an encyclopedic ability to pull 
an array of styles and eras into his solos (a bit of hard bop here, some 
Rollins or Coltrane runs there, a twist of avant-garde to button things off) 
than by the uniqueness of his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his father, however, who doesn't play remarkably fast, nor with a 
particularly wide stylistic range, Redman has not yet managed to create a 
singular presence for himself. A potential monster talent, he needs to worry 
less about stretching his technical envelope and spend more time looking into 
the heart of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

CRITIC'S PICK: 'FALLEN CHAMP: THE UNTOLD STORY OF MIKE TYSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Kopple's 1993 documentary for NBC is brawny, roundhouse filmmaking, 
tapping many emotions while adding to the lore about its controversial and 
perplexing subject.More than just a story about Tyson's success and decline, 
culminating in his conviction for raping beauty contestant Desiree Washington, 
the film examines a male environment in which violence against women is winked 
at. It also casts a youthful Tyson (pictured) in an almost loving light, 
showing him as someone who, almost in the same breath, could express tenderness 
and speak about crime being "exciting." (USA Saturday at noon.) Howard

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; MICHAEL ZASLOW STIRS THE PLOT ON 'GUIDING LIGHT' AND 
HOPES FOR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT RORKE, Robert Rorke is a New York-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For actor Michael Zaslow, the secret to playing a successful soap villain used 
to be "leaving every so often, either dying or being sent off in disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
 As Roger Thorpe on CBS' daytime drama "Guiding Light," Zaslow has done both -- 
taking two sabbaticals from the role he has played for more than 20 years and 
coming back stronger (and meaner) and more compelling each time. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent return to the show, in 1989, resulted in a series of dynamic 
story lines that made Thorpe the focus and earned him three nominations for the 
best actor Daytime Emmy. He won the prize last May in a moment he clearly 
relished but doesn't expect to pave the way to future riches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't hurt that I got (the Emmy), but if somebody calls and asks about 
my interest in a movie or a TV movie, is it because I won the Emmy?" Zaslow 
wonders over lunch at the Central Park Boathouse cafe. "I don't know, because 
I've been around for 25 years and I show no signs of quitting, so they say, 
'Well if he's gonna be in our faces ...' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zaslow trails off with some hearty laughter but his background bears out his 
belief that "a career is largely a result of tenacity, perseverance, talent and 
luck, perhaps with luck rated at the top of that list." 
</P>
<P>
 In his early days, Zaslow acknowledges he was a theater snob. "Television was 
an accident to me," he says. "I was a serious artiste. I didn't want to be a 
star in that sense." 
</P>
<P>
 On this sweltering summer day, the 51-year-old actor could not look less like 
his devious TV character. He's traded Thorpe's double-breasted Armani armor for 
green shorts and a green embroidered Central Park T-shirt. His trusty, 
20-year-old Motobecane bicycle is locked up outside. Like Roger, Zaslow's 
career is full of surprises. His early days acting were spent on the West 
Coast, in musicals, both as a baritone with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera 
and the USO (he toured Asia playing opposite Bonnie Franklin in "Carousel"). 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood, Calif., native, who graduated UCLA with a degree in political 
science, did his share of episodic television before tackling Broadway. There, 
in 1971, he starred as Perchik in "Fiddler on the Roof," where he met his wife 
Susan Hufford, whose career is as diverse as his own. Once a singer-actress, 
she's now a psychotherapist. The couple have adopted two Korean girls, Marika, 
11, and Helena, 8. "I would never have been able to stay on a show -- I'm in my 
sixth year now -- before children," he confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another strong reason for doing daytime cropped up three years ago when Zaslow 
and National Endowment for the Arts chairperson Jane Alexander, among others, 
were embezzled by their business manager -- "Everything we'd ever saved." While 
his business manager serves a jail sentence, Zaslow has to pay back taxes to 
the government for returns he and his wife thought were filed but never were. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zaslow has no "aching" ambition "to be on a prime-time series at all," 
he and pal Ed Sherin (Alexander's husband and producer of "Law & Order") have 
discussed possible roles for him on the New York-based prime-time show. ("I was 
considered for about a minute and a half for Michael Moriarty's replacement," 
Zaslow reveals with a smile.) 
</P>
<P>
 What he really wants to do, though, is get back to the theater. Emmy Award 
notwithstanding, the stage is where Zaslow had what he expects will be the most 
"magic" moment of his career: the night he took over -- on three hours' notice 
-- for an ailing Keir Dullea in the 1974 Broadway revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof," opposite Elizabeth Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out for my curtain call, right before Liz, the audience stood up 
and started going to town. Then she came out after me applauding and separated 
the whole cast, just left me and my crutch and my vulnerability, center stage 
looking out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments like that are rare in any career. Until another one occurs, Michael 
Zaslow will have to be satisfied with his Emmy -- more than television's 
equivalent of a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guiding Light" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on CBS.

PROFILE; MARLEE MATLIN'S STRONG 'WILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlee Matlin was surprised at her parents' reaction to her latest movie, 
"Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story," premiering Wednesday on cable's 
Lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the disturbing true story, the hearing-impaired actress plays Carrie Buck, 
a developmentally slow hearing woman who, in 1927, became the test case for a 
landmark Supreme Court ruling legalizing the sterilization of mentally 
deficient women against their will. Melissa Gilbert also stars as a young 
lawyer who takes on Buck's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad is probably one of the most sensitive men I know," says the ebullient 
actress, through her interpreter, Jack Jason. Though Matlin, who won the best 
actress Oscar for 1986's "Children of a Lesser God," prefers to sign her 
interviews, she frequently breaks into conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is probably he's overprotective of me," Matlin, 29, says of her 
father. "He wanted to protect me. When the movie started he instantly began to 
cry. I said, 'Dad! It's only the credits.' And he said, 'Just hold on, Marlee.' 
He watched the movie. He talked to the TV and he kept looking at me like he was 
making sure I was all right and kept saying, 'Why is this happening? Is it 
true?' He was very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother was equally emotional. "My mom was in the middle of watching this 
and she said, 'I don't know if I can take this anymore.' I don't know if she 
meant that the movie itself is not what she couldn't take, or was it the work 
that I did she couldn't take, or the character, what I was going through, she 
couldn't take. I didn't discuss it with them. We didn't get to talk about what 
they were thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Matlin chose to do the movie because it was controversial. And also because 
she felt a kinship with Buck. "I was proud to portray her because I felt such 
an amazing instinct to protect her, to represent her in a positive way, while 
at the same time highlighting such a negative issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress first received Brian Ross' script, then called "The Friendly 
Suit," four years ago. "I remember (saying to the producers), 'Is this 
character deaf?' And they said, 'No.' I said, 'Just go ahead and write the 
script and make it possible for me to play it.' They made it possible for me to 
play it because this is a person who was hearing, but she wasn't hearing in a 
sense that we consider a normal functioning woman." 
</P>
<P>
 And one would never know watching the film that Matlin is deaf. Even her 
mother asked her if there was someone underneath the cameras giving Matlin her 
cues. "I said, 'No, no one was helping me.' I was working and that was my work 
as an actor. That's the one thing I'm proud of. I did it on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for her part, Matlin visited a mental hospital in North Carolina, 
where the film was shot. "They were very nice to show me the residential part 
of the hospital and the different behaviors of individuals. It was overwhelming 
to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
 She met two deaf men during her visit. "They were not responsive at all, but 
did respond when I signed to them, but then they couldn't respond back. (They) 
made me realize how I appreciate where I come from and the fact that I have 
what I have. I have a great deal of good fortune. It's one of the reasons I 
chose to do the role of Carrie Buck because she had nothing. She didn't even 
have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a hearing person is not something Matlin wants to do "repeatedly." But 
after winning her Oscar, Matlin has sought out challenging parts -- whether it 
be a snotty cashier in "The Linguini Incident" or a modern-day Robin Hood in an 
episode of "Picket Fences" last season. Five years ago, Matlin made her 
speaking debut in the CBS movie "A Bridge to Silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Matlin says she's trying to broaden her horizons. "I am doing something 
right," she says, laughing. And indeed she is. Matlin received two Emmy 
nominations this last season for guest appearances on "Seinfeld," as one of 
Jerry's girlfriends, and for her "Picket Fences" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, I can't just get what Julia Roberts gets and Susan Sarandon gets. 
But that's OK. I let myself look at scripts, and if there's something in the 
script that's not written for me, I say, 'Can you change it for me and make me 
fit in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She would have loved to have had a crack at Jane Campion's acclaimed "The 
Piano." "Holly Hunter was terrific," she says. "She's a great actress. I admire 
her a great deal, but I don't know if it would have been a loss if she wasn't 
in it. I think that's the truth, but at the same time, she was terrific in it 
and I voted for her. I think that a deaf actress could have had the opportunity 
to play that role." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Matlin adds, she did meet with "Piano" director Jane Campion. But 
Matlin was still involved in her 1991-93 NBC series "Reasonable Doubts," and 
the schedules conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Matlin is in the market to do another TV series. "I'm meeting with several 
people right now for next season with various ideas," she says.

 If she does another hour series, Matlin would prefer an ensemble piece. " 
'Reasonable Doubts' was extremely exhausting because it was myself and Mark 
Harmon," she says. "The first year was very exciting because it was all new and 
the scripts were OK. But the second year, things sort of fell apart. It was a 
good experience, but I'm glad we moved on."

 "Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story" premieres Wednesday at 9 and 11 p.m. 
on Lifetime.

RETRO; DAYS OF INNOCENCE; 'DISNEY DRIVE-IN' FILLS SATURDAY AFTERNOONS WITH THE 
STUFF BABY BOOMERS WATCHED GROWING UP 
</P>

 "Disney Drive-In," the Disney Channel's new Saturday afternoon showcase, is 
supposed to be for the kids. But don't tell that to baby boomers. For anyone 
who grew up in the '50s and '60s, "Disney Drive-In" is a trip down memory lane 
and a chance to visit such old friends as Spin, Marty, Moochie, Annette and the 
Hardy Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this week, the Disney Channel will offer old-fashioned movie matinee 
entertainment. Back in the 1920s, '30s and '40s, kids would flock to a movie 
theater to see a cartoon, serial, short and then the main feature. The "Disney 
Drive-In" is a tribute to those moviegoing days. 
</P>
<P>
 The series will feature classic Disney films, specials and television shows 
created by the Walt Disney Studios in the '50s and '60s. The matinees begin 
each Saturday at 1:30 p.m. with an episode of the Disney TV series "Zorro," 
starring Guy Williams as the aristrocratic Diego de La Vega, who becomes the 
legendary masked rider and hero of the oppressed in early California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zorro" originally aired on ABC from 1957 to 1959. Though the series was shot 
in black-and-white, the Disney Channel has colorized all the episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Following "Zorro" at 2 p.m. are series that appeared on the old ABC "Disney" 
show, such as "'Texas John Slaughter," starring Tom Tryon; "The Saga of Andy 
Burnett," with Jerome Courtland; and "The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca," with 
Robert Loggia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western adventure "Texas John Slaughter," scheduled for the first 
Saturday, aired during the 1958-59 season. Tryon, who later became the 
best-selling novelist of "The Other," "Harvest House" and "Fedora," plays a 
peaceful man who wants to settle down and marry. But first he has to tame the 
area's lawlessness, so he joins the Texas Rangers. "Texas John Slaughter," 
which also featured Robert Middleton, Norma Moore and Harry Carey Jr., was the 
biggest hit for the "Disney" series since "Davy Crockett." The Disney Channel 
will air all 17 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m., "Disney Drive-In" presents serials from the original "Mickey Mouse 
Club," including "Spin and Marty," "Annette" and "The Hardy Boys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Spin and Marty" is first out of the starting gate. The action-adventure deal 
focuses on two boys and their experiences at summer ranch. Tim Considine stars 
as the down-to-earth Spin, David Stollery stars as the rich and snobbish Marty, 
a.k.a. Master Martin Markam, and Kevin Corcoran is the irrepressible Moochie. 
And who could forget Skyrocket the horse? 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the matinee will be classic Disney features. This Saturday is 
Part I of the entertaining period adventure "The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh," 
starring Patrick McGoohan of "The Prisoner" as a mild-mannered vicar who defies 
the heavy taxation of King George III by becoming a pirate and a smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was released theatrically in Europe in 1962 as "Dr. Syn: Alias the 
Scarecrow" and frequently appears on TV under that title. NBC's "The Wonderful 
World of Color" aired the film in three parts in early 1964. The Disney Channel 
also is presenting "Scarecrow" over the next three weeks.

PRIVATE LIVES; FAMILY; 'UNPIGGED' PIGS OUT ON MUSIC FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Miss Piggy falling for love-sick, heavy-metal wild man Ozzy Osbourne? And, 
what's going on between Kermie and pop diva Linda Ronstadt? 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiring minds -- and Muppet fans -- can find the answers in "kermit 
unpigged," a musical blast of hilarity from Jim Henson Records/BMG Kidz, a 
takeoff on rock music's "unplugged" craze.Miss Piggy (Frank Oz) is very much on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Osbourne and Ronstadt, celeb performers on the collection of 
familiar pop and country hits include Lily Tomlin, George Benson, Jimmy 
Buffett, Vince Gill and Don Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of TV's vaudevillian, celebrity-laden "The Muppet Show," the 
wacky but tuneful album is both child-friendly and a clever, satiric hoot for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 A few highlights: Tomlin in her "Ernestine" persona as the studio 
receptionist: "Pardon me, but the livestock entrance is around back." Kermit 
and Miss Piggy summing up their relationship with a parody of the Fine Young 
Cannibals' "She Drives Me Crazy." And Miss Piggy surviving a "Born to Be Wild" 
encounter with Osbourne -- "Boy, did I open the wrong door." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Kermit (Steve Whitmire) sounds different, but his sweetness, paternal 
leadership and perplexity in the face of comic chaos remain true to the froggy 
essence of the late Jim Henson's alter ego.

A PAT HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Emerson's "I, Screenwriter" (Sept. 11) exemplified the politics of the 
"it's who -you-know-not- what -you-know" complaint heard around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson basically says that he had no experience writing films, had a rotten 
pitch and yet -- thanks to Julia Sweeney -- found himself in the position of 
being a screenwriter on an $8-million comedy for Touchstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the development process as a befuddled outsider might be amusing 
for him, but for those of us who take the craft of screenwriting seriously, 
Emerson's bafflement is a bad joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not admit that if it wasn't for his relationship with Sweeney and Quentin 
Tarantino, Emerson would be reviewing "It's Pat" instead of writing it.

<P>
 Thank you, Lawrence Christon, for telling all of Los Angeles about one of its 
"hidden" treasures, the Groundlings ("In Praise of Silliness," Sept. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 I have yet to see a Groundlings show that has failed to provide me with 
continuous laughter, and judging from the capacity crowds that always seem to 
accompany me, I am not alone.Best of all, the Groundlings provide "real" humor. 
The laughs they bring about come from the characters and sketches they create. 
They are not the result of vulgar and foul-mouthed dialogue. This is humor 
everyone can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us hope that one of the TV networks finally wakes up and notices true 
talent (well, one can dream). Until then, I'll continue to go to the Groundling 
Theatre to catch the best comedy entertainment in L.A.

 Groundlings may come and Groundlings may go, they may zing or they be just 
plain silly, but in my many years of reviewing theater in Los Angeles, I found 
them to be generally forced and restricted by too many set pieces (and the 
music was deafening). 
</P>
<P>
 For my money, the best improv group in L.A. was Dee Marcus' Off the Wall. 
Every show was completely unscripted, based solely on audience suggestions. You 
never saw the same show twice. Former Times reviewer John Mahoney referred to 
them as "joined at the quip." Thanks to tremendous rapport among cast members 
and Dee's impeccable sense of timing in knowing when to end a skit, Off the 
Wall was a never-ending source of delight you enjoyed seeing again and again. 
It was the jumping-off place for Robin Williams, pre-"Mork and Mindy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to Off the Wall?

CELEBRATION THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan Breslauer's coverage of Celebration Theatre ("Visibility. Stability. Now, 
the Next Step," Sept. 11) is an overdue look at L.A.'s oldest lesbian and gay 
theater. But her conclusions are quite different from those I made as a 
reviewer of Celebration's plays for much of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece suggested that Celebration had only recently staged socially 
relevant productions, and contrasted its "stunted" fare to East Coast AIDS 
dramas staged in 1985. But in 1983, Celebration offered Bob Hagedorn's "One." 
Two more early AIDS plays -- "Warren" and "Do Rattlesnakes Bite in the Dark?" 
-- followed in the fall of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Charles Rowland, who founded Celebration, deserves better treatment 
than to be scapegoated for sabotaging his own creation. Many directors found 
Rowland, though stingy, to be generous regarding artistic freedom. His 
pre-scandal staging of the radical work of Robert Chesley suggests that 
Celebration did not have "one foot stuck in the past," as Breslauer writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland co-founded the first American gay rights organization in 1950 and in 
1982 envisioned culture as the next arena of the gay movement. He was right, 
and his legacy deserves preservation. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I found many statements by Celebration Theatre Artistic Director Robert 
Schrock sad and very disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point he says, "For every 20 male scripts that I get, there's only one 
female script, and it probably isn't good." As a onetime member of the board 
and dramaturge for Celebration, I read many wonderful scripts by women. I think 
the real problem lies in his preceding statement: "Not being a lesbian, it 
makes it even harder for me to find what they want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Who are they ? It sounds like he's talking about aliens from another planet. 
Either find someone (a woman would make sense) to read lesbian scripts who 
understands "what they want," or change Celebration to an all-gay-male theater. 
We aliens will just start our own.

TARANTINO UNIVERSITY

 In response to the two Quentin Tarantino-bashing letters last Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Tarantino isn't just in the forefront of a new generation of 
filmmakers, he is the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get there by getting straight A's in film school or by worrying why 
someone in Kansas would want to see his movies. He got there because he has 
conviction, drive, passion and, yes, talent. 
</P>
<P>
 After working on three films with Quentin, I say, thanks -- you're the best 
film school anyone could ask for.

 Hollywood finally finds the perfect filming location, a place where money can 
buy you anything ("Wet and Wild Pandas," by Rone Tempest, Sept. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 The crew "dammed up waterfalls, built roads, remodeled villages and . . . 
built an artificial ledge on a cliff face." 
</P>
<P>
 How can people with so little respect for nature actually be making a nature 
film? "Similar activities in Yellowstone would result in a long jail term," 
Tempest writes. These people should be thrown in jail anyway!

OBESITY IS WEIGHTY, AGING ADDS WRINKLES TO FOREIGN ADOPTIONS; CULTURE: ONE 
MAN'S BATTLE TO RETAIN CUSTODY OF KOREAN CHILD AFTER HIS WIFE DIED DEMONSTRATES 
HOW DIFFICULT THE PROCESS CAN BECOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Obesity is disdained, advanced age scorned. And single parents might as well 
forget even trying. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the rules for an American who hopes to adopt a Korean infant, and 
they're not unusual: In a growing number of cases, would-be American parents 
are coming up against cultural differences that complicate foreign adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for pitfalls was driven home when Keith Lussier, a potato chip 
salesman from Cheektowaga, N.Y., fought an unusual legal battle in August for 
the fatherhood of the 11-month-old girl he named Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
 Lussier's wife, Kimberly, 27, had died of uterine cancer July 17 and turned 
him into something their agency didn't want: a single parent rearing a Korean 
child. The baby was confiscated and relocated three days after the funeral, and 
Lussier fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something no parent should have to go through," said Lussier, 28, 
after a county judge ruled the child belonged with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, Love the Children, has appealed the decision, arguing that rules 
and common sense dictated Brittany's relocation. Lussier and Brittany were 
reunited Aug. 30, but the appeal is pending in state Superior Court. Arguments 
are scheduled for early October. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption experts consider the Lussier case a fluke of circumstance. But in a 
changing global landscape where adoption often involves international 
maneuverings and bureaucratic entanglement, many think such issues could arise 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: In China, foreign adoptive parents should be at least 35 years 
old and childless; in Korea, 40 is the maximum age. Poland typically seeks and 
prefers Catholic families and prefers some Polish ethnicity in the adoptive 
families. India's government requires agencies to place two children with 
Indian families for every one placed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The requirements generally reflect the culture. Most countries are looking 
for what they consider the ideal family," said Susan Freivalds, executive 
director of Adoptive Families of America, a Minneapolis support organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what is an ideal family? It's different in every culture," she said. 
"It's like a little patchwork you have to get through. You kind of plug 
yourself into the country where you fit." 
</P>
<P>
 And Americans have. They adopted 7,348 babies from more than three dozen 
countries last year, and Korea topped the list with 1,765 foreign adoptions, 
according to Freivalds' organization. The former Soviet Union was second with 
1,107 adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, Eastern Europe, China and many Latin American countries have 
encouraged more adoptions in the last five years, making more babies available 
and shifting focus from Korea. But as adoptions increase, the countries' 
operations become more elaborate. And that's not always productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about whole new world regions that are involved in the 
process," said Clyde R. Tolley, executive director of Families Adopting 
Children Everywhere, an international adoption group. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't believe that foreign adoptions are becoming more difficult but says 
nations' moves to centralize procedures could lead to stricter standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to see restrictions appear, they're going to be universal and 
there won't be exceptions," Tolley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern international adoption began after World War II when large numbers of 
European and Asian children were adopted by Americans. With the Korean War, 
attention turned to Korean orphans, and today more than 100,000 Korean children 
have come to the United States through adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of international adoptions peaked at 10,097 in 1987 -- in part, 
many say, because the flow from Korea has slowed and policies have tightened. 
It dipped after that and has stabilized at between 6,000 and 8,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most international adoptions are not pegged to war or other crises as 
they once were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reason for some of these countries' restrictions was that they 
perceived that American families were exploiting their country by taking their 
children away," said Kenneth Watson, assistant director of the Chicago Child 
Care Society, a nonprofit children's agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Graves, Love the Children's executive director, testified at Lussier's 
hearing that Korea tightened its policies after 1985 and made suggestions into 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the Korean way," she said. "They mention it, they recommend it, then 
they come down and say, 'This is it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An international attempt to standardize, called the Hague Convention on 
Intercountry Adoption, would provide a system of safeguards and processes to 
protect the rights of all parties. It is still in the drafting stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, adoption agencies must operate in a very complicated world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that we're keeping two federal governments happy for every 
little muffin that comes in is miraculous," said AnnaMarie Merrill of the 
International Concerns Committee for Children in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucks County Judge Leonard B. Sokolove, who ruled on the Lussier case, said in 
reading his decision that adoptions -- especially international adoptions -- 
may not always end perfectly but usually are better than no adoption at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could always find someplace that is better for our children," Sokolove 
said. "We have to recognize that we're playing the odds."

CLINTON STILL ENJOYS GOODWILL AT BUS STOP; ILLINOIS: IT SEEMED LIKE THE ENTIRE 
TOWN OF SANDOVAL HAD LINED THE HIGHWAY FOR THE CAMPAIGN BUS TOUR THAT SUMMER OF 
'92. CLINTON ORDERED THE CONVOY TO STOP SO HE COULD SPEAK. TWO YEARS LATER, THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS ARE EASY TO FIND, BUT CLINTON-HATERS ARE NOT. 
</P>

<P>
 To read some newspapers, watch some television shows or listen to certain 
radio hosts, you could get the idea that there are people across America who 
hate President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are. You'd just be hard pressed to find them here. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, little Sandoval -- 1,535 people huddled against a sea of corn 
stalks -- would seem a good place to tap into the groundswell of anti-Clinton 
feeling that seemed to rumble around the country this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 People here hold to traditional values. They're Democrats, but conservative, 
in a small-town, Harry-Truman kind of way. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of them lined the highway in 1992 when the Democratic campaign bus tour 
breezed through -- so many, in fact, that Clinton ordered the buses to stop so 
he could get out and speak. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised change. People believed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they feel betrayed now? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a reasonable question to ask because there are people elsewhere who 
clearly feel a deep, personal loathing for the President -- a sense of betrayal 
if they voted for him, just plain anger if they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there are plenty of people who support him -- the President's approval 
ratings have stayed pretty close to the 43% of the electorate that voted him 
into office. But you don't have to go far to hear the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Every once in a while, a President comes along who, if he was a piece of gym 
equipment, would be the heavy bag. Franklin Roosevelt was one, if you were 
conservative. Richard Nixon was one, if you were liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bill Clinton is one, if you believe what you hear and read. 
</P>
<P>
 But not in Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at the Double D Hair Salon, where either Darrena or Darlene -- it isn't 
clear which, she wouldn't say -- looks up from washing hair clips and says, "I 
just think he's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Not at the Sandoval House Restaurant, where waitress Doris Lyons looks a bit 
dreamy when she describes how the President talks: "He's got a nice, soft 
voice. He's easy to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Whitie's Barber Shop, where proprietor Steve Gregory whips out two 
Clinton-Gore campaign buttons from the wooden cabinet where he stores the combs 
and hair goop. "I think he's doing a great job," Gregory says. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, Gary Deadmond, likes Clinton. "Bill Clinton said he stood for 
change, and he is trying to change things," Deadmond says. "With all the 
problems in Congress, he's having a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sandoval, you will find people who are disappointed in Clinton, who 
strongly disagree with him, who even dislike him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sort of person who would believe Jerry Falwell when he all but accuses 
the President of murder? The sort of person who would own a popular bumper 
sticker that says: "Smoke dope, dodge draft, cheat wife, become President. . . 
. The new American Way!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not here. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Resch owns the local video store, a little cottage with white aluminum 
siding and a gravel parking lot. He voted for Clinton and has lived to regret 
it. "I've joined forces with those who think he's turned out to be a weak 
President. He's real wishy-washy." 
</P>
<P>
 Resch leans on the counter, a small, muscular man with sweptback bristles of 
red hair shading to gray. And he voices some complaints about Clinton that are 
common here, even among the President's most ardent supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the things he said he was going to do, the first thing he came out 
with was gay rights," Resch says, referring to Clinton's gays-in-the-military 
policy. "With all the problems we have, that just really turned me off. And his 
foreign policy -- he doesn't have a foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Resch expresses something else that's common here. He trusts Clinton, he 
says, and believes he means well. He isn't bothered in the least by Clinton's 
Whitewater investments or by the stories about the President's supposed 
extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm down on the press for that," he says. "It just seems like any subject, 
they go to extremes. . . . It seems like once they got a guy down, they just 
keep stomping on him." 
</P>
<P>
 A customer comes in. Scott Magnus is a big, dark-bearded, 34-year-old grain 
farmer who voted for Bush, likes Rush Limbaugh and doesn't think much of 
Clinton's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, "I really, truly believe that in most of what he does, Clinton 
means well." 
</P>
<P>
 So he doesn't hate Clinton? "I don't hate anybody," Magnus says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a friendly place, Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of July 21, 1992, the Clinton campaign came rolling up Highway 
51, the road that nicks the edge of Sandoval on its way from Centralia to 
Vandalia. Those are the big towns around here, where many people in Sandoval 
drive to work. There aren't a lot of jobs in Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 What there were a lot of, at least on that night, were supporters of Bill 
Clinton and Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimates range from 300 to 1,000 -- it doesn't much matter which is 
right. The point is that what seemed like the entire town was stretched out 
along the highway, everybody waving American flags and Clinton-Gore banners, 
singing patriotic songs, cheering in the warm Midwest night. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ordered the bus to stop. He and Gore and their wives got out, hopped 
onto the roof of a limousine and spoke. It turned out to be a magical moment, 
one of the most memorable of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are old men, Al Gore and I, we will say, 'You should have seen the 
crowd in Sandoval,' " Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sandoval, it was the most memorable moment since -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Hensen, Democratic committeewoman, had organized the rally. "It was 
something Sandoval will never forget," she says now. "Because that day we were 
somebody. We meant something to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton went on to beat George Bush here by better than 3-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 This town is almost all white, mostly Democratic and largely fed up with the 
whole lollygagging, tax-sucking, gossip-mongering Washington Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 They are people who didn't dodge the draft during the Vietnam War, whose 
children fought in Desert Storm. They are anti-immigration, anti-welfare, 
pro-gun, pro-flag. And despite it all, many are pro-Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Dave Schilling. Schilling owns a woodworking shop on North Main 
Street. He's gangly, 50 years old, with a long, droopy mustache. He wears 
suspenders hooked to his blue jeans. He is a registered Republican who voted 
for Ross Perot. And he doesn't like Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Him?" he says, his voice rising when the subject of the President is 
broached. "You mean her! President Clinton -- that's Hillary. He's just a 
figurehead. And they both ought to be impeached." 
</P>
<P>
 Schilling is standing outside his shop. He beckons a visitor inside, saying, 
"I'm probably the only person in Sandoval who doesn't like Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 "This town carried Bill Clinton," he goes on, his voice turning sharp with 
sarcasm. "Everybody in this town voted for him. . . . He could have said he 
would have doubled the income tax and everything else, and they still would 
have voted for him. Because, hell, he stopped to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Schilling missed the bus tour, quite intentionally. "I wouldn't walk across 
the street to see him if he came today." 
</P>
<P>
 He hates Clinton's health care plan. He hates his foreign policy. He hates 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But hate Bill Clinton? "I hate nobody," Schilling says. "Well, I got a few 
people who owe me money I kinda dislike. . . . No, hating's for young people. 
I'm too old to hate anybody."

JAPAN'S TOP PRIVATE EYE PREACHES GENTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAVEN SMILLIE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michinao Kodama, a courteous, dapper man of 73, considers most of his fellow 
Japanese private investigators to be "an ill-mannered bunch of thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your gangsters, frauds, extortionists, your incompetent dilettantes" go into 
the business, says Kodama, who has spent most of a lifetime trying to change 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 During four decades as proprietor of the Japan Detective Assn., a school and 
agency acknowledged to be one of the most honorable, the dean of private eyes 
has made a crusade of improving his trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a modest classroom at his headquarters, where Kodama teaches students such 
basics as conducting surveillance, he also schools them in professional ethics 
and good manners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always seek the truth, and dress like proper ladies and gentlemen," says 
their mentor, who is rarely seen outdoors without his trademark dark-green 
fedora. A sign over the blackboard reads: "Our Work Begins and Ends With 
Politeness." 
</P>
<P>
 Be polite, but don't be stupid, his message goes: "Watch out for deadbeats, 
and always get 10% of the estimated fee up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama's 12-month detective course costs the equivalent of nearly $4,000 and 
is so tough that only about half the students finish it. Those graduates he 
chooses for his own agency undergo another year of hard training before 
becoming full-fledged investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical class day, six well-dressed students fanned out in a busy train 
station. Their "mark" was a man in a gray suit, nondescript tie and polished 
shoes, barely distinguishable from hundreds of other commuting "salarymen." 
</P>
<P>
 Only half of the apprentices managed to stay on the quarry's tail. The other 
three lost him and searched the crowds in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama carries his crusade for quality beyond the classroom, campaigning for 
higher standards in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has about 600 legal detective agencies that employ several thousand 
operatives, but Kodama said an equal number probably work without registering. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the illegals, he said, the profession is a front for scams. For 
example, a detective asked by a manufacturer to check out a potential 
subcontractor might offer the subcontractor a favorable report for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Such frank talk about his trade's underbelly does not endear Kodama to 
colleagues. "I'm not too popular," was how he put it. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire profession, Kodama's agency included, makes most of its money 
investigating potential marriage partners, a practice often criticized as 
perpetuating discrimination in Japanese society. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese routinely order such background checks, and often reject potential 
partners found to have "undesirable" traits -- Korean ancestry, perhaps, or a 
family history of disease. Kodama defends the practice, calling it a safeguard 
against later trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people pretend to be rich when they're really poor, trying to marry 
up," or have hidden vices, he said. Kodama cited the case of an apparently 
respectable young man who, it developed, was given to fondling women on 
commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking on a spouse, lover or intended usually costs about $3,000 and the 
firm's policy is to tell the client all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's an affair, a secret bank account, whatever, never sweeten up a 
report, even if it dooms a marriage," Kodama said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all investigations produce bad news. A husband hired Kodama because his 
wife was disappearing in the daytime. "Turns out she was boxing at a nearby 
gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama got his start after World War II, finding troublesome former Imperial 
Army soldiers for his first client, the U.S. occupation forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of them hadn't relinquished their fighting spirit, if you know what I 
mean," Kodama said. "I could track these guys down." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, he said, but "I could find the best price a bag of sugar would 
fetch on the black market." 
</P>
<P>
 However old-school he is about manners, Kodama is familiar with wiretap 
detectors, car-tracking devices and all the other modern wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 But gadgets, he said, won't replace one essential trait: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing a detective can do is simply be observant."

TEXAS DEATH ROW GAINS 5 TEENS GUILTY OF BRUTAL MURDERS; CRIME: TWO GIRLS WHO 
TOOK A SHORTCUT ACROSS A FIELD TO GET HOME BEFORE CURFEW BECAME VICTIMS OF 
YOUNG TOUGHS WHO HAD GATHERED FOR A NIGHT OF BOOZING AND BRAWLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What was intended to be a night of rough-and-tumble boozing and brawling, a 
routine gang initiation in a field beside a Texas bayou, took a ghastly twist 
when two teen-age girls wandered too near the young toughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were raped, viciously beaten, then strangled with shoe laces and a belt. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, just 15 months after the crime, three of the youths were 
convicted of capital murder, joining two fellow gang members -- none yet 20 
years old -- on the path to Texas' crowded Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 All five await death by lethal injection, punishment meted out by a citizenry 
"fed up with the expense of crime, the fear of crime, the devastation of crime, 
and just the senseless nature of it," said Billy Bramlett, a juvenile 
delinquency expert and professor at Sam Houston State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections experts say they can't recall a similar case where so many people 
have been condemned to death for a single crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Anthony Cantu and Derrick Sean O'Brien, both 19, were convicted earlier 
this year. Last month, in separate trials, jurors convicted Efrain Perez, 18, 
Raul Villarreal, 18, and Joe Medillin, 19, increasing the number of inmates in 
the nation's most populous Death Row to almost 400. 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth member of their loose-knit "Black and White" gang, a juvenile 
ineligible for the death penalty under Texas law, was convicted and sentenced 
to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of June 24, 1993, gang members gathered along a railroad 
trestle over a bayou to drink and initiate Villarreal by making him fight each 
of the other gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11:30 p.m., shortly after the fighting stopped, Jennifer Ertman, 14, and 
Elizabeth Pena, 16, took a shortcut through the field, trying to get home from 
a party by their curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 Their path took them past the gang, who grabbed the girls and took turns 
raping them before beating them, strangling them and stomping on their necks. 
The girls' battered bodies were found four days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's no question the jury was upset about the conduct," said 
Harris County District Attorney John Holmes. "I think everybody who knew 
anything about what happened out there was outraged by it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We know how to deal with those people," Holmes said. "I think you've just 
seen an example of that." 
</P>
<P>
 When one youth was arrested, he snarled obscenities at camera crews and tried 
to kick reporters as police hauled him away. Testimony at the trials showed the 
youths divided $40 and some jewelry taken from the girls, then bragged about 
what they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are more or less oblivious," said Robert Lineberry, an urban 
crime historian at the University of Houston. "From their point of view, life 
is of little value. Our logic toward the criminal justice system is people are 
rational, but I think you're dealing with a crowd of people who are not 
rational by the standards of the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those five young men were simply looking for an identity and proving their 
manhood and that's all it takes," Bramlett said. "Violence is a very powerful 
and effective way to get attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The ages of new Death Row inmates in Texas are getting younger and younger, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my feeling, from what I see coming in here," said David Nunnelee, a 
spokesman for the state Department of Criminal Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 393 inmates on Death Row in late September, 12 committed murder at age 
17, 21 at age 18, and 30 at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all felonies nationwide, statistics show the most common age of arrest 
is 16, Lineberry said. The second most common: 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The composition of crime is changing," he said. "You've got 11-year-old kids 
or 14-year-old kids committing crime sprees that we would in hitherto (have) 
thought were only done by sort of deranged adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, teen-agers tended to at worst knock off the 7-Eleven store. 
These days, teen-agers knock off the store and murder the manager at the same 
time. That was almost unheard of 20 or 30 or 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Texas Death Row inmates have even remarked on their new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here I knew almost everyone," murderer Robert Drew said in an 
interview in August, a week before his execution. "Now there's so many people. 
And they're so young and cocky." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew was 24 when he was sentenced to die; he spent nearly a dozen years on 
Death Row before his punishment was carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely the five teen-agers convicted of the Ertman-Pena murders will face 
a similar stretch in Death Row cells as their cases are appealed. The average 
condemned inmate from Harris County has spent more than 10 years in prison 
before facing the executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists say that's part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidence in criminology is there are deterrent effects in swiftness of 
punishment but not severity of punishment," Lineberry said. "If you're not 
relatively expeditious in carrying out punishment, it doesn't have much 
practical deterrent value."

LINCOLN HAD NAGGING REASON TO SUCCEED; HISTORY: AUTHOR SAYS MARY TODD LINCOLN 
MADE THEIR HOME LIFE SO MISERABLE THAT THE FUTURE 16TH PRESIDENT BUSIED HIMSELF 
WITH POLITICS JUST TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His life with a nagging, potato- throwing wife may have helped propel Abraham 
Lincoln to the White House, according to a new psychobiography of the 16th 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Todd Lincoln's behavior has been well documented, but Michael Burlingame 
says he was surprised by the extent of the abuse he found in researching "The 
Inner World of Abraham Lincoln," published by the University of Illinois Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (the Lincolns) had problems in their domestic life was no state secret," 
said Burlingame, a history professor at Connecticut College in New London, 
Conn. "But I had no idea of the depths of woe he had to endure." 
</P>
<P>
 With a more amiable wife, Lincoln might have been satisfied as a country 
lawyer, but Mary made their home so unhappy that Lincoln busied himself with 
politics just to get out of the house, Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlingame spent a decade delving into old newspaper and magazine accounts, 
manuscripts and the research of previous biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Mary smacked Lincoln in the face with a piece of wood after he failed to 
build a fire quickly enough to please her, Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day, he came to work with a plaster covering his injured nose," the 
historian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other accounts have her throwing coffee in Lincoln's face, striking him with a 
broomstick, driving him from the house, and pelting him with books and 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's temper tantrums were the talk of the neighborhood, and she also aimed 
her tirades at tradespeople and servants. She physically abused her own sons as 
well, Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln often slept on a couch in his office, and sometimes stayed with 
friends across town in Springfield. As a circuit-riding lawyer, Lincoln seemed 
to do everything he could to stay away from home. He was one of the few lawyers 
to cover every county in the circuit, and kept riding by horseback even after 
the advent of the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln hinted at his attitude toward marriage in 1864, when he pardoned a 
young soldier who had been sentenced to death for deserting in order to marry 
his sweetheart, Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he signed the papers, the President said: "I want to punish the young man. 
Probably in less than a year, he will wish I had withheld the pardon."

FAEROE ISLANDS' BOOM TIMES WASH AWAY; EUROPE: ARCHIPELAGO IN THE NORTH SEA 
PROSPERED WITH ITS RICH FISHING GROUNDS. BUT A COLLAPSE HAS LEFT RESIDENTS 
SADDLED WITH DEBT, SOCIAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the fog that often envelops their weathered landscape, an economic and 
social crisis has crept over the islands that once seemed like an oasis amid 
the ills of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 An economic boom in the early 1980s has yielded to recession in the 
semi-independent Danish territory, a North Sea archipelago of striking fjords 
250 miles north of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are no longer plentiful. Drug and crime problems are growing. Money is 
tight, and young people are emigrating. The good times are over in the Faeroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived on borrowed money without thinking of what tomorrow would bring," 
Premier Marita Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich fishing grounds in the North Atlantic helped bring prosperity to the 
41,000 Faeroese, who are outnumbered by the 70,000 sheep and millions of birds 
on their 18 islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The territorial legislature won huge subsidies from Denmark, using much of the 
money to build roads, tunnels and bridges along the fjords to link the 
shorelines to hamlets on the sheer cliffs above. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowed money bought fishing boats and new houses. Satellite dishes sprouted 
from the grass-covered roofs of wooden cottages painted yellow, green or blue. 
New Japanese cars became commonplace, stores were well supplied and video shops 
offered the latest American hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the mid-1980s, the stocks of fish began shrinking just as world 
prices went into decline. By the early 1990s, the island economy was near 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell on credit any longer. No one does," said Jon Heinesen, a 
household appliances dealer in Torshavn, capital of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic problems have dramatically altered the attitudes of Faeroese. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, they would not go along with Denmark in joining what has 
since become the European Union, citing the strict fishing quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the July election, most voters chose the Unionist Party, which 
advocated EU membership as the only way out of the economic hole. The Social 
Democrats dropped from 10 seats to five in the 32-member legislature and the 
Unionists gained two seats for a total of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Faeroes would join the EU under the wing of Denmark, which has handled 
their foreign policy, defense, justice and currency since 1948 and provides 
subsidies of more than $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjarni Olsen of the islands' Economic Council blamed the economic troubles on 
a decade of "unprofitable investments in both the private and the public 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Premier Petersen, a Social Democrat serving as caretaker until a new 
government is formed, put it more bluntly: "We're all responsible. All the 
political parties backed these expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses connected with fishing, which accounts for 97% of exports, 
have gone broke in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the island government asked Denmark to lend a hand in helping 
struggling businesses. The Danish Parliament voted an extra $462 million, but 
it did not solve the problems. Last year, the Faeroes' foreign debt reached 
$1.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment has grown to 17% and an estimated 5,000 people in their 20s and 
30s, more than 12% of the population, have emigrated to Denmark, the government 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say reported cases of theft and drug smuggling have increased by about 
20%. Mogens Neper-Kristensen, chief of the island police, said the increase in 
crime is "probably linked to the slump." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Faeroese take heart in the recent discovery of oil south of the islands, 
but Petersen cautioned: "Let's be prudent about making big dreams."

HIV-POSITIVE CANDIDATE THINKS POSITIVE; MASSACHUSETTS: DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR 
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, A HEMOPHILIAC, CONTRACTED VIRUS THROUGH A CONTAMINATED 
TRANSFUSION, BUT HAS NOT DEVELOPED AIDS. HIS GOAL IS TO LIVE LIFE TO THE 
FULLEST. 
</P>

<P>
 As a child, bleeding in his joints caused by hemophilia tortured his limbs. As 
a young man, a contaminated transfusion left him with the virus that causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bob Massie is the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, perhaps 
the first HIV-positive candidate for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very aware that you only have a certain time on this Earth and some 
people have more and some have less," he said, "and the goal is to live life to 
the fullest within that span. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's do the stuff that's important to do in the time that we have," he said 
of his first bid for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Massie, running with gubernatorial candidate Mark Roosevelt in what is clearly 
a long-shot candidacy, said he wants to help boost small business and work on 
heath care reform. But he emphasizes that he hasn't made his HIV status the 
centerpiece of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a qualification for government. It's part of who I am," he said. "It 
says something about my determination and about my candor." 
</P>
<P>
 Massie, diagnosed with HIV in 1984, said he hasn't developed any illnesses 
associated with HIV or AIDS. His opponents have not made his health an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Massie and Roosevelt face popular incumbent Republicans, Gov. William Weld and 
Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci, in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Massie is believed to be the first HIV-positive candidate to run for statewide 
office, according to Kathleen DeBold, deputy director of the Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's often a shame and silence that surrounds HIV and there's really no 
reason for that," she said. Massie's candidacy "sends a message that the lives 
of people with HIV are full and active." 
</P>
<P>
 His hemophilia -- a hereditary blood-clotting disorder -- was a spark for his 
father, Robert K. Massie, to write "Nicholas and Alexandra," a best-selling 
novel about the last Russian czar through the eyes of the czar's son, Alexis, a 
hemophiliac. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massie family's ties to the literary world have turned into contributions 
from writers Erica Jong, Peter Maas and David McCullough, and from singer 
Barbra Streisand. Peter, Paul and Mary gave him a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Massie, 38, says he is prepared for the job of lieutenant governor. He's 
helped the poor and sick as an Episcopal minister, fathered two children, 
written a book about his life called "Journey," and picked up three Ivy League 
degrees, including a business degree from Harvard and a divinity degree from 
Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 And growing up with hemophilia also taught him a few lessons. He said he was 
often bedridden with internal bleeding and excruciating joint pain and 
continues to have painful arthritis in his knees and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to for me to dismiss the suffering of others, to just go by 
it, because I know what it's like," he said.

AMISH ON THE MOVE FOR NEW HOMES; RELIGION: REASONS INCLUDE URBANIZATION, RISING 
LAND PRICES, LARGE FAMILIES AND INTERNAL DISPUTES WITHIN CONGREGATIONS. 
</P>

 Melvin Miller moved from Union Grove, N.C., to the rolling hills of southern 
Illinois nearly three years ago, carving out a life where his Amish creed of 
self-sufficiency and simplicity could prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Miller arrived with his wife and daughter, eight other Amish families 
have joined them from Wisconsin, Kentucky and North Carolina, and more are 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the growth of Miller's community in northwestern Jackson County 
reflects a trend: America's Amish have spread rapidly over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always looking for new farmlands," said Donald Kraybill, an 
Elizabethtown (Pa.) College sociology professor and author of "The Riddle of 
Amish Culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "The drama is in the migration, in the shifting to other areas," Kraybill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1972 and 1992, the number of Amish settlements increased from 83 to 
227, spread among 22 states and Ontario, Canada, Kraybill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics on the number of Amish are hard to get: The U.S. Census Bureau says 
it hasn't compiled numbers since the 1950s. But Kraybill estimated there are 
about 100,000 to 140,000 Amish adults and children today, about twice as many 
as in 1970. Half of them are under 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraybill said the reasons behind the migration include urbanization, rising 
land prices, large families and internal disputes within congregations, which 
are largely autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 59, who makes a living selling homemade jams and furniture parts, said 
he heard about Ava and its 800 inhabitants from friends who were contacted by 
real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's community, spread over a 10-square-mile area around Ava and Campbell 
Hill, shuns non-religious entertainment, television and radio. Education is 
limited to the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their more traditional counterparts, the Ava settlement uses 
electricity, in-home telephones and tractors, although a drive into town still 
requires a horse and buggy. Members cannot drive cars but may ride in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we need to exercise our minds with the things that will not corrupt 
them so much," Miller said. "We don't profess that the way we live is what 
saves us, but the way we live is a way to protect us from the things that are 
more apt to lead people astray." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish are conspicuous by their clothing: wide-brimmed hats and pocketless 
shirts for men, who wear beards without mustaches; long, subdued dresses and 
bonnets for the women. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the Amish live in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana, but their 
communities can be found in many states, including Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the states recording the biggest increase in Amish settlements is 
Michigan, which went from five settlements in 1972 to 23 in 1992, Kraybill 
said. Amish settlements in New York increased from one to 15 in the same 
period, while Kentucky's Amish communities went from one to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlements vary in size, with some as small as five or six families. The 
largest settlement is in Holmes County, Ohio, with about 23,000 Amish, Kraybill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish, descendants of the Swiss Anabaptists of 16th-Century Europe, are 
primarily farmers noted for their frugality, although rising land prices and 
development have forced some to open shops, sell crafts or form building and 
carpentry teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Huston, who arrived at Ava from Wisconsin about a year ago, said his 
goals are simple: "My foremost interest is to serve God -- and woodworking." 
</P>
<P>
 Some settlements have become tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some theories that the Amish have become stronger because of the 
increased attention from the outside," said Brad Igou, a Lancaster County, Pa., 
tour employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ava residents seem to be accepting their new, quiet neighbors, who school 
their own children but still pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're a real benefit to the community," said James McCormick, who 
sells livestock feed to the Amish farmers. "Of course, there's some skepticism 
around the area, but you're going to have that whenever somebody new moves in."

MAN'S VIOLENT HOSPITAL DEATH TORMENTS FAMILY; NEW YORK: NO SUSPECTS, NO MOTIVE 
AND NO WITNESSES HAVE EMERGED IN STRANGULATION OF RETIRED POSTAL WORKER.

<P>
 When the truth becomes too much, which is often, Marilyn Reid simply refers to 
Aug. 15 as the day her father "passed away." 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't been particularly surprised that day when a doctor she'd never met 
pulled her aside and told her he had bad news about her father. After all, 
Victor Skelton was 83 and had already spent more than 40 days in a hospital 
with a kidney ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was old. I knew he had been sick," said Reid, an assistant 
principal. "I was prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 But she could not prepare for what the doctor had to say: Hours earlier, the 
retired postal worker had been found murdered in his hospital bed. A fabric arm 
restraint had been twisted around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The homicide was the first in a New York hospital since 1987, when a nurse 
dubbed "The Angel of Death" was arrested for poisoning patients in one Long 
Island hospital. He was later convicted in four killings. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects and no solutions have arisen in this case. Several weeks after 
Skelton's murder, detectives are stumped, hospital officials reticent, the 
victim's relatives anguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not to be believed," a tearful Reid said in her first interview since 
immediately after the events. "What's the reason? Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 The crime scene -- Room 818 -- is in the former Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn. 
Built in 1927, it once was considered one of the city's best. Albert Einstein 
was a patient. Barbra Streisand was born there. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the hospital, which merged with another in 1983 to form Interfaith 
Medical Center, is suffering. The building, trimmed with razor wire in spots, 
is surrounded by gutted brownstones. In recent years it has weathered a nurses' 
strike, mounting debt and heavy state fines for inadequate medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to go in there a lot," acknowledged Wayne Osten, a state official 
overseeing a Department of Health investigation of Skelton's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Skelton spent his twilight years not far from Interfaith, in a 
brownstone where he reared two daughters. After his wife died in 1981, he 
passed the time watching his two grandsons grow up, and walking back and forth 
to a senior center, the barber shop and church. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 3, Skelton's new doctor told his family his kidneys were failing. A 
bed was available at Interfaith. As she checked her father in, Reid found the 
place "very depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her list of complaints grew with each visit: Her father's room was small, 
dingy and had no call button; a day passed before anyone cleaned up blood 
splattered around the bathroom by his roommate; doctors moved him into the 
intensive care unit without notifying the family; a nurse once yelled at him 
for defecating in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last episode, Skelton called his daughter in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand my father," Reid said. "He was so soft-spoken, a 
spiritual person. He never complained about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid considered moving Skelton to another hospital, but doctors gave her hope 
he would soon begin dialysis as an outpatient. She hired a private nurse's aide 
to watch him during the day when she wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole time he just kept saying, 'I'm going home,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, it looked like he would. After a brief stay in intensive care, he 
moved into a private room and began feeling better. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid saw enough improvement that she and her husband, Maurice, felt free to 
take a weekend and move their son to Howard University for his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take care of my dad," she told the aide that Friday. She never saw him alive 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday, before the aide arrived, a nurse prepared Skelton for dialysis, 
leaving him propped up in bed with the television on, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly an hour later, an orderly entered Room 818 and discovered the arm 
restraint knotted tightly around Skelton's neck. Attempts to revive him failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reids did not learn about the death until they returned to New York and 
arrived at Interfaith. They were stopped on their way to Room 818 by a nurse 
who summoned a doctor unknown to the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor would tell them only that Skelton was dead, possibly the result of 
suicide, and that police were investigating, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They clearly were not prepared for us at all," said Maurice Reid. "Their 
first reaction was not about him, it was about covering themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives told the Reids the obvious: It was physically impossible for 
Skelton to strangle himself because he would have blacked out first and 
released his grip. The medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Interfaith is reviewing Skelton's medical care and hospital security. Police 
already have indicated security was marginal at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Their investigation determined that the restraint had come from the 
eighth-floor room of a female patient, said one investigator, Lt. Peter 
Tartaglia. The woman, in the hospital for alcoholism treatment and sometimes 
violent, was briefly considered a suspect until detectives determined she was 
restrained at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have collected forensic evidence and conducted dozens of interviews 
with nurses, orderlies, other patients and regular visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The results so far: 
</P>
<P>
 No witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspect.

MR. COOPER MAY GO TO WASHINGTON; OKLAHOMA: FORMER SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, 71,

SURPRISED EVEN HIS FRIENDS. 'WE THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY' WHEN HE FILED TO RUN, ONE 
SAID.

 Virgil Cooper's retirement was simple. He started each day with two pieces of 
toast and a cup of coffee, walked five miles, delivered meals to the elderly 
and hauled clothes to the Goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 And he always found time for the boys at Jo's Drive-In, a Main Street diner in 
the heart of Oklahoma's oil patch, where the talk started with football but 
almost always settled on politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's dissatisfaction with government became personal. Three months ago, 
the 71-year-old former school principal stunned his coffee klatch by laying 
down $750 and filing as a Democratic candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he was crazy," said Howard Huff, an 81-year-old retired pharmacist 
in Drumright and one of the regulars at Jo's. "We thought he was just going to 
look into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper did more than that. In one of the biggest upsets in Oklahoma political 
history, he defeated eight-term U.S. Rep. Mike Synar in the Sept. 20 runoff to 
win the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces Tom Coburn, a Muskogee doctor, in the Nov. 8 general election. 
Democrats have held the 2nd District seat since 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 While many congressmen are over 55, the American Assn. of Retired Persons is 
unaware of any first-time congressional candidates in their 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows you can't stereotype people by age," said AARP spokesman Peter 
Ashkenas. "This demonstrates that whatever older Americans want to do, they can 
still do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The upset rattled incumbents across the land, prompting White House 
spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers to remark that "this is a tough environment for 
incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, a World War II veteran, avid reader and community volunteer, was not 
as surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're surprised to win, you probably shouldn't be running in the first 
place," he said, showing a glimpse of his homespun philosophy that is fast 
making him a folk hero in Oklahoma's rural northeastern district. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at East Central University in Ada and the University of Tulsa, Cooper 
taught social studies and math for 34 years, the last 29 in Drumright, where he 
also coached basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been to Washington once, a few years back on a sightseeing trip with his 
wife, Ann, and he visited the offices of his Democratic representatives, Sen. 
David Boren and Synar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike pointed into the office and said, 'Mr. Cooper, this is your office.' I 
decided to take him up on the offer," Cooper said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The upset was largely the result of an anti-Synar climate brought on by a 
constituency that felt Synar had lost touch and was too liberal. In fact, 
Cooper introduced himself by saying, "I'm running against Mike Synar." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps anyone could have run against Synar and won, but only two other 
Democrats filed -- Cooper and Bill Vardeman, a 71-year-old rancher from Ft. 
Gibson who missed getting into the runoff by 1% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess a lot of younger guys didn't want to get their heads beat off," 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 His candidacy led to a fascinating campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, with no political experience, tucked business cards under the windows 
of parked cars and drove an old pickup truck with a campaign sign on the back. 
Questioned about the validity of his campaign, state Democratic leaders often 
replied, "Virgil who?" 
</P>
<P>
 Synar ran television and radio ads claiming Cooper wanted to cut Social 
Security and Medicare benefits. Cooper, who draws Social Security, waited 
nearly two weeks to deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw Synar a few days before the runoff, Cooper told him, "You just 
keep lying about me and I'll keep telling the truth about you, and we'll see 
who gets elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper won with 51% of the vote, even carrying Muskogee County, Synar's 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper admits his lack of campaign experience led to "political blunders," but 
they are harmless, engaging blunders at that. 
</P>
<P>
 He said at a news conference that his political idol was Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
When reminded that Eisenhower was a Republican, Cooper replied, "In World War 
II, if you said anything bad about Ike, you were through." 
</P>
<P>
 He promised he would not take any out-of-state campaign contributions, but 
sheepishly admitted he had gone back on his word. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife's brother in Texas asked if he could send money, so I accepted his 
$50," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Mr. Cooper ready to go to Washington? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'd go to Washington, but Drumright would still be my home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign trail is taking him away from his other chores, such as serving 
on the pulpit committee at the First Baptist Church, which is looking for a new 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't been able to mow his lawn because of the number of national media 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cooper has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had still been working, I probably would not have run because I'd have 
been busy with other things," Cooper said. "A lot of people out there have a 
lot more zip and zing than I've got. I wasn't trying to be a role model for any 
old folks. I just thought there were a lot of things we ought to stand up for."

SUMMER CAMP BRIDGES THE GENERATIONS; LIFESTYLE: ILLINOIS VENTURE PAIRS 
GRANDPARENTS WITH GRANDCHILDREN FOR A WEEK OF HIKING, SWIMMING, EXPLORING AND 
GETTING BETTER ACQUAINTED.

 For one precious week, Margaret Amberg hiked, swam and explored the forests of 
southern Illinois with her 11-year-old granddaughter, Katie. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no worried parents, no rigid schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important time in her life growing up," Amberg, who lives in 
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said recently as she watched the girl scamper away on 
a rickety wooden bridge. "She's been a little girl, and it's not going to last 
much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to seeing my parents all the time and not my grandma, so I like to 
spend more time with her," said Katie Amberg, who lives in Anaconda, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ambergs were among 54 older people and their grandchildren at a camp 
organized by Elderhostel to bring the two age groups together. The Boston-based 
Elderhostel sponsors activities for older people around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bringing families closer together, organizers hope that the program 
inspired an appreciation of nature. Some, like young Daniel Ziluca, who lives 
in a New York City suburb, hadn't spent much time in the woods before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, there's not much of this in New York," Ziluca said while admiring Heron 
Pond's towering cypress trees and moss-covered swamp with his grandmother, 
Samantha Monheit, who lives in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the two had spent much time together without other 
family members around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a neutral zone, a zone to share and experience and have fun without 
any other pressures," said Curtis Carter of Southern Illinois University's 
Touch of Nature environmental center, where the group stayed and played. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the children live far from their grandparents, but that hasn't made 
the experience less meaningful. Chris Fletcher, 11, of Waukegan came with his 
grandmother from Rockford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see each other more often than most grandparents and grandchildren do, but 
you know we've never really had any quality time, when it's just the two of 
us," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the families got accustomed to the sights and sounds of the outdoors, 
they slept in a lodge. Later in the week, they had the option of camping under 
the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Smith of Burlington, Wis., said early in the camp that the short time 
she'd spent with her 10-year-old grandson so far had made a big impact. The boy 
lives only about five miles from her home, and they see each other about once a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more at ease with me. We're just having a good time, a closer feeling, 
which is what I wanted," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Gene Lyons, a Cornell, Ill., farmer, it was hard to tell who was 
having a better time: Lyons or his two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have fun watching Granddad and Grandma teach the kids how to 
canoe," he said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp costs $290 per adult and $225 per child between the ages of 9 and 13.

CUBA'S SAN JUAN HILL BEARS FEW U.S. TRACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RICE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Posters of Che Guevara are tacked on the shacks of workers at the entry to San 
Juan Hill. Spare roofing tiles lean against the old stone pillar at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the grassy hilltop, two Cubans take their lunch break in the shade of 
rustling trees, near silent monuments to American, Cuban and Spanish soldiers 
killed in the struggle for Cuban independence. 
</P>
<P>
 No site in Cuba is more famous in U.S. history or illustrates more ambivalence 
toward the past. San Juan Hill may be the only place left in Cuba where polite 
references to the United States can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on this hill that Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders fought the 
Spanish in July, 1898, during the brief Spanish-American War. The battle helped 
free Cuba from nearly four centuries of Spanish rule and propel Roosevelt to 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blood of the brave and true Cuban Insurgent and that of the generous and 
noble American Soldier sealed a covenant of Liberty and Fraternity between the 
two nations," reads one of the few remaining plaques that mentions U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades of hostility between the United States and Cuba have left their 
mark. The hotel, now popular with Spanish tourists, was known until last summer 
as the Leningrad -- homage to the sponsor of Fidel Castro's communist regime. 
It is now the San Juan Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining monument to Roosevelt is half a mile away, across a small 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hill itself, references to the Americans have vanished. Identifying 
plaques have been pried off several monuments topped with bronze figures that 
appear to represent U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many references to the United States were removed in the early 1960s as 
hostility between the governments increased. But now, "the idea of how it was 
has returned, and the history of Cuba is the history of Cuba," said Anamaria 
Rodriguez, the hotel's publicity officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A few courteous exhortations in English remain, including: "Show your regard 
for this place, taking good care of the plants and works -- 1928." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly any Americans have visited San Juan Hill since the U.S. government 
banned travel to Cuba in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are now fixing up the site and expanding the hotel for the 
centennial of independence from Spain in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are struggling hard to rescue our patrimony," Rodriguez said. In the soil 
of the hill, she added, "is the blood of the three countries that participated 
in the battles. That is indisputable."

MERCY KILLING, SUICIDE END FATHER'S PLIGHT; DILEMMA: OLDER AMERICANS OFTEN 
WORRY ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Failing eyesight, anemia and a bum knee already made caring for the mentally 
retarded daughter he treasured increasingly difficult for Benny Bielawski. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently doctors at a Pittsburgh hospital told the 72-year-old retired 
steelworker he also had life-threatening colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bielawski checked himself out of the hospital, and a day later he fatally shot 
his 47-year-old daughter, Judy. Then he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The father and daughter were buried together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benny looked after Judy real special," said neighbor Manuel S. Stoupis. "I 
guess he felt like nobody could look after her like he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Bielawski was not alone in his fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Americans often worry about what will happen to their mentally retarded 
children, and the parents are reluctant to seek help, according to Sharon 
Davis, research director of the Assn. for Retarded Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an extreme measure. We've never seen a situation like this in my 12 
years here," said Maria Smith of Pittsburgh, an Allegheny County human services 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many of the up to 5.2 million mentally retarded Americans 
live with elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After his convalescent wife died in 1981, Bielawski was his daughter's sole 
caretaker. Another adult daughter lived across the state in Allentown, Stoupis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoupis and his wife cut the lawn and did minor maintenance for the father and 
daughter. They often brought meals for the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerful and observant, Judy Bielawski was well known in the working-class 
Port Vue neighborhood near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 She enjoyed waving to passers-by from her porch. Stoupis said Judy Bielawski's 
weight and a fear of falling down stairs made it difficult for her to get 
around. But she took pride in doing simple household chores. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bielawski retired, he and his daughter were rarely separated. Her speech 
was often unintelligible to others, but her father was one of the few who 
understood her, the neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week the two went grocery shopping. They ate dinner three nights a week 
at a neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like clockwork with them," Stoupis said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Bielawski drove his daughter to classes in nearby McKeesport. But 
heavy snows last winter kept them home and she never returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, Bielawski's eyesight deteriorated dramatically and pain 
in his knee became worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benny was sort of proud and independent," Stoupis said. "As far as asking for 
help, he didn't like to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bielawski might have been able to avert the crisis that led to the deaths, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 County health workers could have helped Bielawski contact other elderly 
parents for emotional support. The county also might have sent counselors and 
health workers to Bielawski's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bielawski also might have been able to place his daughter temporarily in a 
foster home or in a group home with other retarded adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith said spaces in group homes are limited. More than 63,000 mentally 
disabled adults are waiting for placement nationwide. Six hundred alone are 
waiting in Allegheny County, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoupis and his wife said they did what they could to help the Bielawskis. But 
they were frustrated that it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more to being a good neighbor than saying hello," he said.

KITTY KELLEY'S BOOKS ON FIRST LADIES STRIKE OUT; SMITHSONIAN: MUSEUM DISPLAY 
WAS REMOVED BECAUSE IT GAVE THE AUTHOR "MORE NOTICE THAN SHE DESERVES." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SKORNECK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The inclusion of Kitty Kelley's irreverent books on two former First Ladies -- 
"Jackie, Oh!" and "Nancy Reagan" -- was a remarkable innovation in the 
Smithsonian's renovated First Ladies exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 But they disappeared within months. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Kennedy, then-director of the National Museum of American History, said 
in July, 1992, that he wanted the display removed because it gave Kelley "more 
notice than she deserves" and "the net effect of the presence of those books is 
to sell them, and that offends me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Bush reveals in her new book, "Barbara Bush: A Memoir," that she 
used her influence as First Lady to get rid of the Kelley books. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw them during a private tour of the renovated exhibit before it opened 
in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There, prominently displayed, were Kitty Kelley's books about both ladies," 
Barbara Bush wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were ugly books," she added in her letter, "written by someone who did 
not know either woman and both books were largely discredited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow or other I thought the Smithsonian was better than that (and 
mentioned it at a later date to Roger Kennedy, the director of the National 
Museum of American History. He agreed and I hope they are gone.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, now director of the National Park Service, refused to be interviewed 
on the subject, said spokeswoman Joan Anselmo. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in March, 1992, Kelley declared herself "astounded" that the museum 
included her tomes in a section called, "Capitalizing on the First Lady's 
Image," and said she was "delighted and pleased that the Smithsonian does not 
bow to political pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 But asked now how her earlier optimism squares with Mrs. Bush's revelation, 
Kelley roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's surprising that the nation's champion for literacy has gotten into the 
book-bashing business," she said. " 'Bar' must have been pretty agitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Edith Mayo said before the exhibit opened that museum officials were 
"very good about not having any kind of pressure coming in from outside. We 
certainly didn't submit it to anyone for review." 
</P>
<P>
 And she said in a recent interview that she did not know about Mrs. Bush's 
comments to Kennedy until the book came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that Barbara Bush did not read the label," Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The books were "part of a series of objects from the mid-19th Century to the 
present that used the First Family or First Lady's image to make a fast buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Other objects included Kennedy masks, puzzles and games. 
</P>
<P>
 The text near Kelley's books contrasted them to the "relatively benign" late 
19th-Century attempts to use the First Lady's image to sell products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tabloids and books furnishing endless gossip and speculation about First 
Ladies have grown both most intrusive and most sophisticated," it says, adding 
that efforts "to capitalize on the First Lady's image for profit or votes" have 
"dramatically increased." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayo said the public, as well as Mrs. Bush, failed to consider the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were inundated . . . by people who thought somehow we were promoting them 
as authentic biographies or that we were trying to promote Kitty Kelley or her 
work," Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such calls started right after the exhibit opened, Mayo said no 
immediate changes were made to see if the concerns died down. They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 30, 1992, Kennedy made no mention of Mrs. Bush's comments when he told 
Mayo in a memo released by the Smithsonian, "I'd be very grateful if we could 
get Kitty Kelley out of the First Ladies hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the feeling we have given her more notice than she deserves. . . . 
While the intellectual point is very clear (that the First Ladies are subject 
to large amounts of inquiry of one sort or another), the net effect of the 
presence of those books is to sell them, and that offends me. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I would be most grateful if they could get out of there as soon as that 
can be conveniently done," he said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayo said she complied immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kelley contretemps was just one of several misunderstandings to plague the 
exhibit, Mayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials removed a photo of a Gerald Ford Administration children's party 
that showed a black woman dressed as a clown, Mayo said, "because somehow, 
people thought we were making fun of this black woman . . . although she 
happened to be a professional clown." 
</P>
<P>
 Other queries simply floored Mayo, such as those asking whether some U.S. 
Presidents were bigamists because they were shown with different wives -- first 
wives who died and second wives who succeeded them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to wonder what in the world is going through people's minds," 
Mayo said.

RUSTY WATER, SAGGING DOORS, BROKEN GLASS, STENCH: IT'S HOME TO THE ELDERLY; 
PUBLIC HOUSING: THOUSANDS OF THE NATION'S OLDEST, POOREST AND FRAILEST LIVE IN 
UNSIGHTLY OR UNSAFE UNITS.

 Standing in the bathroom of his apartment at an elderly housing project, Joe 
Britto voices a frustration that is becoming common around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have plaster falling down; I have plaster in my house falling down," said 
Britto, pointing to water-soaked plaster on the wall of his apartment in the 
Margaret Collins elderly housing project in the city's Jamaica Plain 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Britto has been waiting fruitlessly for the Boston Housing Authority to repair 
the bubbling plaster in his bathroom and the poorly spackled plaster in his 
bedroom in the BHA-run apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people get older and they work long enough and they work all their lives 
they should be able to sit back and live whatever part of their lives they've 
got in some kind of dignity and respect," said Britto, whose brother also lives 
in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one who's complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of the nation's oldest, poorest and frailest people live in public 
housing under conditions that range from unsightly to unsavory to unsafe 
because of management shortcomings, lack of investment and a history of 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Mayor Thomas Menino recently formed a task force to deal with the 
problem in his city, where 34 senior developments house about 15,000 elderly 
and disabled people. Tenants pay 30% of their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is headed by Mark Maloney, a real estate executive, who says he 
feels the BHA is being upfront about the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was any hiding of issues by the BHA," said Maloney. "They 
would like to see these issues addressed. The red carpet has been rolled out 
for us. Anything I've asked for I've been receiving." 
</P>
<P>
 In Alice Soderberg's bedroom in the 32-year-old Margaret Collins development, 
a small wooden chest conceals badly peeling paint. "Since I've been here I've 
been trying to attend to everything," said Soderberg, 85. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a common complaint at the project where residents say they are forced to 
handle their own repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of problems is daunting. Decaying gutters make a haven for squirrels; 
the front doors leading into the foyer of each building have no locks or 
security buzzers; windows leak when it rains. A stench fills the laundry room 
where just one washer and dryer serves the entire 44-apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 BHA administrator David Cortiella admits that much of the housing is in decay, 
but says the agency is committed to improving it. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't only in Boston. Elderly housing nationwide, much of which 
was built more than 30 years ago, is crumbling, housing experts and elderly 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the housing stock simply needs to be rehabilitated," said David 
Schless, the executive director of the American Seniors Housing Assn. "Fiscal 
constraints have really exacerbated the deterioration of the public housing 
stock for the elderly." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks that elderly housing is in such bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elderly are easier on buildings than families. They're physically in far 
better shape than housing for families," said Gordon Cavanaugh, an attorney in 
Washington for the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. "Most people 
feel that the buildings for the elderly are indeed trouble-free." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cavanaugh does concede that funding for rehabilitation in many cities has 
been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years the federal government didn't fund the reserves for rehabilitation 
and they didn't fund the capital money to improve buildings," Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Green knows the stories first-hand. She is the head of the National 
Tenant Organization, which she runs with several volunteers, based in Ft. 
Pierce, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Through fax, phone and mail, Green has heard tales of peeling paint, lack of 
security and other problems from tenants in numerous cities including New York, 
Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, Detroit and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had better maintenance in public housing, we would not have the 
deterioration that we do have," she said. "It's just a vicious, vicious cycle 
that you have to go through with those kinds of programs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston, the BHA is beginning to use a performance evaluation system to 
measure the quality and quantity of work by its supervisors. A five-year 
capital improvement program that addresses some of the structural problems got 
under way two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also issued a list of guidelines for custodians and maintenance 
personnel; however, residents insist they are not being followed. Frequent 
visits by building managers and architects are little comfort to the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Farmer, 74, is waging his own battles at the Martin Luther King Towers 
in the city's Roxbury neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer, a retired postal worker who is legally blind, spends his days 
attending meetings with elderly and housing advocates. He also communicates 
regularly with the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, which has campaigned 
rigorously to try to improve living conditions in BHA elderly housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get hot water, we don't get heat sometimes. People are intimidated 
because they're old and they figure they'll get evicted if they speak out," 
Farmer said.

POLICE, VOLUNTEERS SEEK 2 YOUNG SISTERS MISSING IN SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of police officers and volunteers combed through South-Central Los 
Angeles on Saturday, searching for two sisters, ages 11 and 12, who have been 
missing since Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 officers and 16 Police Explorers went door to door near the 
sisters' junior high school at 67th and Main streets, determined to find 
Cristina and Elizabeth Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put myself in the position of their mother," said one of the searchers, 
Aleida Gonzalez (no relation to the missing girls), an Explorer with sisters 
who are about the same age as the missing children. "I want to find them for 
their mother." 
</P>
<P>
 The area of the search runs from 67th Street to Manchester Avenue, from the 
Harbor Freeway to San Pedro Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to me because they're girls and they're alone," said Police Explorer 
Trinidad Contreras, as he steadily queried merchants and residents on Florence 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' mother, Maria Gonzalez, dropped them off two blocks from Bethune 
Junior High School at 7:30 a.m. Friday. But they were not there when their 
mother returned to pick them up at 3 p.m. School records indicated that the 
girls did not attend school, although a classmate reported seeing them on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 p.m. Saturday, a friend of the family told police he saw the girls 
board an eastbound MTA bus earlier that afternoon at Slauson and Central 
avenues, Police Lt. Jim Voge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voge said police are proceeding as if the girls were abducted because there is 
no evidence they were unhappy at home or school. "I hope they've run away. I 
hope we're wrong on this thing," Voge said. "We have 12- and 11-year-old 
females. That's always something you (worry) about." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gonzalez said her daughters rarely left the house when not at school. 
"Oh, God, I'm so worried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers have been using the Bethune Junior High School's central 
office as a command post since the sisters were reported missing. An area map, 
lists of the girls' classmates and addresses of registered sex offenders are 
tacked up on walls usually reserved for announcements on gym classes and school 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Both girls are Latino and have brown hair and brown eyes. Cristina, 11, is 5 
feet tall, weighs 115 pounds and has what was described as a "lazy" left eye. 
She was wearing blue jeans with white stripes, a multicolored blouse and black 
tennis shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth, 12, is 4 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was wearing 
a white shirt with "California" written on it, blue sweat pants and blue tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the sisters is urged to call to the Newton 
station at (213) 485-5264. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Patty Fuller said many officers who have children are putting extra 
effort into the search. "I'm a mom," she said, "I would want the same to be 
done for my child."

TIME FOR DEFENSE FIRMS TO WAKE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Hughes' and now Northrop-Grumman's decision to downsize its work 
force ("The Downsizing of Defense: Northrop-Grumman to Slash 8,650 Jobs," Sept. 
23) as well as its business potential: When are the defense industries going to 
realize that their future lies in marketing products to the consumer, not to 
the bloated Pentagon bureaucracy? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan during the 1960s, '70s and '80s got rich, filthy rich, by engineering, 
manufacturing and marketing a better automobile, stereo, television, VCR and 
Walkman, while our best engineering minds (Hughes, Northrop) were developing 
bombs, bombers and weapons delivery systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Get a clue! Diversify! Don't put those brilliant scientific and engineering 
minds in the unemployment line -- put them into R&D for the next generation of 
consumer goods.

LIVING TRUST BEST, ESTATE PLANNER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy M. Kristof's article on estate planning ("Live Well, Die Prepared," 
Sept. 18) was ambitious, comprehensive and an excellent primer for those first 
beginning to consider the issues involved in passing one's property to the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking as an estate planner for the last 24 years, I would like to point out 
a few areas in which her vast canvas may still have provided an incomplete 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although holographic, statutory and do-it-yourself wills can carry out your 
wishes, they all still must go through the probate process and have no effect 
until you die. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's true that joint tenancy and life insurance policies avoid probate, 
they provide no planning opportunities and can result in the property being 
left to unintended heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ms. Kristof points out, the modest estate may "skirt" probate using several 
inexpensive means, making a living trust seem expensive by comparison. I can 
say, however, that probate fees for even a very modest estate are almost always 
double or triple the amount of an attorney's fee for drafting a living trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the most compelling reason to use a living trust is that it provides 
for you, your care and your property if you become disabled. No will, 
beneficiary designation or other means of holding or passing property gives 
this flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 And more and more of us are living longer! For these (and many other) reasons, 
a living trust is the most important part of any well-done estate plan. The 
National Network of Estate Planning Attorneys emphasizes this approach, and so 
do I.

NEWFANGLED SHOES? WOMEN DESERVE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "endless parade of limping patients" making their way painfully to the 
offices of orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists will not end with 
adjustable-heel shoes ("Adjustable Heel Pumps Shoes Sales," Sept. 26). Limping 
patients are primarily women, and they deserve better, particularly those on 
their feet a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes should be designed to fit the human foot. Except for sports shoes and 
clunky, broad-toed shoes, the selection of sensible shoes is slim for women. 
Unfortunately, sensible shoes are not deemed as stylish as the pointed variety. 
</P>
<P>
 I will not purchase the Rose-Lee Beverly Hills Shoes. Manufacturers and 
retailers have not answered my dreams. After many years in pain, then foot 
surgery, I prefer shoes that are comfortable and do not maim my feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Are any shoe designers interested in creating a new -- old, really -- style 
and doing away with the points, even accommodating my A-width, narrow-heeled 
foot?

THE PUC GIVETH AND THE PUC TAKETH AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My recent monthly telephone bill showed two credits allowed by the Public 
Utilities Commission in the total amount of $1.03.While I was consulting a 
financial expert about how to invest this windfall, "The Bottom Line" (Sept. 
16) reported rate increases -- allowed by the same PUC -- of $2.90 and $6.05, 
respectively, per month. 
</P>
<P>
 I am at a loss as to how the PUC can act in this manner. I believe that only a 
second Sigmund Freud could straighten out this ridiculous PUC policy.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: BOLDLY GOING WHERE SHE'S NEVER BEEN -- CYBERSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, at the end of a speech, a woman approached me at the lectern. We 
spoke for a few minutes, then she asked for my card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," she said, sounding disappointed after reading it. "No Internet address?" 
</P>
<P>
 I felt vaguely chagrined. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew what an Internet address was, but hadn't realized until then that I 
needed one or was expected to have one. The idea of replacing letters, which I 
love, with E-mail saddens me. Letters are a source of great, if guilty, 
pleasure. (There is so little time to respond.) On the other hand, an Internet 
address would surely make contact easier for people averse to putting pen to 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, a newspaper as big as this one can seem monolithic, and if electronic 
mailboxes allow for easier communication between readers and writers, who but a 
few hundred of the most curmudgeonly writers or editors would object? 
</P>
<P>
 I put the idea out of my head, but a few weeks ago, it popped up again in a 
different context. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, I was bemoaning a lack of sources for a sodden column I was trying 
to levitate, a piece that was going to live and die by the quality of its 
anecdotes about authority figures who crush the spirits of others. 
</P>
<P>
 (Sometimes, you find a few adequate stories, publish your column, and are 
deluged afterward by people with superb tales of their own. The trick is to 
find the great stories before the column runs.) 
</P>
<P>
 A sympathetic colleague suggested I put out a call on the Internet. Having no 
access at my own terminal, I sought the help of a resourceful Times librarian, 
who took me where I wanted to boldly go: to cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 The information superhighway, it turns out, is a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Print journalists are by nature primitive hunters and gatherers of 
information, not inclined to trust the false warmth of the electronic campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 We live by a lot of self-created myths, many having to do with our abject 
fearlessness at all times. And although the phone is an indispensable 
appendage, we like to think of ourselves as people who knock on doors, who get 
in faces, who bear witness. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not like to think of ourselves as wimps who eschew human contact, even 
if sometimes that is exactly what we are. 
</P>
<P>
 By using the Internet, therefore, I felt I was committing a revolutionary and 
somewhat sneaky act. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't shake the feeling that I was cheating: No desperate phone calls, no 
shoe leather lost, just a cool query to potentially kajillions of invisible 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But desperation does funny things to your standards. 
</P>
<P>
 As deadline loomed without any wonderful -- let alone passable -- anecdotes, I 
couldn't really come up with a single compelling objection to using the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 The unthinkable suddenly became a fabulous avant-garde solution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before I tell you what happened, allow me to register a mild objection to the 
fatigued phrase "information superhighway." It seems dreadfully off the mark. A 
superhighway implies linear movement, getting from Point A to Point B, say, at 
previously inconceivable speed. 
</P>
<P>
 My foray was more like casting a net upon invisible, (hopefully) teeming 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, the "information superfishnet" just doesn't trill. 
</P>
<P>
 My request generated a steady trickle of responses almost immediately, 
although I was warned by the librarian that quoting people off the Internet 
without additional contact was not a good idea, since anybody can write 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So I asked for phone numbers and ended up calling the two people whose stories 
most neatly coincided with the points I was trying to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other responses only went to show that in cyberspace as well as 
everywhere else in life, there will always be people who refuse to follow 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 One man sent word that he had nothing to offer on the topic at hand, but he 
was furious with me for previous columns in which I had reinforced incorrect 
stereotypes (his feeling) about violence in Los Angeles. I believe the 
expression he used was that he felt like "breaking (my) arm" for printing such 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another said he wasn't interested in my needs, but wondered if I might pass on 
his lengthy note of praise to a fellow columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another invited me to watch him discharge pyrotechnics at the Los Angeles 
County Fair, with the proviso that I not reveal the storage location of the 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a tempting proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Another deadline was looming, you see, and I was getting desperate.

GALLERY: CURB APPEAL; TWO COLLEGE PROFESSORS RESTORE FERRARIS FOR SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK C. PATERNIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Peters has a houseful of Ferraris. His daughter, Cindy, grew up sharing a 
bedroom of their home in Orange with bits of Italian mechanical flotsam 
squirreled away by her dad as he waited to find the pieces necessary to 
complete another automotive jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and his partner, Charles Betz, are college professors with a passion 
for what they call the artisan cars -- Ferraris built up to the late '60s, 
before aerospace technology changed the design and manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, they have restored and repaired hundreds of sports cars and now 
own 20 Ferraris, eight of which are drivable. 
</P>
<P>
 The crown jewel of their collection is a 1958 Ferrari Testarossa, the original 
factory prototype of what many consider to be the quintessential Ferrari road 
racer. Betz, who lives in Huntington Beach and teaches at Cerritos College, and 
Peters, who teaches at Fullerton College, restored the car in 1987 after taking 
17 years to accumulate the parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was purchased in 1970 in "disastrous shape," Betz says. They had tried 
to buy another Testarossa in better condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would loan us the money to buy that one, so we had to buy the derelict 
and start collecting pieces and working on it," Betz recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men trace their auto passion to the sports car boom of the '50s, when MGs 
and Jaguars captured the hearts of the postwar generation. The romance is kept 
alive today by such events as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races at Laguna 
Seca Raceway on the Monterey Peninsula. From humble beginnings 20 years ago 
with only a handful of entrants, it has grown into one of the area's major 
races with about 400 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari was the honored marque for last month's races, and Peters was in his 
glory entering the "first Ferrari I bought for myself" -- a 1958 250 GT TDF 
(Tour de France) dual-purpose car suitable for both road and track. 
</P>
<P>
 Prowling the pits like an amiable polar bear with his white beard and hair, 
Peters has to defer the racing duty to his "lifelong pal and blood brother," 
Gordon Wheeler, a Napa Valley doctor. Peters' left knee cannot handle working 
the Ferrari's clutch under race conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Peters conducts a demonstration ride over the Laguna Seca course as it 
rolls up and down the hills near Monterey Bay. Looking along the sinewy fender 
lines, feeling the precise meshing of the transmission gears and listening to 
the engine note rising and falling lyrically, one begins to appreciate the 
allure of the artisan cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's ever been a time when I've taken a Ferrari out and 
driven it more than five minutes that I didn't make some other people happy 
too," Betz says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Betz-Peters Testarossa will be on display at the Petersen Auto Museum in 
Los Angeles through December. PATRICK C. PATERNIE

UP ALL NIGHT: LIKE 'CHEERS,' BUT WITH COOLER PEOPLE

 The Room is exactly what it claims to be. "It's a room," explains owner 
Jeremy. That's what his business card says -- just Jeremy. The place is equally 
spare, four walls with an entrance off an alley. Inside are a long bar, some 
comfortable booths, low lights and a signed photo of Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a huge party every year on Frank Sinatra's birthday, December 12th," 
says Jeremy's partner, Ashley. (The two also own the Burgundy Room.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Jeremy says. "and we invite him every year, but he hasn't come yet." 
</P>
<P>
 If he did, he'd probably enjoy himself. The Room manages to be hip and cozy at 
the same time, an unpretentious gem much beloved by a cast of regular 
characters who see the place as a welcome refuge from the theme-park ambience 
of most Hollywood hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a club," Ashley says. "It's a bar. We both grew up in England, in 
the pub culture, where you all go to the same place every night with your mum 
and your granny. When we got here we were totally alienated by what we found. 
It was so flash.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere else this would be just another bar, but in Hollywood, it's 
different. People from New York walk in here and say, 'Wow, it's just like New 
York.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside the back alley entrance at 11 on a Friday night, Ashley and 
Jeremy are kissed with feeling by a steady stream of arriving regulars. "Why do 
you think we opened a bar?" Jeremy says, grinning, 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday nights, The Room is packed, and the energy is warm and 
raucous. Any other night of the week, it's a quiet, casual place to meet up 
with old friends for a beer or cold martini. "Note the chilled glasses," Jeremy 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Wednesday nights we set up some turntables and people come in with records 
under their arms," Ashley says. 
</P>
<P>
 These same regulars show up with bats and balls every Sunday afternoon at a 
park in the Valley to play softball, and they turn up for twice-yearly 
barbecues. A significant number of these are writers, which makes sense, 
because everybody knows writers make the best barflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Nancy Rommelman is the only female on the softball team. She looks at 
Ashley and Jeremy with familial fondness. "These guys, they inspire affection," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we crave affection," Jeremy corrects her.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know that once Nancy baked us cookies in the shape of a keyhole, 
which is our logo? I couldn't believe it."  
</P>
<P>
 Before she can answer, Steve Schayer, another writer, bounds up and gives 
Jeremy a bear hug, almost lifting him off his feet. "I love this man!" he 
booms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Room?" he says, when asked to describe it. "The Room gives you a sense of 
accomplishment. Going to a bar has a lot to do with simulating relationships 
that you don't have otherwise. The Room does that." 
</P>
<P>
 At which point Schayer grabs pen and paper, sits down in the middle of the 
alley, and copies down a poem from memory that he composed for Ashley and 
Jeremy, called "And No One Comes In."

 We know we already gave you one big scoop about the Carousel of Hope ball on 
Oct. 28 (the one hosted by Barbara and Marvin Davis to benefit the Children's 
Diabetes Foundation), regarding the Duchess of York, Sarah (Fergie) Ferguson, 
making an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another that's just as intriguing: Silent auction item No. 261 is lunch 
with none other than Robert Shapiro.Yes, the snappy-suited, bushy-browed 
attorney on the O.J. Simpson defense team is up for sale.

 The actual listing in the catalogue reads: "Enjoy a luncheon with the 
captivating attorney Robert Shapiro and share in discussions of his exciting 
experiences. Time and date are subject to availability. Minimum bid: $500." 
</P>
<P>
 We figure you'll probably have to wait a few months for those "exciting

 LAPD Blue: The Los Angeles Police Department usually doesn't get points for 
creativity, but this time it's outdone itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For the department's 125th anniversary Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police 
Historical Society is throwing a gala and has invited actors who have portrayed 
cops on TV and film. Expected to show are Angie Dickinson, Earl Holliman, Kent 
McCord, Robert Blake, Gene Barry, Robert Stack and Erik Estrada. There will 
also be a tribute to the late Jack Webb, a.k.a. Sgt. Joe Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fictional cop shows are usually glamorized, hyped-up versions of reality, but 
real law-enforcement officials and the actors who portray them might find they 
actually do have something in common like . . . a love of doughnuts?

KUDOS TO THE DRIVERS OF MTA'S BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am not arguing with Michelle Williams, who has given up riding the bus ("The 
End of the Line," Sept. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 But I came three years ago from Phoenix, where public transportation does not 
exist.I decided to leave my car behind, knowing your congested traffic and your 
daring drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 So I was dependent on the transportation system and for this I will be ever 
grateful. Certainly there are no more caring, helpful, kind people in this city 
or any city than the bus drivers of the MTA. They are patient and helpful, and 
they meet hundreds, perhaps thousands of different people daily. They are 
unsung and unappreciated heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot count the number of stories I have heard on bus rides. You would not 
believe the intimate tales that are told to fellow bus travelers and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will you believe that while waiting for a bus, I met a most unusual woman 
who has turned out to be one of my best friends in this remarkable city.

ACADEMICS MAY NEED LESSONS IN MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A Lesson in Love?" (Sept. 16) presents a dilemma that I believe can be solved 
in a simple, straightforward manner.  
</P>
<P>
 If professors or other faculty members become enamored of students in their 
classes, they can demonstrate the maturity and wisdom that is part of their 
role as teachers and wait to consummate the relationship until the student has 
completed the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Delayed gratification is a sign of maturity, and one hopes faculty members are 
mature enough to wait a few weeks to fulfill their carnal desires, when power 
would no longer be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 For every case of a Will Durant, who married his student, Ariel, and went on 
to a lifelong partnership as scholars and writers, there are hundreds of 
heartbroken young women who were unprepared for the rejection of their mentor 
and tutor.

WESTSIDE WATCH: ESSAY CONTEST KEEPS RAND'S WORK ON MINDS OF STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school students struggling with Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" can thank a 
Marina del Rey institute for helping to keep the 51-year-old, 700-page 
philosophical novel in the public consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, the Ayn Rand Institute has sought to promote the novel and Rand's 
other works through a speakers' bureau and the distribution of videos, readings 
and other material to book clubs and other devotees of the champion of 
individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the institute began its 10th annual high school essay contest. 
About 486,000 flyers for the "Fountainhead" contest and its sister contest on 
Rand's novelette "Anthem" will be mailed to 254,000 educators, including all 
high school English teachers, counselors and librarians in the United States 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the essay contest is to introduce young people to crucial 
issues at a critical time in their lives," said Michael S. Berliner, executive 
director of the Ayn Rand Institute, philosopher and former department chairman 
at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the essay contests is but one indicator of the continuing 
interest in Ayn Rand, who lived in Hollywood and died in 1982 at age 77. "The 
Fountainhead" still sells more than 100,000 copies each year. Rand study groups 
have sprouted up at dozens of colleges across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club 
ranked Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" in second place, behind the Bible, on a list of 
"books that made a difference" in the lives of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place winner gets $5,000. Winners will be announced later this year. 
</P>

 BY THE NUMBERS: Republicans hope a backlash against Democratic leadership 
helps Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks unseat Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 But registration in the 36th Congressional District so far has not changed 
much since 1992, when Harman defeated Republican Joan Milke Flores. As of Sept. 
8, 42.6% of the voters were registered Democrats and 42.4% Republicans. The 
deadline to register is Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also have widened their registration lead in an Assembly district 
where registration was almost evenly split two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd Assembly District, 43.3% of the voters are registered Democrats 
and 40.9% Republicans. There, first-term Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina 
del Rey) faces insurance agent Julian Sirull. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on past trends, political analysts say, Republicans are more likely to 
go to the polls, which means their party still can enjoy an edge in districts 
where they are slightly outnumbered. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 THEY MEET, AT LAST: For politicos, Sunday is the day for their candidates to 
shine -- or say something stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in three races will meet at a League of Women Voters Forum at the 
Torrance Cultural Arts Center. Among the faceoffs: Bowen and Sirull at 1 p.m.; 
State Sen. Ralph Dills (D-El Segundo), who represents Marina del Rey, and David 
Barrett Cohen at 2 p.m., and Brooks and Harman at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates won't be debating one on one. Instead, audience members will be 
able to submit questions to a moderator, who will choose which ones to pose to 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The event's other sponsors are the American Assn. of University Women, 
Torrance Branch, and the Torrance Council of PTAs.

HIGH SOCIETY; HISTORY: LANDMARK HOTEL TOWERS OVER SUNSET STRIP -- AND HOLLYWOOD 
LORE. OWNERS HOPE NEW NAME WILL REVIVE ITS GLORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This Sunset Strip landmark is rich in history and rumor. There were residents 
ranging from Jean Harlow to Tina Turner -- and the tale, a tall one it seems, 
that John Wayne kept a cow on his balcony to ensure he had a fresh supply of 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been name changes. In 1988, the building that had been known 
as Sunset Tower was re-christened the St. James' Club & Hotel. And on Thursday 
its latest owners, the Lancaster Group, announced that their upscale hotel will 
be known as The Argyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 
was named the St. James' Club & Hotel after British financier Peter de Savary 
saved the Art Deco tower from decay and abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest name change, the building has lost its link to what in the 
1980s became its sister institution -- the 135-year-old St. James' gentlemen's 
club in London. This has some local St. James members steamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will bring no more ladies' lunches here," declared Marilyn D. Watson, a 
Century City real estate saleswoman who staged monthly gatherings in the 
building's airy restaurant with its lofty view of the city from a swimming pool 
terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scorched, and so are all the other members," she added, venting her ire 
at a recent cocktail party laid on by the new management in an effort to spread 
hors d'oeuvres on troubled waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, where the wine list tops out with a $450 magnum of 1982 Dom 
Perignon, was a sort of home away from home for its members, a place 
distinguished, Watson said, by "exclusivity, warmth and the staff calling you 
by name." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is proving difficult to reserve a table over the phone, she said. But 
Eileen M. Womer, director of sales for the new management, said there should be 
no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be patrons as much as they like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing, some would argue, is that the new plans pose no threat to 
the building itself. The building is a genuine star of local architecture, 
featured in movies from "Murder My Sweet" (based on a Raymond Chandler novel) 
to Robert Altman's "The Player." 
</P>
<P>
 "On clear days, Mr. Marlowe, you can see the ships in the harbor at San 
Pedro," the bad guy tells Chandler's hard-bitten detective hero in the 1943 
thriller, showing him the view from his elegantly-furnished living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the edifice are devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it and you're drawn to it, and at night, the way it's lit up, it's 
breathtaking," said Barbara Hoff, director of preservation issues for the Los 
Angeles Conservancy, which worked on saving the building from demolition nine 
years ago. "They can change the name, just don't tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Built between 1929 and 1931, the 13-story Sunset Tower was one of the first 
skyscrapers on the Westside, and its cliff-top location made the luxury 
apartment-hotel look even taller than it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Leland A. Bryant, who was also responsible for several other 
stately apartment buildings in West Hollywood, it was adorned with friezes of 
exotic beasts, a Zeppelin and a submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 It was advertised as an ideal home for actors, "Faultless in Appointment -- 
the Ultimate in Privacy," according to a piece in the Screen Actors Guild 
magazine of February, 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Harlow, residents during its early years included Errol Flynn, 
Clark Gable and Zasu Pitts. And in recent years, guests have included not only 
Turner, but Whoopi Goldberg and dozens of British rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stars' photographs adorn the lobby in a collection by George Hurrell (but 
John Wayne's cow is absent). 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as the first all-electric building in Los Angeles, the Sunset Tower 
went downhill in the 1970s, falling victim to failed condo conversion plans and 
eventually standing empty for years.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess, legally. There were probably 20 to 25 lawsuits against it," 
recalls architect David Gray, who mortgaged his house to acquire the hulk. "I 
used to live by there and it was just falling apart and it was just sad, and 
one day I just made up my mind I was going to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 A mutual acquaintance introduced him to de Savary, who was looking for a West 
Coast branch to add to his collection of real estate, which included St. James' 
clubs in Paris and Antigua, as well as the original club in London. 
</P>
<P>
 After unraveling the legal knots, Gray sold de Savary the building but stayed 
on as architect for the $40-million project, adding a parking garage, two 
townhouses and the restaurant space. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designer David Becker commissioned fancy furnishings for the inside, 
including gondola-shaped beds and mini-bars that rose at the push of a button 
from cabinets made of exotic woods. 
</P>
<P>
 But within days of its opening in 1988, de Savary had sold the building and 
two other St. James' Clubs to Norfolk Capital, a British firm whose executives 
were reportedly dazzled by the sight of Liz Taylor's book party for Roddy 
McDowall on the night they arrived to inspect the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although long gone, de Savary is not forgotten, his bearded, balding, 
cigar-wielding visage holds court on a mural in the restaurant. The mural also 
features caricatures of notables from Liza Minelli to Sir Laurence Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
 Norfolk Capital later fell victim to a hostile takeover by Queen's Moat, 
another British firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Although British institutions held occasional events there, it never caught on 
as anything like a London club, said Dennis Storer, executive director of the 
British-American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Leigh, the club's former membership director, said that entertainment 
industry power-brokers were often seen there, but its cachet dropped over time 
-- along with the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the Hollywood jet set for the first year, and then they bowed out real 
quickly," she said. "After awhile the novelty wears off and people move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Tawdry incidents in recent years included the arrest of singer Rick James on 
charges of brutalizing a woman in his hotel room and the embarrassing case of 
an intoxicated movie star who bumped into a bust of John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the West Hollywood property was acquired by the Lancaster 
Group, which operates a handful of small, upscale hotels in Chicago and on the 
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody needs to come in and bring it back to life," said Mary Jo Klein, a 
spokeswoman for the Lancaster Group. "It's a fabulous building."

LEGAL AID CENTER FOR LOW-INCOME CLIENTS CLOSES; SANTA MONICA: WESTSIDE LEGAL 
SERVICES HANDLED 3,200 CASES IN THE PAST YEAR. CITY OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING A 
REPLACEMENT AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year ago, when Claire Stone could no longer tolerate the slum-like 
conditions of her Santa Monica rooming house, she sought help from Westside 
Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the free legal aid program -- the 62-year-old woman could not 
afford to pay attorneys' fees -- Stone sued the landlord and prevailed in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements, however, still were not made. So the battles continued, with 
Stone quickly becoming one of Westside's regular customers. But last week, 
Westside shut its doors. And, for now, Stone and about 3,200 other low-income 
Santa Monica residents are left in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get another agency in Santa Monica; we need it desperately," Stone 
said. "There are a lot of elderly people in Santa Monica, and we're not all 
living on trust funds." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 15 years, Westside ran a one-stop legal center primarily for Santa 
Monica residents, most of them destitute. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency itself ran out of money when the Internal Revenue Service notified 
Westside earlier this year that it owed nearly $100,000 in unpaid payroll 
taxes. The agency closed last week after it was unable to come up with a 
reduced payment of $25,000, said former director Barbara Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency paid taxes quarterly, and for three quarters it came up short, she 
said. The agency is still trying to make the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santa Monica funded roughly $226,000 of Westside Legal Service's 
total budget of $380,000. The agency also received financial aid from the state 
Bar Assn., grants from private foundations and money from fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 3,200 cases it handled in the past year, about 1,000 involved 
domestic violence. Lawyers helped battered women obtain restraining orders and, 
in some cases, represented clients in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also helped Santa Monica residents obtain public benefits, resolve 
immigration problems, fight consumer fraud and defend themselves against 
unlawful evictions and other disputes with landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the city began a search for an agency to replace Westside Legal 
Services. It could take at least three months to find a new service, according 
to the city's Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a dearth of free legal services in Santa Monica. Westside is 
referring clients to two other legal aid organizations -- Bet Tzedek, which has 
its closest office on Fairfax Avenue, and the Legal Aid Foundation of Los 
Angeles, located Downtown. The agencies have indicated that they will submit a 
proposal to provide legal services in Santa Monica on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trip to Bet Tzedek and the Legal Aid Foundation may be too difficult 
for most of Westside's former clients, many of whom do not have cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure people can trek down to the (Legal Aid Foundation) or over to Bet Tzedek 
for now, but it's prohibitive. The longer the distance, the more reluctant 
people are to go there," said Tony Trendacosta, general counsel for the Santa 
Monica Rent Control Board, which referred more than 40 people a week to 
Westside for advice on evictions. 
</P>
<P>
 For clients who need help with domestic violence cases, the outlook is 
somewhat brighter. City officials are working on a contract with Ocean Park 
Community Center in Santa Monica to run Westside's domestic violence program on 
a limited and temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The details are not final, so there may be a gap between Westside's departure 
and Ocean Park's coverage, but Rusk said chances are good that some form of 
legal aid for domestic violence cases will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the legal aid agency that permanently replaces Westside will have 
more funding this year to aid victims of domestic violence. In June, the Santa 
Monica City Council approved $50,000 earmarked for such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition from Westside to a new legal aid provider may not be 
seamless, Greenstein warned. None of the other legal aid programs in the county 
provide much attorney representation in court for victims of domestic violence, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to renters' rights, the differences are even more 
pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Monica offers its clients different defenses than other cities because 
of rent control," she said. "They're not used to it in Los Angeles, although 
it's not impossible for them to get up to speed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Stone, any legal aid program would be better than none, as long as it is 
closer to home. Now that Westside is gone, she must take a bus from Santa 
Monica to Bet Tzedek, where her case has been referred. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling is a problem. She has arthritis and respiratory problems, and she is 
still recovering from stab wounds after an attack in Venice last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But what concerns her most is the fear that her case will not be a priority 
for the attorneys at Bet Tzedek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they're swamped, so taking on my case will be difficult," Stone 
said. "But I really don't have any alternatives right now."

BOOKS; LEAVING HIS MARK WITH FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A book signing can be a sobering experience, says Donald Westlake, master of 
the comic mystery who is on a national book tour promoting his latest, "Baby, 
Would I Lie?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much like drowning. My whole life passes before my eyes. The only 
difference is I have to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
 And sign he has on a trek across the country that brought him to the Los 
Angeles area last month, signing books and doing whatever else it took to 
inspire the interest of potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday morning he was in the North Hollywood studios of 
Pacifica Radio's KPFK (90.7-FM) where he deftly fielded the questions of Pearl 
Skotnes, veteran host of "All About Books." Also on Westlake's local schedule: 
signing books until it hurts at bookstores from West Hollywood to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The book tour, with its interviews and book signings, is a necessary evil, 
says Westlake, who in 1993 was named a Grand Master, the highest honor of the 
Mystery Writers of America. Actually, he says, a book tour isn't nearly as 
ghastly as the other necessary evil in his professional life: taking meetings 
with movie producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake has produced more than 80 titles, if you count those written under at 
least five pseudonyms ("Nobody has ever asked me to write faster," he noted). 
But he is also a successful screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 His script for "The Grifters" was nominated for an Academy Award, and he also 
wrote "The Stepfather" -- screenplays as dark as many of his novels are 
hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake says his mentor in the screen trade was William Goldman, who adapted 
Westlake's comic caper "The Hot Rock" for the 1972 film starring Robert Redford 
as hard-working criminal John Dortmunder. Instead of simply cringing at every 
change Goldman made, Westlake listened and learned as Goldman explained what 
works and what doesn't on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake was in town to move copies of "Baby, Would I Lie?" (Mysterious 
Press). "To go on the road to hawk a book is certainly not as bad as not being 
asked to go on the road to hawk a book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows exactly what impact book signings have on book sales, although 
Westlake says he's heard that signed books move twice as fast as unsigned ones. 
Signings are good for business, especially at specialty bookstores such as 
Mysterious Bookshop in West Los Angeles, said manager Shelly McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur's regulars, many of whom would rather skip Christmas than a favorite 
writer's new novel, line up to exchange a few words with an author and have him 
or her inscribe a pristine copy of the book. "Many times, we're offering the 
one thing people can't get by buying the book at discount," McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake is very accommodating with his admirers. A fan once showed up at a 
signing with two shopping bags full of back issues of Playboy magazine, 
featuring Westlake stories to be signed. Unlike writer John Irving, who now 
only signs books for friends and overseas admirers, Westlake almost always 
obliges. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the fans you deserve," said Westlake. His own followers are a fairly 
sunny lot, he said, although mystery and suspense is a genre with a decidedly 
dark side -- and some fans of other writers reflect that.

 According to McArthur, appearances by writer Clive Barker are the ones most 
likely to bring out the creatures of the night. Barker, who writes horror as 
well as suspense, is always being asked to sign fans' body parts, McArthur 
said. One local admirer even slashed his wrist so Barker could autograph his 
latest book in blood. The fan thoughtfully provided a quill as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing to a different crowd, Westlake's new book is set in Branson, Mo., 
Mecca for some of the nation's most ardent country music fans. A New Yorker to 
the bone, Westlake spent several weeks soaking up local color in Branson, where 
no breakfast is served without grits and gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife refused to accompany him on the last visit, inquiring: "Why can't you 
ever think of a story set in Paris or Rome?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby, Would I Lie?" deals with the murder trial of a country singing star 
(whose discography includes "If It Ain't Fried, It Ain't Food!") and the media 
circus that surrounds him. If all this sounds vaguely familiar, Westlake 
couldn't be happier. He is shamelessly willing to talk to interviewers about 
the sometimes startling parallels between his fiction and the O.J. Simpson 
murder case, including the high jinks of the tabloids. "I've found a phrase for 
what I've been doing," says Westlake, whose book was finished before the 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. "I'm 
surfing the Zeitgeist. " 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake doesn't sell as many books as Dick Francis or Sue Grafton, but he 
isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without doing it on purpose, I think I've found the perfect middle ground," 
he said. "I haven't had an honest job since April, 1959. . . . and I've never 
had the down side of fame."IRFAN KHAN / For The Times

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RESIDENTIAL-STREET TRAFFIC BARRIERS CAUSE 
DRIVERS' TEMPERS TO OVERHEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic congestion -- never far from the thoughts of white-knuckled Westside 
drivers and residents irritated by noise and fumes -- are commanding more than 
the usual amount of attention in Santa Monica these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Sunset Park residents debated the best way to keep shortcut-seeking 
drivers off residential streets, while drivers entering Santa Monica's Mid-City 
area scrambled to find their way around new traffic barriers on the city's 
eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people, mainly angry and confused drivers, have called Santa 
Monica's traffic hot line, (310) 458-8296, since the barriers went up two weeks 
ago, diverting Mid-City traffic from residential streets to thoroughfares such 
as Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it as a personal affront," said Marilyn Noyes, a West Los Angeles 
resident who has been driving down Arizona Avenue to shop in Santa Monica for 
21 years. "I thought they were trying to shut me out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-City plan marks the first time Santa Monica has undertaken a 
neighborhood-wide effort to ease traffic congestion, officials say. Barriers 
now force drivers heading west on Broadway and Arizona to turn at Centinela 
Avenue instead of going straight through the residential neighborhood. Barriers 
also prevent left turns from Centinela into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Doyle, a Santa Monica resident who lives on Centinela, said the barriers 
have resulted in increased traffic on her street, making it hard to turn left 
into her driveway. Her husband had to change his route to work on Wilshire, and 
her son's soccer car pool had to find a new route to get him home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle also said the new traffic patterns make it harder to shop in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 But others like the traffic-diversion measures. Councilman Paul Rosenstein, 
who abstained from voting on the plan because he lives in the neighborhood, 
said drivers will adjust to the traffic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's peace and quiet for the first time in many years" in front of his home 
on Yale Street, he said. "Many people really appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will continue to tinker with the plan to resolve problems and 
evaluate it at the end of a six-month trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers of office buildings at 26th Street and Cloverfield Boulevard funded 
the project to ease the traffic burden caused by the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's next neighborhood-wide traffic plan will focus on Sunset Park, said 
Ron Fuchiwaki, the city's traffic engineer. In eight hours of public hearings 
Tuesday and Wednesday nights, 158 people signed up to speak on proposals to 
reduce traffic around Santa Monica College and from Venice to the Santa Monica 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the issue are separate traffic plans by two dueling neighborhood 
groups, Sunset Park Associated Neighbors and Friends of Sunset Park, and a 
third plan by city staff that attempts to reconcile the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bloom, president of Friends of Sunset Park, said the staff proposal 
doesn't impose tough enough measures to control traffic and that the plan by 
Sunset Park Associated Neighbors benefits part of the neighborhood at the 
expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom said his group's plan "is comprehensive, and it's supported by a 
coalition of neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But that plan would use permanent barriers to restrict traffic when it's not 
necessary, said Eileen Hecht, a member of the executive board of Sunset Park 
Associated Neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members plan to vote on the issue Wednesday.

<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * HOLLYWOOD TUNNELING -- Approved the formation of a task force, headed by the 
structural engineering company Gerald Lehmer Associates, to study whether a 
resumption of tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard for the Metro Red Line 
project will cause further damage to the street. After damage occurred in 
August, the council ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to cease 
all digging. On Sept. 2, MTA officials told the council that corrective 
measures were taken and no further problems were expected. However, the council 
wants the independent task force to confirm that tunneling is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTWOOD CELEBRATION -- Approved the following street closures from 6 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. next weekend for the Westwood Village Celebration '94: Westwood 
Boulevard between Lindbrook Drive and Weyburn Avenue; Westwood Boulevard 
between Weyburn and Le Conte avenues. Additionally, Broxton Avenue between 
Kinross and Weyburn avenues will be closed from 5 a.m. Saturday to 9 p.m. 
Sunday. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * COASTAL BLUFFS -- Approved an ordinance establishing the Coastal Bluffs 
Specific Plan, which is designed to protect and enhance the Playa del 
Rey/Westchester coastal region. The area is roughly bounded on the west by 
Vista del Mar, on the east by Lincoln Boulevard, on the north by Culver 
Boulevard and on the south by an irregular line north of Manchester Boulevard. 
Highlights of the plan include a height limitation of 36 feet for all new 
buildings, except on certain up-slope lots where the front of the building may 
be 45 feet in height; a requirement that side yards be a minimum of 10% of the 
width of the building; a ban on outdoor eating and drinking establishments 
within 75 feet of a residential area, and a ban on outdoor entertainment. 
Passed 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Zev Yaroslavsky.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; MEASURE WOULD CUT TAXES ON OLD HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could safeguard historic structures for affordable housing, the 
Los Angeles City Council has agreed to give owners of older houses and 
apartments a property tax break if they pledge to restore and maintain their 
buildings for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent decision could apply to an estimated 3,600 buildings that have been 
designated by the city as historically or culturally significant. In addition, 
other buildings could receive the tax break if their owners persuade the city 
that the structures are historic. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report says that more than 70% of the older houses and apartments are 
concentrated in a handful of areas: South-Central Los Angeles, Southeast Los 
Angeles, West Adams, Boyle Heights, Wilshire, Silverlake/Echo Park and 
Northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving historic older units is important, city officials say, because 
those properties traditionally have the most affordable rents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action is allowed under a 1976 state law known as the Mills Act, 
which permits cities to cut property taxes on historically significant 
structures by an average of 50% so long as owners agree to upgrade and preserve 
the buildings for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law has been in place for nearly 20 years, city officials say it 
became more attractive after recent changes broadened the definition of 
historic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 It was those changes and a desire to preserve more affordable housing in Los 
Angeles that led Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas to urge his colleagues to take 
advantage of the state law. His motion was seconded by Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who, like Ridley-Thomas, represents a district with many older 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Ridley-Thomas motion, the property tax break would be available to 
historic single-family houses with an assessed value of no more than $500,000 
and multifamily buildings with a valuation of $1.5 million or less. The new 
assessed valuation of properties would be determined under a formula that 
includes a variety of factors, such as a property's mortgage rate and monthly 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely directed at residential buildings, the tax break could apply 
to other structures on the city's list of 596 historic or cultural monuments. 
The tax break also would apply to some 3,050 structures in the city's seven 
historic preservation zones. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for the tax break, property owners would pay a non-refundable $25 
fee. If their application is approved by the city's Cultural Affairs board, 
they would pay an additional one-time fee of $243 for the tax reduction that 
could save thousands of dollars by lowering the property's assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is expected to return to the council for final action by late 
October and, if approved as expected, would become law as early as December.

EARNING THAT BADGE ISN'T EASY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before they hit the streets, reserves hit the books. Level I reserves such as 
Jeff Zacha and Robert Kenneally must go through 409 hours of training at the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Training Academy in Whittier.They learn everything 
from how to handle domestic disturbances to proper handcuffing technique and 
firearms training. The academy training is followed by 200 hours of field 
training and an additional 200 hours of in-service work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has a similar program for its reserve 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing their training, reserve deputies are issued a badge, 
identification card and a service revolver. Then the real work begins. They 
must volunteer a minimum of 20 hours per month -- 16 hours of shift duty plus 
four hours of meetings. While on duty, reserve deputies have the same authority 
as regular deputies. Off duty, they may not carry a concealed weapon without a 
state permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Frank Decker, who trains reserve deputies for the Sheriff's Department, 
says those who make it through the academy are a special breed. "The reserves 
are a great source of pride and a substantial asset," Decker said. "They bring 
in a lot of expertise from their civilian professions." ROBERT WYNNE

FOR SENIORS; WRITER TURNS HER PASSION TOWARD HEALTH INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People thought she was dead. When a friend called to verify, instead of 
responding with a witty quip -- not out of character for this two-time 
Emmy-winning comedy writer -- she got depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Lila Garrett is alive and well and wants everyone else to be that way too. 
That's why she decided to chair the Westside Coalition for Proposition 186 -- 
the Health Security Act. As for the premature news of her demise, it's her old 
life that's gone, not Lila Garrett herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearing that people thought I was dead made me do something which I rarely do 
-- contemplate my life," she says in her trademark powerful delivery. "I'm 
single. I'm not working in the business. And I'm not making enormous waves 
anymore. In other words, according to (the friend's) image of me, I was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 I've known Lila Garrett for almost 15 years. She's as vulnerable as she is 
impenetrable, emotional as she is unsentimental. She's never boring. She can be 
hilariously funny and downright infuriating. She's known as difficult by people 
who love her and imperious by those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a woman is described as difficult it usually means she's too assertive, 
too opinionated, too something or other which is never too anything for a man," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, who declines to give her age but admits to being eligible for 
Medicare, was the first woman to write, produce and direct her own television 
movie. She has received, besides the two Emmys, the Writer's Guild Award and a 
New York International Film Festival Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a pioneer is overrated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hollywood has notoriously been anti-elder, she also has involved 
herself in teaching and politics. She teaches writing at UCLA Extension, but 
politics are the constant in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 She can't be talked out of her opinion about the need for gun control or 
talked into blaming immigrants for the problems of society. Nor can she be 
persuaded that health care is a right, not a privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 But, agree with her or not, when Garrett is involved in a cause things happen. 
In her view, her so-called death started 10 years ago when she lost a few big 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended a meaningful long-term relationship with a man I was living with for 
17 years, which I do not want to discuss, and I lost a battle with the Writer's 
Guild West over the issue of writers getting just compensation from the rental 
and sale of videos," she said. "I felt we were being sold out by a group of 
elite self-serving representatives of the Guild who did not represent the 
writers as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett also lost an election as vice president of the Guild and was 
"brutalized," she says, in a Times article in which she feels she was 
characterized as a "very wealthy woman talking about the rank and file while 
she luxuriated in a Malibu beach house." 
</P>
<P>
 She is unapologetic about living well and feels that "those of us who have 
enough shouldn't be made poorer but we should all fight for everyone else to be 
richer. . . . Besides, it was a rented beach house." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the fight with the Guild, Garrett decided to move out of the 
storm and to carefully consider what battles to fight next. Although she 
remained involved in Democratic Party politics, she said she hasn't felt the 
classic Garrett passion for any issue until Proposition 186, which would 
provide cradle-to-grave health insurance for all Californians by imposing taxes 
and, most likely, folding in existing government financing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question in her mind that securing health care for everyone is a 
cause worth her getting back into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boggles my mind that the United States and South Africa are the only 
countries which do not have some sort of universal government-run health care," 
she said. "It's disgraceful that Congress is not going to pass some health care 
reform this year because it was their obligation to the people of this country 
to do so. They were bought off." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent report by Citizen Action, a consumer research group, 
special interests -- notably health and insurance industries and the American 
Medical Assn. -- spent more than $100 million in less than two years on 
lobbying, advertising and direct contributions to members of Congress to defeat 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 186 -- the Health Security Act -- is California's answer to 
solving a human problem that Congress either doesn't acknowledge or refuses to 
act on. It would replace insurance premiums and deductibles with a payroll tax 
(4.4% to 8.9%, depending on the number of employees), an income tax (2.5% on 
all taxable income after deductions) and a $1-per-pack cigarette tax, and 
everyone who is a legal resident of California would be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 186 passes, senior citizens would be especially affected. It 
provides coverage for long-term care (for both nursing home and at-home care) 
and prescription drugs. The elderly will no longer have to pay the $400 
deductible, the 20% co-payment, the Part B premium or purchase a Medi-Gap 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, every Californian would get care from a doctor of their choice, 
doctors could maintain private practices, hospitals could remain privately 
owned and all health providers would have to compete on the basis of quality, 
not price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 186 makes health insurance, not medicine, a publicly administered 
function," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has experienced the health system close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently, I had chest pains and had to go to an emergency room. I was put on 
a gurney for five hours with all kinds of tubes in me. Beside me was a homeless 
man. We were both treated like numbers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett admits it will be difficult to persuade the voters that under 
Proposition 186 they would never have to pay insurance premiums again and that 
this fact more than compensates for the price of the after-deductions income 
tax, which opponents say would be the largest tax hike in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance companies don't want reform. Never mind that taxpayers save $20 
billion a year and we will have health coverage that can never be taken away 
and the costs will be lower," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lila Garrett is readying herself for the battle of her life, but this time 
she's not fighting alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me seven minutes to convince a taxi driver that Prop. 186 was the 
most important measure he could vote for in November," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside Coalition for Prop. 186 is holding a town meeting Oct. 9 at 1 
p.m., 10390 Wilshire Blvd., third floor. Information: (310) 441-7350. Hot line:

GARBAGE HOUSE; TRASHY HOUSING TAKES ON WHOLE NEW MEANING AS BUILDERS EXPERIMENT 
WITH WAYS TO USE RECYCLED MATERIALS

 The handsome Colonial-style home shown at right features four bedrooms, two 
baths and two powder rooms, along with a two-car garage. It would fit perfectly 
in almost any upscale subdivision where prices run in the high $200,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait till you see what it's made from. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Home Builders, which created the home at its Research 
Center in Bowie, Md., formally calls it the Resource Conservation Research 
House. Less formally, it's known as the "Garbage House." 
</P>
<P>
 Step inside the 3,600-square-foot house, and it's the stuff dream dwellings 
are made of -- a wood-burning fireplace, spiffy track lighting, a Jacuzzi in 
the master bath. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, you're treading on a high-priced scrap heap. You're also walking 
into the future, for the entire place, subflooring to attic, amounts to one 
inspired riff on the theme of recycling and energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 And the future, according to those farsighted folks at the Research Center, is 
just around the corner. As old-growth forests dwindle, the price of lumber is 
skyrocketing. Energy costs will soar. And landfills are going to be maxing out 
all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not fear: Garbage House is here. The frame is steel, most of it recovered 
from junkyard cars and dismantled bridges. An added bonus: Termites are foiled 
forever. The siding might look like ordinary clapboard, but it's really made of 
sawmill wastes and wood chips. And a layer of insulation sandwiched beneath 
that siding contains 20% recycled polystyrene packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the nifty solar collector beside the deck in the back yard. It's 
fitted with a solar panel (heating 80% of the house's hot water) and a 
photovoltaic panel that powers the landscaping lights and the security system 
and provides backup electricity should a power failure occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior holds its surprises too. Overhead ceiling tiles contain recycled 
newsprint. The double-paned windows are state-of-the-art energy efficient. Even 
the heat pump is state of the art, drawing warmth from the earth via copper 
pipes buried under the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find even more innovations described on the above illustration. Don't 
be surprised, though, if persistence is required to track down the house's 
environmentally friendly components: some products are prototypes, others are 
on the market but still not easy to come by.

HOT PROPERTY: SHE HEADS FOR HILLS, HE'S LEAVING THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Pop crooner JERRY VALE has put his Beverly Hills home on the market at just 
under $1.6 million, and actress MORGAN FAIRCHILD has leased a Beverly Hills 
house for about $4,000 a month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Vale, who will perform on Wednesday at Carnegie Hall and from Friday through 
next Sunday at Caesars Palace in Atlantic City, and his wife, Rita, plan to 
sell their longtime home and buy a condo instead. They've been talking about 
moving to the beach area, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A vocalist in the style of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Vale has been a 
longtime attraction on the Las Vegas-Atlantic City casino circuit who also 
became a darling of younger audiences through his frequent appearances on David 
Letterman's late-night TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Born a little more than 60 years ago in the Bronx, Vale has been described as 
"part of a generation of Italian-American cabaret singers who virtually defined 
the pop ballad." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "The Silver Fox" because of his full head of silver hair, Vale has made 
a career out of singing about love. He recorded 50 hit albums, now being 
released as CDs and dozens of hit records, such as "What I Did for Love." His 
new CD is "The Essence of Jerry Vale." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our seventh house," he said, referring to the Beverly Hills home that 
he and his wife bought 15 years ago. "This is the longest we've lived anywhere, 
but we want to get a condo so we can close the door, travel and not worry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vales, who have been married for 35 years, already have a condo in the 
desert, but they also want one in the Beverly Hills area because their house is 
too big for them now that their two children are grown, he said. "Our son is in 
Vegas, running for the state assembly, and our daughter is an artist in 
Scottsdale," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vales' home was built in 1925, but they they updated and expanded it. The 
nearly 4,500-square-foot, Tudor-style home has four bedrooms and a guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Villa of Asher Dann & Associates in Beverly Hills has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Morgan Fairchild, who plays the anti-sex girls' school principal in 
"Test Tube Teens From the Year 2000" and a soap-opera star in "Body Chemistry 
2," has leased a recently remodeled, Beverly Hills house, which has four 
bedrooms in 3,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild, 44, played a bombshell/perfume executive in the 1993 Fox 
movie-of-the-week parody "Based on an Untrue Story," was a series regular in 
"Paper Dolls" and "Falcon Crest" and has been known as an abortion-rights and 
AIDS activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Peele of Fred Sands' Directors office in Beverly Hills represented 
Fairchild in the lease, and Casey Bennett of Jon Douglas Co.'s Bel-Air office 
had the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey home of late President RICHARD M. NIXON has been sold for close 
to $800,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhouse, which had been Nixon's residence from 1990 until he died in 
April, had been on the market since June, when it was listed at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A married couple with two teen-agers bought the townhouse, which is in Park 
Ridge, about 15 miles from Manhattan. The buyers had been living in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-story townhouse has an elevator, three bedrooms, a solarium and a 
library, all in 3,500 square feet. It had been listed by Mary Lenk of Mary Lenk 
Properties in Cresskill, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 BRANNON BRAGA, co-producer of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" series and a 
writer for the series as well as for the movie "Star Trek: Generations," due to 
be released in November, has become a first-time home buyer with his purchase 
of a Hancock Park home for close to its asking price of $635,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Braga, who is in his late 20s, bought a Spanish-style home, built in 1926, 
with three bedrooms plus maid's quarters in 3,500 square feet. Braga was 
represented in his purchase by Champ Davenport of Jon Douglas Co., Hancock 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor BLAIR UNDERWOOD, who played young attorney Jonathan Rollins in "L.A. 
Law" and slain civil rights worker James Chaney in the 1990 TV film "Murder in 
Mississippi," was married in September at the DeAngelo Estate in Orange County, 
which is for sale at $11.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 36,000-square-foot house, on about 26 acres in North Tustin Hills, 
has been on and off the market since 1989, when it was listed at $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The home was built in 1985 for Pat and Michael DeAngelo, founder of 
Anaheim-based Clothestime Inc. The couple still owns the home, with its 10 
bedrooms, two swimming pools, tennis court, disco, hair salon, gym and two 
racquetball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the wedding guests were Jill Eikenberry and other "L.A. Law" cast 
members, according to Carole Geronsin, who shares the listing with Mickey 
Hartling and Marcia Saunders, all of Prudential California Realty, Anaheim 
Hills.

HOMEOWNER'S EXEMPTION SERVICE IS OFFERED FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to numerous calls about mail solicitations, Los Angeles County 
Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn cautions homeowners against paying a fee to 
organizations for filing homeowner exemption forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county assessor's office provides this service free of charge," Hahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under California law, property owners are entitled to an annual $7,000 
reduction in the taxable value of their principal residence," he said. "To 
receive the exemption, a homeowner must complete a proper exemption claim form, 
which the assessor's office automatically sends to all new homeowners soon 
after their purchase." 
</P>
<P>
 The forms are also available at any of the assessor' regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners can check their tax bills to determine whether or not they are 
currently receiving a homeowner's exemption.

APARTMENT LIFE: IS CABLE NOTICE OF REPAIR WORK ADEQUATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in a large apartment complex in Burbank and I have some 
questions. I understand that under state law landlords and managers must 
provide ample written notification of water and power shut-offs, and of their 
intent to enter one's apartment unit to perform maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager at this complex only posts this type of information on a cable TV 
service's information channel. My problem is that I don't subscribe to cable. 
As a result, I've been caught off-guard by high-decibel, 6:30 a.m. tree 
trimmings, morning water shut-offs and unannounced entries into the apartment 
by repairmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the posting of such information on a cable channel satisfy these state 
law requirements? The manager seems to think it does. 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: First, about the noise, according to Sgt. Len Doran of the Burbank 
Police Department, 6:30 a.m. is too early for construction or similar 
(tree-trimming) noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree trimmers should wait until 7 a.m. to start and should quit by 10 p.m. 
You should make the manager aware of this before taking more drastic action, 
like complaining to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 If the manager is unresponsive, you may make a complaint about the noise, to 
which the police will respond. To do so you may phone the Burbank Police Dept. 
at (818) 953-8731. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as water and power shut-offs are concerned, state law does not mandate 
that you be notified of them in advance, but common courtesy does. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll assume that the manager puts the water shut-off information on cable, 
like he puts the "notices" of the maintenance men's intent to enter units. That 
might be reasonable notice if everyone in the building had cable. Since you 
don't, you are getting no notice, which is no good. 
</P>
<P>
 State Civil Code section 1954 requires "reasonable notice," oral or written, 
of one's intent to enter, which is usually presumed to be 24 hours' notice. At 
a minimum, the manager should verbally notify you of someone's intent to enter 
your unit. Ideally, a written notice is better. Put Gardening Duties of Renters 
in Writing 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In your Sept. 11 column, your answer to the question "What Happens When 
Tenant Neglects Yard?" has me rethinking my rental policies on the 
single-family homes I rent out in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 I always assumed that it is the tenant's responsibility to take care of the 
lawn and gardens in single-family rentals. You don't mention that in the answer 
to the reader's question. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, you say that the owner can alter the written rental agreement or lease 
with the tenant and he may " . . . withdraw the 'maintenance concession' 
(taking care of the lawn) and increase the rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Am I out of step, or are renters in single-family homes required to take care 
of the lawns and gardens at these types of rentals regardless of the agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Out of step on this one, I'm afraid. Unless you and the tenants 
specifically agree that they will care for the lawn and gardens, orally or in 
writing (in writing is always better), it is your responsibility to care for, 
or provide for the care of, these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to make the renters responsible for the lawns and gardens in your 
rentals, you should write it into the rental agreement at the inception of the 
tenancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Listing specific duties, such as "watering, trimming, pruning and mowing are 
required," is better than merely saying something like, "The tenants are 
responsible for the lawn and gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 You may change the terms of the tenancies of existing renters with 
month-to-month rental agreements by giving them 30-day notice of the changes, 
such as responsibility for gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not, however, change the terms of existing renters with leases unless 
they concur, or until the leases are up for renewal. Some Tax Advantages of 
Rental Repairs 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am a single-family homeowner in Newport Beach who will soon be a 
landlord. In the very near future I will be moving overseas and renting out my 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that there are some tax advantages to renting out a house, such 
as when you make "improvements" (like a new roof, for example) to it. My 
question is when and how do you get these tax breaks? Also, what qualifies as 
an allowed "improvement?" 
</P>
<P>
 A: As a landlord who owns and rents the house, or apartment building, as a 
business, you are entitled for tax purposes to amortize (spread out) the costs 
of certain "capital improvements" (like a new roof) that you make to the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The amortization schedules -- the number of years over which you may deduct 
the improvement's cost on your tax return -- vary with different improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 You should consult your accountant or tax attorney for specific information 
about which improvements qualify and their write-off schedules.

YOUR MORTGAGE; MAKING THE MOST OUT OF THE KEEN COMPETITION IN THE LOAN MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does $722 billion in loans sound like a lot for America's mortgage industry to 
make this year? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's not if you compare it with 1993. That's when the industry surpassed 
the $1-trillion mark for the first time in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this year's drop-off in loan applications has made many lenders 
hungrier than ever for business. And that appetite should help home buyers 
searching for good service and fair terms on a home mortgage, says David 
Lereah, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mortgage lending is a fiercely competitive market now. Everyone is competing 
for a piece of the shrinking pie," Lereah said. 
</P>
<P>
 What caused this steep decline in business? The run-up in rates -- which began 
last February -- is responsible. Low rates brought mortgage refinance 
applications to record levels last year. But this year, now that rates have 
risen, the refinance market is all but dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Refi mania is over," Lereah said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, higher rates are bad news for home buyers. But as with most 
clouds, there's a silver lining to this one. Fierce competition can work to the 
advantage of the savvy mortgage borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always pays to shop. But it really pays to shop now," Lereah stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are pointers on how to make the most of the current mortgage market: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seek out a lender with plenty of time for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when many lenders had more business than they could handle, their 
phone lines were jammed, said Mary Ann Bocchetti, who makes loans through 
Prudential Home Mortgage Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the refi boom on, there was no time in the day for all the appointments 
people wanted to make," Bocchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year is a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan officers should not only take your calls now, but also give you generous 
amounts of their time to go over the wide array of loan options available -- 
helping you select the right one for you. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also smart to learn your borrowing limits before you set out to shop for 
a house, Bocchetti said. A good loan officer should spend at least an hour on 
this initial interview, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best days of the week to get all your questions answered at the lender's 
office are Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, when loan officers typically have 
the most free time, Bocchetti recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask for a low down payment loan if you're short on cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, lenders like a down payment equal to at least 5% to 20% of the 
appraised value of the property. But some lenders are now willing to make loans 
with as little as 3% down. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time buyers, immigrants, minorities and those in the low-to-moderate 
income range are among those eligible for 3% down plans under new national 
programs. But even if you're not in one of those categories, you may be able to 
get a 3% down loan in the current lending climate, Lereah said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask your lender for a waiver of fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of business, some lenders are now willing to waive closing costs 
associated with a loan application -- such as fees for appraisals, credit 
reports and underwriting services, noted Sanjay Babbar, a Citibank mortgage 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of gimmicks out there now to attract the home buyer," Babbar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a waiver of fees, you may be able to get free "payment insurance" on 
your mortgage. Some lenders are giving away policies that promise to make your 
home loan payments for as long as six months -- should you lose your job, said 
Lereah, the economist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Request rapid loan processing if that would help you. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much loan processing being done by computer nowadays, it's reasonable 
to ask that your mortgage close within 30 days after application. That's a big 
improvement on the 60 to 90 days it once took to process a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you wish to move swiftly on your home purchase? Today, an aggressive 
lending firm should meet your desire -- so long as you cooperate in providing 
the documents it needs to do the loan, Lereah says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask for decent loan terms even if your credit is partially blemished. 
</P>
<P>
 During the refinance surge, many busy lenders didn't want to be bothered by 
customers with credit flaws. Those with significant blemishes in their credit 
histories were often referred to "B," "C" or "D" level lenders who demanded 
that they pay mortgage rates as much as 2 to 3 percentage points above the 
prevailing market. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Lereah noted, these days more mainstream mortgage lenders are putting 
down the welcome mat for those with mixed credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you show that, despite a poor credit history, you've been faithfully 
making your payments in recent months? Then now could be the time to find an 
"A" level lender willing to make you a market-rate loan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look for a lender you think will stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the year is out, fully 20% of those in the mortgage field are expected 
to lose their jobs, Lereah predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with a mortgage company that fails before you close your loan could 
put a big dent in your home purchase plans, cautioned Matt Garagusi, a loan 
consultant for Great Western Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 And at this point many young mortgage firms are expected to perish, according 
to Garagusi. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of small shops that crept into the market during the last two years are 
creeping out just as fast," he said.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT / GARDENING; RETRACTABLE AWNINGS SUIT 
DECK, PATIO AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I would like some type of awning over my deck and large sliding 
glass door for blocking the sun's heat and rain. How durable and effective are 
the automatic retractable awnings that need no supports? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Retractable awnings are an excellent choice for decks and patios. They 
can be as wide as 40 feet and extend out from the house wall up to 12 feet or 
just as far as you need it. They need no supports that can get in your way. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do they shield your deck and party guests from unexpected summer 
showers, but they block the sun's heat and fading rays. Extending the awning 
out over a large glass patio door can lower the indoor room temperature by 
eight degrees and protect your furniture from fading. 
</P>
<P>
 When you crank the retractable awning open, an elbow joint in each of two 
lateral support arms straightens. This extends the awning out over your deck. 
The arms are spring-loaded to keep the awning fabric stretched tight. 
</P>
<P>
 When the awning is retracted, the fabric rolls up and is stored in a small 
square box high on the house wall. With special covers, it is barely 
perceptible. The arms are fully collapsed at the elbows, so they lay flush 
against the wall and are hidden too. 
</P>
<P>
 The least expensive awnings use a hand crank mechanism to open and close them. 
For easier operation, you can get an electric motor drive with a hand-held 
remote control, like a TV remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Special sun and wind sensors and 24-hour timer controls are also available. 
These automatically extend or retract the awning depending on weather 
conditions. For example, you can preset it to close the awning at a particular 
wind speed to protect the awning. 
</P>
<P>
 Most designs are supported by a single torsion rod that is attached to the 
wall. This makes installation simple. By just turning a few screws, you can 
adjust the angle of the awning to give the desired head clearance and shading. 
</P>
<P>
 The lateral arms are usually made of special lightweight, high-strength 
aluminum alloys. With an anodized or baked-on finish, they are completely 
maintenance-free. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many choices of fabrics for retractable awnings depending on your 
specific needs. The most common fabric for residential use is solution-dyed 
acrylic. Laminated polyester materials are more waterproof for hard rains, but 
they are heavier and require a larger storage box. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 670 listing 11 manufacturers of retractable 
awnings, do-it-yourself installation instructions, fabric selector guide, 
detailed product information and prices. Please mail $2 and a self-addressed 
envelope to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, 
Ohio 45244. How to Protect Home Against Air Leaks 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have read where air leaks along the sill plate in a house are the 
greatest air leakage source. Where is the sill plate and how can I seal the 
leaks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Many tests have indicated that the sill plate is the area of greatest air 
leakage. The sill plate is the piece of lumber that lays on top of the 
foundation. The walls attach to the sill plate. The top of the foundation, 
especially a poured foundation, is sometimes uneven and creates gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 I sealed the sill plate area in my home from the indoors using expanding foam 
caulk from a can. If you do not have access to it from indoors and must caulk 
from outdoors, make sure to paint it or the sun will degrade it.

GARDENING Q&A: HOME IMPROVEMENT / GARDENING; WHY 4-YEAR-OLD HYDRANGEA FAILS TO 
BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I have not been able to correct a problem with my 4-year-old 
hydrangea, and nurserymen seem to be baffled by it too. It bloomed well for the 
first two years, but now it no longer blooms; it just grows and looks healthy. 
Having grown hydrangeas for years with no problems, I am now confused. Would 
you have any great suggestions other than tossing this shrub out? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Your problem reminds me of an experience I had about two decades ago 
with a friend in Glendora whose six Hybrid Tea rose bushes just grew and grew 
but never bloomed. He reported that he fed them regularly, and the plants 
looked remarkably healthy, but every stem grew without a bloom. After much 
inquiry, I finally learned that he was feeding his plants monthly with a 
fertilizer that contained only nitrogen, without phosphorus or potassium. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitrogen generally promotes greenery in plants, whereas phosphorus tends to 
encourage flowering and fruiting. I advised my friend to try feeding his plants 
with "Superphosphate" (0-20-0 formula) and let me know the result. Some weeks 
later he called very excitedly to say his bushes were covered with big, 
beautiful flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's late in the season to expect any bloom this year from a hydrangea, but go 
ahead and feed now with Superphosphate. I'm almost certain it will help your 
plant bloom again next season. How Much, Often Can Bluestar Be Pruned? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you please discuss when, how much, and how often a "Bluestar" (Amsonia 
tabernacmontani) should be pruned? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although I am not personally familiar with this apparently lovely 
perennial, I have two publications that rate it quite highly for year-round 
good looks, with shiny willow-like leaves, clusters of soft blue star-shaped 
flowers in late spring and interesting long, tapering seed pods later on. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they also comment that it is not widely available. Both confirm that 
this plant is generally trouble free and recommend leaving it undisturbed once 
planted. Normally it grows 2-3 feet tall and spreads about 1-2 feet wide. If 
you feel you must prune it, do so lightly in winter after the seed pods mature, 
and before new growth starts in the spring. How to Take Care of an Orchid 
Cactus 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have two questions regarding the care of Epiphyllums (Orchid cactus). Do 
I break off the spent flowers, cut through the seed pod or leave all on? Will 
the same leaf flower again next year? I can't find answers to either of these 
questions in any books. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Epiphyllums tend to bloom on recently matured leaf-stems; so the new growth 
developing now will normally provide the next crop of flowers. Leaf-stems that 
have already bloomed will not usually re-bloom to any notable extent. 
Leaf-stems that are unattractive or over 2 years old may be removed, but others 
should remain to nourish the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Old blooms and seed pods may be removed to promote slightly more flowering 
next time, but it doesn't seem to make a significant difference. By the way, 
the fleshy seedpods of Epiphyllums are edible, and some of them are actually 
quite sweet and tasty when ripe.

IN THE GARDEN: TIDYING UP YOUR GREENERY FOR THE FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that fall is here, do you tear out that patch of lamb's ears than died 
during summer? How far can you cut back the Mexican sage? Should you prune a 
rockrose or ceanothus that's grown too large? What about "deadheading"? 
</P>
<P>
 Just how do you care for the "new" garden, the drought-resistant or 
"sustainable" landscape? 
</P>
<P>
 That was the subject of a day-long seminar by Los Angeles landscape designer 
Robert Cornell for his clients, held in a garden he'd designed, an interesting 
idea in itself, because, as he pointed out, few professional gardeners can 
afford to do anything more than "mow, blow and go." Nowadays, you need to know 
how to care for your own garden. 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers the term sustainable to drought-resistant, because these new 
gardens encompass more than simply saving water. A sustainable landscape takes 
into account all of the things that go into or come out of a garden -- water of 
course, green waste, even the energy expended, or resources used, to make 
garden chemicals. Part of his seminar had to do with that kind of maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fun (the owner of the garden and I had a hard time not joining in) 
came when he took the pruning shears, weeding fork and other garden tools, out 
into the garden and began showing how to tidy up. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the plantings in this Pasadena garden are drought-resistant, new, and 
few gardeners have much experience with them. After the heat of summer, they 
need a tidying up, to prepare them for the wonderful rainy, growing season 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Patches tend to die out in small-scale ground covers such as lamb's ears and 
the new Phlomis russeliana . He showed how to clean these out, mulching any 
bare areas to protect them against rain and irrigation runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the fall, you can dig up healthy plants from the main clump and fill 
the voids. This also works for good old gazanias. 
</P>
<P>
 From the new ornamental grasses he removed fistfuls of dead blades and 
suggested cutting a miscanthus completely to the ground since this is one of 
those grasses that goes completely dormant in winter. If you have a grass 
you're unsure of, Cornell suggested playing it safe: "Only cut back what's 
already turned brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Many plants needed deadheading. He cut off the spent agapanthus and kangaroo 
paws, showing how to cut the flower stalks close to the ground. If you only cut 
them off above the leaves (easier), you'll have a mass of dead, stumpy stalks 
in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stalks are actually pretty -- dried arrangements in the winter garden -- 
but eventually they have to come off. Agapanthus are one, turning a lovely 
bleached tan in time and if you wait long enough they are easy to simply pull 
off. Don't try this too soon on any seed stalk or you will also pull up some of 
the plant. They're got to be really dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell admitted that deadheading, the removal of spent flowers and sometimes 
stalks, was his least favorite garden chore (mine too), but it makes an 
incredible difference in the look of a garden.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, as soon as the plants were deadheaded and dead patches in ground 
covers cleaned up and mulched, the garden looked dramatically better. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new perennials needed cutting back in varying degrees. A lion's tail, 
still in full bloom, had some of the older, dead stems cut out and he did the 
same thing for a Mexican sage, just coming into fall bloom. This perennial will 
bloom at least twice each year if you cut off the dead flowers in summer, and 
then cut back the plant almost to the ground in early winter. 
</P>
<P>
 He said you could also cut the lion's tail nearly to the ground (that means 
about a foot off the ground, trying to cut just above new sprouts) and that it 
would rebound and remain a more manageable size. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell also tackled one of the new Canary Island lavenders, a difficult plant 
to clean up because there are so many flower spikes and they never stop coming. 
He grabbed handfuls, live ones and dead, and then cut them off, going back 
afterward to individually shorten some of the remaining spikes, nipping here 
and there with the shears so the plant didn't look "sheared." Sort of like 
layering hair and, in fact, Cornell calls it "feather pruning." 
</P>
<P>
 Penstemon have always puzzled me. It's a hard plant to tidy up. Cornell 
suggests lightly cutting off spent blooms, again making cuts just above new 
sprouts, but he also suggests completely cutting out old, thick woody growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the helichrysums can be a handful. In this garden a variegated kind 
(the chartreuse 'Limelight' is more common) had quickly overgrown its spot and 
was smothering a neighbor. These fast, rambunctious perennials are best cut 
back branch by branch, making all cuts just above another branch so there are 
no stubs, to preserve the soft, spreading look of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Going slowly, you can easily reduce the plant by about half without it looking 
any less lovely, but a wise gardener allows at least six to eight feet of space 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't you just chop away with a hedge shears, until it was the right size 
and completely constrained? There's no place for a hedge shears in the new 
garden, according to Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
 The way to prune anything is to cut back one branch at a time, with the shears 
or a loper. That's why professional gardeners simply don't have the time, and 
end up "poodling" everything -- cutting shrubs and large perennials into nasty 
round balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The native ceanothus and Mediterranean rockroses were two shrubs Cornell 
suggested not pruning (and I can add that hard pruning of ceanothus is a quick 
way to kill them). If they get too big for their spot, it's better to remove 
some. Cornell suggested just a little tip pruning to control growth and remove 
old flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also thinned and shortened a large shrub acacia, the elegant knife acacia, 
by removing overly long branches, always back to another, and taking out one 
entire trunk, preserving the graceful shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural shape and form is definitely an important part of the new garden, and 
fall clean up requires finesse and no hedge shears. I don't know about his 
clients, but I for one couldn't wait to get home and practice the art, getting 
out the Corona shears and filling the compost bin. Satisfying work indeed on a 
warm, dry autumn day.

IT MAY NOT BE A LOT, BUT IT'S DEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rachel Kusher's "Just a Plot of Land, Not a Lot of Land" (Green Thumb, Sept. 
25) is the dearest article I ever read in a newspaper or magazine.

<P>
 After reading "Just a Plot . . . " by that bookkeeper who dabbles as a 
wordsmith, I was tickled green. 
</P>
<P>
 I too have lived in apartments where there has been a little space to produce 
a bit of Mother Earth that isn't being trampled or someway abused. Kusher is an 
inspiration in that even though her potted plants sprouted their own little 
feet and walked away in the middle of the night, she remains undaunted. Perhaps 
it is what was needed for her to take on that little-bigger piece with her 
landlord's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 For my part, I find that it is contagious. I started with one palm plant that 
I bought years ago for my one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood. And then a Spider 
plant that has kept going and going. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, this last summer I became the caretaker of the 1994 Showcase Design 
House with its six acres. I am sorry to say I have fallen to the "slash and 
burn" gardening, although I don't think I have an "excessive fondness for the 
small, gasoline powered engines." I confess, we have a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations and God bless Rachel Kusher for her wit, and if she makes her 
"little Eden" better, the world is better.

ONE CREDIT PROBLEM SHOULDN'T STOP LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Robert Bruss' Real Estate Q & A column on Sept. 25, the person 
seeking seller-financing because of a "messy credit problem" due to a co-signed 
auto loan should be advised if this is the only lapse on his credit report, he 
should be able to obtain financing through an institutional lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect borrowers are the exception, not the rule. Lenders deny approval when 
there is a pattern of untimely payments or ignored obligations, but not for an 
isolated credit blemish.

THURSDAY IS THE BEST DAY TO CLOSE A SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agree with Robert Bruss ("What Is the Best Day to Close a Home Sale?" Real 
Estate Q&A, Sept. 25). There is no best day to close the sale.But there is a 
best day to schedule a day for closing, and this is a Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 It's two days before the day on which everyone expects the sale to close. 
Escrow has had all the documents signed and everything looks great for a 
closing on time, but then, after lunch, the escrow officer gets a call and the 
lender now has to also have the seller's signature too on some silly yellow 
form to put in their file before they will fund and funding has to be on the 
day before closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The escrow officer calls the seller's home and finds out the seller just left 
and won't be back 'til dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 The escrow officer notifies all concerned that there may be a delay in getting 
the sale closed and, if she thinks she has the slightest chance, she will get 
on the phone and try to talk the lender into modifying this requirement. Few 
people know just how hard escrow officers work. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday as your target you have Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to get the 
last-minute things in shape. If there does happen to be a delay you've still 
got Friday on which to close the sale.

SELLING HOMES 'AS IS' SPARKS RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are three salient points about "as is" sales, all of which speak against 
the practice: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Let's take two identical adjacent homes, one for sale "as is" and the 
other not. The one without "as is" will attract more qualified buyers. You 
don't have to be an economics Nobel laureate to know that more qualified buyers 
equals a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Suppose someone buys the "as is" home and shortly after the sale a defect 
is discovered. California law still requires full disclosure of what the seller 
knows or should have known. Naturally, the seller will profess ignorance of the 
undisclosed defect. However, the buyer may assume that the seller's motive for 
the "as is" was to protect himself from a failure to disclose the defect. "They 
must have known or they wouldn't have sold 'as-is'!" the thinking goes. 
Consequently the buyer will have a greater propensity to sue with the "as is" 
than he would without. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Finally, suppose there is litigation for the above defect. The jury will 
assume that the seller had something to hide or he wouldn't have used the "as 
is." Again, "They must have known or they wouldn't have sold 'as is'!" 
Consequently an "as is" seller is more likely to lose in litigation due to the 
perceived guilt (deserved or not). 
</P>
<P>
 A properly constructed real estate transaction conducted by a competent 
realtor is the best protection for both the buyer and seller in today's 
consumer-protection world. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 You make a very "easy answer" to a very difficult question. You categorically 
state that the "as is" clause has no use whatsoever in modern residential sales 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago the longstanding rule of caveat employer customarily placed 
the burden of investigation of the quality of the property on the buyer. Along 
with the advent of consumer rights as enforced by the courts, the pendulum has 
swung far over to the side of the buyer so that the buyer can bring to court 
any disappointment he or she may see fit, whether substantial or frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not think there is a problem in the litigation system with silly 
lawsuits. You may not think there is a problem of wasted millions of dollars in 
attorney's fees by litigants fighting over which end of the egg to open, but a 
number of my clients, including the broker you mention, believe that 
responsible citizens should take steps to reduce the flood of costly litigation 
in our courts. The "as is" claim is a simple tool to let buyers know that the 
seller is not willing to guarantee perfection, and that the risk of unknown 
problems is on the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 You suggest that use of the "as is" clause is not a smart way to get a top 
price. There are other issues in such an important contract as the sale of a 
residence. One of the important ones is the reduction, perhaps to zero, of the 
risk of frivolous lawsuits that can cost tens of thousands of dollars to 
defend, even where the seller is blameless.

REAL ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q.: I am a first-time home buyer. Do I need a real estate attorney? 
</P>
<P>
 A.: Not unless the transaction is out of the ordinary or otherwise expected to 
be difficult.The vast majority of people buying a home in California do not use 
a real estate attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Most home buyers are capable of handling routine real estate purchase 
contracts as long as precautions are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should definitely make sure they understand every single term of the 
contract. Every contract is different, even though they're on pre-printed 
forms," said Marc Weissman, of Weiss & Weissman in San Francisco, adding that 
buyers should closely study the contingency clauses that allow them to back out 
if they cannot obtain financing or an inspection turns up problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Hiring an attorney after a conflict erupts may be too late. Lawsuits are 
costly and time-consuming, so, Weissman advises, "People who anticipate a 
problem should stay out of the transaction altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 Ilyce Glink, author of "100 Questions Every First-Time Homebuyer Should Ask," 
(Times Books, Random House, 1994), says buyers who need an attorney should call 
several and inquire about fees, but be willing to pay for experience. Do not 
hire "Uncle Harry, the tax attorney" to handle what may be the biggest 
investment of your life, she advises. "On a $100,000 home, the attorney's fee 
is minuscule, and on a bad deal, that fee could save you a tremendous amount of 
heartache as well as money to fix whatever problems crop up," Glink said.

REMODELER'S DIARY: RETRO-FIT WINDOWS OFFER REPLACEMENT OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN F. GIESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Gieser lives in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk through any middle-class neighborhood and you'll find many homes that 
could use improvement in their windows. Sometimes it's a double-hung window 
that's obviously hard to open with its crooked frame and rotted wood. Maybe 
there's several windows that just don't match each other. Perhaps the windows 
are the wrong style for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, a homeowner's only choice was to tear out the old windows, install 
new windows and repair the stucco and drywall, hoping to match the old paint 
and stucco colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came "retro-fit windows," designed to use the existing opening 
without removing the old window frame. Now we can have the windows we need in a 
few days with no stucco damage and only the trim to paint afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 I first considered replacement windows when the street noise began to 
interfere with my sleep. My windows were single-glazed metal-sashed sliders and 
measured 6-by-3 feet, except for a small bathroom window. They operated well 
enough but were ineffectual as a sound barrier. I felt like I was sleeping on 
the front lawn. By replacing them with double-glazed windows, I could decrease 
noise by more than 40% because the double panes of glass trap "dead air" 
between them, creating insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 As I began attending home shows, I realized the choices in materials and 
optional features could accomplish more than just noise-reduction. Optional 
tinting would protect upholstery, drapes and carpet. For the beautiful look of 
French windows without the headache of cleaning multiple panes, you could have 
the grids installed inside the dual-glazing. Likewise for mini-blinds. Improved 
lock design allows you to leave the window partially open for ventilation while 
still providing security. There is a choice of basic colors. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviews with five salespeople, I was ready to make the choice between 
wood, metal or vinyl sashes. Wood had the appeal of being a "natural" material, 
but one of the salesmen had cautioned me that "termites are an ongoing problem 
in California." Don't I know it. They've been munching on my house for years. 
So, I decided "we're not making a salad here, let's pick the best material for 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal seemed a durable choice, but another salesman reminded me that "metal 
and glass are conductors of sound, not inhibitors." 
</P>
<P>
 That left vinyl. Vinyl doesn't come to mind when I first think of windows. I 
pictured it warping and cracking in the extreme heat of our California sun. 
However, there was convincing documentation showing the success and durability 
of vinyl in the Midwest as well as in Europe. One salesman even showed me a 
real estate appraisal that had vinyl windows increasing the value of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 I was mulling over my choices when I got a call from my good friend Lani. A 
friend of hers was ecstatic over the peace and quiet his family has enjoyed 
since installing vinyl windows throughout their house. I spoke with him and 
then called the contractor he had used. Of all the salesmen, he was the worst. 
Not only was he a half hour late, he didn't even apologize for it. If these 
customers hadn't been so satisfied, he would have "unsold" the product. 
</P>
<P>
 After measuring my existing windows, he wrote a contract that contained so 
many misspelled words it was impossible to tell what work the carpenters were 
to perform. Since the windows were to be shipped directly to my house, I asked 
him to drop by after delivery to check the accuracy of his measurements. He 
didn't. I understand that he no longer works there. 
</P>
<P>
 The salesman may have been a disappointment, but the carpenters more than made 
up for him in efficiency and courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff and Brian swiftly set to work Monday morning. First they removed the 
slider and the fixed panes of glass. Then they cut off the vertical center 
support. This left the original metal frame and track. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the salesman's measurements were not accurate, (are we surprised?), the 
carpenters shaved off some of the lower metal frame. While Brian held the 
window in place from the inside, Jeff leveled and secured the window from 
outside, drilling in the screws on the left and right sash. Next, they laid out 
the wood trim they had purchased that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal trim is now available to cover the small gap between the old and new 
frame of the interior. At the time of my installation this was not an option, 
so the carpenters mitered the corners of 1-by-2-inch trim and fastened it to 
the old frame with counter-sunk finishing nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff reminded me to caulk all around the window between the trim and the sash. 
The exterior of the new window has a flange to cover the old sash. If there is 
a small gap, it will be necessary to apply trim on the outside as well. A large 
gap can be filled with foam insulation that comes in a spray can. My job was to 
caulk the nail holes and primer and paint the trim. The vinyl sash would never, 
(never, never, never) need painting. If you've ever scraped paint off glass you 
can relate to my feeling of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpenters took a day and a half to install the three large windows and 
the small one. They left no mess, no trampled plants and their business card. I 
was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 One drawback of retro-fit windows is that they will use up a few inches of 
your windowsill due to the additional trim and the larger sash necessary to 
cover the old sash. Bear this in mind if you have blinds or drapes that nest 
inside the window sill. You may have to rehang the window treatment on the 
outer edge of your windows. I was fortunate that my mini-blinds still fit 
afterward. The actual glass surface will also be a few inches smaller than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost was $1,600 with a payment schedule of one-third deposit when 
the contract was signed, one third at start of construction, and the balance at 
completion. It would be wise to withhold final payment until getting a lien 
release from the contractor as proof that he paid the distributor and his 
workmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they worth it? I can close the windows and make (most) of the world go 
away. They look as new as when they were installed. My home is cooler in summer 
and warmer in winter. They operate smoothly and quietly. I should have done 
this years ago.

GEARS & GADGETS: TOOLING AROUND WITH REPAIR KITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, the only pocket tools I toted around were my two trusty Swiss 
Army knives -- one a basic model with a couple of blades, a nail file and a 
corkscrew, the other a weighty multi-tool, with scissors, screw drivers and 
saws for both wood and metal. But newfangled twists on Swiss Army knives are 
popping up all over the place. Some are veritable mini-tool chests on hinges; 
others contain special gadgets for repairing bicycles or eyeglasses. All are an 
acceptably portable size, and can come in handy on the go. Prices below do not 
include postage and handling: 
</P>
<P>
 The Leatherman Tool performs so many functions that in the several months I've 
had one on hand for testing, I've found only a few tasks it can't do. 
Especially useful -- and unusual in a pocket tool -- are the pliers that fold 
out of the two handles, which fold back to provide a solid grip for usage. Also 
concealed within the handles are a fold-out can/bottle opener, three sizes of 
standard screwdrivers, a Phillips screwdriver, metal and wood file/saw, an 
awl/punch, and wire cutters. When extended parallel to each other, the handles 
form an eight-inch ruler. The entire tool is only 4 inches long by 1 inch wide 
and less than one-half inch thick when folded and comes with its own snap-shut 
leather pouch. Manipulating the handles takes some practice, since the hinges 
are a bit stiff. Also, I missed the presence of a scissors or corkscrew, items 
I frequently use, on the go.Still, for tougher tasks, the Leatherman is hard to 
beat, and the addition of a basic Swiss Army knife can fill in the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Leatherman Tool (item No. KT547V) is $48.50 from Magellan's; (800) 962-4943. A 
smaller, lighter version (No. KT547VS) with fewer screwdrivers costs $37.50.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nature Company's Pocket Survival Tool is an attractive slim-line 
alternative to the Swiss Army Knife. The 3 1/8-by-1 7/8-inch stainless steel 
case is equipped with a folding knife, scissors, magnifying lens, cap and can 
opener, screwdriver, wrench, three-inch ruler, sharpening stone and nail file. 
The polished surface functions as a mirror. No, there's no fish-scaler or metal 
saw, and no plastic toothpick or tweezers pop out of any recesses -- standard 
features on most Swiss Army knives -- but you can't have everything in a 
package this compact. And you do get a carrying case with a belt loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket Survival Tool (No. 298232) is $21.95 from the Nature Company; (800) 
227-1114.  
</P>
<P>
 No slouch when it comes to innovation, Victorinox, maker of the Original Swiss 
Army Knife, recently introduced a Traveler's Kit. Inside a black leather pouch 
with a Velcro closure and belt loop are a knife with 18 implements, a 
mini-Solitaire Maglite flashlight, and a compass/ruler with a magnifying glass 
and indoor-outdoor thermometer. Each of the three components slides into its 
own compartment in the pouch. The 3 1/2-inch knife with signature red handle 
includes: a large blade, small blade, corkscrew, can opener with small 
screwdriver, cap opener with screwdriver and wire stripper, reamer/punch, 
scissors, multipurpose hook, wood saw, mini-screwdriver, straight pin, key 
ring, tweezers, toothpick and tiny ballpoint pen. The effect is very snazzy as 
well as practical -- a neat gift for Yuppie fixer-uppers. Victorinox Swiss Army 
Knife Traveler's Kit is $91 at sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists often fear breakdowns on the road -- particularly remote routes, such 
as mountain paths. The Cool Tool, as advertised, is like having a mini bike 
repair shop in the palm of your hand -- provided, of course, you know how to do 
the job. Totally ignorant of bike mechanics, I asked a cycling friend who is on 
intimate terms with his bike's every element to test the tool for several 
months. He liked what he saw -- and used. Of course, in an instrument just 5 
inches long and 2 inches wide, there's no spare tire or extra chains. There is, 
however -- and this will only mean something to people who know what to do with 
them -- an adjustable narrow-gauge crescent wrench with square jaws to fit all 
spokes as well as nuts and bolts up to three-fourth inches; 4-, 5- and 
6-millimeter Allen wrenches; a No. 1 Phillips screwdriver; chain breaker; Allen 
wrench holder, and 14-millimeter crank-bolt wrench.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cool Tool bike repair kit (No. K546-241) is $20 from REI; (800) 426-4840.  
</P>
<P>
 On a simpler note, I've found an inexpensive eyeglass repair kit that already 
has come to the rescue in the short time I've had it. The kit includes four 
tiny replacement hinge screws, a miniature screwdriver and a magnifying glass, 
all within a see-through plastic carrying case. The screws slide into the 
hollow handle of the screwdriver. The whole thing measures a mere 3 1/2 inches 
by 1 3/4 inches and weighs half an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeglass Repair Kit (No. KO539) is $1.85 from Magellan's; tel. (800) 962-4943. 
Gear & Gadgets appears the first week of every month.

HIKING: SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS: ON THE TRAIL OF MANY LANGUAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Think globally, act locally" could be the motto for builders of the new 
Solstice International Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-guided interpretive trail leads hikers along a year-round creek and 
introduces them to the flora and history of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
Interpretive pamphlets are available in English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, 
Tagalog, Cantonese and Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the trail, a joint endeavor of the Southern California chapter 
of the Pacific Asia Travel Assn. and the nonprofit Mountains Conservancy 
Foundation, is to introduce the local wild lands -- what park professionals 
call "the other L.A." -- to visitors and residents from Asian and Pacific Rim 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The path itself is a narrow country road -- suitable for strollers and 
wheelchairs -- which offers an easy family hike in the shade of grand old oaks 
and towering sycamores. 
</P>
<P>
 Solstice Canyon Park, which opened on the summer solstice of 1988 and came 
from land privately owned, is enjoyable year-round, but autumn and winter are 
particularly good times to ramble through the quiet canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 In autumn, enjoy the fall color display of the sycamores and in winter, from 
the park's upper slopes, look for gray whales migrating past Point Dume. Milk 
thistle, castor bean and other assorted non-native plants were eliminated when 
the park was built. Picnic areas and a visitor center were added. Now, with the 
Solstice International Trail, Solstice Canyon Trail has to rank among the top 
nature parks in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Pacific Coast Highway, about 17 miles up the 
coast from Santa Monica and 3 1/2 miles up-coast from Malibu Canyon Road, turn 
inland on Corral Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first bend in the road you'll leave the road and proceed straight to 
the very small Solstice Canyon parking lot. Beyond this small lot, the park 
access road continues to a second, larger lot. There is a $5 park entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Stop at the Visitor Center, pick up a trail brochure in the language 
of your choice, then join signed Solstice International Trail. The brochure, 
keyed to two dozen numbered posts along the path, describes everything you see 
en route , from sage to sycamores. About halfway along, you'll pass the 1865 
Matthew Keller House and in a few more minutes -- Fern Grotto. 
</P>
<P>
 The road travels under the shade of oak and sycamore. Palms, agave, bamboo and 
bird of paradise and many more tropical plants thrive in the garden. A 
waterfall, fountain and an old dam are some of the other special features found 
in this paradisiacal setting known as Tropical Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the creek from Tropical Terrace is signed Rising Sun Trail, which 
climbs a ridge for rewarding canyon and ocean views. The two-mile trail offers 
an excellent, but more difficult return route to the trail head. Solstice 
International Trail Where: Solstice Canyon Park, Santa Monica Mountains. 
Distance: 3 miles round trip. Terrain: Gentle canyon, year-round creek. 
Highlights: Best nature trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, complete with 
interpretive brochure in a half-dozen foreign languages. Degree of Difficulty: 
Easy. For More Information: Mountain Parks Information; tel. (800) 533-Park.

CRUISE VIEWS: SHIPBOARD SAMBA DOWN TO RIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looks like the Pasadena Rose Parade on amphetamines, costumed by 
Frederick's of Hollywood and orchestrated by the chain saw marching band from 
the Doo Dah Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The giddy, gorgeous pre-Lenten Carnavale in Rio de Janeiro is still one of the 
most spectacular shows on earth, with 70,000 lavishly costumed singers and 
dancers parading through the Sambodromo during a three-night extravaganza 
beginning Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Rio these days is also on many travelers' caution list because 
of its high rate of crime, particularly theft aimed at tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 We've found being aboard a cruise ship is the safest and most comfortable way 
to attend Carnavale. Guests are escorted on a private bus to and from the 
Sambodromo, where the samba schools parade. Security at the stadium is well 
enforced, and you're sitting among your fellow cruise ship passengers in a 
reserved area. 
</P>
<P>
 With your ship serving as hotel and restaurant, you don't have to worry about 
room reservations that aren't honored, waiters and chambermaids who fail to 
show up for work or any of the other problems that befall tourists during this 
collective annual madness. Rio's citizens drop everything including their jobs 
to devote themselves to four days of partying. They get little or no sleep, 
dozing on the beaches in the daytime so they can samba all night. 
</P>
<P>
 We've sailed to Carnavale in Rio twice now, first nearly 10 years ago with Sun 
Line's Stella Solaris, then again two years ago aboard Crystal Cruises' Crystal 
Harmony. This year, the Crystal Harmony is the only major cruise ship returning 
for Carnavale; the Stella Solaris will be sailing in the Amazon and Caribbean 
during late February. 
</P>
<P>
 The 960-passenger Crystal Harmony is perhaps the most luxurious of all 
traditional large cruise ships. Built in 1990 (and with a new sister ship set 
to debut next April), the ship provides top-quality food and service, with 
spacious cabins measuring from 183 square feet to penthouses at 948 square 
feet. All have sitting areas and bathrooms with tubs, and more than half have 
private verandas. Four cabins are specially configured for passengers with 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-day cruise that will feature attendance at the Carnavale competition in 
the Sambodromobegins in Buenos Aires Feb. 21, then calls in Montevideo Feb. 22. 
There are two days at sea to rest up for late nights before the ship arrives in 
Rio on Feb. 25 at noon. The samba school competitions begin that evening, a 
Saturday, and continue through the evening of Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Harmony sails from Rio the morning of Feb. 27, going on to Recife, 
Devil's Island and Barbados, before docking in San Juan on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The line has recently announced a discount in effect on bookings made before 
Oct. 31 that takes 38% off the fare for the second cabin occupant. The offer 
covers all cabin categories except the most expensive Crystal Penthouse 
staterooms and the two lowest-priced accommodation categories. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if a couple booked a deluxe stateroom in Category F on Deck Five 
before the Oct. 31 deadline, their fares with the discount would be $5,690 
each, plus an additional $200 air add-on per person for round-trip air fare 
from Los Angeles. Port taxes would add another $135 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore excursion prices for the Carnavale have not been set because the tickets 
have not been released by the Sambodromo officials, but a spokesman for Crystal 
estimates they will cost around $200 per person for one evening. At Carnavale, 
each samba school first selects its theme and composes its story-song, and the 
latter is played on local radio stations from December right until Carnavale so 
the audience can usually sing along. 
</P>
<P>
 Some travel tips if you go: 
</P>
<P>
 Rio in February is extremely hot and humid. Take cool, comfortable cotton 
clothing that you don't mind getting wet; the last time we went, we sat through 
a drenching downpour for at least an hour, and even with umbrellas weren't able 
to stay dry. And yes, the parade did go on in spite of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the crush of crowds everywhere during Carnavale, exercise extreme 
caution with valuables. Leave your passport, travelers' checks, almost all your 
cash and all your jewelry locked up in the ship's safe deposit boxes or in your 
cabin safe. Take with you only what's essential during your outing. Never go 
out alone at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted optional day shore excursions from the ship cover most of Rio's 
traditional sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
 To get more information about Crystal's cruise to Rio's Carnavale, contact a 
travel agent or Crystal Cruises, (310) 785-9300.

TAKING THE KIDS: PASS THE TROUT, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt wouldn't even look at the kids' menu. "I know there's nothing on it I 
want to eat," he said firmly, begging to order trout for the third night in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't like spending $14 for his dinner but I couldn't force him to eat 
another burger, hot dog or serving of chicken fingers and fries. I figured any 
10-year-old who had hiked 10 miles up a mountain deserved a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet wherever we went on a recent trip West, the kids' offerings were sadly 
similar and often distressingly high in fat. Some menus offered "heart healthy" 
choices for adults but stuck to the same tired choices for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 This at a time when 25% to 40% of American children are overweight and 
research continues to underscore that heart disease and high cholesterol can 
start in childhood, said Dr. John Udall, a national expert on pediatric 
nutrition for the American Academy of Pediatrics and a professor at Louisiana 
State and Tulane Universities. "People have got to start realizing that this is 
not good for kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially troublesome on trips, he continued, when kids are probably 
getting less exercise than at home and eating more snacks that may be high in 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few restaurants seem inclined to change. "This is what the restaurants 
think the kids want," said Gregg Rapp, whose Seattle-based company, Menu 
Workshop, designs menus for restaurants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, restaurant officials point to industry surveys that show kids prefer 
high-fat choices such as pizza and macaroni and cheese. "A restaurant meal is 
not the time to force nutrition on the kids," said Susan Schneider, who 
oversees children's menus for the national restaurant chain Denny's. "Parents' 
No. 1 concern is to keep the kids happy and quiet. In 3 1/2 years, I haven't 
received one letter asking for other food for kids," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, restaurants from budget-priced Denny's to upscale city 
eateries are working overtime to make families feel welcome, Rapp said.  
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder. The market is growing each year as children of the baby-boom 
generation reach school age and adolescence. During the 1990s, the Census 
Bureau reports, the elementary school-age population is expected to jump more 
than 4 million, numbering more than 36 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already 40% of parents with preteen kids tell us they never go to table-serve 
restaurants without their kids," American Restaurant Assn. spokeswoman Wendy 
Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the more reason to demand more nutritious food for children, Udall said. 
One way is to fill out customer satisfaction cards, he said. "Someone has to be 
advocates for the children." 
</P>
<P>
 A few upscale places have begun to listen. At Hyatt hotels and resorts, for 
example, a child can order a smaller portion of anything he likes from the 
adult menu for half price. The Boca Raton Resort in Florida has adopted a 
similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked the kids and they told us they wanted more choices," said Meg 
McLeroy, who initiated the menu policy at the Boca Raton resort. Contrary to 
popular wisdom, she's convinced that "kids have a lot more sophisticated tastes 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they don't, they likely won't want to eat chicken fingers and hot dogs 
for a week straight. Until more restaurants get the message from parents that 
there is a need for more nutritious choices for children, there are some ways 
we can ensure that everyone eats healthier on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In restaurants, rather than ordering a meal for each child, try ordering 
"family-style" and letting everyone share. Side dishes may also be the source 
of healthy options. And ethnic restaurants may offer variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that it may cost more to eat healthy on the road. The other 
bad news is that the kids may resist. "It can be tough," Somers said. "You 
might have to work out a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 But not always. Matt finished his trout every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

BACKPACK & BUDGET: A KOALA'S PACE IN THE LAND DOWN UNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the past five years a budget transportation-accommodation service known as 
Kiwi Experience has been a success in New Zealand. A similar service, called Oz 
Experience, will begin operating along the east coast of Australia Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oz Experience is designed to provide flexible bus transportation and 
economical accommodation suitable for backpackers and independent budget 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The service allows travelers to move at a leisurely pace taking time to see 
and do things along the way. The three passes mentioned below are valid for up 
to six months. Bus passes for shorter segments of these routes will be 
available by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruce Pass costs $218 and is valid for travel from Sydney up Australia's 
east coast to Cairns. You could travel it in a minimum of 10 days, if pressed 
for time. 
</P>
<P>
 Oz Experience guarantees at least three departures a week throughout its 
network, so customers can move at the pace they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the route stops are made for adventure activities such as canoe trips, 
surfing, hot-air ballooning, camel trekking, snorkeling, bungee jumping, tandem 
sky diving and white-water rafting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible to purchase accommodations with your transportation pass. 
With the Bruce pass, accommodations for 12 nights would cost $136.  
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to stretch the trip out, you can just pay for the additional 
nights of lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodation is at lodges and backpacker hostels. Each hostel lodges four to 
six to a room. However, many of the hostels have double rooms. Upon arrival, 
travelers may move up to a double by paying an additional $4 to $6 per person, 
per night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cobber pass, valid for travel from Cairns to Sydney, costs $167. The 
minimum time you'll need to make the journey is seven days. A package of nine 
nights' lodging costs $105. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boomerang pass, valid from Sydney to Cairns and back, costs $339. The 
minimum time it would take to complete the journey is 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
 An accommodation pack for 19 nights costs an additional $192. 
</P>
<P>
 For further details, contact Oz Experience, Ocean World, West Esplanade, Manly 
2095, Sydney, NSW, Australia 2095, telephone 011-61-2-977-2688. 
</P>
<P>
 Another very helpful tool for planning an Australian adventure is the 
comprehensive, free publication, Destination Australia. The 1994-95 edition is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The 136-page magazine includes details on where to go, what to see and how to 
do it, with maps. Its accommodation listings range from hotels to hostels and 
campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For a free copy of Destination Australia, contact the Australian Tourist 
Commission at (800) 333-0262.

CANAL CORRECTION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I, too, have made the passage through the Panama Canal and I enjoyed the 
article ("Rite of Passage, Sept. 18), but I would like to correct a statement 
(in the accompanying illustration) that water is pumped into the lock.The 
marvel of the canal is that there are no pumps; it is operated on gravity flow 
through valves that are opened to allow the stored water from the man-made lake 
to fill the locks from openings in the bottom of the locks and continue on its 
way to the ocean.

 I applaud your candid summary of the Michelin Green Guide to California

RAFT WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I feel compelled to add my voice to "Rapid Transit" (Weekend Escape, Sept. 
11). 
</P>
<P>
 My then-15-year-old son, Matt, and I went rafting on the American River 
several years ago.We, too, were told to float feet-first, hold on to the oar 
and remain calm if we fell in. We did indeed fall in! Your readers need to know 
that this can be truly treacherous. Not only can you not float feet-first 
because you are so disoriented, grasping the oar is also nearly impossible.  
</P>
<P>
 Matt and I will never forget "Satan's Cesspool" as our fall-in rapid was aptly 
named. Nor will Tony, a friend who hit his hand on a rock and permanently 
disfigured his finger. It's serious business on a raft -- not all fun and 
games.

TRYING TO TELL THE NEWS FROM THE PSEUDO-NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marvin Kalb, Marvin Kalb is a visiting professor of press and public policy 
at George Washington University. He was chief diplomatic correspondent for CBS 
and NBC. His new book, The Nixon Memo, will be published this month by 
University of Chicago Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Larry King a journalist? Is Ted Koppel a talk-show host? Is there any 
difference between the two? 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the answer to the first question was "no;" the answer to the 
second equally "no," and to the third a resounding "yes." King was unmistakably 
the king of talk, but no one expects him to do a stand-upper on arms control 
from the State Department. Koppel was the journalist, who covered wars, 
politics and diplomacy for ABC News before the Ayatollah Khomeini launched the 
Iran hostage crisis in 1979 and -- unwittingly -- the exceptional "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nothing is what it seems. Suddenly, after radical changes in technology 
and journalistic norms, there is a disturbing blurring of the line between news 
and entertainment, between reporting and editorializing, between fact and 
opinion, between "old" and "new" media -- between Koppel and King. The result 
is confusion in the news room and the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do people get their news? Indeed, how do they even define news ? These 
are not rhetorical questions, for in this age of television, in which image is 
sovereign and perception is reality, answers are increasingly elusive. As we 
approach the 500-channel world, the old news guidelines for determining what's 
important and reliable grow ever more fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS anchor Walter Cronkite used to be enough -- "the most trusted man in 
America," he was called. But now, bewilderingly, there are hundreds of sources 
-- from traditional news shows to call-in talk shows, from electronic town 
meetings to faxes, 800- and 900-numbers and on-line bulletin boards, from 
"Capitol Gang" and "Meet The Press" to religion programs that mix faith with 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this avalanche of information newspapers and tabloids, magazines and 
newsletters. You can see that the difficulty of distinguishing real from fake 
has become almost insurmountable. "News" may be news, but it may also be 
gossip, half-truth, outlandish fiction, scandal or sensational and 
unsubstantiated tidbits, masquerading as "news." News is no longer an easily 
definable commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 More Americans get their print "news" from People Magazine, the National 
Enquirer or the Star tabloid than they do from, say, the Los Angeles Times, the 
New York Times or the Washington Post? On television, according to one recent 
focus group, people say they get their "news" or "information" from such 
programs as "Hard Copy" and "Rescue 911" rather than the three networks' 
evening news shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, according to a Roper Organization poll, 50% of Americans learned 
about their country and the world from the evening news shows on TV. By 1991, 
81% got their "news" from television -- but no longer from the network news. 
Instead, they turn to the glossy pseudo-news programs or mercurial talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 This is crucially important, because the standards of journalism on these 
pseudo-news shows or a talk show, even a serious one, are substantially 
different from standards applied in a traditional news program or newspaper. 
Instead of two sources, a talk show may go with only one source -- or none, 
prefacing items with, "The rumor is." Responsible print journalists do not pay 
for news, and, as a rule, neither do responsible broadcast journalists; and 
they are careful about checking facts or fronting for special interests. Not so 
for the new "media," where proper standards are only regarded as obstacles to 
bigger headlines and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, what's news? When President Bill Clinton appears on "Larry King Live" 
and answers questions about foreign policy, he may well end up making news -- 
the kind that is spread on the front page of the next day's newspapers. Does 
that mean "Larry King Live" is a news program, and King is a journalist? After 
all, King did participate in the time-honored process of news-gathering. He 
asked the questions that produced the headlines. So why not? As King told a 
recent group, "I guess you could say I'm now a journalist." Or, as his boss at 
CNN, Ted Turner, jokingly told the National Press Club, "I'm a 
quasi-journalist." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, even as the status of journalists plummets in popular esteem -- 
according to one poll, only 15% of the American people have "confidence" in the 
press -- many non-journalists display an interest in joining the priesthood of 
journalism, presumably to enjoy its power and privileges as well as its obvious 
notoriety. Even Ross Perot, the zany billionaire, has brought his Texas twang 
to talk radio. The editor of Talkers Magazine, says that in the past decade or 
so the number of talk-radio stations has risen from 250 to 1,000, and the 
number of talk shows to 8,000. Seventy percent of the hosts are identified as 
"conservatives." Enter Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk radio, though it has been around for decades, erupted as a powerful force 
in American culture and politics only in recent years. It has now become the 
hottest spot on the dial, a place where opinion gallivants as fact and 
fast-talking hucksters can attract everyone from Clinton to Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to answer questions from a cynical, frustrated 
populace. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard, almost impossible, for even the most intelligent listener to 
recognize fact as fact and news as news. It all sounds the same -- especially 
when interviewees are such distinguished people. Why does Clinton go on Don 
Imus' show? Because Imus, among other hosts, can popularize a Clinton theme or 
clog up the Capitol Hill switchboard with thousands of angry calls. He can no 
longer be ignored. He has real power and is using it -- in the process, pushing 
the traditional journalist to one side and denigrating journalism to an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Can journalism ever recover its former authority? Can a new Cronkite emerge in 
today's world of rip-and-slash competition in TV news? Can "news" once again be 
news -- easily identifiable? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps -- but it will require a monumental struggle, and the outcome is far 
from assured. Journalistic ethics have crumbled, along with medical and legal 
ethics, as popular confidence in the major institutions of American life has 
taken a nose dive. Meanwhile, what is needed is a new commitment to honest, 
old-fashioned journalism -- and to courage. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Gennifer Flowers story first broke in a supermarket tabloid and 
"Nightline," without any independent reporting, went with the story -- thereby 
lending it a large measure of legitimacy -- editors and anchors of Nation 
Public Radio's "All Things Considered," like so many other journalists, 
wondered whether they, too, should go with the story. A producer argued that 
the Flowers story was, after all, "out there." Yes, anchor Linda Wertheimer 
responded, "But that doesn't mean it has to be in here."

L.A.'S JEWISH COMMUNITY LOOKS INWARD FOR ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

fellow at the Center for the New West and international fellow at Pepperdine

<P>
 When Stanley Treitel was growing up four decades ago, Fairfax Avenue was the 
center of Los Angeles' Jewish world. But as he walks down the avenue today, he 
sees just another urban strip in decay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had these vacancies, this graffiti, until the last three or four 
years," Treitel says. "People are down, people are economically down. They feel 
if the graffiti is taken off today, it'll be back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the graffiti marks the spot of an abandoned or declining business, 
of which there are many between Beverly and Melrose, the heart of the Fairfax 
District. Second- and third-generation Jews who own businesses are barely 
surviving because their clientele is either aging or has moved elsewhere. The 
children who continue to run family concerns seem to care less and less about 
keeping the enterprise going. What economic vitality there is on Fairfax is 
traceable to recent Jewish immigrants, mostly Israeli and Iranian. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it may be the immigrant who now represents the most dynamic economic 
element in the Jewish community. Persian, Israeli and North African Jews have 
become players in the Downtown garment and jewelry districts, replacing earlier 
generations of East Europeans. Similarly, in contrast to Fairfax's decay, there 
is a plethora of Israeli- and Persian-owned businesses in retail districts 
along Pico and Ventura boulevards. Russian entrepreneurs are the economic 
engines along Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in many ways, Fairfax's fate raises the distinct prospect of decline in 
what is one of Judaism's wealthiest and most powerful communities. Long a 
dominant force in entertainment, the garment industry, the artistic and 
political life of Southern California, the Jewish community faces a difficult 
period of change in the increasingly multicultural reality that is Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of this change is a weakening embrace of the liberalism at the 
heart of New Deal coalition politics, which has characterized much of Los 
Angeles Jewry. It is also a turning inward, toward a deeper spirituality and 
interest in the social health of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 This change, in part, is the product of demographic trends. After rapid growth 
in the first two decades following World War II, the Jewish population in the 
county has plateaued at about 500,000, according to studies conducted by the 
L.A. Jewish Federation. If immigration from overseas had not occurred, it would 
almost certainly have declined during the past decade. The most severe 
population losses are in Beverlywood and Fairfax, the traditional centers of 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 This decline in numbers coincides with the lessening urgency of the three 
obsessions that have dominated the diaspora for 50 years -- the preservation of 
Israel, the building of Holocaust monuments and the maintenance of the New Deal 
liberal coalition. At the same time, mainstream Jewish politics seems 
increasingly unresponsive to the challenges of ethnic survival in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither strong community institutions, an affluent business elite or such 
powerful Jewish politicians as Rep. Henry A. Waxman and Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, for example, seem willing to tackle the decay of neighborhoods 
like Fairfax. "No one takes responsibility for the street anymore," laments 
Treitel, who headed a briefly successful Fairfax revitalization campaign in the 
1980s. "There's a lack of commitment on the part of the merchants and the 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The rethinking among Jews in Los Angeles is, in large part, driven by the 
changing interests of younger, working Jewish families. Much of the Jewish 
Establishment here traditionally supported the liberal causes of busing and 
affirmative action. One result of these policies, however, has been "conscious 
leveling" in public schools, according to the Anti-Defamation League's David 
Lehrer. The once highly regarded Fairfax High School, for example, has suffered 
under a doctrinaire multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any one factor, decreasing confidence in public schools is pushing 
many of the younger Jewish families northward to Calabasas and the Conejo 
Valley in Ventura County, whose public schools have top-quality reputations. At 
the same time, Jews who remain here are choosing private non-denominational or 
"Hebrew day schools" to educate their children. Two decades ago, there were 
hardly any such Jewish parochial institutions. Today, the Jewish Federation 
estimates there are more than 30, with a rising student enrollment that tops 
8,000, about twice the number of pupils 10 years ago. Even the most powerful 
mainstream temples are either planning or are already building new and ever 
more elaborate full-time schools to keep their younger families in their 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another powerful force behind changing Jewish attitudes is deepening anxieties 
about crime. "There's a greater perception of crime than ever before among 
Jews," says Alan Fisher, a political scientist at California State University, 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher contends that worries over escalating crime are accelerating the 
community's gradual drift away from traditional liberalism, particularly among 
younger Jewish voters. After studying Jewish voting patterns nationwide, he 
estimates that under-30 Jewish voters are roughly 10% more likely to vote 
Republican than their predecessors. Other growing blocs of Jewish voters, 
notably Orthodox and recent immigrants, who make up at least one-fifth of Los 
Angeles' Jewry, are also more rightward-looking than their American-born 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it would be a mistake to see the altering currents of Jewish opinion as 
merely a reaction to negative events. The improved peace prospects for Israel, 
the fading of Holocaust memory and shifting urban realities have all prompted a 
growing emphasis on building self-sustaining community structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jewish life has to go beyond politics," says UCLA Hillel's rabbi Chaim 
Seidler Feller. "The structure of the community has been too much on politics. 
The Jews have become like a political party. The culture of spirit has been 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nothing better illustrates this resurgent "culture of spirit" than 
construction, using donated labor and funding from mostly immigrant-run 
businesses, of a $2-million temple in West Hollywood for Los Angeles' 
approximately 30,000 Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Unions. "It's the 
first expression of freedom that they built their own synagogue," says Chabad 
rabbi Naftoli Estulin, who for 20 years practiced underground in Russia under 
communism. "The Russian Jews -- they don't know anything, they're ignorant, 
they had no schools or synagogues, but their feeling for God and for Judaism is 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally notable has been the growth of the Iranian Jewish community, which 
numbers about 30,000 in Los Angeles, the largest such concentration in the 
world, including Tehran. Iranians in the San Fernando Valley have built a large 
cultural center and plan to build a new day school near the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We follow each other because we came to L.A. and then saw our relatives come 
after us -- that's why we gather here," explains Ruben Dokhanian, one of the 
elders at Eretz Cultural Center. "We like and love to be together, to work 
together and this building (the center) is a sign of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But this new spirit is not only found among immigrants. The influence of 
synagogues is spreading to even distant suburbs, where Jewish migration has 
been growing rapidly. Temples like Etz Chaim, in the Ventura County community 
of Thousand Oaks, have doubled in size in 10 years. Serving more than 700 
families, it supports Israel as both ancestral homeland and source of cultural 
guidance, but focuses on family, community and related religious issues. Many 
of its members are converts, usually spouses of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our identity -- the synagogue in the suburbs," notes Etz Chaim's 
rabbi, Shimon Paskow. "You don't have a Jewish neighborhood. There's no Fairfax 
or lower East Side as they had in New York, so this is where you identify as a 
Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of grass-roots "edge city" congregations such as Etz Chaim, as well 
as the spiritual and economic dynamism of recent immigrants, may well represent 
the best hope of revitalizing the Los Angeles diaspora. In many ways, it 
expresses among Jews the same search for values and focus on self-help that 
have propelled the spectacular growth of some Protestant sects and the Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
 This revival is critical not only for Jews, but also for cosmopolitan urban 
regions like Southern California. As a distinct community, Jews have 
contributed a particular kind of economic innovativeness to the region -- from 
the pioneer merchants of Downtown Los Angeles to the founders of Hollywood, 
from the garment industry to today's growing Jewish immigrant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews come here and they want to start a business that hasn't been developed," 
says Ann Volokh, who came to Los Angeles from Kiev in 1975 and now publishes 
Movieline, the nation's second-largest film monthly. "There is this special 
entrepreneurial vein in Jews that is part of that heritage and part of our 
history. You have to come to a new place and start new. And we've been doing it 
so long, we started doing it well." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when middle-class flight should be a concern to business and 
politicians of all ethnic groups, the preservation of a strong Jewish community 
could contribute to making Southern California's transformation into a 
multicultural metropolis a successful one. This should be a top priority for 
L.A.'s Jews, for whom this region has long served as a most congenial promised 
land.

BACK TO BASICS ON HEALTH CARE; WHEN WE RESUME THE BATTLE NEXT YEAR, THE NATION 
MUST REMEMBER WHY REFORM WAS NEEDED IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By now you've read all the convoluted reasons health-care reform officially 
died for 1994. It's because Harry and Louise were more believable than that 
other fun couple, Hillary (Rodham Clinton) and Ira (C. Magaziner). It's because 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) makes Haitian Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
seem like a reasonable guy. It's because Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) was 
caught giving away official chairs. It's because voters want change but only if 
nothing is different. It's because President Bill Clinton got distracted by 
events in Lower Koda-Chromistan and the crisis over amphibian rights. And so on 
and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the most important factor has been missed in last week's zillions of 
words of commentary. This reason is the simplest: All parties lost sight of why 
health-care reform was needed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two underlying reasons for significant reform of the health-care 
system. One is the moral imperative of universal coverage: both to protect the 
37 million Americans who lack health insurance, and to guarantee that those who 
have insurance don't lose it if they change jobs. The second reason is the U.S. 
approach to health care costs too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this year's debate, the U.S. health-care system has been variously 
portrayed by the Hillary Clinton faction as falling apart at the seams, by the 
Dole faction as totally peachy-keen. Both views diverge from the clinical 
reality. In terms of quality, American health care is ab-fab (absolutely 
fabulous, if you missed this summer's slang). But not everybody qualifies, and 
for those who do, the price is too high -- 14% of U.S. gross domestic product 
vs. 9% to 10% in countries like France and Switzerland, which offer just as 
much high-tech care, yet insure everyone at lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst flaw of the President's plan was that rather than offer a simple 
system of cost controls specified by the federal government but carried out by 
the private sector, Clinton would have created multiple new bureaucracies to 
attack the wrong question in health care. The bureaucracies would have gone 
after care delivery -- generally, the ab-fab part of the system -- while 
skirting the core problem, the price of care. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate progressed, the White House abandoned cost controls, putting its 
energies behind what were, in effect, new taxes (the "employer mandate") on the 
assumption that since health costs can never come down, universal coverage 
means spending must go up, and for that, somebody must pay. 
</P>
<P>
 This represents at once a spectacular misreading of public sentiment on taxes 
and of proven ideas that have worked in countries with high-tech universal care 
at reasonable prices. Focusing on universal coverage and lower costs could have 
allowed a far more intelligent, politically appealing reform proposal to emerge 
and be enacted last year. But first, let's look at the lessons learned from the 
health-care collapse: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't propose 1,400-page ideas. The initial Hillary Clinton-Magaziner 
package was so overwrought with mandates and formulas that, from the moment the 
forklift lowered it to the President's desk, there existed zero chance it could 
be enacted. Whatever health plan rises from this year's ashes must be simple, 
focusing on the two things that matter -- universal coverage and cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington should mandate goals, but leave the details to the people in the 
field. In the Clinton plan, hundreds of pages of details were supposed to 
micromanage every aspect of hospital and physician life. Give it up! Next 
year's health-reform plan must take the federalist approach of setting a few 
vital goals but leaving doctors, hospital administrators and other 
professionals to achieve those goals using superior knowledge of what happens 
in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget the Medicare magic asterisk. Both Democratic and GOP alternatives to 
the Clinton plan seemed nice in that they imposed no new taxes, but lacking 
cost controls sought to finance themselves in a preposterous way -- by assuming 
unspecified future cuts in Medicare spending. But in the past decade, typical 
Medicare fees paid to doctors and hospitals have already declined to about 60% 
of typical private-pay fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than cutting Medicare, health-care reform ought to drive private-pay 
fees toward the Medicare level. It is important to note that about 60% of the 
U.S. private-pay level is about where medical fees in France and Germany now 
sit. At this level, doctors still are affluent, but social costs for health 
care are within reason and universal care is affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get business on board. This seems impossible to believe a mere year later, 
but at the outset of the Clinton proposals, most big business supported health 
reform -- its eyes focused on the fact that the price of U.S. health care is 
too high. But when Hillary's faction became wedded to new taxes on employers 
and new layers of bureaucracy, the Fortune 500 jumped ship. This group must be 
back on board well before the next sailing time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut the fat, not the lean. Though well-intentioned, the Clinton plan 
contained one deeply cynical aspect. Because the White House was terrified of 
proposing the fee-setting system that has restrained medical prices in Western 
Europe, the Administration offered up limits on total regional spending 
("global budgets") and on how much insurers could charge policyholders. But if 
fees by doctors and hospitals stay high while the total pool of money to be 
spent is capped, what is the only way health costs can be restrained? 
Rationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Clinton's plan passed, most Americans would have been compelled to join 
HMOs, which, in turn, would have been compelled to ration care -- with the 
blame then seeming to fall on the HMOs. It would be far better for Washington 
to take the blame for a simple system of setting medical fees that would 
control costs through lower prices, not rationing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go after the insurers, not the docs and the druggists. For reasons that 
escape everyone, Hillary Clinton and Magaziner decided early on to attack 
physicians (who may charge too much but who night and day do genuine work of 
lasting value) and pharmaceutical companies (whose products may be overpriced 
but save thousands of lives annually) while making nicey-nicey with health 
insurers (who are, at best, paper shufflers). 
</P>
<P>
 This weird strategy imploded when the insurance lobby, knowing itself to be 
the most featherbedded medical sector, merrily stabbed the White House in the 
back. The Health Insurance Assn. of America, sponsor of those simpleton Harry 
and Louise ads, became the new National Rifle Assn., brazenly distorting the 
Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * The docs were moving forward while everybody else peddled back. Through the 
closing months of the health-care debate, only one major interest group said 
anything that did not serve its own financial interest -- the doctors. The AMA 
warmly endorsed universal care and signaled to the White House it would accept 
some restrictions on fees in return for malpractice revisions and dropping the 
plan's micromanagement aspect. Somehow, it went unnoticed when, in February, 
the American College of Surgeons -- representing the best-paid doctors -- 
endorsed a Canadian-style "single-payer" system. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the leading surgeons' group endorse the Canadian approach? Because 
Canadian medicine (and the similar French, German and Swiss systems) offers 
realistic prices, free choice of private practitioners, traditional 
fee-for-service arrangements, high-tech care and physician autonomy -- which to 
the surgeons sounds like a pretty good combination. It is -- and it ought to be 
the focus of next year's plan. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose next year's health-care package did these things: achieved universal 
coverage by abolishing Medicaid, a monstrously complicated, state-run, 
federally financed program that doesn't work, then making everyone not covered 
by a private health plan eligible for Medicare, a sensible, privately run, 
federally financed program that does work; made private insurance accessible at 
lower-cost by imposing standard benefit packages sold to all at uniform 
premiums, regardless of "pre-existing conditions;" required employers either to 
provide standard plans or pay the equivalent cost per worker into Medicare 
support; created a National Health Board, run by doctors, hospital executives 
and neutral parties, that cuts the fees physicians, hospitals and drug 
companies may charge, and otherwise left medicine alone. No big bureaucracy; 
doctors remain private practitioners, patients retain choice over who treats 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like wishful thinking? This is basically a description of medicine as 
organized in Germany, the former Western part. German medicine, covering 100% 
of citizens plus all illegal immigrants, costs $1,750 per capita; U.S. 
medicine, covering only 85% of the legal population, costs $3,000 per capita. 
German medicine employs the same technology as U.S. medicine and is delivered 
on-demand, without the queues that plague the English system. German medicine 
offers more hospital beds per capita than the United States, an important 
measure of on-demand capacity; average hospital stays are longer in Germany 
than in the United States, because lower costs mean there is no need for the 
American philosophy of rocket-propelled discharge. Life expectancies, infant 
mortality and other measures of health-care success in Germany are the same as, 
or slightly better than, in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, German doctors work for themselves, not government; insurers are 
private. They do about the same number and type of procedures as U.S. doctors, 
but following federal fee schedules, simply charge less. Because fees and 
insurance provisions are standard, doctors can practice without endless hassles 
regarding paperwork. Because paperwork burdens are few, doctors can earn 
handsome livings from lower fees, as they need not subsidize huge accounting 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Germany do it? The key is federally set fee schedules for health-care 
providers. Government sets the fees, using a surprisingly small bureaucracy: 
The private sector does everything else -- from selling reasonably standardized 
insurance policies to running the hospitals and doctor's offices. German 
medicine, covering everyone, costs slightly less than 10% of GDP, versus about 
14.2% in the United States. Physicians in (West) Germany still are well-paid, 
averaging $110,000 annually, around three-quarters of what U.S. physicians 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose U.S. health spending were reduced, mainly through federally set fee 
schedules, halfway to the level of German spending: declining to about 12% of 
GDP, which would still leave U.S. medicine the world's most expensive. This 
would save a phenomenal $130 billion per year -- more than enough to pay for 
universal coverage; to expand coverage for mental illness and long-term care, 
and still leave the U.S. system less expensive than today. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to the U.S. health-care dilemma is not more bureaucracy and 
taxes, as Clinton proposed, nor pretending that no problem exists, as the 
Republican obstructionists say. The solution is what works in Germany, France 
and Switzerland: federally set reductions in medical fees combined with 
universal coverage. A bill to accomplish this in the United States would run 
far less than 1,400 pages.

CHANGING JAPANESE POLITICS, NOT TRADE, IS GREATEST THREAT TO U.S.-JAPAN 
RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Norman D. Levin, Norman D. Levin, a senior analyst at RAND, served on the 
State Department's policy planning staff from 1984-87. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever the eventual outcome of the "framework talks" on trade between Japan 
and the United States, agreement or sanctions, it will have little effect on 
the political fortunes of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's ruling coalition 
or on the short-term course of Japanese politics. In the long term, however, 
relations could be damaged by underlying political trends in Japan reinforced 
by the way the Clinton Administration has handled the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the game in Japan today is not policy but political power and 
survival. Few things illustrate this more than the union of the leftist 
Socialist Party with its longtime nemesis, the conservative Liberal Democratic 
Party, to form a surprisingly solid government. The continuing efforts of the 
other major parties to merge into a "New New Party" reflects the opposition's 
need to offset the coalition's formidable political strength. While there are 
differences both between and within the various political groupings on issues 
like taxes and policy toward Korea, they, on the whole, have not been drivers 
of political affiliation. Certainly, trade policy is not a defining issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround by the Socialists on virtually every major political issue has 
undercut the opposition's ability to mount an effective challenge. Even if 
policy differences were a more formative factor in party affiliation, the 
Socialists have defused the disagreements by renouncing their previous 
positions and embracing the goals of former "reformist" governments. Whether on 
trade, nuclear power or national-security, the Socialist-led government is 
nearly indistinguishable from its predecessors. This has made it difficult for 
opposition parties to criticize it, since they would, in effect, be criticizing 
themselves. It also has contributed to a sharp rise in support for the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese public, furthermore, is tired of U.S. hectoring on trade issues 
and its threats to "retaliate" against Japan with economic sanctions. Far from 
constituting pressure for change in Japanese trade policies, the public mood in 
Japan today is a mixture of confidence and resignation: confidence that Japan 
can survive any punitive measures the United States might impose, and 
resignation that a standoff may be unavoidable if Japan is ever going to end 
U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 This mood means that the coalition government will neither benefit much from a 
negotiated agreement nor suffer greatly from a breakdown in talks. It also 
means the government will be under no significant pressure to lash out against 
potentially harsh U.S. measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news buried in these political trends is that we are not likely to 
see a rupture in the broader U.S.-Japan relationship -- at least not one that 
is precipitated by Japan. Japanese political leaders have their hands full 
coping with their domestic situation. The sharply polarized Japanese politics 
of recent times has given way to one characterized by a large, new "middle" 
ground that, while subsuming important policy differences, shares fundamental 
values and national objectives. Most significant, as reflected in the 
transformation of the Socialist Party, a broad consensus now exists in Japan on 
the importance of the United States to Japanese national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that the ground is shifting. For one thing, the framework 
negotiations have seriously eroded mutual trust and respect. The Clinton 
Administration's insistence on "objective criteria," by which to measure 
Japanese faithfulness in honoring their commitments, has been particularly 
corrosive. This has fostered greater agreement among Japanese leaders that, 
while ties with the United States remain critical, Japan must do more to 
develop other dimensions of its foreign policy. The pronounced emphasis on Asia 
in recent Japanese diplomacy is one early product of this shift in thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally worrisome is the development of a new political equation in Japan. In 
the past, the priority was to accommodate U.S. wishes. Today, a willingness to 
stand up to Washington is becoming the measure of political leadership. This 
change could literally blow the U.S.-Japan relationship apart if a really 
serious issue -- like responding to North Korea's continuing nuclear program -- 
became the vehicle for demonstrating Japan's toughness. Already, Japanese 
financial support for U.S. military bases in Japan has become a political 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate danger, however, comes not from any specific act by one or 
the other country. Rather, it comes from the growing indifference of each to 
the other as a result of the domestic preoccupations of the two countries' 
leaderships. In a sense, each side is becoming impervious to the other. Left 
unchecked, the result will almost surely be increasing distance -- not so much 
a "pulling" as a "drifting" apart that undermines a sense of common interests.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; IS YOUTHFUL IDEALISM DEAD IN THE '90S? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WU, Amy Wu is a junior at New York University majoring in American 
History. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The road to AmeriCorps, President Bill Clinton's national-service program, 
begins with an invitation to embark on a journey to help fellow citizens, to 
better the community, to change the world. I was tempted to apply for a less 
noble reason -- I wanted the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the days when idealistic young people got down and dirty because they 
wanted to change the world? These days, money means more to college students 
than making a difference. National service is self-service. 
</P>
<P>
 My roommate at New York University flipped on a calculator and figured that 
AmeriCorps wasn't worth her time -- $2,100 a year for three years, followed by 
$2,363 in tuition grants. A young man with cornrow braids bragged he could make 
$5,000 bagging groceries in one year. A young woman said that the 900 required 
hours were too many. 
</P>
<P>
 The applications that flowed into AmeriCorps at the 11th hour did not mark an 
outpouring of do-goodism. For applicants, it was the money, an admirable entry 
on their resume, work experience or a stepping stone to a career. 
</P>
<P>
 How important was the money? A college nearby with an AmeriCorps program 
didn't offer students a living stipend; getting kids to apply was like pulling 
teeth. At NYU, the money made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 It's said that today's young people have to be bribed to be genuine. On a 
recent afternoon, I ventured into the NYU student lounge and chatted with young 
people about the President's program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were enthusiastic when I told them about the money, but their excitement 
waned when they heard about the three-year, 900-hour requirement. "Isn't that 
like joining the army?" one kid asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some frowned when they heard about helping inner-city high school students. 
"They can't pay me enough to do that," a young woman said bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're 18 or 19 years old, you live in a world without consequences. 
Commitment is frightening, especially if you're doing it more for the money 
than making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 I was tempted to apply because it sounded exciting, kind of like a trip to the 
moon. I asked myself what was in it for me. I was haunted by what a classmate 
had said after I had chastised him for applying just for the money: "Our whole 
society is based on money; you have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, my hopes, along with the application, went into the dump, and I 
was left to wonder what national service would really accomplish, and who would 
benefit. It seems the President's program was made for the wrong generation.

CABINET FOLLIES: NO ESCAPE ONCE A SCANDAL IS DECLARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news for President Bill Clinton on the scandal front is that the 
noise of Haiti and the visit of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin have -- for 
now -- almost drowned out the persistent whispers of Whitewater. The bad news 
is that two of the President's Cabinet officers are under simultaneous criminal 
investigation -- with the gossip predicting that they're not long for this 
political world. 
</P>
<P>
 This embarrassment comes at an awkward time. Clinton has just 
not-fired-but-begun-easing-out Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers; the candidate who 
promised an Administration that looked like America is ending up with a male 
inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Cabinet officials under investigation are Mike Espy, secretary 
of agriculture, who is accused of taking favors from business interests and 
misappropriating government travel funds; and Henry G. Cisneros, secretary of 
housing and urban development, said to have lied to investigators during his 
confirmation process. They are two of the Cabinet's minority-group members. A 
third, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, was recently cleared of charges that 
he had improperly received money from a Vietnamese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton came to office proclaiming his enthusiasm for this process of 
purifying government. By now he has doubtless decided that he'd settle for a 
little less public moralism and a little more sense of proportion. Yet, there 
is not much Clinton can do to stop these scandals from running their loud, 
protracted course. 
</P>
<P>
 When a political figure gets into trouble, there's no way for the public or 
journalists or other politicians to say, "You did something arrogant; pay back 
the money, accept your loss of clout, get on with your job," or declare, "You 
have acted stupidly, but you've already paid your penalty in public 
embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the scandal system has only one gear. It insists on treating all 
official misbehavior as potentially criminal. If the wrongdoing is found not to 
be criminal, the politician who perpetrated it will call the result moral 
exoneration. Meanwhile, the whole process soaks up every piece of available 
political attention and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 We're doing it again. The Espy case is sleazy, while the Cisneros story is 
tragic. Yet, from what we know about them now, a full-dress criminal probe does 
not look like the right way to deal with either one. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two at risk, Espy has the more conventional troubles. He was a 
Mississippi congressman before his appointment. He travels constantly and has 
what some call a frenetic operating style. He has not made a lot of friends in 
the Agriculture Department's bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, there appeared a story about how he had accepted various gifts from 
Tyson Foods, a Friend-of-Bill Arkansas company whose chicken-processing plants 
are inspected by the Agriculture Department. Then the list began to grow: Espy 
had gotten a basketball-game ticket from a cereal company. He gave 
extraordinary access to a friend who worked for a food conglomerate. His travel 
managed to include a stop in his home town about once a month and, for a while, 
the government paid to lease a Jeep that he left at the local airport. Once, it 
is said, he drove the Jeep back to Washington but charged the government for a 
return-flight ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the alleged misuse of government funds, there have also been 
suggestions that Espy went easy on some he got goodies from: that he was not 
tough enough on poultry inspections and also supported a boondoggle of a 
program benefiting business friends. 
</P>
<P>
 No one says he threw an Agriculture Department decision in return for a bribe. 
But current law is clear in this area. Espy is a high Clinton Administration 
official under the Ethics in Government Act, and the attorney general must ask 
the courts to appoint an independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has done her duty. Espy's independent counsel, attorney 
David C. Smaltz, seems like a fair-minded man. But he says he will run a 
suitably broad investigation, not limited to the public charges or to Espy 
himself. He notes that Espy paid back money to the government and corporations 
to erase the "appearance of impropriety" -- but points out repayment does not 
erase criminal guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Smaltz has noticed that the secretary might be subject to stricter 
criminal standards than other government officials, because of the special 
statute governing meat inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 So you can tell this one will take a long time, during which Espy will walk 
around with that special vulnerability to trouble that marks an official whose 
scandal-immune system has been breached. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Cisneros will undoubtedly be shorter. In the late 1980s, 
when he was mayor of San Antonio, Tex., he left office after a scandal over his 
affair with fund-raiser Linda Medlar. Medlar's husband divorced her and, 
because of the affair, she could not get work in her field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros gave Medlar a lot of financial help until 1993 -- when, he says, his 
appointment as HUD secretary made for a steep drop in his income. Now, she is 
suing him, claiming he had agreed to keep paying her until she got a suitable 
job or her teen-age daughter was grown. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Medlar secretly taped some 40 hours of her phone 
conversations with Cisneros. She sold some to the TV show "Inside Edition." 
Then she let loose with the claim that Cisneros had lied to the FBI during 
their preconfirmation investigation of him about how much he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes do not prove Medlar's charge, but do reveal another problem: To help 
her, Cisneros had asked a San Antonio man he knew, a real-estate dealer and 
Democratic fund raiser, to try to get Medlar a job. The man gave Medlar money 
-- as a loan, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros says he is not aware of any business this gentleman has with HUD. But 
who knows? The Justice Department is investigating. Because, by law, this 
investigation must end in a decision as to whether to appoint yet another 
independent counsel, everyone is watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Even partisans who get a kick out of the Administration's ethics troubles are 
staying away from this. But today's scandal system does not allow charges to 
surface, explode and die: We have decreed that cover-up can be more serious 
than the original sins alleged, so dig we must. While the excavation goes on, 
there is plenty of time for yet other charges to come crawling out of their 
fetid swamp. 
</P>
<P>
 When the office of the independent counsel was established, it was part of a 
broadly held passion in government and the press to root out even the 
appearance of impropriety in public life. To some extent, that passion is 
exhausting itself. But it will be slow to subside to civilized levels while 
post-Watergate institutions, with their constant suggestion of criminality, 
force us to rivet our eyes on misdeeds that may be tawdry or grossly imprudent 
but do not deserve the clang of the cell door swinging shut. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll just have to wait this one out.

IS ANOTHER VIETNAM RISING IN CAMBODIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marvin Ott, Marvin Ott specializes in Asian security issues at the National 
War College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the world's attention riveted on Haiti and Bosnia, the United States has 
crossed a foreign-policy Rubicon in Indochina. The Clinton Administration has 
quietly agreed to a Cambodian request for defense assistance and dispatched 
about 45 military advisers to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine an initiative that raises more specters. Are we about to 
become embroiled in a new Indochina conflict even as we continue to try to 
account for the casualties of the last one? 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Phnom Penh was a ghost town. The killing fields had claimed 
nearly a quarter of the country's population. With good reason, many Cambodians 
felt they had been cursed by the gods and abandoned by the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the capital city is alive with activity. Shops are stocked, children 
are in school, restaurants and food stalls are busy, foreign businessmen are 
exploring investment opportunities and traffic jams are becoming a problem. 
There are few signs of the classic development pathologies -- limos pushing 
bicycles to the side of the road, beggars, filth, large, walled mansions 
adjacent to shanty towns and environmental abuses. Much of the same, though on 
a reduced scale, can be said of the country's major provincial towns. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is unfolding against the backdrop of a political transformation: 
successful national elections, conducted by the United Nations, and the 
establishment of a coalition government presided over by an ultimate survivor 
and national symbol -- King Norodom Sihanouk. The Parliament has emerged as an 
arena for remarkably open debates. The press is passably free. And an active 
Cambodian human-rights organization keeps nipping at the government's heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, a great many Cambodians are fearful. Serious human-rights abuses by some 
provincial authorities go unpunished and unchecked. A recent coup attempt 
highlights the fragility of the new political order. Four months ago, a Khmer 
Rouge force expelled a disorganized Cambodian army from the provincial town of 
Pailin. After this debacle, a final attempt to reach a political settlement 
between the new government and the Khmer Rouge collapsed. Parliament put its 
seal on the outcome by voting to formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, this is good news. A debilitating illusion -- that the Khmer 
Rouge can somehow be accommodated in a political settlement -- has long 
hampered prospects for a resolution of the Cambodia problem. The same small 
coterie of secretive fanatics who created the killing fields of Cambodia still 
lead the Khmer Rouge. The men and the agenda remain the same: to achieve total 
power and to liquidate everything and everyone in Cambodia that might resist 
the communization of the country. The Cambodian government now seems to 
understand that there can be only one solution with two variants: the 
elimination of the Khmer Rouge either through military defeat or gradual 
marginalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia's leaders also realize that a thorough overhaul of the Cambodian army 
is a precondition for any satisfactory outcome. The current army has been 
described -- without great exaggeration -- as the worst in the world. Second 
Prime Minister Hun Sen calls it "an embarrassment." About one-third of its 
nominal 140,000 troops are "ghost soldiers." Nearly 70% of its actual force 
consists of officers (2,000 of whom are generals). Both Hun Sen and First Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh agree that the army must be substantially 
downsized (to perhaps 60,000), the percentage of officers drastically reduced 
and the training and education of officer corps and rank-and-file given the 
highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But any move to rapidly demobilize would cast large numbers of young men with 
few employable skills into a civilian economy that has no place for them. The 
inevitable result would be banditry and insecurity, if not a military coup. And 
any hope to improve training and education of existing personnel founders on 
the dearth of teachers and trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the United States. Ranariddh and Hun Sen, supported by Sihanouk, want 
the United States to "adopt" three or four Cambodian army battalions and train 
and equip them for construction work. Then with U.S. economic assistance, these 
units could be demobilized and used for civilian road building and other 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is providing military construction advisers, graders and 
bulldozers, and de-mining specialists. It is an important start, but just a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the United States return to the scene of a disastrous and divisive 
intervention? Unlike South Vietnam, Cambodia has a government that was selected 
through free elections and is recognized by the international community. The 
international community has a substantial stake in the outcome in Cambodia 
because the U.N. effort there, at a cost of more than $2 billion, remains its 
most successful. Cambodia's current leaders generally recognize and acknowledge 
the problems their government faces and the weakness it exhibits -- and show 
credible indications they are prepared to adopt the necessary remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the Khmer Rouge is not 10 feet tall. It is generally confined 
to a region near the Thai border. A lack of broad popular support undercuts its 
ambition to launch a protracted war of attrition. The Khmer Rouge survives 
because it is disciplined, controls a nearly inaccessible base area, receives 
cross-border assistance from elements of the Thai army and is opposed by the 
inept Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should not be the only country willing to assist the 
Cambodian government, however. What is required is a multilateral 
defense-assistance program, orchestrated and led by Washington, to provide 
training, materiel and non-lethal equipment, except for ammunition and, 
eventually, small arms. Toward that end, the State Department has initiated 
discussions with other interested countries, notably Australia, France and 
Indonesia. Under no conditions should foreign combat troops be introduced nor 
should Vietnamese assistance be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 A basic lesson of history is that successful strategists anticipate the 
consequences of intended actions and plan for them -- answering the "then 
what?" question. For Cambodia, the U.S.-U.N. strategy that produced the Paris 
Accords and national elections was incomplete. Hard realities and follow-on 
plans were submerged in the euphoria of a successful vote. But the election was 
only the beginning. We have reached a culminating point in Cambodia that 
requires a new strategy so that what has been gained is not lost. For Cambodia, 
the "then" is now and the "what" is clear.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JANE ALEXANDER; DEFENDING THE ARTS ENDOWMENT FROM 
THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke 
with Jane Alexander while the NEA chair drove from San Francisco toward the 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton may have had the soothing power of celebrity in mind 
when he nominated actress Jane Alexander to head the controversial National 
Endowment for the Arts. In the Washington halls of power, senators and 
representatives are the VIPs, but when a genuine Hollywood movie star shows up 
on Capitol Hill, even veteran committee chairmen have been known to swoon. 
Alexander plays down the importance of star power, but so far she has charmed 
some of the NEA's most vocal critics. Even Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) deemed her 
"a straight shooter with the best of intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander will need more than good intentions to rescue the NEA from the mire 
of controversy and neglect that characterized it during the Reagan-Bush years. 
The agency -- which is designed to operate as an investment banker for the arts 
-- is hobbled by a declining budget and is the target of critical sniping from 
both the left and the right. The vast majority of the grant money it 
distributes goes to mainstream symphony orchestras, regional theaters and art 
councils. Yet, most of the press generated about the NEA concerns its funding 
of a handful of artists whose work is characterized by some, like Sen. Robert 
C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), as anti-family, anti-religious and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander says she's determined to defend her agency's right to support 
diverse and sometimes disturbing artwork. But she's also campaigning to change 
the image of the NEA, emphasizing the broad cultural contributions and even the 
economic impact of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is 54, the mother of four children and a respected actress who never 
expected to become a bureaucrat. By all accounts, she's tackled the job with 
the same intensity she brought to roles in "The Great White Hope" on Broadway 
and to "Testament" on the movie screen. In a bid to get her message heard, 
she's promised to visit all 50 states before the end of this year -- she spent 
the past week barnstorming through California, this week she'll be in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on the road between San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, she 
talked about redefining the role of the NEA, how she handles her critics, and 
the difference between legitimate and political theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've just gotten your budget approved by Congress -- how did you 
do?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The budget was cut by 2%, which puts us at $167.4 million, down from 
$172 million. I would have liked to have gotten a budget at least as big as 
last year's, but Sen. Byrd (chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee) 
wasn't happy with some of the grants we made last year, so . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: But you must have done something to change Sen. Byrd's mind, because he 
originally wanted to cut your budget by at least 5%. What did you do to calm 
his concerns?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I sat down and talked with him. He had earmarked certain programs for cuts 
-- programs presenting visual arts and theater -- and I pointed out that it 
would be punitive to cut funding to so many wonderful visual artists and 
theaters in the country. And I think his own constituents came to the fore, as 
did arts advocates across the country, and he backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You must either have a great deal of charm or remarkable skills of 
persuasion to garner compliments from Jesse Helms.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Maybe it's because I have a dialogue with him. I pay attention to him. He 
knows where I'm coming from and that I don't see things the way he does. But at 
least we correspond. You know, half the time all you have to do is pick up the 
phone. Many times, all it takes is just answering your critics. Because there 
is so much distortion of the facts, it's very important to set the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your budget works out to less than 65 cents per person in the U.S, and it's 
less than the amount a much smaller country like Britain spends on the arts. Do 
you think it's ironic that so much time and legislative effort is spent 
debating a relative drop in the bucket?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it speaks to the power of the arts in the country to move people 
one way or the other. People have strong feelings about what the arts should 
do. And the arts are very visible. In most of the agencies in the government, 
the American public could not tell you what's going on. But in our case, when 
certain organizations or individuals choose to isolate specific works of art 
they don't find appealing, or that they find offensive, then it gets picked up 
by the media, because it excites people. And that's just what art should be 
doing -- it should move people, be able to make them think and wonder. But I 
want to stress that at the NEA we have two criteria that our panels look at 
when making grants -- artistic excellence and merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that by accepting public funds an artist should be willing to 
modify or moderate his or her artistic vision?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that would be extremely detrimental, not only to the vision of 
artists, but to what the arts do for society. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, it may sound simplistic, but you can't please all of the people all 
of the time. Still, what we do at the endowment is so broad, there's something 
there for anybody. The critics focus on a very small piece of what we do. 
</P>
<P>
 I said in my confirmation hearings a year ago that the arts are as varied as 
the rainbow of human behavior. That's the way the arts must be in America if 
they are to truly represent America. What I have been trying to explain to 
people over the past year is that there really is something for everyone in the 
arts -- be you a right-winger or left-winger or whatever. And that every 
community will seek its own kind of art, and that at the community level is 
where the real discussion of what's appropriate should take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We've talked about critics on the right, but you have also been criticized 
by those on the left -- artists primarily who think the endowment is bowing to 
censorship. Were you surprised at the voracity of this sort of interfamily 
squabbling?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I come from their community and I know what they are thinking. When 
money is short and there is not enough work around, we all become a little 
paranoid. Artists have a right to express their dissatisfaction just like 
anyone else. But there's something bigger that's going on in the country that 
no one really talks about much. There is a discussion about the democratization 
of art. People want to begin to talk about art. When they don't understand some 
kind of new art, it can anger them. They wish they understood it better, and 
when it's inaccessible, they begin to resent it, and to undervalue art in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 But, overall, I think it's healthy, because it represents a sort of populist 
movement about art -- that every citizen can feel engaged, can be a participant 
in the arts in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been chairman of the NEA for a year now -- how have you evolved in 
your understanding of what the endowment does, or should do?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think one of the most important things I decided to do was to go on the 
road. The public has had a misconception about what the NEA is -- that needed 
to be righted. And once I'm able to talk to people, they begin to put a face 
with the endowment and the arts become more human and less fearful. They see 
that the 65 cents they are shelling out each year is, in fact, a terrific 
investment. I was just in Wyoming last week, and every dollar we award in that 
state leverages $26 dollars -- that's a pretty good return on investment! 
</P>
<P>
 Until I started traveling, I never understood the breadth of artistic endeavor 
in this country, and the breadth of what the endowment supports. For instance, 
in Alaska, there's the Indigenous Broadcast Center, which we started with a 
grant from our Media Arts program some years ago. It beams programs to tribal 
people in Alaska and the lower 48 states. Programs are broadcast in native 
languages, and it has caused a revival in these tongues. That's an astonishing 
ripple effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In Abilene, Tex., I met a group of women painters who had formed a collective, 
and they were doing outstanding work. In Ft. Gibson, Miss., there's a place 
that started as a quilting center and grew to become the art center for the 
whole community -- so that when I dropped in, I saw teen-agers hanging out 
there and little kids running around. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The NEA was conceived as a kind of venture capitalist for the arts. How 
does that work, and how much of an economic force are your grants?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's seed money. We award grants, and people then have the federal 
imprimatur. They can say, "Look, the NEA believes in us," and use that to raise 
money from other sources. And then these arts organizations create ancillary 
jobs -- for instance, at restaurants that cater to people who are going to the 
theater or an art opening. The entire nonprofit art community returns $3.4 
billion to the federal government each year in taxes. Art and art centers are a 
sound investment in any community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are those who think that the NEA budget has become so tight that the 
organization has become irrelevant. The Times art critic Christopher Knight 
described it as approaching "functional oblivion." Do you take issue with that? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: I do. Just tell him to hit the road with me, and he'll find it's just not 
true. He must be thinking of some of the big institutions where we are only a 
tiny, tiny part of their overall budget -- something like Lincoln Center in New 
York or the Music Center in Los Angeles. But I've sat down with the people who 
run those organizations and asked them if they don't need the endowment any 
more and they say, "No, no, no." They need the endowment because they say it's 
the only organization that can convene panels of experts in their fields, that 
can judge projects in a way that lets them know what is the best. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the big institutions say they need us, I know the small ones do. 
Sometimes, our $5,000 is providing a third of a small group's budget. And I 
can't tell you how many small arts organizations there are like that in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't pretend that $167.4 million can adequately address the needs of every 
arts organization in the nation. Nevertheless, the NEA is the most important 
endowment organization in this country. That is because of our leadership. For 
instance, we just convened a meeting of health-care people from all over the 
country because fully 30% of the artists in this country have no health care. 
That's the kind of thing the endowment can do -- that we do do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you grade the Clinton Administration on their commitment to the 
arts?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, very high. People sometimes don't understand that this is a very busy 
President. But he has been highly supportive of me, of the NEA and of arts in 
general. On Oct. 14, we'll have the Medal of Arts ceremony at the White House, 
and the First Lady was with me just last week at the National Heritage Awards 
for folk and traditional artists. I think the President is quite eloquent in 
his support for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last winter, George Will wrote a piece blasting the NEA -- he said it 
dispenses pork for the elite. What was your response to that fairly common 
criticism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You know, again, go out on the road with me. I sat down with George Will 
for a couple of hours before he wrote that article and the last thing I said to 
him was, "Please, come on the road with me, just to one state. Come see what we 
do." But he didn't pay any attention. He comes from a very privileged 
background, and like lots of people of his background, he has this perception 
of art as being elitist -- because he grew up with it. But I can't tell you how 
many people in this country do not have art in their lives, and who want it in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your vision of art and of the artist in the 21st Century?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That the artist is valued in society. That the arts are available to all 
members of society at every age and every level. That the arts institutions are 
stable in their funding and that arts education is a part of the core 
curriculum. And that there is an understanding of what art means, both as 
individuals and as a collective society.

POLITICAL FORECAST; WILL HAITI'S MILITARY RULER STILL BE IN THE COUNTRY ON 
OCTOBER 15?

<P>
 Will Haiti's Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who has ruled his country for three years, 
leave by the Oct. 15 deadline established in the Carter agreement? The Times 
asked eight experts on Haiti.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. White, President of the Center for International Policy  
</P>
<P>
 Cedras will leave at noon, Oct. 14. It's almost impossible for the Parliament 
to gather, debate and pass a far-ranging amnesty. I doubt we will be pushing to 
get the Parliament to act when it suits our interests that Cedras leave, and 
the surest way to get him to leave is to make sure that he is subject to arrest 
Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mark Falcoff, Resident scholar and Latin American specialist, American 
Enterprise Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe Cedras will leave. It's no accident that the agreement does 
not require his departure. He would have never signed it (otherwise). I would 
guess that he will stay and not be arrested. There's not much possibility he'll 
have a major political career, but he'll be around to make life unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ernest H. Preeg, Former U.S. ambassador to Haiti during the Reagan 
Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear, but I don't think it will make much difference. Legally, Cedras 
doesn't have to go, but will he fear for his safety? I presume he will. The 
Administration has turned back from a Carter-oriented approach of 
reconciliation. The way it has been going in the field, the pro-Aristide people 
are the good guys and the anti-Aristide are the bad guys. I don't want to 
overplay the importance of (Cedras). The real question is: Will the army and 
police disintegrate in Port-au-Prince as they have in Cap Haitien. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jean Jean-Pierre, Commentator, Radio for Peace International, and consultant 
on Haiti  
</P>
<P>
 Cedras will leave Haiti if there is political amnesty instead of the general 
amnesty that was promised by Jimmy Carter. If the Parliament approves an 
amnesty that goes beyond the political, which is authorized by the 
constitution, this will be a recipe for disaster, because all the people who 
were raped or whose families were tortured will not have any recourse except 
their own justice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marian E. Douglas, Former member of the Organization of American States-United 
Nations human- rights mission in Haiti  
</P>
<P>
 It could happen within the next few weeks, because of the pressure applied 
from inside Haiti and from the international community, the United States, 
particularly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Gaskin, Vice-president for policy, Business Executives for National 
Security, and former military strategist  
</P>
<P>
 Why would he leave? He's going to be granted amnesty. The Parliament is more 
prone to side with Cedras than (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide. They have a bad taste 
in their mouth from Aristide; that's what started the coup 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Martin, Senior associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  
</P>
<P>
 I think its quite possible that Cedras will leave before the 15th of October. 
That can happen in one of two ways: 1) within the Carter agreement, if 
Parliament passes some kind of amnesty law, but not one satisfactory to Cedras; 
2) the United States could find it necessary that constitutional authority 
needs to be rapidly restored (and bring Aristide back) before the 15th. In 
either of these situations, it will be necessary for Cedras to leave, because 
the situation is simply not viable for him. A great majority of the population 
holds him responsible for human-rights violations since the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dessima M. Williams, Professor of sociology, Brandeis University, and former 
Grenadian ambassador to the Organization of American States  
</P>
<P>
 The more important issue is whether Cedras is willing to play a role in 
reducing military control over Haitian life, whether or not the Haitian state 
is able to hold him accountable and what kind of process of accountability and 
reconciliation Haitian society wants to pursue: trials, amnesty or a truth 
commission that would assess human-rights abuses. Whether Cedras will be in 
Haiti to be held accountable will depend on what (type of amnesty) Parliament 
can agree on.

 Re "Forswearing the Commonplace," by Jenijoy La Belle (Commentary, Sept. 21): 
</P>
<P>
 I am a retired dentist who practiced dentistry in Los Angeles County for more 
than 32 years. With regard to LaBelle's statement, "The worst cursing I ever 
heard in my childhood was from our dentist . . . the air turned blue while he 
worked on his patients' teeth," I find it hard to believe that her parents, 
whose strongest words were "phooey," would be so stupid as to allow their child 
to go to a dentist who used such language. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is obvious from her description of her childhood dental experience 
("The invective was just part of the whole awful experience, like shots and the 
drill and the pain") that the dentist her parents sent her to was a hack. I 
would presume that with a dental initiation like that, her teeth must now 
occupy a glass of water on her night stand. 
</P>
<P>
 I want LaBelle to know that there are not many ethical dentists who have ever 
publicly vituperated. In fact, I have not been involved in any vituperating, at 
least not in public, for more than 10 years now. 
</P>
<P>
 So (excuse my profanity), "hecky-darn," Jeni, and I'll see ya later, 
vituperater.

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the Sept. 21 article on Japan Airlines and its new flight attendant hiring 
plan, I feel compelled to set the record straight about U.S. flight attendant 
salaries in comparison to theirs. I am a flight attendant for American Airlines 
and am currently in my fifth year of service. Last year my annual gross salary 
was just shy of $20,000. (I am a full-time employee and work overtime when I 
can fit it into my schedule.) 
</P>
<P>
 The article stated that "at JAL, an average attendant's wage of $80,000 year 
is about twice as high as pay for attendants on U.S. airlines, according to 
company officials." Try four times! I find it shocking that any airline 
attendant is paid that much anywhere. If it's true, then wonderful for them. I 
can't say I'm not envious. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, I can speak for American Airlines attendants and tell you that 
more than three-quarters of our attendants are B-scale and make less than 
$30,000 per year. It's true that a few years back some of our newly hired 
flight attendants on reserve based in New York City actually qualified for food 
stamps. We went on strike last November for better wages and work rules and 
although we did not lose our jobs, our contract has still not been settled. It 
is currently going through binding arbitration with federally appointed 
mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 A-scale flight attendants are the only ones who earn annual salaries in the 
$40,000 range. Once they retire or quit, they will be gone forever, taking 
their salaries with them. We B-scalers who stick around long enough to make it 
to the new A-scale rate of pay will be looking at a whole new salary scale, 
designed to keep us working longer and harder for less pay in the long run.

PLAN TO RESTORE MONO LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Water Resources Control Board, after exhaustive hearings and 
extensive study, has determined that to protect the Mono Basin's unique 
environment there is need to cease exporting virtually all water from the basin 
for at least the next 20 years and raise the lake level another 17 feet (Sept. 
18). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power accepts that judgment and 
will not further appeal the board-recommended lake level. 
</P>
<P>
 The department must now heighten efforts already under way to replace the Mono 
Basin supply, which historically has represented almost 20% of the city's 
supply. Toward that end, the department will continue to pursue its nationally 
recognized water conservation program, which has achieved 15% to 20% reduction 
in water usage during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the department is moving as quickly as it can to take advantage 
of water reclamation and conservation opportunities in the legislation recently 
signed by the governor, which will provide $36 million of funding for projects 
in Los Angeles. The most important, the East Valley Water Recycling Project is 
being designed to provide 35,000 acre-feet per year of reclaimed water when it 
is running at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The department wants to work closely with the many other interests in 
California that are grappling with the complex issues involved in making 
additional water supplies available to Southern California from the San 
Joaquin-Sacramento Delta, which will also require a new balancing between 
urban, agricultural and environmental interests under the guidance of the state 
Water Resources Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 DENNIS A. TITO, President, DWP

<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the most significant statement of the article is one which both 
sides can agree on. When referring to future water supplies in L.A., DWP's 
James Wickser said that unused supply was to have accommodated anticipated 
population growth. It is an indisputable and objective fact that more people 
equals more consumption. This is in spite of the fact that comparatively small 
offsets can be made through advances in technology or 
conservation/reclamation/recycling. This applies for water as well as other 
resources including trees, roads, schools and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with virtually any environmental issue, the real/underlying 
issue is population growth. Manage it properly and technology, conservation and 
recycling, etc., will have a chance to catch up and actually improve things. 
Fail to do so and the quality of life for all of this planet's inhabitants is 
in big trouble.

 The Times seems to view Mono Lake's protection as a loss for Los Angeles. This 
is not true for the following reasons. The Mono Lake Committee has worked very 
hard to get replacement water for L.A. that would not damage the environment. 
And Mono Lake is a place of great value that has meaning to the people of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mono Lake is an important resource to the entire state. It is an 
important ecosystem as well as an important stop for migratory birds. This lake 
is very old and should be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Southern California and am willing to do my part and use less water 
to protect Mono Lake. There are state and federal funds available to help 
develop water reclamation and conservation programs in the Los Angeles Basin. 
These projects will create more water than the city ever diverted from Mono 
Basin, and the water created will be reliable, local and drought-proof.

 I am writing on behalf of the Mothers of East Los Angeles-Santa Isabel. This 
is a community-based organization that sponsors programs to help our community 
by creating jobs, expanding resources and fostering programs such as water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading your article, it seemed that Southern California is going to lose out 
if Mono Lake is protected. I believe that we are going to win. Our organization 
and eight groups in Southern California are doing our part to conserve enough 
water so that we can protect Mono Lake and still meet our water needs. Through 
our ultra-low flush toilet exchange program, we have conserved 6.5 billion 
gallons of water per year and added economic stimulus of $3 million into the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 This past summer we took 25 inner-city children to camp at Mono Lake. Many of 
them had never had such an experience and Mono Lake's natural beauty made a big 
impact on their lives. We all stand to gain if Mono Lake is protected.

TORTURE OF DOG BY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have learned from the Sept. 21 article that six apparent "youths" 
systematically tortured a dog for a period of more than three hours. The dog 
was ultimately set afire by the "youngsters." Thankfully, the dog died, thereby 
not feeling the abuse and torment any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions of the "kids," if true, were so heinous, calculating, coldblooded 
and premeditated that one can conclude we are dealing with somewhat mature and 
sophisticated minds on the part of the 15-year-olds. The age of the young 
adults viewed in connection with their egregious conduct should cause the trial 
to be conducted as one for adults, not juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the facts depicted in the your article are true, and one or more guilty 
verdicts are brought in, no less than adult penalties should apply. If one or 
more of the defendants are found not guilty, the penalty is irrelevant as to 
that/those individual(s), which should assuage any fears of those who believe 
in the innocence of the accused.

 It amazes me, although it no longer surprises me, that parents support their 
child without question, no matter how gruesome or horrific the crime committed. 
I am referring to the incident of the dog who was tortured for hours and then 
set ablaze and burned alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents automatically insisted the police arrested the wrong teen-ager 
(their son), despite the fact the police arrived on the scene and saw for 
themselves who was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 When we wonder why there is so much violence among our young people, we can 
trace it back to parents who deny their children could ever do anything wrong. 
No parents want to admits their child would do this but until parents are able 
to look at their children objectively -- capable of good and evil -- our 
society is only going to get more twisted.

 I was very upset and my children cried over this. However, I also blame 
shelters and animal rights groups that give animals to adopt, to save them from 
being put to sleep. It is more humane to put animals to sleep than giving them 
to the wrong people, or seeing them abused.

PROPOSITION 187 AND THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; ANTI-IMMIGRANT 
INITIATIVE WOULD DENY MEDICAL CARE, ROIL SCHOOLS AND MAKE SNOOPS OUT OF 
TEACHERS; IS THIS WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illegal immigration to America is obviously a significant problem, especially 
in California. But how Californians react to it can either produce thoughtful 
policy that can be a model for the nation or a half-baked approach that could 
actually have dangerous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 What will it be? 
</P>
<P>
 THE CONTEXT: The issue of illegal immigration has reached a fever pitch here 
for three reasons. One is simply that the number of illegal immigrants is 
large. The second is that the gubernatorial campaign has dwelt on the issue. 
And the third is the looming presence of statewide ballot Proposition 187, to 
be voted on Nov. 8. We strongly recommend a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This measure proposes to prohibit state and local governments from providing 
education, health care or other social services to illegal immigrants. 
Proponents claim that state and local governments' services and benefits 
aggravate the problem by enticing many people into entering the country 
illegally and that social tensions resulting from immigration will only worsen 
unless California does a dramatic about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 supporters admit that some of the measures are Draconian -- 
for instance, state and local agencies would be required to report "apparent 
illegal aliens" to immigration authorities. But they argue that more moderate, 
intermediate measures -- minor congressional reforms and local patch jobs -- 
are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has a parallel to Proposition 13, the controversial 1978 
statewide ballot measure limiting property taxation, in that it is one of those 
thunderbolt, send-'em-a-message ballot measures. But, also like Proposition 13, 
it would surely produce many unintended bad results. Proposition 187's 
understandable appeal is based on the assumption that we have to do something 
about illegal immigration. We certainly do. And this proposition would 
certainly Do Something. But what it would do is not something California should 
want to happen. DECIMATE THIS STATE'S LOW-WAGE LABOR POOL? 
</P>
<P>
 Is illegal immigration only a negative force? Of course not. What about the 
economic benefits that accrue from all recent immigrants, even those who are 
here illegally, such as low-wage but highly productive labor? Think of all the 
work -- from home repair to garment manufacturing -- that keeps marginal 
businesses profitable and allows new small firms to open. Think what the 
world-famous California economy would be like without the many thousands of 
tiny businesses and service firms that depend on low-cost labor. Guess who's 
picking the crops for the California agribusiness that is the envy of the 
world? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember: There are powerful economic factors at work here. Reputable experts 
disagree over how many new immigrants this state can absorb without severe 
consequence and over whether they are a net plus or a negative for the economy. 
But the experts are virtually unanimous on what draws most immigrants here: The 
lure is jobs, however ill-paid, not welfare. The United States and Mexico 
should work out a sensible arrangement that recognizes the reality of this 
powerful job magnet and minimizes the exploitation of these workers while also 
discouraging illegal resettlement in the United States. DENY PEOPLE BASIC 
MEDICAL CARE? 
</P>
<P>
 To refuse to provide fundamental health care is downright dangerous to the 
public interest. If Proposition 187 passes, and is upheld in the courts, people 
here illegally would be denied basic health care even if their medical problems 
were serious, even if they had communicable diseases, even if a low-cost dose 
of preventive medicine could nip a potentially costly problem in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
 A major and vital goal of public health care is to keep the problems of even 
the sickest and most destitute individuals from becoming a danger to the rest 
of the population. Say an illegal immigrant with an infectious disease like 
tuberculosis is turned away from a public clinic. Health professionals worry 
that he is less likely to return to his homeland than to become a potential 
health threat to those he comes in contact with in this country. Is the public 
interest better served by treating the disease or turning the carrier away? 
THROW KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL? 
</P>
<P>
 Though based on a longer-term definition of the public good, the argument for 
educating the children of illegal immigrants is similar. First, studies have 
shown that even children born abroad who are raised here by immigrant parents 
are more likely to remain in the United States than go home, even if their 
parents eventually return to their countries of origin. So it is in the public 
interest to make sure they become well-educated and acculturated to American 
life. At least then they will be likely to be productive members of society as 
adults. It's no wonder so many law-enforcement officials are vigorously 
campaigning against Proposition 187. By tossing kids out of school it's 
virtually an unintended but effective gang-recruitment tool. TURN TEACHERS INTO 
SPIES? 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrant education issue is extremely complicated. Many, perhaps most, of 
the children born to illegal immigrants are born in the United States and thus 
are U.S. citizens entitled to a public education. Yet Proposition 187 would 
literally force a school district to question young Americans about their 
parents' immigration status and report to authorities any parents suspected of 
being here illegally. That's the Immigration and Naturalization Service's job, 
not the schools' job. Imagine requiring a teacher to quiz a pupil about whether 
her parents are illegal -- what an ugly outrage. Teachers are stressed out 
enough without having this added to their list of duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Big Brother" aspects of this approach to immigration law enforcement are 
obvious. Less obvious are the unintended consequences such as illegal 
immigrants pulling their children out of public schools in huge numbers. State 
education officials estimate that school enrollment could drop by 300,000 if 
every illegal-immigrant parent did so, and that could cost California up to 
$2.8 billion in federal education aid. Some shortfall would have to be made up 
by state taxpayers because the exodus wouldn't yield $2.8 billion in savings. 
SEND A MESSAGE THAT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE? 
</P>
<P>
 Another fundamental flaw of Proposition 187 is the facile assumption that a 
single state can actually do something about an international phenomenon like 
the migration of people from countries as close as Mexico or as far away as 
China. That assumption is legally tenuous, for the courts have traditionally 
held that immigration is a federal, not state, responsibility. On that basis 
alone, any sections of Proposition 187 that contradict federal laws or 
procedures may wind up being nullified by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that possibility, some supporters of 187 urge a vote for the 
initiative to "send a message" to a federal government that has ignored its 
responsibility to deal with the immigration issue. But while there may once 
have been value in sending even a very crude message such as 187, Washington is 
certainly not ignoring the immigration issue these days. Under pressure from 
California Democrats like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republicans like Gov. Pete 
Wilson, both Congress and the Clinton Administration have been made acutely 
aware that illegal immigration is a major issue in California and other states 
with large immigrant populations. And President Clinton has made regaining 
control of the nation's borders a priority for the Justice Department, 
designating money in the recently passed federal crime bill for hiring 1,000 
new Border Patrol agents and reimbursing California and other states for the 
cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 And a recent study commissioned by White House chief of staff Leon E. Panetta, 
himself a Californian, verified that California pays far more in educating and 
helping immigrants than it gets back in federal immigration aid. That will 
provide ample ammunition in pressing Congress for more immigration-related 
funds. RISK LOSING FEDERAL AID? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no single argument against Proposition 187 makes its proponents so 
uneasy as what their initiative could wind up costing California taxpayers. 
According to the state legislative analyst, lost federal aid to schools, public 
hospitals and clinics could add up to $15 billion. How can Proposition 187 
proponents sell it as a tax-saving initiative in the tradition of Proposition 
13? They really can't, and when pressed on 187's costs, the initiative's 
authors change strategy and confess that they don't really expect 187 to go 
into effect right away, even if it wins. They then acknowledge their real goal: 
pushing the state into what is sure to be a long, costly lawsuit against the 
federal government -- a suit that the state could well lose. The legal question 
here centers on the Supreme Court's Plyler vs. Doe decision of 1982, which held 
that immigrant children are entitled to public education. In effect, 
Proposition 187's authors would gamble with your tax money in the hope of 
winning a dubious legal fight they should pay for on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Proposition 187 purports to offer a simple answer to a complex 
phenomenon, it really is no answer at all. If state voters enact this measure 
they will not only not end illegal immigration, they will drag California into 
bitter lawsuits and political battles that could hurt the state far more than 
illegal immigration does. 
</P>
<P>
 One need only ponder the divisive campaign waged over 187, with its overtones 
of hostility against Latinos, Asians and other state residents who look or 
sound like "apparent illegal aliens," to get a sense of how difficult ethnic 
relations could become in the aftermath of the initiative's approval. In an era 
when California businesses increasingly look to Asia and Latin America for new 
markets, this state doesn't need such ethnic division. Vote "no" on Proposition 
187.

IF WE BELIEVE IN THE PROCESS, WE MUST PAY THE DUES; U.N.: ALWAYS CASH-STRAPPED, 
THE WORLD AGENCY IS HAMPERED BY U.S. ARREARS, NOW TOTALING MORE THAN A 
QUARTER-BILLION DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. VOELL, Richard A. Voell is chairman of the board of the Business 
Council for the United Nations, and president and CEO of the Rockefeller Group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations will not be able to realize any time soon its mission to 
"end the scourge of war," as its charter declares. It will not be able to 
function as the agency for peace everywhere, every time, but when its principal 
members agree on a policy, the world body is a proved, effective vehicle for 
peacemaking and policing. Experience in Cambodia, El Salvador and, as a result 
of the powerful U.S. commitment, the Persian Gulf testifies to this. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to come together on a unified policy to resolve crises and end 
bloodshed is much greater today than ever before. The last consequential veto 
cast in the Security Council was more than four years ago. The General Assembly 
is no longer a forum for ideological diatribes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it is to fill the crisis-management vacuum created in the Cold War's 
aftermath, the United Nations needs effective leadership and financial support. 
Habitually a beggar on the world scene, the United Nations got an important 
boost to its financial health with the $1.2-billion appropriation in August by 
Congress for U.N. peacekeeping operations. In a climate of severe budget 
constraints within the United States, the appropriation is a major victory for 
a U.N. policy advocated by the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations, but 
repeatedly rejected by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this victory, however, the United States remains more than $250 
million behind schedule in dues for regular U.N. operations. Absent an 
additional appropriation, this figure will double in January. In contrast, our 
European allies and Japan are almost uniformly up to date with their 
obligations. And while the U.S. assessment is the world's highest in the 
aggregate, on a per capita basis it is no more than those of other developed 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Our assessment for the regular U.N. operating budget costs each American only 
$1.16 a year. Assessments for special peacekeeping operations run somewhat 
higher, but this is only a small part of the story. In any reasonable 
cost-benefit analysis, the benefits to the United States far exceed the 
expense. Whatever misgivings we may have about the United Nations' performance 
to date in Bosnia or Somalia, imagine the cost to the United States if we had 
been compelled to address these crises unilaterally, or to ignore them 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would disagree that the United States cannot and should not be the world's 
policeman or fireman or rescue squad. The cost would bankrupt us, even assuming 
we could perform the task effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Timely payment of our financial obligations will boost America's credibility 
in the world body. It would be an important step, too, toward providing the 
United Nations the kind of leadership that will enable it to act effectively in 
resolving the diverse crises of our fragile world -- crises we can't afford to 
resolve on our own, but which we can't afford to turn away from.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEDIA; 'INFORMATION POLLUTION' IS REAL; TALK ABOUT 'POLLUTING 
THE JURY POOL' IS JUST A METAPHOR, BUT IT GIVES LIFE TO THE NEW MEDIA ECOLOGY 
MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN STONEHILL, Brian Stonehill is completing Screen Smarts: Visual 
Literacy for the Age of Multimedia for print and CD-ROM publication. He directs 
the media studies program at Pomona College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising to the surface of debate surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial is the 
notion of information as pollution. Judge Lance A. Ito and lawyers for both the 
prosecution and the defense all have talked about media exposure possibly 
"polluting" the jury pool. Technically speaking, this is a metaphor, but it's 
one that is extremely useful to understanding the growing media-literacy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the metaphor lies an awareness that not everything that pours out of 
that tube or out of those speakers is good for you. More information may not 
necessarily be better information. The idea is starting to take hold, that is, 
that some kinds of information -- particularly but not solely with respect to a 
jury's deliberations during a trial -- may be noxious, harmful or even, in some 
respects, poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is not a new one, but it is newly salient and persuasive this time 
around. Many of us remember the wartime slogan, "Loose lips sink ships." That 
was a dramatic way of reminding Americans during the two world wars that the 
free flow of certain information could cause mortal damage. More recently, 
during the Persian Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein caused propagandistic 
interviews with downed American airmen to be aired on CNN, the notion of 
information and imagery as potentially toxic to the morale of U.S. forces took 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently still, in the debate over violence on television, one 
increasingly hears scholars such as George Gerbner, dean emeritus of the 
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, speaking 
explicitly about launching a "media ecology movement" and arguing for the need 
to think in terms of conserving the quality of our media environment. Gerbner 
calls persuasively for a cleanup of what he calls "happy violence" on 
television, as if images of violence presented without their negative 
consequences were a toxic effluent being poured into the air that surrounds us. 
</P>
<P>
 We are increasingly aware, in other words, that what we unthinkingly refer to 
as "the media" literally is the stuff, the matter, the environment in which we 
live. While our bodies live on nutritious food, clean water and fresh air, our 
minds are nourished (or not) by both the quantity and the quality of the 
information and images that we expose them to. Information and imagery provide, 
that is, our brain's sole food and the only air it has to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth and falsity are essential to the quality of our information environment, 
but they are not the only relevant variables. In the courtroom, the question of 
whether information, accurate or not, may be prejudicial to jurors' judgment 
helps to determine (in Judge Ito's terms) the degree of possible "pollution of 
the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The power of images as role models for behavior establishes a further set of 
criteria for evaluating media ecology by raising such questions as, does this 
picture advocate or endorse helpful or harmful behavior? In a currently 
controversial example, the Postal Service has issued a stamp commemorating 
blues legend Robert Johnson; the stamp replicates an old photo of Johnson in 
which the cigarette between his lips has been air-brushed out. The 
"information" in the original photo may be more "truthful," but the alteration 
furnishes further evidence that the idea of media ecology -- "down with toxic 
imagery!" -- is starting to stick. 
</P>
<P>
 The current courthouse discussions of preserving the jury pool from pollution 
by exposure to the wrong information have gone even further in planting the 
idea. We might even be led to hope that without spending a penny of real money, 
a "superfund" of sorts might be established to clean up the toxic waste dumps 
of our media by encouraging us to begin on our own to sort out what's worth 
noting in the media from what's worth nothing or worse. Media literacy means 
knowing how to avoid media litter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid the dross of the overplayed story of sex and violence surrounding 
the Simpson trial, a kernel of goodness can be found: Media environmentalism is 
born!

THEATER NOTES; A PRIDE OF ROYALS; THE PRESTIGE FACTOR IS HIGH AND THE ACCENT IS 
DECIDEDLY BRITISH IN THE FALL THEATER SEASON, THANKS TO THE UK/LA FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A glance at the fall theatrical calendar reveals that the UK/LA Festival 1994 
is a very big part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significant are the back-to-back appearances of Great Britain's 
two most important theater companies: Previews begin today for the Royal 
National Theatre production of David Hare's "Racing Demon" at the Doolittle 
Theatre ( see related story, Page 4 ), and one month from today the Royal 
Shakespeare Company arrives at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts to 
present "Henry VI: The Battle for the Throne." 
</P>
<P>
 Both productions are making their only U.S. appearances this season as part of 
the festival, and festival officials say it's unprecedented for both companies 
to appear consecutively as part of an American festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in a million years" would these productions have appeared in this area 
back-to-back without the UK/LA umbrella, declared the festival's executive 
director Bruce Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Racing Demon" is being produced here under the auspices of Center 
Theatre Group, CTG managing director Charles Dillingham agreed there was "no 
way" CTG could have done it apart from UK/LA, which issued the invitation to 
the Royal National, arranged the donation of air fares and provided 10% of the 
costs of remounting the production. An earlier notion to bring the same 
company's multiracial production of "Fuenteovejuna," a Spanish classic, to 
UK/LA was derailed over concern that its large cast could not be reassembled, 
Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Henry VI," Cerritos executive director Victor Gotesman said he's not 
sure if he could have obtained such a show without the UK/LA banner. Cerritos 
is not well known in London, and Gotesman had been trying to bring over a Royal 
Shakespeare Company show for almost two years. The UK/LA connection was 
"helpful" in finally accomplishing it, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 When Royal Shakespeare officials saw the theater at Cerritos, "they flipped," 
said French. The theater will be configured to its smallest capacity, 900, for 
the six performances. One of the theatergoers on Nov. 2, in the center of the 
orchestra section, will be Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally UCLA had planned to import the English company Theatre de 
Complicite as part of the festival (in addition to its presentation of "Stomp," 
currently at the Wadsworth Theater). But that company's touring plans collapsed 
in July. A substitute had to be found soon, and Joseph and UCLA quickly 
marshaled a formidable trio of one-person shows. Called "3 X 3: Great Solo 
Performances" and opening this week at UCLA's Freud Hall, the program features 
Lynn Redgrave's "Shakespeare for My Father" on Friday through next Sunday, 
Miriam Margolyes in "Dickens' Women" on Oct. 11, 15 and 16, and Steven 
Berkoff's "One Man" on Oct. 12, 14 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave did her show in Santa Barbara and Cerritos before taking it to a 
nine-month run on Broadway, but it has never been seen in Los Angeles. A 
scheduled run last winter at the Henry Fonda Theatre was called off when the 
theater required repairing after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolyes did an earlier version of "Women" at the Tiffany Theatre in 1990 
under the somewhat more problematic title, "Wooman, Lovely Wooman, What a Sex 
You Are!" It was produced there by Susan Loewenberg of L.A. Theatre Works, who 
is also producing "3 X 3" for UK/LA, in a brief return to stage production 
after years of focusing on radio drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berkoff show, however, has never been seen in the United States. It was 
Loewenberg, an early U.S. champion of Berkoff's work, who suggested him to 
UK/LA. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth performer, Carol Cleveland -- best known as one of the few 
authentically female members of Monty Python (as opposed to men in drag) -- 
will do a recently announced one-night performance as part of "3 X 3" on Oct. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 UK/LA also includes British-themed work by several L.A. theaters under its 
banner. The only one in a theater larger than 99 seats is Will & Co.'s "The 
Merchant of Venice," alternating in English and Spanish at Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, opening Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A HOME FOR "PICASSO": When an L.A. staging of Steppenwolf Theatre's production 
of Steve Martin's "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" was first talked about, the plan 
was for the L.A. County Museum of Art to present it. Martin is a trustee of the 
museum and shot part of his movie "L.A. Story" there. But now it'll open at the 
Westwood Playhouse instead, on Oct. 22. LACMA isn't one of the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were working closely with Steve to identify a non-traditional theater 
venue on the museum property," said Melody Kanschat, the museum's development 
director. Galleries, outdoor spaces, even the May Co. property next door were 
considered. "But we were unable to find one that met the requirements of the 
production company and fit the museum's public program schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, tickets to the play will be used as premium offers in the 
museum's subscription renewal campaign.*

BLOCKADE AT THE BORDER; EL PASO CALLED A SUCCESS AFTER 1 YEAR; SAN DIEGO ON TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDUARDO MONTES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Border Patrol agent Billy Black stands his daily watch on the Rio Grande in a 
mixed state of boredom and satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 His once-exciting job of chasing down illegal immigrants has become a 
monotonous exercise of sentry duty, watching the river day after day -- a 
result of the patrol's year-old border blockade.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total turnaround from what it used to be," Black said. "It's 
effective. It's not 100% effective, but it's to where we like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The blockade was unique to the El Paso area until this weekend, when it was 
scheduled to be expanded to San Diego. The Border Patrol plans to double the 
number of agents along the busiest stretch of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, the experiment began when Silvestre Reyes, chief of the sector's 
Border Patrol, strung his agents out within sight of each other along a 20-mile 
section of the Rio Grande. It takes 160 to 200 agents to maintain the 24-hour 
blockade line every day. 
</P>
<P>
 First dubbed Operation Blockade, it was meant to keep people from trying to 
cross the border illegally and to capture anyone who made the attempt anyway. 
The strategy marked a radical departure from the patrol's old approach of 
letting people come across, then apprehending them and sending them back. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, patrol officials say the operation -- since renamed Hold the 
Line -- has given them unprecedented command of an area where ferrymen known as 
"lancheros" once did a booming business taking boatloads of illegals across the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 12 months, we've seen that a border as active as El Paso can 
be controlled," Reyes said. Citing agency estimates, he said illegal entries in 
the El Paso sector have decreased from an average high of about 10,000 a day 
before the blockade to about 1,000 now. An entry is considered to be someone 
who eludes the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprehensions of illegal immigrants, an indication of how many people are 
trying to get across, have fallen from an average of about 1,000 per day to an 
average of less than 200 now. "We're very much impressed," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 So are others. "I think the net effect has been very positive," said El Paso 
Mayor Larry Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Many agents have complained about the tedium of sitting on the riverbanks 
during an entire 10-hour shift without much relief, but they support the 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics say there are indications the blockade has simply pushed 
large numbers of illegal immigrants toward other areas, such as Arizona and New 
Mexico. Reyes, whose district includes New Mexico, acknowledged that 
apprehensions have risen outside the El Paso area. 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol figures show no clear pattern. Apprehensions are down from last 
year in Yuma, Ariz., but up in the Tucson area, where 125,335 apprehensions 
were reported from October, 1993, to August, compared with 82,092 during the 
previous year's reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent who refused to be identified for fear of reprisal said that since 
the inception of the blockade the Border Patrol has cut back on the number of 
agents on the line, making the operation less effective. Reyes acknowledged the 
decrease in manpower but said it wasn't decreasing effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration-advocacy groups have also criticized the strategy for militarizing 
the border and, they say, straining relations between the communities of El 
Paso and its sister city, Ciudad Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
 During the days after the blockade's inception, Juarez residents protested and 
tried to blockade international bridges. Those protests were short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, some say using apprehension figures to show a decline in border 
crossings may be misleading, because even the patrol agrees those statistics 
don't account for multiple arrests of the same person, a common occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzan Kern of the Border Rights Coalition, an immigration-advocacy group, 
called the blockade a "Band-Aid on a gaping wound." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains difficult to pin down the blockade's overall effects, such as 
supporters' claim that the operation has reduced local crime. 
</P>

POLLUTION IS CHANGING CLOUDS, RESEARCHERS FIND; ENVIRONMENT: STUDY ALSO SAYS 
SUNLIGHT AND HEAT COULD BE REFLECTED BACK INTO SPACE, POTENTIALLY COOLING THE 
PLANET. 
</P>

 The lumbering C-130 skims perilously close to the ocean waves, collecting data 
suggesting that pollution may be altering the clouds above -- and ultimately 
Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers think smog is creating clouds where none existed and increasing 
the brightness of normal clouds. That, in turn, reflects sunlight and heat back 
into space, potentially cooling the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unlikely that would be enough to force us into an ice age, but it's 
certainly likely to cool the climate significantly," said project scientist 
Phil Durkee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best models we have seen indicate this could be on the same scale as what 
has been predicted for global warming -- only in the opposite direction," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monterey Area ShipTrack Experiment grew out of mysterious bright white 
lines spotted crisscrossing the ocean cloud cover in the first satellite photos 
shot three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines were eventually traced to ships. But smokestacks failed to produce 
enough visible smoke to explain the tracks, some of which stretched hundreds of 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention soon centered on invisible microscopic particles spewing from the 
smokestacks, which allow moisture in the atmosphere to precipitate more 
quickly. In effect, smog apparently seeds the air, creating clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And if narrow ship tracks had such a striking effect, the far more extensive 
pollution over land could potentially change vast stretches of the Earth's 
cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The MAST experiment, a joint U.S.-British effort operated out of the Naval 
Postgraduate School near Monterey, is testing those theories. Participants 
included five U.S. Navy ships, a high-flying ER-2 from the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, a Royal Air Force C-130 and a smaller C-131 from the 
University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed with instruments ranging from exotic lasers to common wind vanes, the 
British C-130 zigzagged behind the unsuspecting freighter Hanjin Barcelona as 
it steamed toward Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fly down the plume," ordered Douglas Taylor of the Meteorological Research 
Flight facility in Farnsborough, England. The plane banked into the invisible 
trail of smokestack exhaust behind the vessel. Inside the plane's computer 
center, meteorologist Jonathan Taylor peered into instruments showing particle 
sizes and amounts, as well as cloud reflectivity. One plume, he said, is 15 
miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship tracks are minor contributors to global cloud pollution, but their 
sharp definition and location in relatively unpolluted skies at sea makes them 
ideal for study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They act as a really nice, controlled experiment -- we have a nice clean 
cloud, then the ship makes it dirty," said Taylor. "But the findings relate to 
pollution anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The graphs jumped as the C-130 crossed the freighter's invisible pollution 
plume. Cloud reflectivity soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings have a military purpose as well, participants reluctantly 
acknowledged. Knowing which ship engines produce which ship tracks could be 
useful in a naval confrontation. But most participants are interested in the 
broader climate implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the operations center, they leafed through satellite photos showing 
the Hanjin Barcelona's ship track off the California coast. Durkee pointed to a 
brighter swatch of clouds just off Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are ships under there, but the coastal clouds are already so polluted 
from land sources that they don't leave ship tracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The British meteorologist flipped to a photo of his homeland that showed 
clouds turning far brighter as they reached England's polluted coastal cities. 
Los Angeles-area shots show the same, said Durkee, with power plants leaving 
especially long trails. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they say, the cloud cover over the entire Northern Hemisphere is 
brighter, or more reflective, than in the less developed Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the change will affect Earth, they add, is uncertain.

THE PRESIDIO'S FUTURE SEEMS UP FOR GRABS; SAN FRANCISCO: AS THE NATIONAL PARK 
SERVICE TAKES OVER THE LANDMARK MILITARY BASE THIS WEEKEND, NO ONCE IS CERTAIN 
ABOUT THE NEXT STEP. MEANWHILE, THE ARMY REMAINS IN RESIDENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 A mouthwatering patch of the country's most valuable urban land turns into a 
national park this weekend, to blossom one day into a think tank for the world 
and a playground for 10 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a black hole for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a greedy $20-billion land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 After 218 years as a military base under Spain, Mexico and the United States, 
the Presidio joins the vast holdings of the National Park Service. But there's 
never been a national park like the Presidio. It encompasses 5% -- 1,480 acres 
-- of San Francisco, the nation's most expensive city. It boasts a gorgeous 
view of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forests, dunes, trails and beaches, the 6th Army headquarters 
includes 510 historic buildings, a state-of-the-art medical research center, a 
picturesque golf course, tennis courts and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Too valuable a prize to reserve only for San Franciscans, or Californians, or 
even Americans, visionaries say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a global center, a great learning center, bringing together 
individuals and organizations working on the world's pressing environmental and 
social issues," said Robert Chandler, the Park Service official who heads the 
Presidio Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy has already declared that the park will be "the 
world's foremost training institute for sustainable development." 
</P>
<P>
 It will also be a model of the Clinton Administration's public-private 
partnership theme. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to sell the idea of working in a historic building that sits in 
a park at the foot of Golden Gate Bridge, only miles from Stanford, the 
University of California at Berkeley, Silicon Valley and dozens of research 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev fell for the Presidio instantly. His 
war-and-peace think tank will be housed in an old Coast Guard station. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore visited the Presidio recently, calling it a future 
showcase of environmental technology leading to clean engines and non-polluting 
agriculture. He also brought a couple of federal tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corporation for National Service -- the Administration's domestic Peace 
Corps -- will base some operations at the Presidio. The Environmental 
Protection Agency is expected to encourage contractors to locate at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 On the private side, the Tides Foundation, which nurtures progressive 
environmental and social groups, is looking to rent space. The University of 
California at San Francisco is fighting for the research hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there's the endangered plant communities, sea lions, open space, 
bike trails, and planned museums for residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks each attract 4 million visitors a 
year," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). "By contrast, it is projected that 
the Presidio will attract 10 million or more." 
</P>
<P>
 But that bright vision is murkier than the Golden Gate fog that often rolls 
across the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying threat is the staggering value of the land. When the Army began 
decommissioning the base, officials estimated they could sell off chunks for 
$500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Way too low, says real estate attorney Neil Eisenberg, who once served on the 
park's advisory committee but has become a vocal critic of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 If developed on an urban scale, with skyscrapers and condominiums, the 
Presidio's real value could be $20 billion, he says. And there are developers 
quietly waiting in the wings for the park to collapse under its own expensive 
weight, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's most vulnerable point is its cost. Congress has allocated $25 
million for each of the first two years, making it the most expensive national 
park in the United States. And the real cost of running the park could reach 
two or three times that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The stiff price tag has angered many congressmen and makes future annual 
appropriations chancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Duncan (R-Tenn.) complains the budget is three times Yellowstone's 
and five times higher than his own Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Duncan 
unsuccessfully pushed a bill critics say would have allowed selling or leasing 
most of the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 Building maintenance takes the blame for the high costs. The Parks Service 
finds itself stuck with keeping up 870 structures on the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is backing a bill by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) that would 
create a private-public Presidio Trust to administer and lease the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust would implement the global village think tank concept, filling the 
buildings with rent-paying tenants to chip away at the $25 million without 
inviting in oil companies and chemical factories. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Army has had second thoughts. After agreeing to decommission the 
base, the Defense Department informed the Interior Department it wasn't really 
leaving after all. The 6th Army will continue to use 40% of the Presidio 
buildings as its headquarters for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 And by the way, the Army said, we'll keep the golf course for officer morale.  
</P>
<P>
 Chandler puts the best face on it. At least, he says, we have a paying tenant 
during the transition phase. But the Army decision stunned park supporters who 
had hoped to use the golf course for revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army's decision also struck a nerve with a growing chorus of critics who 
complain that the Presidio planning process was run behind closed doors. 
Powerful organizations appeared to be cutting up the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chandler insists that everything was done by the book, with endless public 
hearings and public bids when legally required. "There were no secret deals and 
conspiracies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists worry the protracted debate may frighten potential tenants, 
sabotage the global village think tank, and ultimately threaten the park's 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't do a real good job, you create pressure -- like, let's sell a 
big chunk of it off," said Michael Alexander, the Sierra Club's representative 
on the advisory committee. "And we'd be fools to sell it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander recalls the history of California's redwood forests, parceled out to 
loggers in the 1930s for 50 cents an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1960s, the children of the people who sold it off realized we had to 
preserve it," he said. "But there was only a small chunk left by then -- and it 
cost us a billion dollars."

WILL EDUCATION PARK CONCEPT AT EL TORO BASE FLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times goofed! Saturday's paper ("Will Trojans Occupy El Toro?" Sept. 24) 
headlined converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a satellite 
campus as a "new idea." What is new is county Supervisor (Roger R.) Stanton's 
pitch to approach USC officials, and that's certainly good. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted three months ago by the grass-roots Leisure World El Toro 
Conversion Committee, at a community forum, overwhelmingly supported the idea 
of educational facilities at El Toro as a viable alternative to a commercial 
airport.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many other "new" ideas won high praise in the poll, such as a 
transportation hub (high-speed rail), parks and recreation, and a museum 
complex (including a Native American Cultural Center). Unfortunately, The Times 
chose not to cover June's mass meeting, nor the subsequent results of the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps greater insight in the idea category might have been gleaned if you 
had. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * And yet another creative use has been proposed for El Toro, this time by 
Orange County Supervisor Stanton. It is hoped that the voters will come to 
understand that potential possibilities, like Supervisor Stanton addresses, 
cannot be realized if Measure A, the 21,000 jobs-airport initiative, passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University President (James) Doti wants to jump on this bandwagon as 
well. Since he publicly supports the airport initiative, which limits base 
conversion usage to an airport and "airport-related use only," how does he see 
himself in this picture of creating an education park as a complement to an 
airport? 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me. Is "airport-related use only" now open to broad interpretation? Why 
not hop down from that ivory tower and admit that this hastily drafted 
initiative is too flawed to fly?

WE NEED TO CLEAN UP SOMEONE ELSE'S ACT; TO KEEP OUR BEACHES BEAUTIFUL, YOU 
MIGHT HAVE TO GET RID OF THE NEXT GUY'S TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 10th annual Coastal Cleanup Day in Orange County that took place recently 
was a reminder of how much junk people carelessly leave along the county's 
shoreline and estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 45,000 pounds of trash and almost 6,000 pounds of recyclable 
plastics, aluminum and glass were taken from the beaches and even from the 
ocean floor. A well-done is in order for the 4,538 volunteers who took out a 
Saturday to clean up the waterfront and to remove hazards such as plastic from 
the reach of wildlife. Obviously, they could have spent it doing something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the knowledge that the coast was clear for a day carried with it 
the sense that the same kind of trash that accumulated in the past year could 
return easily in the next. There is a message there for the rest of us. The 
best strategy of all is for each of us to pick up all during the year, and 
perhaps even take a pledge to leave the beaches a little cleaner than we found 
them, even if it means picking up a few items left by somebody else.  
</P>
<P>
 People who participate in one-shot cleanups like this one, which was sponsored 
by the California Coastal Commission, can only do so much in beginning to 
address the problem of pollution. It may be that thousands who took part came 
away from their day at the beach with their own consciousness raised. A 
well-done also to the organizations and businesses that took part, or which 
sent employees to clean up sites. But how many of the rest of us yet have to be 
converted?  
</P>
<P>
 The shoreline is a fragile place, and its delicate balances can be disturbed 
by the thoughtlessness of visitors. Workers were dispatched to some 21 seaside 
locations during the cleanup. Many commented on how amazed they were by the 
trash they found.  
</P>
<P>
 We have to recognize that the beaches that grace our area are a precious 
resource for all of us to enjoy and also to preserve.

TRASHED BEACHES AREN'T PLASTIC'S FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission and the 4,538 volunteers who removed 22 tons 
of trash along Orange County beaches recently are to be commended for their 
efforts ("The Coast Is Clear, for a Day," Sept. 18). However, I was 
disappointed, if not somewhat chagrined, to learn that Peggy Blanchard of Long 
Beach "will never buy Styrofoam again."This statement represents the public 
misperception that plastics are the problem when in reality the problem is the 
method by which some individuals discard insulated plastic. (Insulated 
packaging makes up far less than 1% of most landfills.) 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental responsibility is a serious concern of the plastics industry. We 
support recycling programs to reclaim and reuse post-consumer plastics and we 
are expending every effort to inform and assist the public with this task. As a 
matter of fact, the American Plastics Council and the Society of the Plastics 
Industry sponsored the Center for Marine Conservation's Annual International 
Coastal Clean Up on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of our recent economy, the plastics industry is growing, providing 
millions of jobs and billions of dollars to our national economy.

SUPPORT FOR IRVINE HEIR'S MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the story about Joan Irvine Smith denouncing her son because of his 
marriage ("Irvine Heir Risks Inheritance to Wed," Sept. 26): 
</P>
<P>
 Run, Joan, run! Do not walk! Run to the nearest phone, call your new 
daughter-in-law and embrace her into your family. Then gather your friends and 
family to "receive" the newlyweds. Celebrate: 
</P>
<P>
 The joy of their love; 
</P>
<P>
 The privilege of having a son so healthy, talented and robust; 
</P>
<P>
 The satisfaction for rearing a son who has learned to make his own decisions; 
</P>
<P>
 The fulfillment of seeing your child live to adulthood; 
</P>
<P>
 The blessing of having a woman of accomplishment at your son's side; 
</P>
<P>
 The hope which is present in this new union. 
</P>
<P>
 Your son needs you now. Need is not just bad times. Need can be wanting those 
closest to you to share your happiness. When you turn your back on your 
children's dreams, you turn your back on your children. If you are concerned 
about money, any intelligent lawyer can produce a trust program which will keep 
the money away from this love of your son's. But don't let another person come 
between you and your child. There isn't enough money in the world to fill the 
resulting vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 Run, Joan, run. . . . Today, as fast as you can. Make that call now. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * This article ("Irvine Heir Risks Inheritance") touched my heart and reminded 
me that children are a gift to the parents and to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 We've only heard one side of the issue about Morton Smith possibly losing his 
inheritance from Joan Smith. But we, as parents, must remember to cherish the 
precious moments we have with our children and that they are not our 
controlling possessions. Having the strength to go forward in life 
independently is a natural process and necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck to the newlyweds!

TARGET THE REAL PROBLEMS, NOT GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequently in the past I have taken The Times to task for your anti-gun 
editorials, especially when you have equated gun control to crime control. So 
it is only fair that I compliment you and Dana Parsons for his Sept. 25 column, 
"How Much Bullets Actually Hurt. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hardy seems clearly to understand what The Times and too many of our 
legislators do not."The right to bear arms is an important part of the 
democratic process." He also sees the root cause of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduction in gun-related violence will come not from ever more restrictive and 
largely unenforceable gun laws, but from a societal commitment to correct 
fundamental failings in the way this country has been working. 
</P>
<P>
 We must teach our young people employable skills. We must create the jobs that 
allow them entry to the economic highway. We must reward responsible, 
participative parenting. We must strive diligently to eliminate the economic, 
emotional and societal isolation of the young people who have no place to turn 
for support except gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 I remain deeply concerned that our lawmakers and The Times seem to believe 
that the anti-gun measures passed in the emotional hysteria of recent 
legislative sessions are an appropriate response to these problems. They are 
not. Let's get on with the hard part.

COUNCIL REFUSED MONEY ON PRINCIPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Petracca (Letters, Sept. 25) is incorrect in his assertion that the 
Irvine City Council was "inconsistent" in turning down $500,000 in federal HUD 
Community Development Block Grant funds, while continuing city subsidies in 
processing local development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal system established by the framers of the Constitution, 
decisions affecting local communities were intended to be made by local 
government representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It was therefore appropriate for Irvine City Council members to allow a 
reduction on development fees to stimulate business. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no legitimate constitutional basis for most of the massive federal 
spending programs that have caused a national debt approaching $6.5 trillion. 
In "Bankruptcy 1995" Harry Figgie Jr. demonstrates that the time is near when 
all federal tax payments will go toward interest payments on this debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing federal grant money was a collective act of principle by the Irvine 
City Council, not inconsistent with its previous actions.

COMMUNITY SERVICE GETS A FEDERAL BOOST; AMERICORPS, COMING TO SANTA ANA, HELPS 
YOUNG PEOPLE DO WELL AND DO GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen young people are about to get the chance to do well by doing good in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24 are members of AmeriCorps, the Clinton Administration's version of a 
domestic Peace Corps. The federally funded national program of community 
service is worth doing and has laudable goals: improving health and education, 
helping crack down on crime, taking care of those needing help. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana-based Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., a nonprofit organization 
founded 20 years ago to build and maintain low-income housing, will administer 
the AmeriCorps program locally, using 11 participants in Santa Ana and others 
in sites from Chula Vista to Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation's president, Helen Brown, said all 24 started two days ago on 
a two-week training project, immunizing children against diseases and testing 
them for tuberculosis. After that the Santa Ana programs will include working 
with police in projects to fight gangs and drugs, and identifying people who 
need help with services such as child care and health care, after-school 
programs and English classes. The AmeriCorps members will also pair people with 
the agencies that can help them. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are paid minimum wage, plus health care and, if needed, child 
care. They also receive $4,700 to pay for college tuition or vocational 
training or repay educational loans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ample opportunities for good work in Santa Ana and, if the program 
is popular and is expanded, elsewhere in Orange County in future years. There 
are potential pitfalls, though. Taxpayers understandably are concerned about 
how their money is spent; concrete results can negate criticism of the type 
that was directed at community service programs of the past, namely that they 
spent money rashly, without results. 
</P>
<P>
 A pilot program for AmeriCorps found that volunteers, motivated at least as 
much by a chance to help communities as by money for college, can lose their 
enthusiasm quickly if their jobs turn out to be make-work projects. That must 
be avoided. Done properly, AmeriCorps will give dedicated young people a chance 
to help improve others' lives, and better their own as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said 60,000 people across the country called to ask about signing up 
for the program, and 20,000 will take part in the first year. That is an 
impressive number and indicates a desire to do good from members of the 
sometimes maligned Generation X. Orange County youths helping their neighbors 
deserve applause, and a program that uses their talents well.

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS AT ANAHEIM'S DOOR; BUT CITY FACES TOUGH CHOICES TO FUND 
IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody can fault Anaheim for a failure to see the big picture. There are some 
serious questions about how to pay for everything the city now has on the 
drawing boards, but it has recognized correctly that entertainment and tourism 
are its meal tickets. It is confidently positioning itself for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 October is shaping up as an important month in this regard, and the outcome 
ultimately will be of great interest for the rest of Orange County. City 
officials are expected to lay out the details this week of financing plans for 
the $172-million revitalization plan designed to address urban blight around 
Disneyland and pave the way for an expansion of the theme park.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan is designed to bring in new tax revenue and encourage growth, and it 
will include new landscaping, burying overhead utility lines, installing wide 
walkways and generally making the area more attractive.  
</P>
<P>
 These are the kinds of improvements that can create a favorable climate for 
new business and growth, but the city is now going to have to pay for all this. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The city wisely has avoided tapping general funds and understood the political 
risk in trying to impose new residential taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Having approved an environmental impact report, the city now anticipates that 
a large portion will be picked up by the county, state and federal governments. 
However, even if the money is there, it is likely that developers and property 
owners will be asked to pick up the remaining $63-million portion.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is going to have to make a case that its anticipated new revenues 
will be worth the investment for those being asked to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major item on the agenda is the anticipated $60- million renovation 
of the Anaheim Convention Center, which city officials also will consider this 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 That plan has been billed as requiring a two-percentage-point increase in the 
hotel bed tax to 15%, which would put Anaheim in the top tier around the 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 In its zeal to avoid sticking residents with new taxation, the bed tax has 
climbed steadily upward in recent years. City Manager James Ruth wants to avoid 
overburdening the tourism industry, but clearly a new tax is not something 
everyone would be wild about. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is wise to recognize the asset of its convention facilities and the 
need to stay competitive, but it should be sure before going ahead with a bed 
tax increase that there is sufficient support for the new levy. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is on the drawing boards with or without the addition of a new 
theme park, and the Walt Disney Co. has said it will not make a decision on 
whether to go ahead with the project for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim is doing all that it can be expected to do to make the case for the 
theme park expansion, which is a good thing. As Disney reckons with change 
elsewhere in its empire, the city is doing what it should be doing to position 
itself for the future.

HATE CRIMES DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your recent editorial on the prosecution of hate crimes ("The Outer Limits of 
Prosecution," Sept. 21) demonstrated an appreciation of the difficulties that 
prosecutors face when attempting to prove the motivation behind acts of 
seemingly senseless violence. It also showed an understanding that the root 
causes of hate crimes must be combatted at the basic level of the family, the 
church, the school and the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Our office is very proud of the commitment we have made to scrutinize cases 
involving possible racial or other discriminatory motivation. Recently, for 
example, we obtained a four-year prison commitment against a defendant with a 
previously clean record, who had committed a racially motivated assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Your sensitivity to the difficulties of proving discriminatory motivation in a 
criminal court, together with your call for combatting the beliefs and 
attitudes which lead to hate crimes at all levels of society, is timely and 
appropriate.

WHOSE HABITAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to some desk jockey yahoo at the Department of Fish and Game (the 
most ludicrous department in the government) to come up with the statement in 
your article "Lion Sightings Force Irvine Park Closure" (Sept. 24): "They are 
trying to expand their habitat and they are coming into the human habitat." 
What? Who is expanding into whose habitat? I think Patrick Moore needs a 
serious reality check.

GOODWILL ABOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My husband and I recently were at a busy intersection in Brea when every 
motorist's nightmare occurred. Our car stalled. We quickly decided that I would 
go phone for help while my husband stayed and motioned traffic to go around our 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short time that we were waiting for the tow truck to arrive, a 
policeman pulled up behind us and set out flares. After he left, 11 motorists 
stopped and asked if we needed any help or could they call someone for us. We 
were amazed at the sincerity and empathy of the individuals who simply wanted 
to give us a hand. They were men and women, young and old, Asian, Caucasian and 
Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it nice to know that with all the negativity around us, the spirit of 
humanity still prevails?

PALI CAFE SORELY MISSED IN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday (Sept. 18) was a sad day for all of us in Silverado Canyon. The Pali 
Cafe closed. The Pali Cafe was one of the reasons we moved up here four years 
ago.It was a weekend treat for us to drive up to Silverado Canyon from Orange 
and enjoy a leisurely breakfast at the Pali. We enjoyed coming to a place where 
everyone was so friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1989, we decided that if others could live up here so could we. Since 
that time, we've enjoyed two lifestyles -- the hustle and bustle of city life 
during the day, but evenings and weekends are spent at a more leisurely and 
relaxing pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, we have made many friends at the Pali Cafe. There's 
still a real camaraderie in Silverado Canyon, but a piece is missing without 
the Pali.

FULLERTON SHOULD HEED COVINA'S FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a special City Council election looming as the result of the recent 
recall of three members of that body in Fullerton who voted to impose a measly 
2% utilities tax, those who were so hellbent on that action would do well to 
heed the sorry fate of Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Covina residents recalled their entire City Council for imposing a 
6% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot? 
</P>
<P>
 Those recall supporters who replaced the Covina council recently were forced 
to impose an 8% utility tax to meet a $2.8-million budget shortfall. The 
alternatives was to lay off 77 city employees, including police officers and 
firemen, and to close the city library. 
</P>
<P>
 So, beware, Fullerton. The recall slate in this city is just as irresponsible 
as those in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 They are especially irresponsible in their desire to eliminate the city 
Redevelopment Agency. Contrary to their nonsensical claims that the agency 
costs the city, the reverse is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency provides $2.23 million annually in revenues to the city's general 
fund.

OUTLAW SPANKING TO CUT CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Parsons says in his column, "Latest Casualty Spurs Troops in War Against 
Child Abuse" (Sept. 19), that what happened to that 10-year-old "is but another 
grim reminder that adults continue doing horrible things to children." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is it that so many parents are appalled at the idea of having an 
anti-spanking and anti-humiliation law similar to the ones they now have in 
five other countries? 
</P>
<P>
 As long as we tell parents that they have the right to hit their children, 
there will always be some parents who will lose their temper and do extreme 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyway I look at it, when an adult parent hits a child of any age it is 
assault and battery. We have laws to protect adults from assault and battery, 
why not for our children? 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to encourage the new umbrella group, Orange County Partnership 
for Children, to lobby our politicians to revise the present law, which allows 
parents to hit their children by using language like "age appropriate 
spanking." Language like this only opens the door for criminal abuse.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON SOCIETY; U.N. YEAR OF THE FAMILY AN 
OCCASION TO RE-EXAMINE PRIORITIES; THE CORE OF OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURE DESERVES 
MORE COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC-POLICY SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY IN OVERCOMING SUCH 
SCOURGES AS CHILD ABUSE AND GANG VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DELORES WARDELL and SUZANNE DARWEESH, Delores Wardell is vice president of 
the Orange County chapter of the United Nations Assn. and chairwoman of the 
Orange County committee for the International Year of the Family. Suzanne 
Darweesh is co-chairwoman of the committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Children's Summit, which took place Sept. 25 at Orange Coast College, 
focused our attention once again upon children and families and communities. 
Perhaps the United Nations should declare every year an International Year of 
the Family until we get our priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Families form the basic unit of society. When a society is cohesive, 
law-abiding and productive, the source of its strength can invariably be traced 
to the strength of its families. If families are in trouble, then communities 
are also in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations International Year of the Family (UNIYF) has as its goals 
to engage in efforts on a local level that would strengthen families, to 
promote better relations between the public and private sectors and to work to 
change public policy that does not make children and families our priority. We 
need to enable the family to fulfill its function as the source of emotional, 
financial and material support essential for the well-being of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, in its first annual report on the state of Orange 
County children, noted the progress made in education -- test scores, dropout 
rates (with the exception of Latinos, whose dropout rates have increased) -- 
while simultaneously pointing out increases in three very important areas: 
poverty, child abuse and gang membership. Studies show that child abuse is 
cyclical; perpetrators are most likely victims of child abuse themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 How to break the pattern? How to teach parents better techniques of parenting? 
How to discipline without anger, without violence? We salute the sponsors of 
various parenting classes throughout the county, but we believe they are 
insufficient to meet the need and don't reach all those who could benefit from 
parental training. Shouldn't classes in marriage preparation and parenting be 
required for graduation from high school? Isn't it a fact that the high divorce 
rate has a profound and permanent effect upon children? 
</P>
<P>
 Families are shattered every day by the impact of violence. It is done through 
intimidation, force, exploitation, subjugation, humiliation or ridicule. Its 
results are often expressed silently, through fear and isolation. Its 
consequences: a society of individuals preoccupied with survival rather than 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't increasing levels of violence in our community indicate a need for 
teaching conflict resolution in the schools, beginning at the elementary level? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps classes in conflict resolution should be offered in the evening for 
parents as well. We know also that television violence affects families; why 
can't we do something about it? Spousal abuse is finally receiving more 
attention. How can we foster more egalitarian relationships between men and 
women based upon mutual respect, both in the workplace and the home? 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done about the rapidly escalating membership in gangs by our 
youth, with its consequent often violent activity? It irritated us to hear 
preventive measures referred to as "pork" during the recent Senate crime bill 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) supported after-school programs. Midnight 
basketball occupies youth at just that time of day when criminal activity is 
said to be most prevalent. We have heard Anaheim's police chief stress the need 
for churches to get involved in after-school activities for youth before they 
get in trouble. The care and concern of a single person may make the decisive 
influence in that person's life. Prevention is not only more cost-effective 
than incarceration, it saves lives! 
</P>
<P>
 What has the Orange County UNIYF accomplished in the midst of these great 
needs? Besides producing a calendar of county events geared to families, three 
Santa Ana teachers prepared a curriculum of activities to celebrate families, 
recognizing the diversity and changing nature of families in Orange County. 
This was distributed among schools, particularly in Anaheim, Garden Grove and 
Santa Ana. A religious subcommittee prepared information and suggestions for 
celebrating families in religious institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, "living-room dialogues" were promoted. The program 
assembles small groups of people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds for 
discussion of topics aimed at fostering mutual respect and appreciation of one 
another. Orange County has the distinct advantage of being a microcosm of the 
United Nations itself. In this era of hate crimes, Proposition 187, homophobia, 
xenophobia and extremism, there needs to be a movement devoted to 
understanding, compassion and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the important goals of the U.N. has been to encourage families to have 
the courage to express themselves and their needs in decision-making processes. 
The recent Children's Summit agenda exemplified this principle. 
</P>
<P>
 Our UNIYF year will conclude Oct. 23 with United Nations Day, a celebration of 
the 49th anniversary of the founding of the U.N. Using the International Year 
of the Family theme, U.N. Day will celebrate families with a family fiesta at 
Bowers Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the work of the UNIYF completed? Not by any means. The importance of 
children and families cannot exist for just one year. For all of us, the needs 
of families must guide our everyday thinking and actions. 
</P>
<P>
 We have many examples in Orange County wherein public policy does not support 
children and families. When long waiting lists prevent Phoenix House from 
helping all the teen-agers in trouble, when there are so few county-funded 
pediatric clinics for sick children, when street beautification outranks 
keeping libraries open, and when city and county budget realities reflect that 
other items remain priorities, we still have lots of work to do.

PACIFIC IS PLACE FOR OLD I-5 CONCRETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fishermen, biologists, environmentalists, commuters, surfers and taxpayers 
have a common bond in the recycling of concrete into offshore reefs near 
Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interstate 5 freeway widening project is producing enough concrete to 
build a man-made reef or two near the shores of Newport or Huntington.As a 
surfer, fisherman, contractor, commuter and biology student living in Costa 
Mesa, I don't care which beach. 
</P>
<P>
 We have paid, as taxpayers, for piers. We are paying for concrete to be put in 
landfills much farther away than the ocean. The money for the transportation of 
the demolished concrete is funded already. The cost to barge it to sea from 
Beach Boulevard and throw it over the side is needed. To build a pier for 
people to fish from and not build a reef for fish to grow in is a real error in 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
 The emissions from trucks to haul this away could be counteracted by kelp 
beds, which have no place to anchor in sandy soil offshore. Fish go where kelp 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
 Reefs, if not too shallow, help the surf by calming the waters and providing 
glassy conditions. Decreasing the driving time of hauling trucks speeds the 
freeway construction and ultimately the commuter will get home sooner -- not to 
mention decreased cost in taxpayer-funded construction. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Interstate 5 widening is over, this opportunity will be lost.

SERVING THE NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for the article regarding how the charities are struggling these days 
to maintain the level of food distribution, aid to the homeless and counseling 
where the need is so great now ("Episcopal Group That Aids Needy Feels Pinch," 
Sept. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy of mention is that the Episcopal Service Alliance benefits from support 
by over 80 churches. Also, at its inception years ago in San Clemente, it was 
the South Orange County Community Services Council that convened the meeting of 
Episcopal, Methodist, Catholic and Presbyterian ministers and lay people to 
cooperate and communicate together. These partnerships are definitely the way 
to go.

PROP. 187 UNACCEPTABLE IN FREE SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times story "Prop. 187 Foes' Strategy Has a Twist" (Sept. 26) omits some 
important information. 
</P>
<P>
 It fails to mention that Proposition 187 was written by Alan Nelson when he 
was the lobbyist for FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform).FAIR 
received $1 million from the Pioneer Fund. The Pioneer Fund advocates 
"selective breeding" as a means of improving the quality of race and gives 
financial support to organizations promoting the notion that the "purity" of 
the white race is endangered by "inferior genetic stock." 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that as voters become more aware of the facts, more of them will 
oppose this initiative. If voters will read their ballot pamphlets, they will 
see that the California Legislative Analyst states: "The measure places at risk 
up to $15 billion annually in federal funding for education, health and welfare 
programs due to conflicts with federal requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Proposition 187 would turn teachers and health workers into 
"snitches," reporting children and patients to authorities, thus creating a 
police state atmosphere in California. This is unacceptable in a free society.

GRAZIANI LEADS OREGON TO 22-7 WIN OVER USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC was upset 22-7 Saturday at the Coliseum as Oregon's Tony Graziani, living 
a second-string quarterback's dream, threw for 287 yards and a touchdown in his 
first college start. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's first victory at the Coliseum in 23 years bore a striking resemblance 
to a 28-23 win on Oct. 9, 1971, when Dan Fouts was injured and Harvey Winn 
started and threw for three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson was an Oregon assistant on that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani, a sophomore filling in for injured star Danny O'Neil, completed 16 
of 31 passes and threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Cristin McLemore as Oregon 
(3-2) won its Pacific-10 opener against USC (2-2, 1-1.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Philyaw carried 27 times for 123 yards and scored on a 49-yard run and 
also caught three passes for 61 yards for the Ducks, who were 19-point 
underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's defense, with nine sacks, shut out the Trojans after the first 
quarter and sent quarterback Rob Johnson to the sidelines with a sprained right 
ankle in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson completed 20 of 30 passes for 237 yards, with one touchdown and one 
interception before he was hurt, but he was unable to move the Trojans with any 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Belden kicked three field goals for Oregon's other points. Belden 
provided the only scoring of the second half, kicking a 24-yard field goal 
midway through the final quarter after he hit a 43-yarder with 33 seconds left 
in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks took a 16-7 lead midway through the second quarter when Graziani 
threw to McLemore, who came clear across the middle of the end zone. Graziani 
drove the Ducks 70 yards to that score, completing one throw of 32 yards and 
another of 19 yards in the march. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind 10-0, the Trojans scored on a seven-yard pass from Rob 
Johnson to Keyshawn Johnson late in the opening quarter. Keyshawn Johnson also 
had a 27-yard catch in the 66-yard scoring drive.

WHEN BASEBALL WAS DOMINATED AND DOMINEERING; CRAWFORDS MAY HAVE BEEN BEST-EVER 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ROBINSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were arguably the greatest team in baseball history, one so good it might 
have been the best professional team in any sport ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher was the dominant player of his lifetime. The catcher hit the 
longest home runs of all time. The center fielder-manager was so good that 
rather than being compared to Ty Cobb, Cobb was compared to him. Two other Hall 
of Famers rounded out the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 How good were they? They frequently didn't reach double-digit losses until 
June. They so devastated major leaguers on post-season barnstorming tours that 
even the incomparable Babe Ruth often refused to oppose them. They called 
Pittsburgh home, but were such a popular gate attraction they won games and 
fans in virtually every state in the union. 
</P>
<P>
 They had only one strike against them: they were black men playing a white 
man's game in the 1930s. That solitary strike was a life sentence because it 
barred many of the great black ballplayers from the major leagues forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 60 years later, the 1933-36 Pittsburgh Crawfords must rely on colorblind 
historians and the fading memories of their dwindling fandom to keep their 
memories alive. They must hope that history doesn't forget that not only did 
they equal the 1927 Yankees and the 1970s Reds and 1940s-50s Yankees, they 
almost certainly were better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best team that was ever put together in any country -- the best 
team, Negro or white," a rather biased Satchel Paige wrote in his 1962 
autobiography. "We played everywhere, in every ball park you could find, and we 
won like we invented the game." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, too. The Crawfords, who gave Pittsburgh's largely black Hill 
District a national identity and self-respect decades before desegregation, won 
Negro National League pennants in 1933, 1935 and 1936. Many of their stars then 
crossed town to lead the Homestead Grays to a record nine consecutive pennants. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige, catcher Josh Gibson, center fielder Oscar Charleston, third baseman 
Judy Johnson and outfielder Cool Papa Bell, perhaps the fastest player in 
history, represent the Crawfords in the Hall of Fame. The '27 Yankees also have 
four position players in the Hall, plus two pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crawfords, named for a Pittsburgh bath house that sponsored a semipro 
team, were owned by Gus Greenlee, the king of Pittsburgh's black numbers racket 
and a nightclub operator in a thriving Hill District area known as Little 
Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crawfords played most of their home games at Greenlee Field, but they 
often staged exhibition games at every whistlestop along the Negro League 
circuit. Sometimes, they played four games a day in three cities -- morning, 
afternoon and a doubleheader at night, with Paige pitching at least once and 
sometimes twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's almost impossible to imagine Roger Clemens and Ken Griffey Jr. 
playing a morning game in Wheeling, W.Va., an afternoon game in Steubenville, 
Ohio, and a night-time doubleheader in Pittsburgh. But in the rugged Depression 
days of the 1930s, well-paid players often made only $150 to $250 a month, and 
every exhibition they squeezed in meant extra bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige was the showpiece, a man who pitched nearly every day, winter or summer, 
for 20 years in the United States, Canada, South America or the Caribbean. He 
won more than 2,000 games during a career that began in the 1920s -- and, 
because his age was never accurately documented, perhaps earlier -- and 
stretched into the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 With a vast collection of pitches he gave catchy names such as the "beeball," 
"trouble pitch" and "hesitation," he often won as many as 75 to 100 games in a 
year and was a frequent 30-game winner in the Negro Leagues. He pitched at 
least 55 no-hitters and, conservatively, struck out 25,000 hitters -- nearly 
four times as many as Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige often saved his best pitching for the barnstorming tours that all 
ballplayers, white or black, took in those tough economic times. Once, upon 
learning a Ruth-led team was ducking him, Paige said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take our team and we'll play the All-Stars from the major leagues. 
We'll play them right across the country, anywhere and anytime. And we'll beat 
them so bad they won't ever play anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 This was more than braggadocio. Black historian John Holway has documented 268 
black victories in 400 games against white major league teams, and Paige 
himself went more than four years without losing a single off-season exhibition 
on the West Coast, where many of the tours stopped for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Satchel was a great pitcher when he finally got to the majors" in 1948 at age 
42 with the Indians, former Negro Leaguer Clarence Bruce said in a 1988 
interview. "If he had made it 20 years before, they wouldn't have been able to 
hit him. He might have won 450, 500 games." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Paige in a memorable 1-0, 13-inning exhibition in 1934, Hall 
of Famer Dizzy Dean said, "I'm pretty fast, but my fastball looked like a 
change of pace alongside that little pistol bullet Satchel shoots up to the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
 White players, accustomed to a segregated game that emphasized the long ball 
over speed and cunning, were run ragged by the black teams. But when homers 
were needed, nobody -- not even Ruth -- hit them like Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth's 60-homer season of 1927 was nothing to Gibson, who once hit 75 in a 
140-game Negro League season. During the barnstorming tours, Greenlee routinely 
offered promoters their money back if Gibson didn't homer twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the greatest hitter I've ever seen and I mean the greatest . . . Ruth, 
Williams, Aaron," Hall of Famer Monte Irvin said of Gibson, a .379 career 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Charleston, a left-handed power hitting player-manager, hit over .400 five 
times and played so shallow in center field he was accused of being a fifth 
infielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Run? He could run like a deer," Irvin said. "He could run all over the field. 
He was just as good a fielder as Willie Mays and as good a hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, like Gibson a native Pittsburgher, hit nearly .400 in exhibition games 
against major league teams and his .437 average in Mexico in 1940 is one of the 
highest documented averages in any professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the attention paid Paige and Gibson -- Paige is thought to have 
played before 10 million spectators in his lifetime -- Johnson was often 
overlooked. But manager Connie Mack once said, "If he were white, he could 
write his own price." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Robinson integrated the majors in 1947, and other blacks, including 
Irvin, soon followed. Their effect on the majors was undisputed; blacks won 
nine of the next 11 MVP awards and dramatically altered how the game was 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin only wished integration had come sooner so a baseball-loving nation 
could have seen the truly great -- most of all, the Crawfords.

WHEN BASEBALL WAS DOMINATED AND DOMINEERING; BLACK CARDINALS DEALT AWAY 
PREJUDICE, FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was this time during the indignity years, when Bob Gibson was told where 
he could live in spring training because he couldn't live with the white 
Cardinals. And he laughed at the memory, 33 or 34 years later. Nobody cared to 
check whether they were breaking curfews or eating well or getting rest or 
anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had complete freedom," Gibson recalled with that hot-eyed look he used to 
flash on the mound. "The club rented this old taxi for us to get back and forth 
to the field. Nobody messed with us." 
</P>
<P>
 One day he said to George Crowe, the sage of the black players then, "Do you 
think they're having as much fun as we are?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Crowe said, in Gibson's memory, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, it was the absolute lie. Perhaps it was intended to deceive 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The monumental baseball series on public television had taken us who weren't 
there into the time of the Negro leagues and the indignity of being excluded. 
Gibson and Crowe, Curt Flood, Bill White endured the transition, when they 
could play big league baseball if they were good enough, but weren't permitted 
to live as big leaguers no matter how good they were. Still Gibson recalls the 
Cardinals of his time the way combat veterans recall the devotion -- even love 
-- of the men whose lives they shared. 
</P>
<P>
 In his just-published book, "Stranger to the Game," Gibson takes a line from 
"The Way It Is," by Flood: "The men of that team were as close to being free of 
racist poison as a diverse group of 20th-century Americans could possibly be." 
Gibson is making the rounds promoting the book. He said the evaluation still 
holds. Gibson loved being on that team with Stan Musial; Ken Boyer, the 
"blue-eyed devil;" Tim McCarver, the wide-eyed kid from Memphis outgrowing his 
racism; Joe Torre, Lou Brock, White, Flood and Manager Johnny Keane. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson's innings were the 1960s, when he was as fearsome a pitcher as ever 
glared down a hitter. He was so good in 1968 -- at one stretch he permitted two 
earned runs over eight weeks -- that he was at the center of a rule that 
lowered the mound to give the hitters a chance. His time came out of the 1950s, 
when he was told there would be no basketball scholarship for this kid from 
Omaha to Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
 That was my school. The letter came back to Gibson's high school coach that 
the "quota of Negroes" had been filled. IU had selected Hallie Bryant from 
Oscar Robertson's high school in Indianapolis. Bryant started as a senior; 
Gibson went on to star at Creighton. He writes about watching Bryant on TV and 
thinking, "They got the wrong Negro." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent a winter playing with the Globetrotters and left. "It wasn't 
demeaning," Gibson recalled Tuesday. "It was entertainment; I understood that. 
I wanted to kill." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a pretty good self-description of a pitcher who could move a hitter 
away from the plate and then drop a slider on the outside corner. He'd put on 
this fearsome mien, never speaking to an opponent, challenging a newspaper man, 
hiding real insight by bristling. He wasn't mean, and there was insight. "I 
test everybody -- always," he said. "Still do. If they handle it, fine. If they 
don't, they never go through it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1958 he went to St. Petersburg to be a Cardinal, went on a 
train, somehow eluding three guys who threatened to rough him up for being 
black. He walked across the street from the station to the Bainbridge Hotel, 
team headquarters. He was directed to a side door where a taxi awaited to take 
him to a boarding house in the black part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Elston Howard was staying there, and Crowe, Marshall Bridges, Ellis Burton, 
and more, in this lady's house. "Edith," Gibson said. "Man, she was the meanest 
woman. We got $54 a week for living expenses and she took $49. She gave us two 
meals a day; we ate what she had. Talk about a strong person." 
</P>
<P>
 This was 1958 through 1961. "We knew it wasn't right, but what were we going 
to do?" Gibson said. In 1960, when he was a Cardinal, he drove from Nebraska to 
Florida, stopping only at cities that might have a black section with a motel, 
stopping only at major gas stations to avoid confrontations. "My daughters had 
to go to the bathroom," Gibson said. "And I asked the guy if he had one. He 
said, 'We have one for you around back.' I looked into this hole, dirtier than 
anything I'd seen until I saw the bathroom at City Hall here yesterday. (Book 
tours will open a man's eyes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the kids to go in the bushes. I told the guy to cut off the gas." The 
indignity suffered by the man and his wife -- the mother and the father -- is 
not explained easily 30 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "You deal with it," he reflected. "You don't forget it. Patience never was one 
of my virtues. George Crowe taught me patience. I'm better now." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962 some St. Louis people bought a comfortable motel in St. Petersburg 
with arrangements to rent to the Cardinals -- all of them. And the likes of 
Musial and Boyer, the giants, passed up their individual comforts to stay with 
the team. "There had been no intermingling away from the field," Gibson said. 
"Friendship is what you do after the ballgame. You get over fears and prejudice 
when you get to know people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson and McCarver grew close when they could stay together. "I didn't test 
Boyer; we respected each other an awful lot," Gibson said. "McCarver was an 
18-year-old who didn't have much use for blacks. He went 180 degrees, evolving 
into a wonderful person from a snot-nosed kid. He'd say the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson would say much the same of his own evolution. I remember how he 
couldn't straighten his arm. I remember Dal Maxvill, the shortstop, telling how 
he'd gone to the mound in the seventh game of the 1967 World Series -- the day 
the Boston newspaper headlined "Lonborg and Champagne" -- and knowing by 
Gibson's eyes that he wouldn't lose. "Those babies," Maxvill said, "were 
burning." 
</P>
<P>
 Legend says Gibson deliberately hit Tommie Agee with the first pitch he saw as 
a National Leaguer. Gibson insists that wasn't so. It was his reputation and it 
served him well. He was such a competitor Joe Torre brought him to the Mets as 
"attitude coach." Years later Gibson and Maxvill had a falling out. When Torre 
wanted Gibson to coach for the Cardinals, Maxvill, then the general manager, 
blocked it. Gibson says he thinks the issue is "deeper than that," but can't or 
won't elaborate. He still has something to give young players, but it's not 
likely to happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 He has his own status and valued relationships. Unlike army buddies, a number 
of those Cardinals have maintained their links. Gibson often stays at Torre's 
home. Gibson and McCarver keep in touch, see each other, hunt together. And 
Gibson can recall the times when the black Cardinals weren't allowed to stay 
with the red Cardinals, and wasn't that fun.

BUNGLING SAN JOSE STATE GETS ROUTED BY CAL, 55-0; NONCONFERENCE: BEARS TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF ONE SPARTAN ERROR AFTER ANOTHER TO WIN BY SERIES-RECORD MARGIN.

 Matt Clizbe turned a bungled punt into a 62-yard touchdown run as part of a 
28-point first quarter and California went on to rout San Jose State, 55-0, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (1-4), who gave up 35 first-quarter points in a 54-20 loss to 
Baylor three weeks ago, had one breakdown after another in their worst loss to 
Cal in a 33-game series dating from 1899.The defeat surpassed San Jose State's 
52-3 loss to Cal in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Bears (2-2) have won seven in a row against the Spartans, and have 
won the last four by a combined 188-49. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad day at black rock," San Jose State Coach John Ralston said. 
"Needless to say, we had an inability to tackle, an inability to generate 
anything on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 It went bad from the outset for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobbi Williams fumbled the opening kickoff and Bobby Shaw recovered at the 
San Jose State five. Nine seconds into the game, Tyrone Edwards ran in for the 
touchdown from two yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans failed to get first downs in their next two possessions, gave up 
a 53-yard punt return to Na'il Benjamin and allowed two more scores on Cal 
drives that totaled five plays. Reynard Rutherford completed those drives with 
touchdown runs of 29 and two yards for a 21-0 lead.

 Ron Powlus threw three touchdown passes and set up another touchdown with a 
44-yard run as eighth-ranked Notre Dame defeated Stanford, 34-15, Saturday in 
South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus completed 10 of his first 11 passes for 168 yards, including touchdown 
passes of 15, 10 and 47 yards for the Irish (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal quarterback Steve Stenstrom, closing in on Pac-10 and Stanford 
passing records in his senior year, completed 37 of 59 passes for 360 yards, 
with Mark Harris catching scoring passes of nine and 19 yards in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom became the third player in Pac-10 history to pass for 9,000 career 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Powlus who was being praised afterward by Stanford Coach Bill 
Walsh.

<P>
 "He is an outstanding quarterback, but I don't think it's even close to what 
you are going to see," Walsh said. "Greatness will come soon for him." 
</P>
<P>
 And Stenstrom? 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one great player," Walsh said. "It was a gallant performance by a guy 
who just wouldn't quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, who threw for more than 300 yards for the 11th time in 14 games, 
increased his career passing yardage to 9,349, tying former Stanford great John 
Elway for second place, 44 shy of the conference record set by Oregon State's 
Erik Wilhelm (1985-88). 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the defense had an incredible day," Powlus said. "There's no 
question Steve Stenstrom is a great quarterback. He did many, many great 
things. Everything is coming around (offensively). The running game is finally 
coming around. . . . Things have worked out for us. The offensive line is doing 
a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal (1-2-1) opened an early 3-0 advantage on a 34-yard field goal by 
Eric Abrams after a penalty nullified a Stanford touchdown on the game's 
opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish built a 10-3 halftime advantage despite having the football only 7 
minutes 52 seconds in the half, then took command with 24 consecutive points in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's victory prevented Stanford from becoming only the third school 
this century to defeat the Irish on their home field three consecutive times.

COMMENTARY; ULTIMATE SYMBOL: BANNER IN STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The banner came back to the offices of AAA American Flag Decorating on 40 W. 
37th St from Nashville last Friday. The president of the company, Ian Flamm, 
removed the layers of wax paper in which it had been shipped to see if there 
were scratches on either the vinyl surface, or the enamel lettering. A powder 
had been applied in Nashville, as a way of preventing the enamel paint from 
sticking to the wax paper. Flamm gently brushed away the powder in his office 
on the fifth floor and saw that the whole thing was perfect, the blue vinyl and 
the red-white-and-blue Rangers logo at the top and then underneath the logo the 
white numbers and letters that read "1993-94 Stanley Cup Champions." 
</P>
<P>
 There were already three other banners -- proclaiming the Rangers as champions 
of the Atlantic Division, the NHL's regular season and the Eastern Conference 
-- in storage at the Garden. Now Flamm, whose company has been making the 
banners and retired jerseys that hang in the Garden since 1968, picked up the 
telephone and called Garden executive Bobby Goldwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's here," Flamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does it look?" Goldwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like we worked on it for 54 years," Flamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamm worked on it a little more during the weekend and then his crew brought 
it to the Garden Monday morning. It is supposed to go to the top of the 
building next Monday night, when the Rangers are scheduled to begin their home 
season against the Penguins. Now it looks as if there is no schedule and the 
season may be delayed indefinitely because the people who run hockey, starting 
with a very smart commissioner named Gary Bettman, are acting like bigger 
idiots than Clueless Bud Selig and the baseball owners. Baseball had emptied 
out so many October nights and handed them over to the National Hockey League. 
It turns out the NHL does not want these October nights, or this kind of 
once-in-a-lifetime stage to start a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who run all sports do not just take the games now, they take our 
ceremonies as well. They take the end of baseball and the beginning of hockey. 
They think they own everything, including next Monday night. Ian Flamm's banner 
stays locked in a room at the Garden, guarded by Building Operations. Rangers 
fans may have to wait to see it go to the top of the Garden. But then they know 
more about waiting than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some talk that they might put up all new banners, even for the old 
Stanley Cup champs," Flamm was saying yesterday. "I sketched one that would 
have had the Stanley Cup as a backdrop. But they finally decided that this one 
should just look like the others, so that's what we went with." 
</P>
<P>
 AAA American Flag does not get much sports work anymore. The Yankees were with 
them once, but then the Yankees went to another company, not that they have 
given that company any work lately. AAA does a lot of work now with banks; 
their flags fly from flagpoles in front of Citibank and Chemical Bank and 
Bankers Trust. But they have stayed with the Garden and the Garden has stayed 
with them. AAA American Flag waited a long time to do the work that signifies 
the end of the waiting for the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole collection of my banners they never used," Flamm said. When 
the Rangers made the Stanley Cup final in 1979, he was ready with both old and 
new designs, especially after the Rangers won the first game of the finals 
against the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before Game 7 against the Canucks, he sent over his drawings to 
Rangers president Neil Smith and Barry Watkins, who came out of the old blue 
seats to be the Rangers p.r. man. They both decided to go with tradition. The 
banner for '93-94 would look the same as the other ones, from '39-40 and '32-33 
and '27-28. When the time came, Flamm sent his sketches and his purchase orders 
to a painter in Nashville that he has used for years. The painter then 
purchased 50 yards of 16-ounce reinforced enamel-receptive vinyl and cans of 
One-Shot enamel paint in red and white and blue. The vinyl was cut into a piece 
that is six feet across and 10 feet high, and the painter went to work on the 
Rangers' Stanley Cup banner. 
</P>
<P>
 A long way from hockey and from New York City, the Tennessee painter drew the 
logo and then wrote "Stanley Cup Champions" under that logo at last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give this guy a lot of work," Flamm said, "but I told him this work was a 
little more special than the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 This coming Sunday, the Garden riggers were supposed to have a rehearsal of 
Monday night's ceremony, attaching the banner to the pole that would take it to 
the rafters, making sure it was smooth when it got up there, making sure it 
hung straight. But it looks as if there is no season on Monday, maybe for a 
long time. Bettman and the NHL owners want a salary cap, and of course the NHL 
Players Association aren't going to go for that, and so Bettman is prepared to 
lock out the players. The banner stays in a storage room on the fifth floor of 
the Garden and does not go into the sky where it belongs, up there with the 
three new banners from last season and the Stanley Cup banners and Eddie 
Giacomin's No. 1 and Rod Gilbert's No. 7; up there with all the banners and 
jerseys from the old Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was even going to ask for a ticket myself," Ian Flamm said. "I just wanted 
to see it go up, and then I was going home. I open up here around six o'clock 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's regular season was supposed to end this weekend, in New York and 
everywhere else. It was supposed to end with the Yankees in first place in the 
American League East, and so Monday was supposed to be the start of one of 
those weeks when New York still felt like the capital of the sports world. 
Think about what it would have been like here: The baseball season ending 
Sunday, the Rangers raising their banner and beginning their home season 
Monday, the Yankees playing their first postseason game in 13 years on Tuesday. 
Don Mattingly would have been getting the first postseason innings of his life. 
And that would have been some week to remember in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the baseball season ended in August. The hockey season probably will not 
begin this weekend. Seasons are lost, seasons are postponed, even the sweetest 
rituals of sport must be put on hold. Maybe the Stanley Cup banner in storage 
is a symbol of it all. Even when the waiting finally ends for Rangers fans, 
there is more.

WHITE POWERS ARIZONA PAST OREGON STATE; PACIFIC 10: HIS THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES 
FUEL A 30-10 VICTORY, BUT THE WILDCATS GIVE UP 185 RUSHING YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dan White threw three touchdown passes and No. 6 Arizona, despite having 
trouble stopping Oregon State's running game, remained unbeaten with a 30-10 
victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State (1-3, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference) ran for 185 yards, the most in 
28 games against the Wildcats (4-0, 2-0). Arizona had been giving up only 36.3 
yards per game on the ground, second-best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had us on the run," Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. "I'm not sure there's 
a team we've played in the last three years that had us on the run like they 
did in the first half. They very easily could have won." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arizona's defense recovered three fumbles, leading to field goals by Steve 
McLaughlin. Chris Lopez caused two of the fumbles and Tedy Bruschi recovered 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 White connected on first-half scoring pass plays of 47 yards to Richard Dice 
and 13 yards to Lamar Harris for a 20-10 lead at halftime. McLaughlin had 49- 
and 25-yard field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin added a 32-yarder midway through the final quarter, and Dice caught 
a 34-yard pass from White with 2:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers rushed for more yards than any team against Arizona since Arizona 
State gained 192 in the final game of 1991. Oregon State also was the last team 
to gain more than 200 yards against the Wildcats, getting 238 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Donald Shanklin carried 12 times for 85 yards, including a 51-yard 
run that set up Randy Lund's 26-yard field goal. He passed for 101 yards, 
completing four of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 His longest completion was a 38-yard pass play to J.J. Young. He also went to 
Young on a 33-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin's long run surpassed the longest ground gain Arizona gave up all last 
year -- Young's 33-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiwaun Carter gained 114 yards on 26 carries for Arizona. White completed 14 
of 21 passes for 194 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona drove to the Beavers' 20 on the game's opening drive before Buster 
Elahee sacked White for a 12-yard loss on third down. That forced the Wildcats 
to settle for McLaughlin's 49-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's second field goal came about 90 seconds later, after Lopez 
stripped the ball from Young.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; MICHIGAN GETS BACK ON WINNING TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyrone Wheatley ran for 182 yards and two touchdowns in his first start of the 
season and No. 7 Michigan rebounded from its loss to Colorado last week to 
defeat Iowa, 29-14, Saturday in Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan, 3-1 overall, also got three field goals from Remy Hamilton and a 
touchdown run from Wheatley's backup, Tim Biakabutuka, in winning its 13th 
consecutive Big Ten opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa (2-3, 0-2) led, 7-3, after quarterback Ryan Driscoll's one-yard touchdown 
run with 12:23 left in the second quarter. But the Hawkeyes didn't make another 
first down until the 2:23 mark in the third quarter. By then, Michigan was in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines scored 10 points in the final two minutes of the first half to 
go ahead, 13-7, and led, 22-7, before Iowa finally regrouped on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa had a chance to make it a game after Driscoll hooked up on fourth down 
with Scott Slutzker on an 11-yard touchdown pass, cutting the lead to 22-14 
with 14:11 remaining. Michigan's Seth Smith fumbled the ensuing kickoff and 
Iowa's Pat Boone recovered at the Wolverines' 29. 
</P>
<P>
 But two illegal procedure penalties stymied the Hawkeyes and Tony Henderson 
blocked Brion Hurley's 40-yard field goal attempt. Michigan then drove 77 yards 
in 11 plays to the game-clinching touchdown, a 12-yard run by Wheatley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley, looking more like the player he was before separating his right 
shoulder in preseason practice, carried eight times for 50 yards on the drive. 
The injury kept him out of the first two games this year, but he came back to 
rush for 50 yards in 17 carries a week ago against Colorado, which won, 27-26, 
on a 64-yard touchdown pass on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 22, Illinois 16 -- Corey Rogers ran for two touchdowns and the 
Boilermakers (3-1, 1-0) stopped Illinois tight end Ken Dilger on the one-yard 
line on the game's final play as Purdue upset the 25th-ranked Illini in 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois (2-2, 1-0) had an apparent touchdown pass from Johnny Johnson to 
Martin Jones called back by a holding penalty with 56 seconds left. But Johnson 
completed a 23-yard pass to Jasper Strong and carried for a first down to the 
Purdue 10 with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 After downing the ball to stop the clock, Johnson flipped a short pass to 
Dilger, who turned, hesitated and tried to get in the end zone but was stopped 
short by cornerback John Jackson. Purdue players then swarmed the field in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State 17, Northwestern 15 -- Eddie George rushed for 206 yards in 39 
carries as No. 20 Ohio State rallied and then held on for the victory in 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Buckeyes' 19th consecutive victory over the Wildcats (1-2-1, 0-1) 
and the fourth game in a row that George rushed for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But George's fumble with 8:21 to play could have been costly for the Buckeyes 
(4-1, 1-0) had teammate Matt Finkes not made a saving tackle on Northwestern's 
two-point conversion try with 5:01 left in the teams' Big Ten opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 25, Minnesota 14 -- Indiana, struggling throughout on offense, turned 
turnovers into second-half touchdowns by Reggie Bryant and John Paci to win in 
Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gophers, leading, 14-10, at halftime, turned the ball over on four of 
their first five possessions in the second half, including twice on 
interceptions by Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (4-1, 1-1) couldn't score after the first interception, but Bryant 
returned his second theft 80 yards for the go-ahead touchdown late in the third 
quarter. After an exchange of punts, Minnesota (2-3, 0-2) reached the Indiana 
18 before Eric Smedley recovered a fumble on an attempted lateral by 
quarterback Tim Schade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers took over at their 45 and moved 55 yards in 12 plays, with Paci 
scoring the final touchdown from the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's Alex Smith, the nation's No. 2 rusher at 157.3 yards a game, was 
held to 22 yards in 16 carries.

WISCONSIN TURNS OVER BALL, GAME TO SPARTANS; BIG TEN: THE 15TH-RANKED BADGERS 
LOSE TWO FUMBLES, ARE INTERCEPTED TWICE AS MICHIGAN STATE WINS, 29-10.

 Duane Goulbourne scored two touchdowns and Michigan State's defense came up 
with four turnovers as the Spartans defeated the 15th-ranked Badgers, 29-10, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, 2-2 overall and 1-1 in the Big Ten, which had four turnovers in a 
55-17 loss at Colorado, lost two fumbles and two interceptions to the Spartans 
(2-2, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers, who came in averaging 523.7 yards on offense, were held to 297 
yards. Michigan State had 420 yards, 259 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers had to play the second half without quarterback Darrell Bevell, 
who left with a separated shoulder during Wisconsin's only touchdown drive, 
late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell completed four of seven passes for three yards. Jay Macias finished for 
the Badgers, completing 10 of 17 for 68 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Banks, a junior college transfer from San Diego making his fourth start 
for the Spartans, completed 10 of 13 for 161 yards. He has gone 60 attempts 
without an interception. Goulbourne rushed 26 times for 115 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gardner kicked field goals of 37, 28 and 19 yards and redshirt freshman 
Marc Renaud wrapped up the scoring on a 41-yard run for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Moss, who rushed 27 times for 173 yards and one touchdown, joined former 
Heisman Trophy winner Alan Ameche and Billy Marek as Wisconsin's only 
3,000-yard rushers. Moss now has 3,125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss has rushed for at least 100 yards in 15 consecutive games.

PENN STATE WAKES UP TO TOPPLE TEMPLE, 48-21; NONCONFERENCE: AFTER A SLOW START, 
NITTANY LIONS PULL AWAY DESPITE CARTER'S THUMB INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Freddie Scott caught three touchdown passes and Jon Witman ran for two scores 
as No. 4 Penn State overcame a terrible start and an injury to star running 
back Ki-Jana Carter to defeat Temple, 48-21, Saturday at Franklin Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter dislocated his right thumb in the second quarter after accumulating 178 
all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple (2-2), a 44 1/2-point underdog, led, 6-0, at the end of the first 
quarter, the first time the Nittany Lions (5-0) had trailed this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple quarterback Henry Burris led the Owls on two early drives that ended in 
field goals, using a variety of draws and short passes to take advantage of a 
banged-up Penn State defense that was missing two starters on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first quarter, I could see the goal posts falling down and Philly 
going crazy," Burris said. "But I knew they were too strong and they were going 
to strike back because they're so explosive." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State took over in the second quarter, as Kerry Collins engineered 
several long scoring drives. After Temple had pulled to within 21-12 with 1:14 
left in the half, Penn State marched quickly downfield and Collins hit Scott 
with a 21-yard touchdown with 22 seconds left. A failed two-point conversion 
pass made it 27-12 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins finished 12 of 19 for 286 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played our guts out," Temple Coach Ron Dickerson said. "We weren't 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a year and a half away from competing with teams of this 
caliber," said Dickerson, a Penn State assistant from 1985-90.

WYOMING GIVES NEBRASKA A SCARE, 42-32; NONCONFERENCE: PHILLIPS, BERRINGER LEAD 
NO. 2 CORNHUSKERS, WHO RALLY FROM 21-7 DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Tom Osborne didn't give No. 2 Nebraska or its coaching staff high grades 
after the Cornhuskers struggled to a 42-32 victory over Wyoming on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we played terrible football today, but we can do better than 
that," Osborne said. "If we don't play better, we're going to have a hard time 
from here on out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Phillips and backup quarterback Brook Berringer each scored three 
touchdowns to rally the Cornhuskers from a 21-7 first-half deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sputtering start, Osborne had praise for his backup quarterback, 
who made the first start of his career in place of Tommie Frazier, out at least 
two weeks because of a blood clot in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Berringer was hospitalized Saturday night with a partially 
collapsed left lung, according to a broadcast report. Team doctor Pat Clare 
said Berringer could leave the hospital today and Osborne said the injury did 
not appear serious and it looks like Berringer will be able to play next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer scored on runs of five, 24 and 10 yards and the Cornhuskers (5-0) 
needed each one to get by Wyoming (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Nebraska team probably had to deal with a tremendous amount of 
distractions this week with the Frazier situation," said Wyoming Coach Joe 
Tiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "And to our credit, we came down and executed well. We had some success, and 
to their credit, they adjusted to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer rushed 12 times for 74 yards and completed 15 of 22 passes for 131 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt freshman quarterback Jeremy Dombek, making his first start for 
Wyoming, threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Harris on the Cowboys' second 
possession, then found Jeremy Gilstrap from six yards out with 25 seconds left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, using a conservative game plan without Frazier, managed only 58 
yards in the first quarter and didn't score until Phillips vaulted in from one 
yard out with 5:25 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nebraska didn't put the game away until Phillips' eight-yard run following 
a Wyoming turnover in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, ranked third nationally, finished with 27 carries and 168 yards in a 
one-sided duel with the Cowboys' fifth-ranked Ryan Christopherson, who was held 
to zero net yards in 12 carries.

SOONERS GET GOING ON GROUND AND GRIND OUT A 34-6 VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The No. 21-ranked Oklahoma Sooners, beset by a poor ground attack in the first 
three games, ran for a season-high 334 yards in a 34-6 victory over Iowa State 
Saturday in the Big Eight opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners (3-1) returned to the wishbone, but used it only 22 times and 
passed five of those times.They gained 93 yards in 17 rushes and the only 
touchdown out of the formation was a three-yard run by James Allen in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That was about what Coach Gary Gibbs expected. He had said the Sooners would 
use three backs more often, but also vowed that there wasn't about to be a 
return to the days when Oklahoma ran all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rushed the football much better than we had in our first three ball 
games," Gibbs said. "(The wishbone) will give us an opportunity to do a variety 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen ran for 111 yards and scored twice. A three-touchdown second quarter was 
too much to overcome for Iowa State (0-5), which hurt itself with three 
turnovers in losing to Oklahoma for the 32nd time in the past 34 meetings.

SAN DIEGO STATE'S GUTIERREZ HAS BUSY NIGHT TURN SOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Gutierrez of San Diego State set career highs by completing 35 of 59 
passes for 421 yards, but he also threw five interceptions and the Aztecs lost 
to Air Force, 36-35, in a Western Athletic Conference game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force, 2-3 overall and 2-2 in the WAC, scored 20 points off eight San 
Diego State turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons also blocked a punt out of the end zone for a safety, blocked a 
field-goal attempt and caused havoc with their triple option attack out of a 
modified wishbone. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (2-3, 0-2) lost its third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez's third touchdown pass of the game, a 12-yarder to Will Blackwell 
with 5:05 left, pulled the Aztecs within one point. But Gutierrez's conversion 
pass deflected off DeAndre Maxwell's hands and was intercepted by Kelvin King. 
</P>
<P>
 King also intercepted a pass in the end zone with 2:03 to play, and Mark 
Sotallaro recovered a fumble by Ray Peterson, who had called for a fair catch, 
with 1:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force's LeRon Hudgins fumbled the opening kickoff, which led to a San 
Diego State touchdown two plays later. But he atoned for that with a 26-yard 
interception-return touchdown in the third quarter that gave the Falcons a 
29-14 lead.

ATLANTIC COAST; N.C. STATE PUT IN LINE BY BENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever North Carolina State is in a jam, it seems Geoff Bender always comes 
to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender saved the No. 22-ranked Wolfpack one more time on Saturday, running for 
a touchdown and directing two turnover-aided drives in a 21-13 victory over 
Georgia Tech at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's any more than any other quarterback can do," Bender said. 
"The coaches just do a good job of preparing and it's just like practice out 
there. You get the look you want and run the play." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Wolfpack offense failed to move behind injured quarterback Terry 
Harvey, North Carolina State, 4-0 overall and 2-0 in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, went to Bender again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender's heroics started in 1991, when he came in and led the Wolfpack to 
victories over North Carolina, Georgia Tech and South Carolina. Last year, he 
led a comeback from a 21-0 deficit against Duke that fell one point short. 
Earlier this season he replaced Harvey in a game against Clemson and threw a 
touchdown pass in a 29-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done it over and over and over," N.C. State Coach Mike O'Cain said. 
"Talent-wise, there are quarterbacks out there much better than Geoff Bender. 
But for a young man who has poise and guts and character, I don't think there 
are many like Geoff Bender." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Bender came in and tossed a 22-yard pass to Eddie Goines late in 
the first half to set up his eight-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 With N.C. State trailing, 10-7, at the break, Bender directed a pair of drives 
that ended in one-yard touchdown runs by Carlos King. The first score came 
after Harvey Middleton fumbled the second-half kickoff and Drea Major 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 King's second score came with 7:55 left in the third quarter and followed a 
37-yard interception return by Ricky Bell to the Georgia Tech three. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech fell to 1-3, 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson 13, Maryland 0 -- The Tigers shut out the Terrapins for the second 
consecutive season as Antwuan Wyatt ran for 134 yards in an ACC game at 
Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson (2-2, 1-2) scored all its points off three turnovers by Maryland (2-3, 
1-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt, switched from receiver to tailback this week, became the first Clemson 
rusher to gain 100 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina 28, Southern Methodist 24 -- The Tar Heels had trouble holding 
the ball and a big lead against SMU, but backup quarterback Mike Thomas' 
67-yard touchdown pass to Octavus Barnes sealed their victory in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th-ranked Tar Heels (3-1), who led, 21-3, in the third quarter, lost 
four fumbles, one at the Mustangs' goal line late in the second quarter and 
another near midfield with 2:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But SMU (1-4) wasted a final chance when a holding penalty and an 
unsportsmanlike conduct foul on Coach Tom Rossley forced the Mustangs into a 
first-and-40 from their 21 with no timeouts left. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive ended on downs and North Carolina, which was coming off a 31-18 loss 
to Florida State, ran out the clock in an unimpressive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest 33, Army 27 -- Rusty LaRue threw for 263 yards, going to 12 
different receivers, and scrambled 14 yards for the winning touchdown as the 
Demon Deacons (2-3) survived Army's 386-yard ground attack and won at 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Army fell to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 37, William & Mary 3 -- Symmion Willis completed 11 of 15 passes for 
236 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for one as the Cavaliers (3-1) rolled 
to victory over the Division I-AA Tribe (4-1) at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke 47, Navy 14 -- Spence Fischer set a Blue Devil record by completing 23 of 
27 passes as Duke (5-0) won in Annapolis, Md. Fischer, who threw for 286 yards, 
completed 85 percent of his passes against Navy (0-4), breaking the single-game 
mark of 81.8 percent, set by Ben Bennett in 1983 and tied by Steve Slayden in 
1986.

DAR DAR RUNS SYRACUSE PAST VIRGINIA TECH, 28-20; BIG EAST: RUNNING BACK'S 
34-YARD TOUCHDOWN PLAY PAVES WAY FOR UPSET OF 14TH-RANKED HOKIES. 
</P>

 Kirby Dar Dar zig-zagged through the Big East's top defense on a 34-yard 
touchdown run with 5:42 to play Saturday, propelling Syracuse to a 28-20 Big 
East victory over No. 14 Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Orangemen (4-1, 2-0), who 
overcame a 20-14 deficit in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dar Dar's third touchdown of the day was just the second second-half touchdown 
the Hokies (4-1, 2-1) had allowed this season but it was enough to end their 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dar Dar's backup, Malcolm Thomas, had a 42-yard scoring run with 2:33 to play 
for the final margin. Thomas finished with a career-high 145 yards in 15 
carries and Dar Dar had 108 yards in 21 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time two Syracuse backs rushed for 100 yards in the same game 
since 1980, when Glenn Moore and Ken Mandeville did it against West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech entered the game allowing just 81.5 yards rushing per game and 
an average of 8.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Williams kicked a career-best four field goals to keep the Hokies in the 
game as Virginia Tech struggled offensively without its leading rusher, Dwayne 
Thomas, who sat out with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties hurt the Hokies, who were called for 12 infractions for 94 yards.

MIAMI BOUNCES BACK, DEFEATS RUTGERS, 24-3; BIG EAST: HURRICANES FORGET ABOUT 
WASHINGTON, TUNE UP FOR FLORIDA STATE BY DEFEATING KNIGHTS.

 Chris T. Jones scored on an 82-yard pass play and set up a touchdown with 
another reception as No. 13 Miami used a couple of big second-quarter plays to 
defeat Rutgers, 24-3, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 67th in a row for the Hurricanes against an unranked 
opponent and came a week after Miami saw its NCAA-record 58-game home winning 
streak ended by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, 3-1 overall and 1-0 in the Big East, wasn't able to take all of its 
frustrations out on Rutgers (2-3, 1-2) because its offense was sporadic. But 
the Hurricane defense, which knocked Rutgers quarterback Ray Lucas out of the 
game just before halftime with a partially dislocated shoulder, was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a win?" defensive tackle Warren Sapp said when asked if he was 
satisfied with the margin. "What's the big thing about beating a team to death? 
This game isn't for humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp set up a 14-yard touchdown run by Michael Stewart with a fumble recovery 
and 19-yard return. Miami's other scores came in the fourth quarter on a 
21-yard scoring pass from Frank Costa to Jonathan Harris and a 29-yard field 
goal by Dane Prewitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back on our way to where we should be," said Miami Coach Dennis 
Erickson, whose team next faces Florida State.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; BARKER LEADS ALABAMA OVER GEORGIA, 29-28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jay Barker threw for a career-high 396 yards and Michael Proctor kicked a 
32-yard field goal with 1:12 remaining to give No. 11 Alabama a 29-28 victory 
over Georgia, ruining a record-breaking night for Bulldog quarterback Eric 
Zeier on Saturday at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier became the yardage leader in Southeastern Conference history, throwing 
for 263 yards and four touchdowns to give him 9,327 yards in his career. That 
eclipsed the career record of 9,287 set by Florida's Shane Matthews from 
1989-92. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as has happened so many times to Zeier, who finished 25 of 33, his 
individual achievements were overshadowed as Georgia, 3-2 overall and 2-2 in 
the SEC, lost an important game that would have kept the Bulldogs in contention 
for the conference title they haven't won since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama (5-0, 3-0) came into the game with the worst passing offense in the 
SEC, but Barker, as he has done often in his career, rose to the occasion. He 
completed 26 of 34 for the second-best passing game in school history, to Scott 
Hunter's 484-yard performance against Auburn in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker is 28-1-1 as the Tide's starting quarterback, and his knack of finding 
a way to win was never more apparent than on Alabama's game-winning drive. He 
scrambled 13 yards for a first down and hit Tony Johnson with a 22-yard pass 
play that put the Tide in position for Proctor's third field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia still had plenty of time when Zeier got the ball back with 1:03 
remaining on his own 22. He moved the Bulldogs out to the 40, but two 
incompletions in a row turned the ball over to Alabama on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 After Zeier's final pass sailed over the head of receiver Juan Daniels, the 
senior quarterback stormed off the field, ripped off his helmet and began 
yelling at no one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not know how we lost," Zeier said. "I had no idea about the record 
during the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas 42, Vanderbilt 6 -- Barry Lunney Jr. threw for 128 yards and three 
touchdowns in the first 15 1/2 minutes at Little Rock, Ark., and the Razorbacks 
had five touchdown passes in a game for the first time since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (2-3, 1-2 in the SEC) had only one touchdown in its last three games 
but scored touchdowns on five consecutive possessions in the first half to take 
a 35-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt is now 1-3, 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State 49, Arkansas State 3 -- Michael Davis rushed for 120 yards 
and Mississippi State's big-play defense returned three interceptions for 
touchdowns at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenging a 15-15 tie a year ago, Mississippi State (3-1) dominated on defense, 
particularly in a 21-point third quarter that featured Davis' 58-yard touchdown 
run and a 41-yard pass interception return for a touchdown by Walt Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas State (1-4) took a 3-0 lead on Jeff Caldwell's 45-yard field goal 
five minutes into the game, but Mississippi State's defense then took command. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina 18, Louisiana State 17 -- Stanley Pritchard's one-yard 
touchdown run with 12:52 remaining gave the Gamecocks (4-1, 3-1) an SEC victory 
over the Tigers (1-3, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Taneyhill completed 23 of 30 passes for 157 yards, with 24 coming on a 
touchdown pass to Toby Cates. Pritchard was South Carolina's leading rusher 
with 90 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU's Jamie Howard, who was intercepted five times by Auburn in the fourth 
quarter two weeks ago, was intercepted twice by South Carolina.

IT'S GETTING TOUGHER, BUT FLORIDA STILL ROLLS; SEC: DEAN, JACKSON LEAD NO. 1 
GATORS, WHO PULL AWAY FROM 14-14 TIE TO DEFEAT MISSISSIPPI, 38-14. 
</P>

<P>
 It was the closest game of the season for top-ranked Florida, yet it was still 
a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dean threw four touchdown passes as the Gators defeated Mississippi, 
38-14, Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean and Jack Jackson combined on two touchdowns in the final 8:37 of the 
first half as the Gators, 4-0 overall and 3-0 in the SEC, took a 28-14 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida scored 14 points in the first two minutes of the game, but Ole Miss 
bounced back, tying the score at 14-14 on Fred Thomas' 83-yard interception 
return with 7:09 left in the first quarter. But Ole Miss was shut out after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean completed 19 of 32 passes for 292 yards and increased his touchdown total 
to 17, although he had three passes intercepted after being picked off once in 
the first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry had some bad plays, but a lot of good plays . . . a lot of beautiful 
throws to Jack Jackson," Florida Coach Steve Spurrier said. "Jack caught 
everything he touched today." Jackson caught six passes for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators still haven't given up a point in the second half this season, 
allowing Ole Miss (2-3, 1-3) just 46 yards after the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense shut them down completely. Very seldom do you lose games when you 
shut them out in the second half," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first minute of the third quarter, Ole Miss quarterback Josh Nelson, 
while running away from pressure, threw his first interception in 145 attempts 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gilmore's interception set up Dean's second touchdown pass to Chris 
Doering, a six-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense sputtered in the second half," said Spurrier, whose team was held 
to 156 yards after gaining 325 before halftime.

GOLF ROUNDUP; ELKINGTON COMMANDING WITH A FIVE-SHOT LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Elkington birdied the first three holes Saturday in a four-under-par 68 
that increased his lead to five shots over fellow Australian Steve Rintoul 
after three rounds of the Buick Southern Open at Pine Mountain, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 At the turn, Elkington appeared to be headed to a record-setting lead after 54 
holes in a PGA Tour event. He had a nine-shot lead after nine holes, in 
position to break the mark of eight set by Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal in the 
1990 World Series of Golf. But a rally by Rintoul and Elkington's first bogey 
of the tournament on his 52nd hole cut four shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkington's 16-under 200 broke the three-round record on the 7,057-yard 
Callaway Gardens Mountain View course set by Gary Hallberg in 1992 and tied by 
Bob Estes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul, who started the third round with a triple bogey, recovered to post a 
70 and was alone in second place at 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Bryant was alone in third at 207. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dent moved into contention at the Vantage Championship for the fourth 
consecutive year when his second 66 in a row gave him a share of the 
second-round lead with Larry Gilbert at Clemmons, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent was deadly with his approach shots in a bogey-free round. But the senior 
tour's longest hitter has folded here in the past. Last year, he led by a shot 
heading into the final round before finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent and Gilbert are at 12-under-par 132 after two rounds, but seven golfers 
are within two shots of the lead, including Isao Aoki, who has won the last two 
weeks, and Raymond Floyd, who had 10 birdies Saturday in a 64. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Birdies on three holes in a row on the back nine helped Liselotte Neumann take 
a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the LPGA Greater Heartland Classic in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Neumann's five-under-par 67 gave her an eight-under 208 total, one shot better 
than Deb Richard and Pearl Sinn, from UCLA, who led after the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Amateur champion Wendy Ward, Sarah Ingram and Carol Thompson won the 
World Women's Amateur Golf Championship for the United States in 
Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, France. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans completed the four rounds seven under par at 569, four shots 
ahead of South Korea.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL; BISHOP AMAT ROLLS AT BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, it might be nice to have a state high school football playoff, but in 
1994, it might not be necessary -- not as long as La Puente Bishop Amat High is 
part of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, led by running back Daylon McCutcheon's 221 yards and four 
touchdowns, dismantled highly touted Bakersfield, 34-3, Saturday night before a 
record crowd of 23,701 at Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was no doubt we were the best team in the state," McCutcheon 
said after Bishop Amat, ranked No. 1 in The Times' Top 20 poll, improved its 
record to 4-0, while dropping Bakersfield to 3-1. "I have confidence in my team 
and confidence in myself. When we play our game, there's no one that can touch 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Drillers, regarded as the Central Section's top team, managed only 35 
yards in offense. Bakersfield running back Steve Wofford, who had rushed for 
more than 500 yards in the Drillers' first three games, was held to 17 yards in 
nine attempts. The Lancers, meanwhile, rolled up 370 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's anyone else out there rated No. 1, I sure don't want to schedule 
them," Bakersfield Coach Pat Preston said. "They're an awesome football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bishop Amat Coach Tom Salter: "Everything just went our way tonight. We 
were real scared of their offense going in, but our defense did a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line dominated the game and we wore them down in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound senior, scored on runs of 17, 55, 26 and 12 
yards, showing what has made him one of the most sought-after players in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the hype for this game really pumped us up," McCutcheon said. "We knew we 
were going to back up our No. 1 ranking." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss halted Bakersfield's 24-game regular-season winning streak. Bishop 
Amat, meanwhile, won its 24th consecutive regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter isn't ready to call his team the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't call us that yet," Salter said. "We have a lot of tough games left. 
The only one that really matters is the last one of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon rolled up 154 total yards in the first half, including 128 rushing, 
and two touchdowns. He also intercepted a first-quarter pass to set up his 
17-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon's second touchdown came on a 55-yard explosion up the middle, 
giving the Lancers a 14-0 lead at the half.

MOTORCYCLE RACING; ERMOLENKO OVERCOMES, RETAINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, when Sam Ermolenko held the national championship trophy aloft at 
the Orange County Fairgrounds, it was the crowning achievement of the triple 
crown of speedway racing. 
</P>
<P>
 He had returned from Europe to earn the title after winning the World Final 
and competing on the victorious United States team in the World Team Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, he retained his U.S. speedway title before 8,723 at the 
Fairgrounds' track and, while the victory only salvaged a disappointing season, 
he was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko, a 33-year-old native of Cypress, seriously injured his leg in a 
crash in the British League two weeks after winning here. 
</P>
<P>
 "My season has been below average," said Ermolenko, 13th in the World Final in 
August, "but I worked my butt off to rehab to the point where I could sort of 
fake my way through this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko managed to return to top form Saturday night. He finished second in 
his first heat -- 16 of the top riders in the country each compete in five 
four-man races -- and then won his next four races. 
</P>
<P>
 He outlasted everyone in the final heats and won the last race going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back here from the bigger tracks in Europe is always a test," said 
Ermolenko, who will race in England on Wednesday, "but I was really pumped up 
tonight. This is really a great feeling. It's a reward for working so hard."

HORSE RACING ROUNDUP; SUPER DERBY VICTORY SONG BY BACHARACH

<P>
 Southland-based Soul Of The Matter, in his last race before the Breeder's Cup 
Classic in November, defeated co-favorite Concern by a neck to win the $750,000 
Super Derby at Louisiana Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, owned by composer Bert Bacharach and ridden by Kent 
Desormeaux, covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:03 2/5 against a field reduced to six 
3-year-olds when two entrants were late scratches. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, fifth in the Kentucky Derby, earned $450,000 for his 
fourth victory in seven starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, trained by Dick Mandella, returned $5.80, $3.60 and $2.60. 
Concern, the Arkansas Derby winner ridden by Jerry Bailey, paid $3.20 and 
$2.40, while Bay Star, with Pat Day aboard, returned $3.00. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveller edged Fastness by a length to win the $200,000 Bay Meadows 
Handicap for 3-year-olds. Blues Traveller, ridden by Gary Stevens, covered 1 
1/8 miles on turf in 1:46 and paid $6.20, $2.80, 2.40. Fastness returned $2.60 
and $2.40 and Wharf paid $3.20.

FAIRPLEX; PEDROZA PROVIDES THE KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John E. Pinner, owner of Set On Cruise, is in for a pleasant surprise when he 
finds out that his horse won a four-horse photo finish in Saturday's $100,000 
Pomona Derby at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse's trainer, Danny Velasquez, made no secret about how he expected the 
race to be run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handicapped the race and felt we could get second or third behind Flying 
Sensation," Velasquez said. That might have been part of the reason Pinner was 
absent for the biggest victory of his career. The more important reason was 
because he was attending a father-daughter dance. 
</P>
<P>
 What he missed was a perfect ride by Martin Pedroza, who found a hole along 
the rail in the stretch and beat Warning Labell, Attleboro and Flying Sensation 
in a blanket finish of the 1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of victory was a head and was made possible because of the ground 
Pedroza saved on the backstretch when Flying Sensation, under David Flores, was 
making a strong move from fifth place in an eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he went too soon," Pedroza said. "I let him go by and just waited 
for something to open." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Flying Sensation took the lead at the top of the stretch, he couldn't 
pull away and eventually finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flying Sensation was the class of the field," Velasquez said, "but he was 
going from a sprint to a distance, and it's not always that easy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brotherly Love, ridden by Eddie Garcia, broke fast and held off Sticky N Picky 
and Steve Treasure for a neck victory in the $25,000 Pomona Quarter Horse 
Championship, the third race on Saturday's card. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third year in a row Garcia had the winning mount in the 400-yard 
race. He won with Easter Buggy in 1992 and with Reign Of Terror last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if we got out of the gate, I'd be OK," Garcia said. "I thought I won 
by a half-length, but everybody told me it was closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Treece, who trains the horse for owner Sherri Barham of Yorba Linda, 
called Brotherly Love "one of the best horses I've had." He claimed him for 
$8,000 in 1991. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, the winner of the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs, was bet 
down to 4-5 at Fairplex Park and paid $3.80 to win. . . . Seahawk Gold, a 4 
1/2-length winner of the C.B. Afflerbaugh Stakes on Sept. 25, and Nancys French 
Fry head a field of 10 in today's $150,000 Pomona Invitational Handicap. 
Berillon is the defending champion but is 12-1 on the morning line.

STYLE: ARCHITECTURE; FRESH OFF THE DRAWING BOARD: AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN ACTIVISM 
GIVES NEW MEANING TO COOL IN CULVER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joseph Giovannini, Writer and architect Joseph Giovannini's last article for 
the magazine was about Los Angeles' avant-garde architects.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took an earthquake and collapsed overpasses to force motorists off the 
Santa Monica Freeway into Culver City, perhaps the most bypassed city in the 
world. But once there, tens of thousands who had only a 65-m.p.h. overview of a 
town known mostly for the old MGM and Selznick studios encountered several 
buildings that acted as semaphores flagging something new. 
</P>
<P>
 Along National Boulevard, in a 57-acre industrial tract of largely empty 
factories and obsolete warehouses, passers-by saw the corner of a long building 
erupting in a cage of off-kilter steel and glass obscuring the black metal 
silhouette of a cloaked figure. On the next corner, another building supported 
a levitated box with canted walls and roof. Both buildings bracketed a third, a 
factory with an oddly tilted canopy centered on a partially hidden oval entry. 
</P>
<P>
 For Culver City-based maverick developer Frederick Samitaur Smith, these 
structures represent an urban idea whose time has come. More than a half-dozen 
of Smith's renovated stucco and concrete factories, abandoned by industries 
that have folded or relocated, are shaping a neighborhood for the small 
businesses emerging as the area's primary growth employers. Culver City's 
Hayden Tract is starting to look like an updated SoHo, only the urban pioneers 
reinvigorating the underused and abandoned 40- and 50-year-old warehouses, and 
hanging out at the local diner, JJ's Cafe, are not artists but graphic 
designers, computer jocks, advertising whizzes and independent film producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has identified small, creative "neo-industrial" enterprises that thrive 
in informal, non-corporate loft spaces. "I try to talk the guy who is inventing 
a mechanical toilet for the handicapped to come into the project because he's 
intellectually starved at Imperial Highway and Lankershim," says Smith, an 
unconventional developer partial to blue cowboy boots. "There's nobody next to 
you to mow the lawn growing in your brain. We're creating a community. I'm not 
after creative types alone, not just filmmakers, but also high-tech industrial 
users like image-processing companies." 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith and his company, Samitaur Constructs, which has remodeled about 
175,000 square feet and has about 600,000 on the drawing board, the metaphor 
and lure of this new community is architecture. Eric Owen Moss, the Culver City 
architect known for a handful of radically deconstructed buildings and many 
architectural awards, has designed all of Smith's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's building-by-building bid at reclaiming the area in and around the 
Hayden Tract coincides with several other improvements undertaken by Culver 
City and by Sony, the largest company in town. The city's Community Development 
Department is now rebuilding the notoriously tangled triangle of downtown 
streets, at the intersection of Washington and Culver boulevards, refurbishing 
the storefront business district and redesigning eastern boulevards -- creating 
a sense of place in what has long been a drive-through no man's land. Meanwhile 
Sony, ensconced where the MGM lion once roared, has restored and expanded its 
vast studios and is adding an Art Deco-style television studio off-campus. The 
synergy of entrepreneur, city and corporation is waking Culver City from an 
urban slumber that made it the last of the Westside areas near the beach to be 
developed. The surprising new buildings, streetscapes and landscaping are 
significant because of their artistic quality and because design is being used 
to redefine the city's identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has been chipping away at the Hayden Tract since 1987, starting with 
8522 National Blvd., a group of now fully occupied light-industrial buildings 
brilliantly reorganized and rebuilt by Moss into a beehive for computer 
scientists, filmmakers and graphic and video designers. He next tackled Ince 
Boulevard and transformed the old Paramount Laundry building opposite the 
Culver Studios into multilevel, cat-walked loft space. To create a diverse 
community, Smith and his wife and business partner, Laurie, have also sought 
the unexpected tenant: The mix in one building on Hayden Boulevard includes two 
architecture firms, a ballet company and a metal fabricator whose space is part 
studio, gallery and future cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's target tenant doesn't need office space in a conventional high-rise. 
Take, for instance, the independent film and record company IRS ("Tom and Viv," 
"The Beans of Egypt, Maine," the Go-Go's, dada), which recently located in 
Smith's building at the corner of Hayden and National. "Why did we come here?" 
asks Paul Colichman, the high-energy, rapid-fire president of IRS' film 
division. "I wanted to be close to where we do business, which is primarily 
Beverly Hills, but we looked there, and in order to get the same amount of 
space, it was going to cost twice as much money to get half as good a building. 
I thought to myself: 'Why am I paying this kind of money to be in an 
uninteresting building when I can go 10 minutes south, have a really gorgeous 
building designed by a totally interesting on-the-edge architect and built to 
my specifications for half the price?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Companies like IRS work best in roomy, loosely laid-out buildings rather than 
rigidly structured ones. The IRS building's exploded corner, with the image of 
a shadowy IRS agent lurking at the back of the steel-and-glass cage, is merely 
a logo attached to a structure remarkable for its informality and complexity. 
In the center of the two-story structure, Moss carved out a narrow courtyard as 
an alternative to interior corridors: Multiple paths in the honeycomb encourage 
chance encounters. "The difference between a conventional office building, 
which is conformist, and here," says Jay Boberg, Colichman's counterpart at IRS 
Records, "is the difference between suffocation and spontaneous combustion. The 
space really lends itself to the fury and flurry of activity that the creative 
process demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design helps socialize the company and spark ideas -- we don't have 
meetings in long corridors lit by fluorescents," he continues, pointing out the 
clerestory windows and sunken court outside everyone's offices, the latter used 
for impromptu meetings. "We were attracted to this kind of SoHo community that 
involved everything from ballet and graphic arts to marketing. There are plans 
next door for an outdoor amphitheater and park. We like being part of the 
change in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Winogrond, director of the city's Community Development Department, 
acknowledges that dozens of warehouses are still vacant or underused but is 
optimistic about the future. "There's a long way to go before you could say 
that a new pattern dominates the landscape, but these things are inertial; a 
body in motion tends to stay in motion, and, definitely, Smith has generated a 
lot of motion." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith recalls that at first, officials wondered why he didn't stick to 
building concrete tilt-up structures like everyone else. Life, they said, would 
be easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when he presented 8522 National, when I headed the Community 
Development Department," says Jody Hall-Esser, now the city's chief 
administrative officer. "We were practically speechless when we looked at the 
plans. They broke all the rules and didn't deal with space, materials and 
construction in the traditional way. Then Smith moved on to two buildings on 
Ince Boulevard and those were even more dramatic: sewer pipes used for a 
cantilevered porch support. We didn't modify the plan; instead it liberalized 
our way of thinking and opened our minds. The building went on to win local, 
state and national design awards. Smith's buildings are an asset to the 
community, and they planted a deep seed." 
</P>
<P>
 The seed continues to change attitudes. Smith pays a premium for Moss' unusual 
and costly-to-execute designs, and the developer earlier this year obtained the 
city's tentative permission to have buildings themselves qualify for the 1% art 
requirement, which stipulates that 1% of a building's budget be spent on art. 
Smith argued that architecture -- or at least this kind of architecture -- is 
art, making Culver City perhaps the first city to make this important 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's efforts at creating a new community differ radically from Sony's more 
internalized efforts at maintaining its studios, which are largely private 
precincts sequestered behind high walls. The impressive Art Deco Irving 
Thalberg Building has been rehabbed and is visible from the street; exterior 
street sets have been redone: passers-by can spy those make-believe spaces 
through tantalizing breaks in the surrounding walls. "The combination of the 
landscaping, the care and repainting of buildings inside, and the new mystery 
glimpses have all added to the urban experience," says Winogrond, formerly the 
director of community development in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 City projects have taken a third direction. "The idea is to make parts of 
Culver City look like a typical small American town with a warm atmosphere, 
with cappuccino and chestnut carts on the sidewalk," says Mayor Albert Vera, 
owner of the Sorrento Italian Market on South Sepulveda. "The theme is really 
sort of modern, yet a little like towns back East -- decent and friendly to 
pedestrians." The mayor, who likes to wear a "Shop in Culver City" button, 
intends to patronize the design talent now working there -- some with 
international reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing for the public-sector development of this city of 40,000 people 
comes from tax increment funds yielded by the Culver City redevelopment 
program, which started 23 years ago with projects like Fox Hills Mall and 
Corporate Pointe. Funds have been used to restore the Culver Hotel downtown -- 
a tall, wedge-shaped brick leftover from the 1920s -- and to transform the 
long-derelict Mission-style trolley substation into a multipurpose cultural 
facility at the entrance to downtown. The two buildings, once eyesores, are now 
national historic landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an outdoor dining ordinance has been adopted, and sidewalks have 
been widened to create room for cafes, public art and benches. To help small 
businesses like Tokyo 7-7, a family-run, 40-seat Japanese coffee shop behind 
Main Street, stay in operation, a public parking structure has been erected and 
parking regulations have been eased. The city has approved a farmer's market 
downtown to open next spring and is distributing grants for facade 
improvements. In response, there have been several hundred inquiries about 
business start-ups, according to Miriam Mack, administrator for the city 
Redevelopment Agency. Among the most ambitious is a proposal by Danny DeVito to 
turn the Culver Theater into a nonprofit corporation to showcase films and 
small theater workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 The most adventurous Culver City proposal, however, may deal with simple 
street design. Los Angeles has been described as an environment of movement, 
but little positive effort has been made in the design of streets beyond basic 
engineering and tree-planting. Last year, the Community Development Department 
engaged Santa Monica building and landscape architects Campbell & Campbell and 
local environmental graphics designers Sussman/Prejza to redesign East 
Washington Boulevard from Ince to Fairfax -- one of the city's spines -- with 
an emphasis on the first few blocks leading into Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Sussman/Prejza, which played a leading role in designing the banners, flags 
and bunting that gave the 1984 Olympics their ebullient "look," has proposed 
adding a "sky gallery of floating murals" in the several blocks west of 
Fairfax. The gallery idea, enthusiastically greeted by citizens in community 
workshops conducted by the designers, recalls the famous parade of billboards 
along Sunset Boulevard. The Culver City billboards would be themed, perhaps 
representing movies filmed in Culver City -- "Gone with the Wind," "Citizen 
Kane," "Bugsy" -- or they might be abstract artworks by one artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a single monument but a sequential gateway formed by a number of 
elements," says the energetic and high-powered Deborah Sussman, whose offices 
are in the Smith-renovated laundry. "You experience it by driving through or 
walking by a kind of floating sky garden formed not just by the posters, but by 
the trees, new street furniture and specially designed street lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell & Campbell has proposed capitalizing on the existing colonnades of 
palms by placing low trees with wide canopies between them, to create a ceiling 
scaled for pedestrians. A user-friendly environment will help nurture small, 
isolated enterprises like Mi Ranchito, whose mole enchilada alone is now more 
of a magnet for the community than the surrounding streetscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most arresting proposal is Culver City's answer to Hollywood. 
Linked to Hollywood by the city's north-south surface roads, Culver City -- 
which claims to be the home of the world's first movie studios -- shares its 
movie-industry orientation. Why not, proposed Sussman/Prejza, build a competing 
HOLLYWOOD sign in the hills beyond Ballona Creek that spells CULVER CITY? 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the sign would spell out the whole name or just the initials CC, or 
some other variation, is still under discussion. But with or without the sign, 
Culver City is already rewriting its name on the mental map of the Los Angeles 
Basin.

CALTRANS WASTED MONEY ON PR FOR CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reopening of the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills has been marred by 
the fact that Caltrans wasted a huge amount of tax money on public relations 
for the construction. Apparently deciding its own people couldn't handle its 
own community relations, Caltrans approved two PR firms (The Sierra Group and 
Century Diversified) in two contracts totaling over $308,000 from January to 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts show the PR firms were being compensated at rates ranging from 
$121.16 to $25.20 per hour. This is the total of the base amounts of $72.12 and 
$15 per hour, plus overhead of 128%, fringe benefits of 28% and a fee of 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 The PR firms were grossly lacking in looking out for the local residents. They 
had no office at the construction project, preferring to operate out of 
Rosemead. They did not even have a sign at the project directing the public to 
them for six months, and when they put up signs, they were so small that you 
needed to be standing next to them to read them. Even though the contracts 
called for biweekly meetings with the community, they hardly held a meeting 
once a month. Maybe the most ludicrous rip-off was for several hundred hours 
charged for a beeper service and monitoring, costing upward of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't we all wish we could have made out in the earthquake as well as 
Caltrans' favored consultants?

IT'S WORTH EFFORT TO CHECK OUT CONTRACTOR; A BIT OF CAUTION CAN PROTECT 
HOMEOWNERS' QUAKE RELIEF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've waited in line. You've signed up for aid to cover the damage your home 
sustained in the Northridge quake. You've filled out the requisite forms. You 
dutifully waited for the inspectors who had to assess the situation, and you've 
been watching the mailbox every afternoon as if you could make that check 
materialize through sheer force of will. Now, that you finally have it, the 
hard part is over, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is time to be doubly careful. And you cannot allow the impatience that 
has undoubtedly struck by now to cloud your judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that much of the quake relief aid has only recently begun to 
flow. In the interim, people have been forced to live in homes that really 
suffered in the quake. Others have not even been able to occupy their homes and 
have been renting or have been forced to live with friends or relatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people now have to start from scratch. Folks are fed up, and want the 
repairs and the rebuilding done yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake has created a boom in local construction contracting. That's 
great for the local economy, and very bad for your patience quotient. At this 
point, some of the contractors you call say that they are booked up months in 
advance. It's become a classic sellers' market. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractors can pick and choose among the more lucrative jobs. Some say 
that they are tired of doing free estimates and are charging "token" fees just 
to look over the work to be done. And the added frustration of this new waiting 
game may just persuade some of you to throw up your hands and pay someone you 
haven't fully checked out. You must avoid that at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining the license number of each of the contractors you are considering 
and verifying it by calling the Contractors State Licensing Board 
(1-800-321-CSLB) is important, but it is only a first step. 
</P>
<P>
 You must also be certain that the contractor has workers' compensation 
insurance. So far, the CSLB has assessed 117 fines against contractors at work 
on quake repairs who could not furnish proof of such insurance. For the 
homeowner who hires a contractor who does not have insurance, the situation can 
turn into a nightmare. So says Dennis Bishop, the supervising deputy for the 
unlicensed activity unit of the CSLB, who is based in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If a worker is injured while repairing your home and the contractor does not 
have workers' compensation insurance, Bishop says, "the owner of the property 
could become liable." Bishop suggests that people ask contractors for a copy of 
their current certificate for workers' compensation and then call the insurance 
company listed on it for verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rules of thumb might seem equally burdensome, but can help you avoid 
headaches in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask for references and check them carefully. Anyone, Bishop points out, can 
drive by a work site, snap a photograph and then claim that they did the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have obtained a range of estimates, you should find that the high and 
the low should not differ by much more than 20%. Try to look at it like judging 
at the Olympics: If the bids vary by more than that, throw out the high and the 
low and consider the middle-range offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay away from contractors who ask for large amounts of money before they even 
start the work. State law restricts contractors to a demand of no more than 10% 
or $10,000 up front, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
 It's entirely possible that all of these steps will seem insufferable to you, 
especially since you've already waited months for the federal funds that will 
allow you to repair your home. Just remember that your home is the most 
important material investment of your life, and no one is going to cut you 
another aid check if you waste the one you have now.

VOICES JOINED AGAINST HATE VANDALISM; GLENDALE OFFICIALS WERE RIGHT TO TAKE A 
TIMELY STAND AGAINST TEMPLE DESECRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The effect of hate crimes is enhanced when they are allowed to occur without 
significant public condemnation. Silence can be perceived as disinterest, and 
perhaps even as a tacit approval of the act involved. Ignoring the problem can 
even embolden the perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the point that Rabbi Carole Meyers made after anti-Armenian slogans 
were spray-painted on the Glendale headquarters of an Armenian youth scouting 
organization, Homenetmen Ararat, last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to speak out and say, 'This (hate) is not what Glendale stands for; 
we welcome these people in our community,' " Meyers said last month in urging 
the Glendale City Council to form a hate crimes response team. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Meyers' Temple Sinai, the only synagogue in Glendale, was recently 
marred by six spray-painted swastikas, it was gratifying to see that much of 
the city's elected and appointed leadership had decided that the matter could 
not be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens, Police Chief James Anthony, the city manager, 
and City Council members Larry Zarian, Sheldon Baker, and Mary Ann Plumley were 
among those who appeared publicly at the temple with Rabbi Meyers to denounce 
the vandalism and to help cover it up with fresh coats of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even imagine why somebody would do something like this. This is not a 
rational act. It's hard to make sense of it," said Mayor Givens after using a 
paint roller to cover a swastika. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the important thing is not necessarily to try to make sense of what is 
most likely a senseless act. The thing to do is to demonstrate that such acts 
can neither be condoned nor tolerated. One way is to officially express that 
sentiment through the words and deeds of as many prominent people as possible. 
Glendale's local leadership is to be commended for doing exactly that.

STEPPING INTO THE VACUUM OF VIOLENCE; YOUTHS MUST BE STEERED TOWARD AN 
UNINTERRUPTED EDUCATION AND HONEST WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little Rock, Ark., is pretty far removed from the San Fernando Valley, but 
there are lessons to be found there for those hoping to sustain a tenuous peace 
between rival street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The HBO Special entitled "Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock" explored the 
record-setting pace of gang-related homicides in that city. During the course 
of the carnage, a few enterprising people did what they could to try to stop 
the killing. The city's coroner drove into the neighborhoods to display 
shocking post-mortem photographs of dead gang members. Churches adopted a theme 
of planting white flags. A task force was formed, and something of a decline in 
the killings was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seemed as though most of the efforts had been spent in attempting to 
calm tensions and put out fires. Very little was devoted to what should have 
been the long-term goal of trying to persuade those youths not to just avoid 
killing each other, but to seek another way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Valley, a truce between Latino gangs that was jeopardized by a 
murder this past week seems to have the very same shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacemaking efforts of William (Blinky) Rodriguez and a few church leaders 
here have drawn enough attention to attract an entourage from Saginaw, Mich., 
that hopes to duplicate the truce. But Rodriguez himself admits that most of 
his time is spent running from confrontation to confrontation. At some point, 
that won't be enough, nor should it be. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should a simple truce between gangs be allowed to suffice. In the case of 
the Oakwood section of Venice, for example, it is widely suspected that a gang 
truce there has merely allowed the gangs to resume their illicit drug dealing 
without the publicity of open hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 More people -- religious leaders, civic leaders and elected officials -- must 
get involved. They must step into the vacuum of the violence and steer more 
youths toward an uninterrupted education and honest work. Until then, the 
William Rodriguezes of the streets will struggle vainly to plug holes in a huge 
dam that could burst anytime.

SUBWAY OR MONORAIL -- OR NONE OF THE ABOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority faces a major decision on rapid transit in 
the San Fernando Valley: an underground subway using the Burbank-Chandler route 
or a monorail over the Ventura Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Combining two major transportation systems (monorail and freeway) would leave 
the city vulnerable. Calamities such as earthquakes, vehicle and building fires 
and large trucks hitting freeway support columns do happen with some 
regularity. Independent and separate transportation systems are worth having. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost estimates for the monorail over the freeway are grossly in error. 
Even before the recent earthquake findings, any elevated railway or monorail 
would require extensive lateral supports to provide lateral sheer strength. In 
many places in the San Fernando Valley, the freeway has insufficient median 
room for these necessarily wide supports. The lessons from the January, 1994, 
earthquake are that even more stiffness is required. Thus the real costs of the 
monorail plan would have to include extensive widening and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Monorails are intrinsically noisy, especially as they are elevated even more 
than the freeway. Our experience with the monorail in Sydney, Australia, which 
is a relatively low-speed monorail, was that it was extremely noisy. With 
higher speeds, the noise becomes even more of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Boulevard-Ventura Freeway corridor is already very congested. 
Adding a monorail would only increase the congestion. An underground system on 
the Burbank-Chandler route would create less crowding of facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Subways are the best choice; during the recent San Francisco quake, BART was 
unscathed and provided weeks of service while the freeways were unusable.

freeway route: earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 If we put both transportation systems in one location and the next earthquake 
knocks down a chunk of the freeway, we will have lost both transit systems. 
After our recent earthquake did just that, commuters were able to get to work 
using the rail system because it was not on the broken freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the ballot measure where people voted for the "monorail," I believe 
if this measure were put to a vote today, with all the facts available (it may 
in fact not be a "monorail" but an elevated train that would be built), the 
public would vote against the freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the people who live near the freeway if they will be delighted by the 
visual impact of a speeding monorail, especially as seen from their back yards.

regarding extension of the Red Line transit route into the San Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board members tell us that only two alternatives for a Valley rapid 
transit system are being considered: a $2.25-billion subway (that is too 
expensive and too susceptible to earthquake damage) and a $2.25-billion 
monorail system down the Ventura Freeway (that is too expensive and will make 
existing traffic jams on the 101 seem trivial). 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense dictates a Chandler-Burbank boulevards surface light-rail system 
that can be built quicker and for a fraction of the cost of the two other 
systems, that can utilize an existing right of way without jamming the Ventura 
Freeway and that can be considered to be safe from a seismic standpoint. There 
are three systems to consider, not two! And only the surface light-rail system 
makes economic and practical sense.

CSUN'S DEAF PROGRAM HAS A DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I commend The Times and reporter John Chandler for a solid piece of reporting 
about the shortage of funds to hire interpreters for deaf and hard-of-hearing 
students at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we have supplemented this service with more than $150,000 in 
recent weeks and exempted this area from cuts that other departments will 
experience because of the state's fiscal problems, we are still faced with a 
dilemma: Do we use these funds to hire more interpreters, to meet the students' 
bona-fide need for more service, or do we pay the interpreters we have more 
money to meet their reasonable expectation for greater compensation? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an uncommon dilemma for the state's public institutions. How do we 
serve the greatest need with the limited resources available? 
</P>
<P>
 The understandable protests of the students and interpreters illustrate the 
consequences of fiscal recession. 
</P>
<P>
 We at Cal State Northridge are very proud of our pioneering role in serving 
deaf and hard-of-hearing students. We are proud that we have the largest 
population of such students among mainstream universities; only Gallaudet and 
the National Technical Institute of the Deaf in Rochester, N.Y., have larger 
enrollments of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. 
</P>
<P>
 We are proud of our new deaf studies department, one of only two in the 
nation. (The other is at Boston University.) 
</P>
<P>
 The program will serve about 250 majors, 90% of them hearing students, taught 
by a faculty that is largely deaf or hard of hearing themselves, and produce 
well-trained and educated graduates to serve a nation sorely in need of their 
services.

WHAT CHANGES ARE CALLED FOR AT CSUN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After having read the statement that "changes are in order" in your editorial 
"2 Issues Inflame Tensions at CSUN" (Sept. 25) regarding the low graduation 
rates and length of time to graduate for minorities at CSUN, I am wondering 
what changes you had in mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you suggesting that graduation be made easier for minorities? That grades 
be "subsidized" for minority students? Or is this a result of poor 
pre-university preparation, or even lack of proper study habits?

AIDS WALK DESERVED BETTER NEWS COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can the Los Angeles Times virtually ignore 20,000 people in the streets of 
Los Angeles on Sept. 25? 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, The Times carried a short paragraph of sketchy information about 
AIDS Walk L.A. on Page 9 of the Valley section, while there were two front-page 
stories and nearly two full pages of copy relating to the O.J. Simpson murder 
trial (not to mention the article on the Voices page). 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll on the O.J. Simpson case reflected the opinion of 1,703 
Angelenos. None of the 20,000 walkers in the AIDS Walk were interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Will future historians have an accurate picture of Los Angeles society if they 
rely on the news media as their source of information? 
</P>
<P>
 Who were those 20,000 people who walked in the fight against this deadly 
epidemic? Does The Times feel its readers are not interested in this issue? Is 
this truly responsible reporting, or are reporters competing with each other 
for coverage by creating sensational news stories, and are editors demanding 
more of the same?

MAGNET SCHOOL NOT THE FIRST TO GO HIGH-TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Central Library may have the first magnet school to focus on 
accessing electronic information ("Magnet School Goes High-Tech," Sept. 19), 
but 74 other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District also have the 
same capability and on-line public access library catalogues. Another 125 
elementary, middle and senior high schools are in the process of having their 
computerized catalogues installed.Thirteen schools have had computer catalogues 
and telecommunications since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birmingham High School, students have used the Internet to access the 
library catalogues at UCLA, Los Angeles Public Library and the Library of 
Congress; to graph current weather data provided by the University of Michigan, 
and to send and receive E-mail. Birmingham has its own electronic bulletin 
board, which is available to students, parents and teachers. Students in the 
new journalism magnet program, as well as all other Birmingham students, will 
have opportunities to use the Internet during this school year.

CSUN STUDENTS DESERVE APPLAUSE FOR TAKING UP THE TORCH OF PROTEST; EFFORT TO 
OUST A WHITE INSTRUCTOR IS MISPLACED, BUT YOUTHFUL WARRIORS ARE EARNING THEIR 
LEADERSHIP STRIPES THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR. NO ONE SHOULD BE ALARMED OR 
APPALLED.

Coalition for the Empowerment of Children and Families in Glendale.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 21, 1965, when I was 11 years old, I stood huddled outside the Audubon 
Ballroom in New York City, waiting to gain entrance into what was to become 
Malcolm X's last public speaking engagement. With the sound of screams and 
people pouring from the building, what was to be an inspirational experience 
for a young girl turned into a nightmare. I learned firsthand about violence, 
the uncertainty of life and shattered dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered that experience when thinking of recent events at Cal State 
Northridge, where minority students have made some San Fernando Valley 
residents nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's ethnic rumblings began last year when African American and Jewish 
students clashed over the presence of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, African American and Latino students demanded the dismissal 
of a newly hired white instructor because of the color of her skin and the fact 
that she was unable to speak to minority students in the language of the barrio 
or the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a coalition of 200 faculty members and minority students marched to 
protest the reorganization of a $4.5-million program that provides grants and 
tutorial support to struggling students. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to oust the white teacher was especially sharply criticized and 
provoked charges of reverse discrimination. And I must say I disagree with the 
students on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us, however, the student unrest represents the actions of a new 
generation of minority students eager to carry the torch of human and civil 
rights. As with generations of student protesters before them, these youthful 
warriors will earn their leadership stripes through trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 No one should be alarmed or appalled by what is happening at CSUN. We are a 
nation that has repeatedly witnessed student movements of all dimensions -- 
from the practical to the engaging to the destructive to the totally 
outrageous. The fact that these students can protest in a way that encourages 
reciprocal respect from CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson is an indication that 
we are witnessing the maturing of tomorrow's leaders, as opposed to the 
development of tomorrow's fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 I was personally and profoundly touched by student protest. In the early '70s, 
as a naive college freshman attending Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., I 
was schooled by upperclassmen who passed on the art of protest with the 
reverence of bards handing down a celebrated oral tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, student protest meant forcefully establishing your agenda, 
fighting for a voice in campus policies and defining "turf" in regard to other 
student groups. Has the definition really changed? 
</P>
<P>
 The Holy Cross upperclassmen, who once included the likes of Clarence Thomas, 
had a track record to prove their point. Prior to my arrival on campus, they 
had taken over a campus building in protest of the college's investment ties to 
South Africa. While the investment question was never resolved, the students 
won the right to have a black-students-only residence floor, a special black 
admissions catalogue written and produced by black students, a greater voice in 
school policy-making and a close relationship with school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike us, the CSUN students didn't take over any buildings, destroy any 
property or make irresponsible statements to the media. Their protest 
dramatized their passion and sense of purpose -- something we middle-aged 
specimens used to feel, before we embraced the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 But we still have the emotional battle scars to remind CSUN protesters that 
true empowerment of youth and their ascension to leadership can come only from 
practice, learning one's boundaries, engaging others in meaningful dialogue and 
being engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The minority students at CSUN need to be applauded for their interest in 
wanting to pick up the torch some of us threw down when we graduated from 
college and got our first job offer. They need to be encouraged to play a 
significant role in the debate of issues that impact the lives of all students. 
We should applaud their ability to protest with clarity, humanity and 
intellectual rigor, especially when the issues they focus on will make America 
a more ethnically sensitive place for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 But CSUN students -- and all college students -- must take the time to learn 
from the mistakes of those who have gone before them -- those who confused 
honorable protest with advancing personal and self-serving agendas. They must 
be cognizant that discrimination against a white woman is as unacceptable as 
discrimination against an African American or a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 History repeats itself, even when it comes to students' flexing their 
intellectual and emotional muscles. As long as the CSUNs of this nation have 
administrators who will not be threatened by the same show of empowerment they 
themselves exercised in their youth, we should be able to pass the torch with a 
sense of peace and belief that our communities will survive a little radicalism 
now and then.

CSUN'S MISERY TURNS MACABRE; IF THE STATE BUDGET GOES HAYWIRE AS USUAL, THE 
'TRIGGER' CLAUSE COULD MEAN DISASTER FOR THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. IT'S WORTHY OF A 
POE TALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SOLOMON, Jack Solomon is an associate professor of English at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little over a year ago, I described in these pages the not-so-gradual 
whittling away of the full-time and part-time faculty at Cal State Northridge 
through an annual budget ritual that I referred to as "death by a thousand 
cuts." What I want to say now is that things have changed some since then -- 
for the worse. Now it's the pit and the pendulum. 
</P>
<P>
 I refer for my metaphor this time to Edgar Allan Poe's gruesome story about a 
prisoner of the Inquisition who is threatened, first, by a fall into a deep 
well, and then, after escaping the well, by a razor-edged pendulum aimed at his 
heart as he lies bound upon a plank. When he escapes this , the walls of his 
prison cell, heated to a red-hot temperature, begin to close in on him. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what it's beginning to feel like at Cal State Northridge these days. No 
sooner do we avoid one catastrophe then another, worse one looms. First, there 
was last year's budgetary brinkmanship. We escaped that. Then there was the 
earthquake. We're surviving that, too. And now, it's the "trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 The trigger: That's what will hit us if the state budget goes out of whack 
again, as it usually does sometime in the late autumn. For, thanks to the deal 
we cut this summer between Sacramento and the bankers who agreed to lend 
California the $7 billion it needs to balance its books, automatic, 
across-the-board budget cuts may be triggered if the books show red ink on Nov. 
15 -- a day of reckoning chosen by our wily legislators, I might note, to fall 
safely after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the walls are closing in on us. But isn't everyone funded by the General 
Fund in the same circumstance, and shouldn't we at CSUN be willing to pay our 
fair share to help balance the budget? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure we are, but that's not what we're being asked to do, because 85% of the 
state budget is constitutionally protected from the mandated cuts. That leaves 
only 15% of the budget to absorb 100% of the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do we find in that 15%? Among other things, that perennial California 
odd couple, higher education and prisons. But what with the "three strikes" 
bill and similar legislation, prison spending is slated to increase (its 
direction for years), leaving higher education with little company among the 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what we at Cal State Northridge are being asked to prepare for. One 
scenario calls for a 30% cut, which would mean laying off the entire part-time 
faculty -- if not the untenured full-time faculty as well. Another scenario 
presents us with the specter of a 50% cut. That would mean shutting down the 
entire CSU system for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of that. If the state chooses to balance its books on the back of higher 
education alone, the walls will close in on a lot of us, including anyone who 
has children in, or is now attending, a public high school, college or 
university. Because if the colleges and universities close for a semester, the 
graduation and progress toward a degree of tens of thousands of students will 
be delayed, creating a logjam that will affect California's entire system of 
public education for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you or your children can afford to attend a private university, or can 
afford the higher tuitions charged to California students who attend 
out-of-state public universities, or can afford to go through life without a 
college degree or career retraining, you should start caring now about what may 
happen this November. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope people vote for candidates who think that colleges are more important 
than prisons. I hope they tell their representatives in Sacramento, and the 
governor, that effective public education doesn't stop with a high school 
diploma, that the state has a responsibility to its children beyond the 12th 
grade. And maybe it's time to start thinking about a referendum to include the 
state college and university systems under the umbrella of constitutional 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, there might be another solution. We could re-designate all of 
California's state colleges and universities as prisons. And then we could also 
rename California. No longer the Golden State, it will be the Penal State. I 
think that would appeal to the imagination of Edgar Allan Poe, but is it what 
we really want?

 Simon Fuentes, Rancho Santiago's quarterback, used several talents to help 
power the Dons to a 50-27 upset of Long Beach in a Mission Conference football 
game Saturday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (3-1) was ranked sixth in the nation by the J.C. Grid-Wire. But 
unranked Rancho Santiago (2-1) dominated the final three quarters of the game. 
Fuentes tied a Rancho Santiago single-game record with four touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, a sophomore from Garden Grove High, was 15 of 21 for 245 yards. He 
also rushed for 34 yards, including a 27-yard scramble for a touchdown. He 
scored on a two-point conversion run as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes was at his best when he was on the move, either with a planned rolling 
out or when he eluded the rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simon was great," Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas said. "He broke their back 
with a couple of his scrambles." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes' biggest scramble came early in the fourth quarter. Long Beach had 
scored to cut the lead to 36-20. The Long Beach defense then had Rancho 
Santiago at its 26 on third and three. Fuentes rolled to his right and was able 
to duck away from the Long Beach rush. While he was getting free, wide receiver 
Roy Mendoza was headed across the middle near the Long Beach 40. Fuentes got 
the ball to Mendoza who, with the help of a block from Hector Flores near the 
goal line, scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown put the Dons ahead, 43-20, with 13 minutes 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going to dump it off," Fuentes said. "But my line did a great job 
and Roy came back to get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores also had a strong game, catching six passes for 103 yards. He and 
Fuentes combined on a 73-yard pass play for a touchdown in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons' strong rushing game was also key. Ace Riggins led the team with 79 
yards and Brian Diaz added 68 as Rancho Santiago compiled 280. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons' final score came compliments of the defense. Andre Holmes rushed in 
to block a punt, recovered the ball at the Long Beach three and ran it into the 
end zone for a touchdown with 6:15 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's defense turned in its second consecutive strong performance. 
El Camino had beaten the Dons, 55-28, in the season-opener, but the Dons came 
back to beat Palomar, 31-14, last week. The victory stopped the Comets' 20-game 
winning streak. Long Beach was held to 280 yards in total offense.

<P>
 Backup quarterback Eric Hannah hit James Hartford for two touchdown passes in 
the last three minutes, including a 10-yard scoring pass with 28 seconds left, 
to lift Fullerton to a 42-41 Mission Conference victory over host Pasadena on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah, a freshman from Servite, replaced starter Mark O'Brien after O'Brien 
was injured after losing a fumble in the third quarter. Hannah completed 15 of 
20 passes for 204 yards and three touchdowns in 18 minutes. Fullerton trailed, 
35-23, entering the fourth quarter, and 41-29 with four minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah's heroics helped overcome a 311-yard, four-touchdown performance by 
Pasadena's Saladin McCullough. McCullough returned a kickoff 98 yards for a 
touchdown, and rushed for three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Correa had 10 catches for 199 yards and two touchdowns for Fullerton 
(1-1-1), which had 504 yards in total offense. Fullerton led, 10-0, after one 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jacot ran for 82 yards in nine carries and scored two touchdowns for 
the Hornets. Pasadena is 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. San Antonio College 46, Orange Coast 24 -- Quarterback Cody Lee Smith 
passed for a school-record 558 yards and four touchdowns and ran for another as 
Mt. San Antonio College beat host Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a sophomore, was eight yards shy of the conference mark of 566 yards, 
set by Jorge Munoz of Southwestern College against San Diego Mesa in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who finished with 600 yards in offense, completed 27 of 47 attempts. He 
threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't even pass before he came here," Mt. San Antonio Coach Bill Fisk 
said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties (2-0-1) rolled up 714 yards overall. They led Orange Coast, 
26-24, early in the third quarter before pulling away on a one-yard touchdown 
run by Alex Brown late in the quarter and two fourth-quarter scores -- a 
54-yard touchdown pass from Smith to Yoda Martin with 9:14 remaining and a 
Kinsasha Lewis five-yard touchdown run with 2:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams scored on their first plays from scrimmage. Orange Coast (0-3) took 
a 7-0 lead when tailback Jeff Clayton hit wide receiver Chris Jackson on a 
65-yard option pass. Then Smith began his record-breaking performance with an 
80-yard scoring pass to tight end Marvin Allen to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino 44, Golden West 27 -- Zak Swoopshire scored three touchdowns and 
Leandrew Childs scored two as El Camino pounded host Golden West.  
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (0-3-1) closed the margin to 24-19 after Mark Crowley caught an 
11-yard pass from Brian Schneider, Crowley's third touchdown of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Swoopshire scored the first of his touchdowns on a 13-yard pass from Sarkisian 
with 7:52 left in the third quarter. But Golden West cut the lead to 30-27 when 
John Sears caught a 10-yard pass from Schneider 11 seconds into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (3-0) dominated the rest of the game. With 13:12 left in the game, 
Swoopshire, who rushed 10 times for 107 yards, scored again on a 39-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomar 27, Saddleback 6 -- Quarterback Gregg Wilbur completed 25 of 39 passes 
for 261 yards and one touchdown to lead host Palomar past Saddleback.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Palomar's special teams and defense that established an early lead. Two 
Alidad Compani field goals and a 68-yard interception return for a touchdown by 
Troy Baker gave Palomar a 13-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's only score came on a one-yard dive by quarterback Aron Garcia 
with 4:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Long Beach City water polo tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast wins three -- Orange Coast scored two goals in the final period 
to hold off El Camino, 12-10, in a pool-play game. Shad Wicker and David Kasa 
each had four goals for Orange Coast (7-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier game, Shad Wicker scored four goals for the second consecutive 
tournament game in a 12-10 victory over San Diego Mesa. FORREST LEE

<P>
 Ken Nash rushed for 63 yards and two scores to lead Calvary Chapel to a 28-21 
nonleague victory over Laguna Beach Saturday night at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle quarterback Waylan Kruse completed 12 of 15 passes for 178 yards and a 
touchdown to balance the Calvary Chapel attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (1-3) scored first, when Nate Pivaroff hit James Kimball on a 
nine-yard touchdown pass for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Calvary Chapel (3-1) scored the next 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash scored on an eight-yard run 30 seconds into the second quarter. Kruse 
then hit Aaron Fountain on a 17-yard scoring pass with 25 seconds left in the 
half for a 15-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash scored his second touchdown on a six-yard run late in the third quarter 
for a 21-6 advantage. The Eagles' final score came on the second play of the 
fourth quarter, when David Kuhn scored on a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists mounted a comeback that started with a Pivaroff one-yard touchdown 
run with 6:14 left to play. On Laguna Beach's next possession, Pivaroff hit Dan 
Styles for a 15-yard score, putting the Artists seven points behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists got one final chance with 19 seconds left, but Pivaroff missed on 
four consecutive passes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Liam McDonagh ran for 80 yards in 17 carries for Laguna Beach. Pivaroff 
completed seven of 17 passes for 96 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley 24, Dana Hills 10 -- Dwayne Cherrington rushed for 199 yards 
in 17 carries and scored two touchdowns for host Santa Ana Valley in the

</P>
<P>
 Cherrington, ranked ninth in Orange County in rushing, had touchdown runs of 
51 and 49 yards. He gained 155 of his 199 yards in three carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Those big plays beat the Dolphins (0-4). Dolphin quarterback Scott Maynard 
scored from four yards late in the third quarter, capping a 15-play, 65-yard 
drive and cutting the Falcon lead to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley (2-2) answered with a 39-yard touchdown run by quarterback 
Jason Parrott. Parrott gained 79 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>

<P>
 Reese scored from 38 yards on the Saints' first possession, then ran for an 
83-yard score with 2:15 left in the second quarter as St. Anthony (4-0) built a 
33-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are two divisions above us, but it would be a reach to say today was a 
positive experience for us," Southern California Christian Coach Bert Esposito 
said. "We came out a little better in the second half, but it's tough when you 
start six sophomores." 
</P>
<P>
 The only highlight for the Flames (1-3) came late in the game when fullback 
Ken Buhler ran 89 yards for a touchdown with 8:47 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Buhler finished with 117 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Conley scored from 13 yards with 2:28 left in the first quarter to give 
the Saints a 12-0 lead. They made it 18-0 when Aaron Decollibus scored from one 
yard on the first play of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Smith's 34-yard field goal put the Flames on the board with 5:19 left 
in the half, but Decollibus returned the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for a 25-3 
lead.

 After Reese ran for the 83-yard touchdown, Brian Walsh ended the St. Anthony 
scoring when he went in from five yards with 4:24 left in the third quarter.

 Neither team was successful passing. Flames quarterback Steve Schinofen 
completed three of eight for only 17 yards and Joshua Zak was two of six for 20 
yards for the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams combined for more than 200 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran 19, Sun Valley Village Christian 13 -- Orange Lutheran 
quarterback Joe Juliano rushed for 90 yards in 15 carries and scored a 
touchdown for the visiting Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers scored 19 first-half points and held on for the victory. Village 
Christian had a chance to win, but quarterback Chris Coleman's pass on fourth 
and 12 fell incomplete with less than one minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Funk had 89 yards and one touchdown in 24 carries and Ignacio Brache 
kicked field goals of 35 and 42 yards for Village Christian (1-3).

 FUMEBUSTERS: It's Rideshare Week in California, where you're urged to car-pool 
to promote year-round traffic improvement and reduce pollution. The Irvine 
Spectrum had a ride-share essay contest for youngsters to help out. . . . Wrote 
one alert winner, 8-year-old Michael Lisenby of Lake Forest: "My dad thinks red 
sunsets are beautiful. But it's really just dirt and toxic stuff in the air. I 
learned that in school. My dad and me have asthma. He thinks it's because of 
junk in the air -- from cars and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 SIGN THIS! It's bad enough when you're a political candidate and you get 
caught posting your election signs illegally. But how about when they catch you 
and you don't even have any signs? That's what happened to Loretta Sanchez 
Brixey, 34, an Anaheim City Council candidate. She received a stern letter from 
the city warning that she'd be subjected to penalties if her signs weren't 
removed immediately. . . . Oops. "Wrong form letter," explains city code 
enforcement spokesman Bruce Freeman. Letters of apology recently were sent out 
to Brixey and other candidates.

 NEW MOUNTAINS: Todd Huston of Newport Beach, whose mountain-climbing exploits 
include scaling Alaska's Mt. McKinley -- with an amputated leg -- has turned 
his interest into a vocation. Huston, 33, who lost his right leg in a boating 
accident as a teen, now gives motivational speeches around the country -- 
including the Sports Club/ Irvine on Wednesday. . . . "It's not just those with 
physical disabilities I can inspire," he says. "Many I've met along the trail 
are more disabled by things like divorce or drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 UPSCALE VARMINTS: People move to Villa Park because it's quiet, low in crime 
and well controlled. So Villa Park Councilman Bob Bell was not amused with what 
he found in his back yard -- a coyote. "A big one," he says. But, City Manager 
Fred Maley told him, there's no county or state agency to call to catch such 
animals in the city: "I think coyotes fall between the cracks."

RUSSIAN INFORMANT CREDITED WITH UNMASKING CIA SPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER PINCUS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Information given to the FBI by a former Communist intelligence officer 
allowed its agents to zero in on confessed spy Aldrich H. Ames in May, 1993, 
leading to his arrest nine months later, according to sources familiar with the 
investigation and the CIA inspector general's report on the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there have been hints since Ames' arrest in February that an 
informant had fingered him, the description in the 400-page classified report 
by CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz marks the first time it has been 
acknowledged officially. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the secrecy, according to government officials, is the 
sensitivity of the individual who was the source of the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI caught Ames after a Russian gave a description that came so close 
that they knew it was Ames," said a CIA official with knowledge of the affair. 
"If the FBI had not gotten that information and opened a criminal case, Ames 
(might) still be driving his Jaguar into the CIA parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, responsible for the worst security breach in CIA history, began spying 
while working in a sensitive office handling counterintelligence work against 
Moscow. He betrayed to the Soviets 36 U.S- and allied-paid agents and, 
eventually, more than 55 intelligence operations over nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Russian informant appeared, the CIA's hunt for the "mole" in its 
midst had been hampered by internal failures and bureaucratic wrangling, 
detailed in the report on Ames by Hitz and outlined by him to Congress last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA effort began in 1986, died in 1988 and was revived in 1991 with 
participation of the FBI. That joint effort was only "gradually (beginning) to 
show results" before the information from the Russian informant was obtained, 
Hitz told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant's statement was used by the FBI in May, 1993, to get Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno to sign a national security warrant that authorized review of Ames' 
bank, telephone and travel records without his knowledge or approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In June or July, 1993, again using information developed initially from the 
informant, the bureau went to a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court for authorization to carry out secret electronic surveillance of Ames 
through his telephone and his computer, according to sources familiar with the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer and written notes Ames sent to the KGB going back to 1990, as well as 
incriminating phone and home conversations produced by that surveillance and 
searches, provided the basic evidence against Ames. That evidence made it 
almost certain he would be convicted and led to his negotiating a guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
 A government counterintelligence official confirmed the FBI got important 
information in the spring of 1993, but declined to say how it was received. It 
"didn't name Ames, but it was so specific that he became the focus in a matter 
of days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 information to the FBI "really got us going," the official said. 
"Without it we would have kept going at a very, very slow pace, narrowing down 
the list of suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the CIA nor the FBI would comment on the informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure of the FBI's informant and his key role in catching Ames provides 
support for the decision by the White House and Congress earlier this year to 
give the FBI new authority to pursue counterintelligence cases involving CIA 
personnel.

DANA PARSONS: GIVE HER THAT OLD-TIME RELIGION WITHOUT THE POLITICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "I'm fit to be tied," the sweet little voice said. 
</P>
<P>
 When you write a newspaper column and someone calls up and says, "I'm fit to 
be tied," you drop everything to listen. Often, the caller's unhappiness is 
predictable or not particularly interesting. What holds my attention most is 
when, as the bettors say, someone goes against form. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the woman Friday began by saying, "I'm a registered Republican and I 
count myself a believer," and then proceeded to upbraid churches for getting 
involved in politics, I wanted to hear why. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is self-serving. I long ago wearied of preacher/politicians 
berating the media and suggesting that we're sadly out of step with average 
Americans. If it weren't for the godless media, they'd have you believe, the 
church could get back into schools where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller identified herself as Thelma House of Fountain Valley. She's 73 and 
a retired homemaker who also worked during her career as a secretary. She was 
raised as a Baptist but sheepishly admits that she tends to substitute church 
attendance these days for watching the Rev. Robert Schuller's television 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because, she said, she worries whether there's a place for her in 
church anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was calling about news reports that Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa 
-- the county's largest church -- had sent pre-election questionnaires to city 
council and school board candidates. The seven questions for school board 
hopefuls, which a candidate had sent me several days earlier, have little to do 
with books and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, five of the questions deal in some way with abortion, another with 
condom distribution and a seventh with parents' involvement in "the moral and 
religious content of academic materials and tests." 
</P>
<P>
 The church tells the candidates the "Voter Guide" will be sent to 50,000 
families. The guide is designed to help voters make an "informed decision" at 
election time, the church says. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that sits well with Mrs. House. "I was raised in the conservative 
Baptist church," she says, "but I find myself more and more in disagreement. 
The reason I disagree is that people that I always respected and agreed with 
are trying to legislate their opinion on everybody else. Even if I don't 
believe in abortion for myself, I haven't walked in anyone else's shoes and 
shouldn't try to legislate their religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she's especially miffed by the notion of tax-exempt institutions 
"meddling in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Two representatives came over from a neighborhood church to ask her about 
joining, she said. "I told them I don't know where I belong anymore. I said I 
was raised in a church like theirs and that I should be running over there, and 
I just laid it out to them. They were a nice couple. I haven't been over there 
because I don't feel I fit in anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 What puzzles Mrs. House is that she doesn't think she's forsaken any of her 
fundamental religious beliefs. But to her ear, her religious friends have grown 
increasingly intolerant over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is, they're so ornery, so mean. And it hurts me because my 
friends are all in their 70s and we all grew up in this together. I try to 
discuss it with them, but we have to leave it. They think it's because I moved 
to California 40 years ago that something happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked whether her discontent toward the politicized religious activists is 
more anger or annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting angry doesn't do it," she said, "but, look, I'm 73, I'm a registered 
Republican, I've been a hard-shell Baptist all my life. You really can't be 
what you'd call more conservative than that, but these people have gone too 
far. And I'm worried when I see these people who I've known since kindergarten 
and know what good people they are and see them turn into a mean-spirited, 
hateful attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. House would be the first to admit she's just one person with an opinion. 
But if I were a religious leader, I'd ask myself how I could turn off someone 
like her. The church shouldn't be losing the Thelma Houses of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel we all answer to God," she said. "Salvation is an individual 
matter. I don't feel I should force it on anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad Mrs. House called. She said it was the first time she'd ever called a 
newspaper on a subject. That suggests to me she's pretty upset. 
</P>
<P>
 If they want to listen, the people who want to mix religion and public policy 
can learn something from her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her message is that their enemies aren't just the media or liberal Democrats 
or devil worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 More so than they want to admit or seem to understand, it's people like 
Thelma.

SEEKING ANSWERS TO CRIME, VIOLENCE; CONFERENCE: COALITION FOUNDED AFTER 10 
PASADENA YOUNGSTERS WERE SHOT ON HALLOWEEN SPONSORS GATHERING, ATTRACTING 800 
PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eleven months ago, outraged Pasadena residents spontaneously organized after 
three boys were shot and killed in a Halloween ambush by alleged gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the fruits of that initial meeting were displayed as a new 
nonprofit agency -- boosted by $360,000 in donations -- put on a daylong 
anti-violence conference attended by nearly 800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Coalition for a Non-Violent City, the meeting at the Pasadena 
Center drew a broad mix of participants, including grass-roots organizers, City 
Council members, city employees, church and social service agency workers, and 
young people from Pasadena's minority neighborhoods. In small panel sessions 
and workshops they sought to devise solutions to crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Adams, executive director of the Pasadena-Foothill branch of the Los 
Angeles Urban League and one of the coalition founders, said: "Pasadena has 
been a tale of two cities. It is not today. It is a city coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams and other coalition organizers said the group's work over the 11 months 
could serve as a model for other cities and agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition came into being after George Regas, rector of All Saints 
Episcopal Church, called a community meeting that for the first time drew 
together members from all of Pasadena's diverse communities and organizations. 
In May, the group became a legal nonprofit corporation, funded by a recent 
$100,000 grant from the Irvine Foundation, a previous $250,000 allocation from 
the city of Pasadena, and $10,000 from individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city money, $70,000 has been given to 17 youth programs. All the grant 
amounts have been $5,000 or less, said Tim Safford, a coalition member. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants funded smaller organizations that would otherwise lack the staff or 
knowledge to apply for city or state money, Safford said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said a $5,000 grant to the Grace Bible Community Church has resulted in a 
partnership in which youths from Pasadena's minority northwest neighborhood are 
bused to a Presbyterian church outside their neighborhood for basketball games, 
dinner and tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The group came into being last year after 10 boys returning from a Halloween 
party were gunned down by revenge-seeking gang members who mistook the 
youngsters for rival gang members. Seven boys were wounded and three died: 
Edgar Evans, 13, Stephen Coats and Reggie Crawford, both 14. Five alleged gang 
members await trial in Pasadena Superior Court.

INDONESIAN CULTURE TAKES ROOT IN HOLLYWOOD; COMMUNITY: SHOPS ARE FLOURISHING ON 
SUNSET BOULEVARD, CATERING TO THE MORE THAN 20,000 ISLAND IMMIGRANTS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Indonesia is the largest 
archipelagic nation in the world, consisting of 13,670 islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that 13,671. 
</P>
<P>
 Along a once-dilapidated, given-up-for-good stretch of Sunset Boulevard in 
Hollywood, a small oasis of Indonesia has gradually materialized. Clustered in 
an outdoor plaza around the Metropolitan Hotel, until recently the only 
Indonesian-owned hotel in the United States, the growing gaggle of shops, 
restaurants and businesses may be the beginning of what community activists 
hope will become Indonesian Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Saigon and Little Tokyo," said Niek 
Haridadi, who conceived the idea of a local center for Indonesian culture and 
commerce. "Why not a Little Indonesia?"  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other Asian American groups, the local Indonesian and Indonesian 
American population of 20,000 to 25,000 people is relatively small. But Los 
Angeles' number of immigrants is still the largest in any city nationwide, and 
the third-largest in the world after cities in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is also the economic linchpin of Indonesian American trade. Of the 
more than $5.4 billion in exports the United States receives from the Southeast 
Asian nation, 75% of those goods pass through Southern California ports. 
</P>
<P>
 But as many Indonesians report, Southern Californians remain largely unaware 
of Indonesia even though it is the world's fourth-most populous country with 
180 million people and the world's largest Muslim nation. Indonesian 
businesswoman and community activist Tilly Palar recalls taking an Indonesian 
friend to a local hospital, where a nurse asked if her friend bathed in a 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept here is that all of Indonesia is a big jungle," said Palar, who 
settled in Southern California 10 years ago. "It makes me very upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Ajie Dinata, a hairdresser who immigrated from East Borneo, said: "People ask 
me where Indonesia is. We're unrecognized in American eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haridadi came up with the idea of an Indonesian Town to combat such ignorance 
and to offer non-Indonesians a window into their society. Haridadi, whose 
husband is the Indonesian consul general in Los Angeles, said that although 
most Indonesians live in Alhambra or in the Inland Empire, the Metropolitan 
Hotel and the nearby plaza seem ideal because the property was bought 1 1/2 
years ago by Indonesians.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, she approached the new owners and encouraged them to bring 
Indonesian-related businesses to the plaza on Sunset Boulevard between Bronson 
and Van Ness avenues. Since then, the newly renovated mall has gone from having 
a handful of tenants to being nearly 80% occupied, primarily by 
Indonesian-owned businesses. A gourmet Indonesian restaurant has opened and 
become an unofficial community gathering spot. In June, a one-day bazaar 
featuring Indonesian folk dancing was held to raise money for disabled 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza owners are negotiating to acquire land next to the mall. "When we got 
here, the plaza was pretty empty," said Sandra Elnitiarta, who owns the hotel 
and plaza with her sister, Jessica. "There were many improvements that had to 
be done."  
</P>
<P>
 Indonesians in Southern California are primarily students or middle-class 
business people who have recently immigrated. Unlike Indonesia, where more than 
90% of the people are Muslims, about 90% of the immigrants are Christian 
Indonesians of Chinese ethnicity. There are nearly 30 Indonesian churches in 
Southern California and eight banks owned by Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
 Palar says Indonesians are drawn here for economic opportunity and the 
climate, just like countless other immigrants. The area's ever-burgeoning Asian 
population and the businesses that cater to them also make it attractive, she 
said. Also, the image of celebrity-studded Hollywood is a powerful lure for 
young Indonesians nurtured on American pop culture.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before Indonesians wanted to go to Europe because we were a colony," Palar 
said. "Not anymore. Now everyone wants to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Palar says Indonesians retain strong ties with their native country. The 
6-year-old Indonesian Journal, based in West Covina, is read avidly by 7,000 
Indonesians nationwide even though it treads lightly on issues such as human 
rights abuses and growing clampdowns on personal liberties at home, according 
to its publisher and editor, Emile D. Mailangkay. 
</P>
<P>
 Palar said Indonesians regularly make the $1,000, 18-hour flight home to visit 
relatives and friends. Also, many still cook Indonesian food, speak Bahasa, 
Indonesia's native language, and wear batiks, the traditional shirts made of 
patterned cloth, she said. In addition, every August the community commemorates 
the anniversary of the formation of the Indonesian republic. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ajie Dinata, 33, arrived in Los Angeles in 1985, he saw few of his 
countrymen. But now he says there is a thriving community here and a heightened 
interest in Indonesia to immigrate to the United States. Despite the area's 
lingering recession, he said, Indonesians still view Southern California as a 
place laden with opportunity. Dinata recently opened a hair salon in the plaza 
five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to feel like home again," he said. County Fair Highlights

POLICE OFFICIAL'S ROOMMATE DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend and roommate of Los Angeles Police Commissioner Art Mattox was shot 
dead Saturday morning in an apparent suicide at the home he shared with the 
commissioner, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's name was not released pending notification of his next of kin, but 
authorities said he appeared to have died from a gunshot to the head. A gun was 
recovered near the man's body, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the shooting led police to tentatively conclude that the 
man killed himself, but authorities were continuing to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physical evidence was recovered that leads us to believe that it was 
self-inflicted," said LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon, the department's lead 
spokesman. "I'm not commenting on what the evidence is," he added, declining to 
say if a suicide note was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattox, 38, was not available for comment Saturday. Police said he was helping 
detectives with their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the death was communicated to high-ranking members of the LAPD within 
hours of the emergency call. Despite the early indications that the death was a 
suicide, Police Chief Willie L. Williams directed that the department's 
Homicide Special Section, part of the robbery-homicide division, handle the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbery-homicide detectives are considered the department's best investigators 
and handle complicated or high-profile deaths. In this case, they will be 
assisted by Northeast Division detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gascon, police received an emergency 911 call from Mattox at 
11:06 a.m. Saturday. Northeast patrol officers went to Mattox's Eagle Rock 
home, where the commissioner told them that his roommate had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers called for paramedics, Gascon said. The victim was pronounced 
dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 As a police commissioner, Mattox is one of five civilians who sets policy for 
the Police Department. Although they are not members of the department, the 
commissioners are its highest authority, with the power to hire and fire the 
police chief, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattox, an easygoing and much-admired member of the commission, was appointed 
to the panel last year by Mayor Richard Riordan and was chosen in part because 
of his long volunteer work with the LAPD. During his time on the board, Mattox 
has played a leading role in a number of issues and has made it a point to 
accompany police officers as they patrol the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the commission's first openly gay member and has been instrumental in 
the effort to combat sexual harassment and discrimination within the ranks.

BURBANK'S BIG LEAGUES; AT OLIVE MEMORIAL STADIUM, HAPLESS ST. LOUIS BROWNS GOT 
SOME RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the age of multimillion-dollar salaries and lucrative athletic 
endorsements, the players on the St. Louis Browns struggled for just a little 
bit of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 They got it, of all places, in Burbank, where the feckless baseball team 
conducted spring training from 1949 to 1952 at Olive Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of spectators, among them Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore and Nat 
King Cole, eagerly piled into the stadium to see the likes of pitcher Satchel 
Paige and Manager Rogers Hornsby in 1952, despite the fact that the Browns were 
arguably the worst team to ever play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that never had a professional sports team to call its own, the St. 
Louis Browns of the American League became just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not all that good a team, but Burbank was just happy to have a major 
league team and the guys we had playing were just happy to be in the major 
leagues," said former Browns infielder John Beradino, now a television actor 
who plays the chief of staff on "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Forerunners of the Baltimore Orioles, the Browns will always be remembered by 
baseball buffs as the team that sent a midget to bat, used a one-armed 
outfielder and once finished 64 1/2 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns' proudest moment -- the 1944 World Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals -- ended in embarrassing defeat, with a team batting average of .183. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all that is left of Burbank's only brush with the majors is a worn 
playing field and a 26-foot-high stadium that the city's Parks and Recreation 
Department has recommended be demolished. Public support for preserving the 
site has all but faded. 
</P>
<P>
 As one vocal supporter of saving the stadium, Terre Hirsch, put it: "There's 
no flame of fight left in this issue. It's gone. It's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the playing field are still used by softball teams. But the 
stadium's locker rooms, dugout and concrete bleachers, which seat up to 1,110, 
have been closed to the public since 1989 for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, softball is the sport of choice in Burbank. Many, such as Parks 
and Recreation Director Mary Alvord, contend that Olive Memorial's playing 
field should be split into four softball fields and that a new stadium should 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "The needs today are different than when the stadium was built," she said. 
"This is an existing facility that is basically falling apart. The bottom line 
is something has to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Building a stadium is expected to cost $500,000, Alvord said. About half that 
money, she added, will come from a state grant that had been earmarked for 
preserving the site. The Burbank City Council is scheduled to consider 
additional funding for the project Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the only piece of Olive Memorial Stadium that Alvord and others want to 
keep is a sculptured concrete column and a set of plaques that honor World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, as Burbank had prospered from the war effort and the city's 
population began to soar, Olive Memorial Stadium was built for $64,425. 
</P>
<P>
 Postwar good times led to inflation and the eventual sale of the financially 
troubled St. Louis Browns to Baltimore in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet, the team sold its best players for cash and as a result 
many fans stopped coming to the ballpark, said Bill Borst, author of the book 
"Still Last in the American Leagues: The St. Louis Browns Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
 "The team's tombstone should have read: 'They died because there were not 
enough fans to go around. Towns couldn't support two teams," Borst said, 
referring to the Browns' hometown rival, the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1899 Cleveland Spiders had the game's worst season ever with 20 wins and 
134 losses. But the Browns hold the worst overall record for a team: 3,414 wins 
and 4,465 losses in 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino, now 77, played for the Browns on and off from 1939 to 1951, and 
never dwelt on losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just tickled to death to be in the major leagues," Beradino said. "I 
think most of the guys were playing for the love of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 What Beradino loved about playing at Olive Memorial was the warm weather, the 
friendly fans and the appearance one day of a young starlet named Marilyn 
Monroe mingling with the Browns for publicity photos. "We got as much support 
as we could out of a city this size without a major league team," he said of 
Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 The Browns held spring training in Burbank for three to four weeks at a time 
before boarding trains for Sportsman's Park in St. Louis. Along the way, they 
played exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the benefit of lucrative contracts, most players held odd jobs in the 
winter -- driving trucks, pumping gas or whatever they could find. Beradino 
studied drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players back then weren't stars. They were more like common people, only 
more visible," said Burbank dentist Joseph Dossen, a fan of the hapless team 
whose collection of Browns memorabilia is on display at the Burbank Historical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks and Recreation Board voted in March to tear down Olive Memorial 
Stadium on the recommendation of a citizens committee that had flip-flopped on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by a consultant in 1991 and 1993 concluded that the stadium's masonry 
walls were beyond repair and overall improvements to the facility would cost as 
much as building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of both the board and committee, Hirsch, was dismayed by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main issue is are we ever going to retain anything in this community for 
the people who follow us? What do we have left in this town to document our 
history?"

SCOTT HARRIS: ODD PAIR OF GADFLIES IN A BUZZ OVER HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They sat together amid the vacant seats near the front, this odd couple united 
by their distrust of the Glendale City Council. Emzy Veazy III and David E. 
Wallis Jr. have been called gadflies, and every city needs a few. 
</P>
<P>
 These allies have distinct viewpoints, and other differences as well. Veazy is 
a 43-year-old unemployed African American whose business card identifies him as 
a "rugged individualist," among other things. On this day he was dressed 
casually and toted a video camera, expecting to record an abuse of civil 
rights. Wallis is 57, well-to-do and white, though he prefers the term 
"Anglo-Saxon." He's a retired Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer who has twice 
waged unsuccessful campaigns for elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come to challenge Mayor Eileen Givens' noble experiment to make 
Glendale a friendlier town and spruce up its image. Not to paint with a broad 
brush, but Glendale, as the mayor knows, has long suffered from an image of 
what may politely be described as ethnic intolerance. Givens appointed a task 
force that drew up a list of proposals, most notably the creation of a 
"community response team" to comfort the victims of hate crimes and decry such 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is said that you can't legislate morality, but only two days after the task 
force announced its proposals, its strategy was put to a test. Six orange 
swastikas were found on Temple Sinai, Glendale's only synagogue. The mayor, 
police chief and City Council promptly pitched in with paint rollers and words 
of support. It was the talk of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 But Emzy Veazy didn't want to discuss Temple Sinai. He handed the camcorder to 
Wallis and stood before the council. Why, he wondered, weren't there any blacks 
on Givens' task force?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good question. Why is it that blacks -- who after Armenians have been 
Glendale's second-most-frequent target of hate crimes since 1986 -- were 
unrepresented on the panel? 
</P>
<P>
 Gadflies often raise good questions. Unfortunately, diplomacy is seldom a 
strong suit. Wallis aimed the camera as Veazy delivered his diatribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give Mayor Eileen Givens' secret meeting and anti-black people Blue Ribbon 
Task Force on Community Relations the thumbs down and call it a prejudicial 
group which represents a high crime against humanity!" Veazy declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayor Givens, you and your rude hate crime task force members need to be 
renamed the OK No Blacks Task Force in Our Community Relations. It is Glendale 
historically at its best to continue to send out to the community and the world 
that Glendale prides itself in excluding black people from full participation, 
as it does exclude its civic-minded council watchers." 
</P>
<P>
 Veazy, the only regular "civic-minded council watcher" among black Glendale 
residents, wondered why he wasn't appointed to the mayor's task force. The 
answer seemed obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Wallis' turn, with Veazy serving as cameraman. Someday, all of this 
may appear on the Glendale public-access cable show that Veazy produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis' delivery was measured and professorial. Unlike Veazy, who argued that 
Givens' project didn't go far enough, Wallis argued that she went too far, 
calling the task force an "overreaction" that should be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an American of Anglo-Saxon ethnicity and democratic tradition," Wallis 
said, "I strongly object to political propagandizing and overreaction with 
regard to special-interest groups, including ethnic or religious ones. I want 
city government to carry out city functions, such as ensuring that the streets 
are clean. . . . It is not a city function to organize to 'denounce' anyone or 
anything. . . . The city should not overextend itself into social do-gooding 
beyond its competence, nor overreact to its detriment. . . . The therapy is 
worse than the disease!" 
</P>
<P>
 The odd couple. One levels charges of racism. The other wonders what all the 
fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Veazy and Wallis failed to make the City Council see the light. Councilman 
Sheldon Baker drew applause after angrily slamming into Wallis' suggestion that 
swastikas at Temple Sinai should not be a concern of the City Council. 
Councilman Larry Zarian rose to the defense of Givens, who said she chooses not 
to respond to personal attacks. Representatives of the Glendale Chamber of 
Commerce took time to laud the task force proposal. The vote was 5-0 to adopt 
the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the questions linger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why weren't there any African Americans on the task force? The mayor says she 
tried, but admits that she did not try hard. After all, for all its ethnic 
diversity -- the city has large Latino, Armenian and Asian populations -- 
Glendale remains less than 2% black and is therefore short on black community 
leaders. Givens says she is hopeful that African Americans will participate on 
the community response team proposed by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Wallis' question. Is the therapy worse than the disease? Wallis 
worries that the anti-hate campaign will backfire, inspiring hard-core bigots 
and perverse pranksters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wallis suggests that, were it not for the task force, the swastikas at 
Temple Sinai may have never appeared. Many people speculate that the vandalism 
was an answer to the task force proposals and the presence of the synagogue's 
rabbi, Carole Meyers, on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier address to the council, Meyers delivered what in retrospect may 
be considered a rebuttal to Wallis' views. Whatever the vandals' motive, she 
said, the community is wise to condemn such deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 She reminded the council that, seven years earlier, Temple Sinai had to 
confront a similar desecration on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no plan like this -- and nothing happened," Meyers recalled. "We 
quietly and quickly scrubbed the swastikas. . . . We thought we had done a good 
job. . . . Then we entered our sanctuary and mourned and grieved in silence." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Temple Sinai was "grateful beyond words" for the way that the 
symbols of hate inspired acts of kindness and brotherly love. And Temple Sinai, 
the rabbi added, won't forget its friends when it is their time of need. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Emzy Veazy III whether he had videotaped the rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't.

2 'MISSING' SISTERS BACK HOME AFTER NIGHT ON TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two sisters who were reported missing Friday after disappearing from their 
South-Central Los Angeles junior high school returned home Saturday after 
spending the night on the town, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristina and Elizabeth Gonzalez, 11 and 12, became the subjects of a 
round-the-clock search after their mother told police they failed to come home 
from school Friday afternoon. The girls told police they ditched school and 
rode the bus to Hollywood. They made their way home about 3 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they had a good time," said Lt. James Voge, commanding officer of the 
Newton police station. "But I think they are regretting that now."

OFFER BY AHMANSON LAND CO. IS NO BARGAIN; VENTURA COUNTY AND SANTA MONICA 
MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DUMP THE ONE-SIDED 
DEVELOPMENT DEAL. NOW IS THE TIME TO STOP USING PUBLIC MONEY ON A FIASCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN GENELIN, Susan Genelin of Sherman Oaks is regional representative for 
the Endangered Habitats League and chairs the Dixie Canyon Park Committee of 
the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The much-ballyhooed deal to allow the giant Ahmanson Land Co. to develop its 
ranchland at the eastern end of Ventura County appears to be eroding. The 
public benefits, questionable in the first place, are sloughing off, leaving 
only the development and all the damage it will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson intends to build a city of 3,050 homes, 400,000 square feet of 
commercial space, 300 hotel rooms, two golf courses, schools and its own city 
hall on 2,800 acres where Ventura County meets Los Angeles County. The 
problems, like traffic, will be sent east and south to L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for Ventura County's permission to build on the prime acreage, the 
company agreed to donate 2,600 adjoining acres best suited for mountain goats 
to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. It also agreed not to begin grading 
until another four canyons are in public ownership. None of the owners of the 
four chosen canyons are signatories to this agreement -- they don't have to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the rush to get "free" parkland from Ahmanson, the conservancy has already 
spent most of its agreed-upon cash allotment on two of the four canyons, 
leaving itself unable to buy the others. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ahmanson revealed recently that it too is probably unable to purchase the 
remaining ones, which as a practical matter is its responsibility now that the 
conservancy has spent virtually all of the $29.5 million pledged in the 
agreement. Ahmanson is now asking the county for more time and has suggested 
that more public money may be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense. The cash shortage is a blessing. It provides the conservancy and 
Ventura County with an opportunity to dump the whole one-sided Ahmanson deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never a good idea to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the conservancy, an agency charged with protecting the natural 
values of our mountains, use public money to help Ahmanson build its 
environmentally destructive mini-city? Why should public money help Ahmanson 
develop the headwaters of Malibu Creek, one of the few remaining riparian areas 
in the mountains, with its rare grasslands, precious oak woodlands, golden 
eagle forage and wildlife habitat connector between natural areas of the Santa 
Monica Mountains and Los Padres National Forest? Why should the conservancy 
participate in water pollution that two golf courses and urban runoff will 
introduce all the way to Santa Monica Bay? 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the Ahmanson development will destroy the remaining rural 
character of the largely light-residential west end of the San Fernando Valley. 
Any hope of even keeping traffic from getting worse on this part of the Ventura 
Freeway -- already graded F by Caltrans -- would be lost, with more than 17,000 
additional daily trips at Las Virgenes Road. Besides seeing neighborhood 
streets turned into thoroughfares with traffic, noise and fumes, the public 
will have to pay for any attempts by Los Angeles County to ameliorate this 
traffic nightmare. Ahmanson has no such obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has already paid millions of dollars on two inflated parkland 
purchases to facilitate this ill-advised project. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy spent $10 million on part of Liberty Canyon next to the 
Calabasas landfill, which has inadequate safeguards against polluting leakage 
from old toxic pits. It spent another $16.5 million on Jordan Ranch, which is 
worth far less. Since there is no access route to the property, no development 
could have been built. Even now the public cannot get on this public land 
because of the same access problem. Ahmanson has paid not a penny toward either 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Ahmanson attorneys say Ahmanson may not, itself, be able to purchase the 
two remaining canyons, Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon, from entertainer Bob 
Hope. If public agencies have the money to buy them and lack the will to 
refuse, the project will go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A better solution would be for various agencies to stiffen their spines, for 
Ahmanson not to build its city, and for all of Ahmanson Ranch to remain in its 
natural state until the public can buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining two properties are so far from Ahmanson Ranch that most 
neighbors never heard of them before the conservancy promoted the land deal. In 
return for them, those living around Ahmanson Ranch would forfeit the quality 
of living they have so carefully nourished and protected for years. And it all 
has been engineered by a conservancy which the residents did not elect and 
which does not appear to be concerned about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy board is to hear a report Monday night by Executive Director 
Joe Edmiston on his efforts to work a new deal. I hope he tells them that 
Ventura County is refusing to grant an extension. Now is the time to stop using 
public money to promote this fiasco.

CHAPMAN COMES BACK, GAINS TIE AT REDLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman finally met its match on the football field, and it took an amazing 
finish by the Panthers to salvage a 14-14 tie with Redlands in front of 5,357 
Saturday at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The game summary shows that Todd Gragnano's seven-yard pass to Dave Poltl and 
Jacob Galasso's two-point conversion pass to Oscar Ford tied the score with 46 
seconds remaining, but it wasn't nearly as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano, who was playing with an injured finger on his passing hand, had 
moved the Panthers from their 38 to the Redlands six with three quick 
completions, but the Redlands defense stiffened and it was third and goal from 
the seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford broke open over the middle near the goal line, and Gragnano's pass hit 
Ford in the hands as defensive back Ricky Cummings hit him. The ball bounced up 
and Poltl grabbed it, and without breaking stride he stepped into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like slow-motion," said Poltl, a former Saddleback College and 
Capistrano Valley High receiver. "It dropped right into my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 On the conversion, Galasso, a running back and third-string quarterback who 
stepped in for Gragnano on three second-half series, took a pitch and passed to 
Ford for two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about that double-tip, whammy-thing?" Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. "We 
were getting some bad breaks throughout the game. I figured it was about time 
one bounced our way and by gosh it did." 
</P>
<P>
 And Chapman had turned a seemingly certain loss into a stirring, uh, tie. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Panthers (2-0-1) can't be blamed for reacting as if it was a victory. 
Redlands (2-0-1) was the team that was supposed to show how Chapman's neophyte 
program was progressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The returns were decidedly mixed. Chapman outgained the Bulldogs, 372-166, 
holding the best rushing offense in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference to 109 yards, nearly 200 short of its average. Anthony 
Jones, who rushed for 213 yards last week, was held two 62 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's offensive line tore into the Bulldogs, gaining 185 yards, despite 
the fact that starting tailback Darnell Morgan sat out much of the game because 
of a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Chapman was moving the ball. However, the Panthers had five 
turnovers, including three on consecutive possessions in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano, who entered the game during the Panthers' third series after 
starting quarterback Curtis Robinson suffered a scratched eye on a tackle, had 
three passes intercepted. He finished 10 of 19 for 163 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands struck first after Chapman faked a punt on its first series. On the 
Bulldogs' first play from scrimmage, Jones sliced through the line to score 
from 19 yards, but the touchdown was called back because of an illegal 
procedure penalty. Four plays and a Chapman personal-foul penalty later, Matt 
Figueroa scored on a one-yard run. Redlands led, 7-0, only slightly more than 
three minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands then took a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter. After Chapman's 
Juan Garcia fumbled on the Redlands 41, Figueroa took a draw-play handoff and 
ran 48 yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hamlin kicked a 24-yard field goal with four seconds left in the half and 
then cut the lead to 14-6 by making a 33-yarder with 8:55 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the final drive, Visser gathered his team in the middle of the field for 
a short speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know no one here is satisfied with a tie," Visser said to the team. "The 
coaches aren't satisfied, you players aren't satisfied, but that was one of the 
most courageous ties I've ever seen."

NORTHRIDGE GIVES CHICO EYE-OPENER, 47-17; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: O'LAUGHLIN PASSES

 A no-look pass in a football game? 
</P>
<P>
 For Cal State Chico, perhaps the whole affair would have been better with 
blinders, if not dark sunglasses, over their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge scored on five consecutive possessions through the second 
and third quarters and rolled over Chico, 47-17, in a nonconference game before 
2,509 at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 To encapsulate the Chico experience, consider this humbling third-quarter 
blunder: Quarterback Chris Zermeno faded back and tossed the ball to receiver 
Raymond Adkins, who was streaking downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins never turned around, the pass hit him in the back and caromed into the 
arms of Northridge linebacker Andrew Rose, who rumbled 16 yards to the Chico 
31-yard line to set up a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Rose, the long snapper at the time, twice hiked the ball over the 
head of the punter to set up 10 points in a 28-23 loss to Southwest Texas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take what I can get," Rose said. "Last week, they took what they could 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins, who later dropped a potential touchdown pass in the end zone, never 
knew what hit him -- which pretty much covered the feeling for his mates. 
</P>
<P>
 It all left the Matadors with a very homey feeling. Northridge (2-2) has 
outscored the opposition, 99-30, in two home games, both victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you gave me a choice, I'd rather be at home," Northridge Coach Bob Burt 
said. "When we were in Texas last week, I'd rather have been in Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Chico (1-3) rallied briefly in the third quarter, but couldn't erase a 33-3 
lead Northridge built after a 37-yard field goal by sophomore Matt Ornelaz with 
9 minutes 3 seconds left in the third. The score was set up by Rose's 
interception, one of three by the Northridge defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 23-3, Northridge took the opening kickoff of the second half and 
moved downfield on the arm of quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin completed passes of 23 and 18 yards, then hit tight end Travis Hall 
with a 12-yard scoring pass that gave the Matadors a 30-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin completed 17 of 31 for 247 yards and three touchdowns, which seemed 
to open things up for 10 other guys on offense. Even the ground game showed 
signs of life. Tailback Mark Harper, who entered the game with a team-high 99 
rushing yards, finished with 101 in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Walton, starting for the first time at fullback, gave Northridge a shot 
in the arm on the first play of the fourth quarter. Walton, a junior from 
Dorsey High, scored on a 71-yard run to extend Northridge's lead to 40-17 with 
14:48 left. It was the team's longest run this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton, who also scored on a 52-yard pass play from O'Laughlin in the first 
half, finished with a career-high 81 yards in only three carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge racked up a season-high 542 yards. The Matadors had more yards on 
the ground (286) than in three previous games (274). 
</P>
<P>
 The first half started in what could be considered predictable fashion for the 
Matadors -- on an interception by senior safety Joseph Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who returned interceptions for touchdowns in each of the first two 
games, did it again for the Matadors' first touchdown. Zermeno, flushed from 
the pocket, threw a flutterball down the right sideline that Vaughn grabbed 
before racing 29 yards for a score with 13:57 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn intercepted another pass later in the first quarter, raising his season 
total to five and tying him with 10 others for eighth place on the school 
single-season list. Vaughn dropped a ball that hit him squarely in the chest in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Zermeno passed for 191 yards, but didn't exactly have a leisurely night. He 
was sacked six times and finished with minus-47 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafik Thorossian, a tailback from Glendale College, led Chico with 113 yards 
in 19 carries.

CAL LUTHERAN DEFEATED IN A DECISION; FOOTBALL: FAILED GAMBLE ON FOURTH DOWN IS 
COSTLY IN 19-17 LOSS TO OCCIDENTAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At first glance, Cal Lutheran's 19-17 loss to Occidental on Saturday at Mt. 
Clef Stadium looks just like another wild game with the winning score coming in 
the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key play came midway through the fourth quarter, three minutes before 
Cal Lutheran quarterback Ryan Huisenga fumbled into his end zone and Occidental 
lineman Andre Coleman fell on the ball for the go-ahead touchdown with 5 
minutes 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen led, 17-13, and faced fourth and four at the Occidental 15. 
Rather than having Dan Leffler attempt a 32-yard field goal, Coach Joe Harper 
elected to try for the first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Terrence Thomas went up the middle and was stopped by the Tigers 
after a two-yard gain. He had lost a yard on a third-and-three carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that we were going to need more than three points," Harper said. "We 
had moved the ball extremely well down there on that drive, and I felt with two 
downs to make three or four yards, we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga, who had completed 10 of his last 11 passes, didn't question Harper's 
decisions to go for the first down or to give the ball to Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrence is The Man," Huisenga said. "You have to give him the ball. It's 
easy to second-guess, but they just stacked up (on him)." 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, Harper will also note that Occidental missed the extra point 
after the go-ahead score, meaning the Kingsmen would have led, 20-19, if they 
had made the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cal Lutheran fell to 1-2, 1-1 in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.  
</P>
<P>
 After winning their first game with a touchdown in the final two minutes, the 
Kingsmen have lost their last two on scores in the final six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the final results of Saturday's game and last week's against the 
University of San Diego were similar, there was one significant difference: Cal 
Lutheran's running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Against San Diego, Thomas set a school record with 224 yards. But Occidental 
used a seven-man front and had players in the Cal Lutheran backfield as quickly 
as Huisenga could drop back and hand Thomas the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tackled for losses of 20 yards, finishing with a net of 80 yards and 
two touchdowns. Thomas' 174.5-yard average after two games was second in the 
nation in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating when they kept shooting the gaps," Thomas said. "They were 
doing stunts and we were not picking them up." 
</P>
<P>
 With Cal Lutheran sputtering, Occidental (3-0, 2-0) took a 13-7 lead on a 
four-yard pass from Davin Lundquist to LaMont Terry in the second quarter and a 
seven-yard run by Lundquist early in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen then adjusted. By stacking linebackers at the line of scrimmage, 
Occidental gave up the short pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga, who completed 22 of 39 passes for 197 yards, went on a hot streak, 
completing six of seven in a 64-yard drive that ended with Thomas scoring on a 
two-yard run.  
</P>
<P>
 The extra point gave Cal Lutheran a 14-13 lead with 5:01 to play in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Cal Lutheran's next possession, Huisenga completed two of three passes for 
28 yards and Thomas, given more of a cushion by the Occidental linebackers, 
gained 31 yards in four carries. The drive ended with Leffler's 26-yard field 
goal 10 seconds into the fourth quarter.

LOYOLA TURNS ANTELOPE VALLEY AROUND, 14-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If turnabout is fair play, consider Antelope Valley and Loyola highs even for 
the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola scored a go-ahead touchdown with seven minutes remaining and held on to 
beat the Antelopes, 14-7, in a nonleague football game Saturday at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Antelope Valley scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns in a 
come-from-behind victory over the Cubs, who were ranked sixth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later Loyola, ranked eighth in the state, turned the tide on the 
Antelopes with its own brand of heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley (2-2), which lost to third-ranked Bakersfield last week, was 
clinging to a 7-6 lead and had the Cubs facing fourth and inches at midfield 
when the momentum turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's Mike Ellison, who rushed for 135 yards in 25 carries, picked up the 
first down, but there was a flag on the play. The referee, however, picked up 
the flag and waved off an apparent penalty on Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was illegal motion on that fourth and short; the referee saw it, 
flagged it, and then ate his flag," Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Loyola quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler completed a pass to Joe 
Cesta over the middle. Cesta ran to the five, but Jermaine Lewis forced a 
fumble. As Lewis tried to recover the ball, Cesta, a 6-foot-1, 233-pound tight 
end, fell on him and Ellison, trailing, recovered the fumble at the two. The 
play covered 42 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Ellison scored his second touchdown of the game, and a 
two-point conversion gave the Cubs (4-0) a seven-point lead with 7 minutes 6 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's swarming defense held Lewis, who gained 108 yards against the Cubs 
last season, in check. Lewis finished with 50 yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley had trouble holding the ball in the first half, fumbling three 
times, but losing possession only once. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Bobby Brown, who earned his first start because Trymon Redick had 
the flu all week, fumbled the snap on the Antelopes' second offensive play. 
Cesta's recovery on Antelope Valley's 15 set up the Cubs' first score. Ellison 
bolted up the middle on the next play to give Loyola a 6-0 lead just three 
minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes answered with a 12-play, 49-yard drive, but Chad Shrout's 
39-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes claimed a 7-6 lead on Brown's 56-yard pass play to Chad Murphy 
with 29 seconds remaining in the first half.

CAL LUTHERAN DEFEATED IN A DECISION; STRATEGY: OCCIDENTAL CAUSES NOTHING BUT 
TROUBLE FOR KINGSMEN OFFENSIVE LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Cal Lutheran football team was beaten by one man on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a different one on each play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would get all the blocks, but then one guy would slip through," Cal 
Lutheran offensive guard Tony Papa said. "We were always one guy short." 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental seemed to slip one unblocked lineman or linebacker through whenever 
Cal Lutheran faced a key play. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding score in Occidental's 19-17 victory over the Kingsmen on Saturday 
at Mt. Clef Stadium came on just such a play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran quarterback Ryan Huisenga was sacked by a linebacker and he 
fumbled into his end zone, where Occidental's Andre Coleman fell on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were giving us a lot of pressure which we weren't picking up," Coach Joe 
Harper said. "We thought our (blocking) schemes at the beginning of the game 
would work, but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Terrence Thomas was also a victim of the Tigers' aggressive defense. 
He gained only 29 yards in 17 carries through three quarters, but finished with 
80 yards after the Cal Lutheran passing game started to open some room for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had seven men on (the line) most of the time," Thomas said. "There were 
just extra men and we didn't do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 When Cal Lutheran faced third and three at the Occidental 14 midway through 
the fourth quarter, Thomas was stopped short of the first down on two 
consecutive carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that if we could get through to their linebackers, Terrence could go 
off like he did at San Diego (when he gained a school-record 224 yards)," Papa 
said. "But we couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem for Cal Lutheran's offensive line was the loss of starting 
center Tim Johnson, who sprained his ankle in practice Wednesday. He was 
replaced by Kevin Kress. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental linebacker Darrin Mangnall, who had 16 tackles and forced 
Huisenga's fumble into the end zone, said the Tiger defense is designed to 
create matchup problems on the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their offensive line did a real good job," Mangnall said, "but we have a 
solid defense, and if we play it right, it works."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON: NO GUTS, NO GLORY FOR COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision is made in a matter of seconds, but it must be lived with for an 
entire week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fourth down or a game's last play, deep in opponents' territory. Go for 
it, or try to kick a field goal? 
</P>
<P>
 The call is made and the players try to execute it. The gun sounds and the 
coach either is labeled a genius or a dolt, no in-between. Dolts are in good 
company. Form a line behind Don Shula and Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by three points last week, Shula's Miami Dolphins go for it on fourth 
and goal from Minnesota's 10-yard line with less than three minutes to play and 
fail. The Vikings win, 38-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 20-3, late in the first half, Shell's Raiders go for it on fourth 
and three at the San Diego Chargers' six-yard line. A running play comes up 
short as eventually do the Raiders, 26-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up would be Kennedy High's Bob Francola. His team trailed, 7-6, and faced 
fourth and five at the Granada Hills six-yard line with five minutes to play 
Friday night. Francola sent in a kicker who had missed seven of eight 
extra-point attempts to try a 22-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The kick ended up closer to the concession stand than the goal posts. Kennedy 
lost, and Francola was left muttering about recruiting a kicker from the soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally doltish was a call made by Birmingham's Chick Epstein with 16 seconds 
to play in the first half and his team on Taft's four-yard line. Epstein 
elected to run the ball. The play was stopped and Taft took a 10-0 lead into 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein didn't have to be Einstein to figure out that a field goal would have 
been preferable: Birmingham lost, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Geniuses, line up behind Bobby Ross, coach of the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by two with two minutes to play last week, the Chargers faced fourth 
and one at the Raiders' 24. Ross risked a permanent place in the dolt hall of 
fame by going for it. Stan Humphries passed to Ronnie Harmon for eight yards 
and moments later John Carney kicked the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park Coach George Hurley, take a bow for sticking with kicker Chrissy 
Sanford, despite her failed extra-point attempt earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With Newbury Park trailing Agoura, 13-12, Sanford gave the Panthers a 15-13 
victory with her first field goal on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Also basking in brilliance is Roger McCamy of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a 6-0 lead in the third quarter, the Pioneers faced fourth and four 
from Camarillo's eight. McCamy kept Tim Wolleck, perhaps the area's best 
kicker, on the sidelines and went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Bennett threw a five-yard pass to Chris Azzinaro for a first down. 
Azzinaro scored a couple of plays later and Simi Valley eventually won, 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, had the plays called by Francola and Epstein been executed 
successfully, they'd be candidates for MENSA along with Hurley and McCamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe next week. Nobody can go from dolt to genius faster than a football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fair and square: With five players suspended for roughhousing a junior varsity 
player, Montclair Prep lost to Kilpatrick, 26-14, for the first time in five 
meetings between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer coincidence, said Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini. "Kilpatrick is a 
good team and would have beaten us even if those kids had played," Giannini 
said. The suspended players will be reinstated this week, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tie-dyed: In preparation for Homecoming, several Quartz Hill seniors were 
instructed to paint something on the football field. "Something" turned out to 
be a huge mellow yellow peace sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it had a subliminal effect on the game. Quartz Hill and Saugus tied, 
12-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed all about it: Tailback Larry Reed was sidelined with a sprained right 
ankle, so Van Nuys (3-1) used opportunistic defense to defeat North Hollywood, 
22-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves intercepted a pass and recovered three fumbles, the last by Allen 
Vides at Van Nuys' 13-yard line with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who should play next week, has 441 yards rushing and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would help," Coach George Engbrecht said. "He is a threat to score from 
anywhere on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Timmbbbeeerrr!!: On a key third-down play against Burbank, El Monte Arroyo 
wide receiver Robert Ochoa began to lose his balance while the quarterback 
called signals. To the astonishment of Burbank players and coaches standing a 
few feet away, Ochoa leaned forward, farther, farther, farther, until he fell 
flat on his face for a five-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank went on to fell Arroyo, which has reached the Southern Section 
playoffs every year since 1983.

THOUSAND OAKS SETTLES FOR SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Keith O'Doherty and junior Kim Mortensen each placed fourth in their 
respective races Saturday to lead the Thousand Oaks High boys' and girls' 
cross-country teams to second-place finishes in the Southwestern University 
Invitational in Georgetown, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty timed 16 minutes over the three-mile course as Thousand Oaks, the 
No. 2-ranked team in the country by the Harrier magazine, totaled 44 
points.Top-ranked Kingwood, Tex., placed first with 37 points, paced by the 1-3 
finish of senior twins Brad and Brent Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Disney (eighth in 16:48), Kevin Marsden (ninth in 16:52), Jeff Fischer 
(10th in 16:53) and Josh Carolan (13th in 17:08) rounded out Thousand Oaks' top 
five runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden and Fischer were racing for only the second time this season after 
missing the first two meets with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen ran 12:07 over the two-mile girls' course as Thousand Oaks totaled 
74 points. Kingwood placed five runners among the top 19 finishers for a 
46-point winning total. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Marsden (15th in 12:49) and Bridgit Roy (16th in 12:49) were Thousand 
Oaks' No. 2 and No. 3 runners.

KENNY STAUB CROSS-COUNTRY INVITATIONAL ; GONZALEZ'S VICTORY A LEARNING 
EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling someone who has run 9 minutes 33.06 seconds in the 3,200 meters a 
novice might sound a little far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phil Gonzalez of Crescenta Valley High fit the part after winning the 
Division I boys' race in the Kenny Staub cross-country invitational at 
Crescenta Valley Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez out-kicked Palisades' Peter Gilmore -- ninth in last year's State 
Division I championships -- in the final 100 yards to win the three-mile race 
in 15:46. He admitted that he had "no idea" who Gilmore was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking to break (16 minutes) and beat some guys like (David) Lopez (of 
Hoover)," Gonzalez said. "But (Gilmore) was the only guy around me after the 
first mile and I didn't know who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is your knowledge of opponents when you've been running competitively for 
only a year and are in the middle of your first full cross-country season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still doesn't know how to race," Crescenta Valley Coach Keith Gilliland 
said of Gonzalez. "Obviously, he's very talented, but he knows very little 
about racing tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's inexperience was evident at the start and finish of Saturday's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 He went out too fast over the first 300 meters -- wasting precious energy -- 
and he failed to put Gilmore away after surging past him on the final uphill 
portion of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing Gilmore by a second at the one- and two-mile points, Gonzalez 
held a 10-meter advantage after the final uphill stretch. But he stepped off 
the accelerator after making the turn for the final downhill stretch. Gilmore 
caught him with 100 meters left before Gonzalez pulled away to a one-second 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know where he was," Gonzalez said. "I was surprised when he 
came up on me at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's effort was not enough to give Crescenta Valley the team victory, 
however, as Palisades placed three runners among the top seven finishers while 
totaling 66 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley was second with 71 points, followed by Garfield (86), Hoover 
(92) and Belmont (99). 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover was paced by Lopez, a sophomore who placed third in 15:55. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon capped a productive week with a runaway victory in the girls' Division 
I race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who finished second to powerful Hart in Thursday's Foothill 
League meet, totaled 49 points, well ahead of South Torrance (94), Simi Valley 
(97), Palisades (98) and Glendale (110). 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Julie Harris (20:11) and junior Kellie Stigile (20:35) finished 
fourth and ninth, respectively, for Canyon. The Cowboys' other scoring runners 
were junior Danielle Hadfield (11th in 20:49), senior Terriann Boggio (12th in 
20:50) and freshman Brandy Plasschaert (13th in 21:00). 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' individual title was also decided in the final 100 meters as Simone 
Ferrara of South Torrance surged past Michelle Zayas of Crescenta Valley to win 
by a second in 19:20. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayas led the race from the start, but Ferrara overpowered her in the final 
straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Lovien Cleavinger led Hoover to the Division III girls' title 
with a winning time of 19:57, and Bell-Jeff won the Division III boys' title, 
paced by the second- and third-place efforts of Carlos Herrera (17:20) and 
Jesse Montes (17:23).

RECREATION / STEVE HENSON: IT'S BEEN A LONG CLIMB BUT WERNER IS STILL GOING UP 
AT AGE 63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Once again, Sanford Werner had reached the end of his rope. 
</P>
<P>
 And he could not have been more happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, 63, climbed a 20-foot rope in 4.8 seconds to win his age-group 
championship at the Senior Olympics gymnastics meet last week at Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort was a far cry from the world record of 3.1 seconds he once held. 
But give this lifelong rope-climber some slack; the record was set in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing up a rope, hands only, is the same thrill it always was," said Werner, 
a consulting geologist who went to Canoga Park High. "We want to prove that 
just because you are old, you aren't dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing second with a time of 4.9 was Bob Hammond, 61, wrestling coach at 
Chatsworth High. Hammond is a former NCAA rope-climbing champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a gripping tale. The meet attracted legends of rope climbing, an 
event popular made popular because of its use in military training. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Werner's former coaches from more than 40 years ago showed up. They 
were a bit frayed at the edges but are going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Doig, 86, was Werner's coach at L.A. City College when he set the world 
record in the National Amateur Athletic Union championships. And Richard 
Bishop, who won a bronze medal in gymnastics in the 1932 Olympics, was Werner's 
coach at Roosevelt High in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't seen Frank since 1951," Werner said. Doig was gymnastics coach at 
LACC from 1938-73 and was the all-around national collegiate champion at USC in 
the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending was Ben Bass, a retired admiral who won the gold medal in rope 
climbing at the 1932 Olympics, the last year the event was contested in the 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 gymnasts competed in the meet, which has been held at Valley for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this for the camaraderie and for the fitness," Werner said. "We like to 
say, 'Old rope climbers never die, they just keep reaching for the sky.' " 
</P>

 Whale of a time: The whale-watching season near the Channel Islands is drawing 
to a close, but an exhibit that opened Saturday at the Burbank Gallery of the 
L.A. County Museum of Natural History offers a comprehensive look at the 
world's largest mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very interactive display," said John Heyning, curator of the exhibit. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It is interesting to children and the lay public while also illustrating how 
complex ecological issues are that affect whales." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to seven whale models, the exhibit includes underwater habitats, a 
whaling boat and items that illustrate whale lore. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will remain in Burbank until January, then will travel for five 
years to museums through the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit the exhibit, then see the real thing next summer when blue whales and 
humpback whales visit the waters near the Channel Islands. 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, deer: Hunting season for bucks begins Saturday in five Southern California 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest fires that consumed thousands of acres in Los Angeles County last 
summer have diminished the areas accessible for hunting, meaning that many 
hunters will be crowding along relatively few roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 7,000 licenses were issued in the Southland and an estimated 
500 bucks were killed, according to the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 tags are still available for Zone D13, located mainly in Ventura 
and Kern counties.

 Roll 'em: The Brunswick Matador Bowl in Northridge busted loose like 10 pins 
during the Jan. 17 earthquake, and has taken a lot longer to reset. But the 
alley finally will reopen Oct. 15 and has been improved during the $2.25 
million renovation.  
</P>
<P>
 New color overhead scorers have been installed and the alley has expanded from 
24 to 28 lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything internally is new," said Warren Flanigan, a Brunswick vice 
president. "We had severe roof damage and replaced two walls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador Bowl is one of four Brunswick alleys damaged by the earthquake. 
Alleys in Van Nuys and Simi Valley opened within a month of the temblor and one 
in Granada Hills will not reopen at all. 
</P>

 Repeat performance: The Ventura Sailing Club won the Ventura Cup recently for 
the second year in a row. The Ventura Yacht Club finished second. Dick 
Velthoen, city manager of Port Hueneme, skippered his J-35, Rival, to first 
place in the five-race regatta to lead the Ventura Sailing Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for the Ventura Sailing Club, which scored 371 points to win by 
35 points, were Adam Glickman (fourth overall), Steve Maseda and Mike Dunmire.

MOORPARK QUICK TO CAPITALIZE ON HARBOR'S SHODDY PLAY, 48-19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They won't be making instructional films out of this one, but Moorpark College 
will take it all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided immensely by L.A. Harbor's ineptitude, Moorpark throttled the Seahawks, 
48-19, Saturday in a Western State Conference game that had Raider Coach Jim 
Bittner shaking his head afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the best thing to do with the tapes of this game is burn them," 
Bittner said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor gained 321 yards to 277 for Moorpark, but the Seahawks grounded 
themselves with six turnovers, oafish special-teams play and weak pass 
protection for beleaguered quarterback Kenji Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark took control with three first-quarter touchdowns, including one on a 
10-yard punt return to open the scoring by 6-foot, 290-pound defensive lineman 
James Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute into the game, Harbor lined up in punt formation at its 11-yard line. 
But Lance Chor dropped the low snap four yards deep in the end zone before 
kicking the ball only 14 yards downfield and into the arms of Jones, who ran 
the ball back for a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 Raider tailback Gary Clemons added first-quarter touchdowns on a three-yard 
run and a 33-yard reception from starting quarterback Damian Delfino, and 
teammate Isaiah Mustafa hauled in another Delfino scoring pass, of 68 yards, to 
make the score 28-7 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Raider backup quarterback Jeremie Watkins tossed a 12-yard 
touchdown pass to Michael Streeter, defensive lineman David Acosta returned an 
interception 22 yards for a score, and Reginald Wilkes completed the onslaught 
with a two-yard plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino was eight of 15 for 168 yards and two touchdowns, and Watkins 
completed all four of his passes for 38 yards and the touchdown to Mustafa, who 
finished with seven receptions for 128 yards.

GLENDALE SCORES, BUT BAKERSFIELD RETURNS FAVOR -- TWICE -- TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two backbreaking plays that came so fast that anybody who blinked might have 
missed them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's essentially what kept Glendale College from upsetting Bakersfield in a 
Western State Conference interdivisional football game Saturday at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield, No. 1 in the state and ranked second nationally by USA Today, 
could generate little offense but slipped away with a 26-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you create your breaks in this game, but sometimes you need a little 
rub of the green," Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (1-2, 0-2 in conference play) held high-powered Bakersfield to 165 
yards rushing and 206 total yards, but the Renegades (4-0, 3-0) capitalized on 
other unexpected opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came moments after Glendale had taken a 7-0 lead on a one-yard run 
by Ilan Zilberman early in the first quarter, a touchdown that was set up by 
linebacker Neal Sowter's pass interception. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing kickoff, George Jones ran 92 yards to tie it, 7-7. Jones also 
returned a kickoff 95 yards for a score in a 62-14 victory Sept. 10 over L.A. 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big play for Bakersfield came after another Glendale touchdown, a 
70-yard pass play from backup quarterback Jose Ramon to receiver Tim Hilton 
that pulled the Vaqueros to within 20-16 with 2 minutes 9 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Woolfolk, on the front line of Bakersfield's kickoff return unit, took 
an onside kick and sprinted 46 yards for a touchdown that iced the game, 26-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time our special teams have broken down in three games," 
Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't have picked a worse time, because the Vaqueros had a reasonable 
chance to keep Bakersfield from winning its 17th consecutive conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale limited Jones, who led the WSC with 438 yards rushing going into the 
game, to 42 yards in 18 carries. The Vaqueros also held quarterback Deon Price 
to 41 yards passing (five of nine with an interception) and sacked him five 
times. Nose guard Peter Stamison and end Calvin Bell each had two sacks, and 
linebacker Victor Huezo had the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a poor performance offensively, but you have to give credit to 
Glendale," Bakersfield Coach Carl Bowser said. "I hope we learned a lesson from 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, knowing that Bakersfield is more vulnerable to the pass than the 
run (560 yards passing allowed before the game, 84 yards rushing), attacked 
through the air with success in the first half behind quarterback Tony Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale mounted several good drives and held a 10-7 lead on a 52-yard field 
goal by Mike Sierra early in the second quarter. Robert Nicz kicked a 33-yard 
field goal to tie it, 10-10, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delgado suffered a shoulder injury midway through the third quarter and 
left the game. Until then, the sophomore from Franklin High was 13 of 20 for 
130 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros replaced him with freshman Eddie Michel from Notre Dame High 
(three of eight, 21 yards) before Ramon (three of four, 89 yards, one 
interception) took over late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilberman finished with 50 yards in 21 carries. For Bakersfield, Mike Gray 
rushed for 69 yards in 11 carries and Tommy Criner had 70 in eight carries.

DEFENSE GIVES ANTELOPE VALLEY 23-9 VICTORY OVER RIO HONDO 
</P>

<P>
 There was no defense for Antelope Valley College's offense Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For four quarters, the Marauders displayed why their offense is ranked last in 
the Foothill Conference, and it nearly cost them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Antelope Valley's Jarod Dodson ended Rio Hondo's last hope when he 
returned an interception 49 yards for a touchdown to secure a 23-9 
conference-opening victory at Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahshah Hayes also scored for Antelope Valley when he returned a fumble 46 
yards for a first-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory enabled Antelope Valley to avoid its first 0-4 start since 1980. 
The Marauders are 1-3 overall. Rio Hondo is 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley committed four turnovers, but Rio Hondo failed to take 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley's defense, which is ranked second in the conference, held the 
Roadrunners to 142 yards and minus-18 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley missed several opportunities to break the game open, but Coach 
Brent Carder said he was not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect us to put them away," Carder said. "A team that hasn't won 
can't be expected to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley, which averaged 153 yards a game entering conference play, 
gained 189 yards against Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their quarterback (Joel Duarte) was in a radar zone and was easy to read," 
Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised my coach I'd get one and I kept my word."

VALLEY BEATS HANCOCK, 36-25, IN A HOTLY CONTESTED GAME; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: 
ARELLANES PASSES FOR 332 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS AS COACHES ENGAGE IN WAR OF 
WORDS.

<P>
 Tempers flared, opposing coaches exchanged harsh words and there was no 
postgame handshake after Valley College's 36-25 victory over Hancock in a 
Western State Conference game at Righetti High. 
</P>
<P>
 There was more than enough to dampen the spirit of Valley Coach Jim Fenwick, 
whose Monarchs put the game away with an impressive second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick, the recipient of some unkind words from Hancock Coach Barney Eames, 
was shocked with the postgame activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 20 years of coaching, I have never, ever seen a coach go off like 
that," Fenwick said. "I can't repeat some of the things he said. I'm 
disappointed for him because I was proud of our guys and the way we played in 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Arellanes completed 21 of 39 passes for 332 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (4-0, 4-0 in conference play) scored touchdowns on each of its first 
three possessions and extended a 15-12 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, held to one passing yard in the first quarter, threw for 119 in the 
second quarter. He shredded the Hancock defense in the second half and set up a 
pair of short touchdown runs by Deriek Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes connected with wide receiver Ricjard Gill on an eight-yard screen 
pass to cap Valley's scoring.

PIERCE'S 5-TURNOVER SECOND HALF LEADS TO 24-16 COMPTON VICTORY

<P>
 Pierce College had hoped to air out its frustrations against Compton on 
Saturday afternoon. Instead, the Brahmas ended up adding to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Five second-half turnovers by Pierce enabled Compton to rally for a 24-16 
Western State Conference victory at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an erratic offense, Pierce held a 13-0 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That cushion quickly disappeared when Compton (3-0 overall, 2-0 in conference 
play) converted three turnovers into a 17-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Deon Hampton returned Josh Patterson's fumble six yards for Compton's first 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce quarterback David Muir (15 of 27, 147 yards, one touchdown) followed by 
throwing interceptions on the Brahmas' next three possessions as the Tartars 
added another 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce Coach Bill Norton played Ash McNally at quarterback in the fourth 
quarter. McNally responded by leading Pierce to a first and goal at the Compton 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the drive stalled and Pierce (0-3, 0-2) had to settle for a 27-yard 
Russell Gordon field goal and a 17-16 deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce held Compton on its next series. But McNally threw Pierce's fourth 
interception of the day to end the drive.

<P>
 Compton responded with a five-minute, 70-yard drive that resulted in a 
three-yard touchdown run by Jachon Ramseur.

MOTORCYCLE RACING; ERMOLENKO WINS NATIONAL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, when Sam Ermolenko held the national championship trophy over his 
head in the infield of the dirt track at the Orange County Fairgrounds, it was 
the crowning achievement of the triple-crown of speedway racing. He had 
returned from Europe to capture the title after winning the World Final and 
competing on the victorious U.S. team in the World Team Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, he defended his U.S. speedway motorcycle title in front of 
8,723 at the Fairgrounds track and, while the victory served only to salvage a 
disappointing season, he was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Ermolenko, a 33-year-old native of Cypress, seriously injured his leg in a 
crash at a track in the British League two weeks after winning here. 
</P>
<P>
 "My season has been below average," said Ermolenko, who finished 13th in the 
World Final in August, "but I worked my butt off to rehab to the point where I 
could sort of fake my way through this season. You can't just take a No. 1 
ranking lightly, so I did my best and I just have to realize that I won't be 
able to dominate again like last year until they take the metal out of my leg." 
</P>
<P>
 That surgery is scheduled soon, but Ermolenko managed to return to top form 
Saturday night. He finished second in his first heat -- 16 of the top riders in 
the country each compete in five four-man races -- and then won his next four 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it came down to the final heats of the night as the top competitors for 
the title saw their chances slip away one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first three rounds, crowd-favorite Mike Faria was the only rider 
with a perfect score of nine points. Faria, competing in his 17th national 
championship and a regular at the Fairgrounds' Friday night program, won the 
state title last month at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino and appeared to be 
in the groove. 
</P>
<P>
 But he let Ermolenko, Josh Larsen and Greg Hancock -- all of whom had eight 
points -- back in the running when Larsen got the jump on him in the 13th heat 
of the night. Faria made a costly mistake on the second lap while battling 
handlebar-to-handlebar with Larsen. He got bumped to the outside and ended up 
finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next race, Hancock's engine blew on the second lap and he dropped out 
of contention for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, who grew up in Costa Mesa and was riding for the first time since 
breaking his arm last month in the World Final in Vojens, Denmark, needed a 
victory in the the third-to-last race to put the pressure on Faria and 
Ermolenko, but he finished second to Gary Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Faria folded in a fierce battle with Brad Oxley and Hancock and ended up 
third in the heat and Ermolenko won the last race of the night going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back here from the bigger tracks in Europe is always a test," said 
Ermolenko, who will race in England on Wednesday, "but I was really pumped up 
tonight. This is really a great feeling. It's a reward for working so hard."

VENTURA RACEWAY ; SHUMAN STREAK HITS DEAD END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Shuman's four-race Sprint Car Racing Assn. winning streak came to an end 
Saturday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tempe native qualified in a track-record 11.527 seconds, eclipsing Ron 
Dinotato's 11.750 mark established July 30, started fifth and worked his way 
through the pack in the 30-lap feature, but was held off in the end by Yorba 
Linda's Rip Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who started fourth, grabbed the lead from Torrance's Rickey Gaunt 
with an outside pass coming out of Turn 2 on Lap 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman worked his way through the pack, sling-shotting past the other cars on 
every pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A flip by Torrance's Mike English on Lap 19 caused a 10-minute delay, and 
Lakewood's Steve Ostling brought the race to a second halt on Lap 22 when he 
flipped his car in Turn 4. 
</P>
<P>
 With two laps remaining, Shuman lost traction in Turn 2, allowing Williams to 
pull away by two car lengths and grab the victory, his seventh of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Cory Kruseman defeated Shuman and Williams to win the three-lap 
trophy dash, and Hollywood's Bruce Dorn won the 20-lap California Dwarf Car 
Racing Assn. main event.

ONE LAST TRANSMISSION FROM SATELLITE OLD-TIMERS; AEROSPACE: HUGHES AIRCRAFT WON 
A $114-MILLION PATENT JUDGMENT. BUT CHINA LAKE PIONEERS SAY NAVY EMPLOYEES GOT 
THERE FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were young and ambitious scientists in 1958, working at a remote 
government laboratory on rocket technology crucial to national security. To 
this day, their intellectual pride in the work is undimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Hughes Aircraft won a $114-million judgment against the U.S. 
government for patent infringement in June -- the largest patent award against 
taxpayers in history -- it reignited the passion of these Navy scientists who 
assert that they were the real technology pioneers and that Hughes absconded 
with their glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired now, some in declining health, they want one last chance to set the 
record straight about what they accomplished at their secretive outpost in the 
Mojave Desert more than three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is silly that the government has to pay for something we invented in the 
first place," said Frank Cartright, former deputy technical director at the 
China Lake Naval Weapons Center. "The old-timers around here are not big Hughes 
admirers." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is who created the know-how to build the first communications 
satellite, a development that revolutionized worldwide data, television and 
telephone links and spurred the creation of a $2-billion manufacturing industry 
that Hughes dominates. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent dispute has been fought in federal courtrooms for two decades, 
waged by several powerful law firms hired by Hughes and a reticent staff of 
attorneys at the Department of Justice. The court has repeatedly upheld the 
validity of Hughes' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has turned on arcane legal issues. Patent awards often have more to 
do with the legal quality of a patent than on the intellectual value of a 
scientist's work. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protests of the retired scientists, who say they have new evidence, 
represent a bizarre twist in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement revolves around two late titans of Cold War technology: Bill 
McLean, top scientist at China Lake and the inventor of the Sidewinder missile, 
still the most widely used air-to-air missile after 40 years, and Donald 
Williams, a brilliant but troubled Hughes scientist whose name is carried on 
the Hughes satellite patent. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean died in 1976 with nearly 300 patents to his name. Among them was a 
concept for controlling the trajectory of a spinning rocket by using timed 
pulses from a small rocket motor, magnet or pressurized gas jet -- a principle 
known as precession that was used on the Sidewinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who killed himself in 1966, devised a way of controlling the 
attitude, or orientation relative to a plane, of a satellite with precession -- 
an application of the concept that a U.S. Claims Court judge ruled was not 
obvious from McLean's prior work and deserved a separate patent. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of legal sparring and the filing of thousands of documents in the 
case, it had seemed that all the facts were on the table. In June, Judge James 
T. Turner handed down the $114-million judgment, finally putting a value on 
Hughes' alleged loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, half a dozen current and former government officials who worked at 
the China Lake Naval Weapons Center during the late 1950s have important new 
evidence, they claim in interviews with The Times. Though they are not pressing 
their case in court, they insist the China Lake center beat Hughes to the 
punch, building a series of secret spacecraft that used the same technology 
Hughes claimed as its own in a patent filed in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story actually begins in 1958, when the United States launched with great 
fanfare Explorer I, the official answer to the Soviet Union's launch of the 
Sputnik satellite in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 But without any public announcement, the Navy launched two other satellites 
into orbit just after Explorer I, according to John Nicolaides, who was 
technical chief of the Navy's space program. The three-stage rocket, named 
Notsnick, was launched from the underbelly of a Navy jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the rocket was never disclosed, on direct orders from the 
Eisenhower White House, Nicolaides said. "It was not announced, as agreed upon 
by myself and the White House," he said. "I am saying that it did enter orbit 
now for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaides, 71, is retired in San Luis Obispo. After his Navy work, he rose to 
senior jobs at NASA and later chaired the aerospace engineering department at 
Notre Dame University and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis 
Obispo. He eventually won a patent of his own for inventing the parafoil -- a 
parachute that resembles a wing and allows its user to maneuver precisely 
during a descent to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the Navy hoped to use the Notsnick rocket to launch a 
reconnaissance satellite and an anti-satellite satellite, using the same type 
of precession as Hughes outlined in its later patent application, according to 
Nicolaides. Though the devices were not sent into orbit, they were built and 
tested at China Lake between 1958 and 1960, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo L. Keilman, a retired China Lake engineer, said he built the 
anti-satellite model himself in about 1958. It was prepared for launch at a 
Pacific Ocean test range but was destroyed by an explosion in the rocket motor; 
no physical evidence of the device exists today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It nearly landed on my head," Keilman recalled, referring to the wreckage 
raining from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a program to build a spacecraft, using jet pulses for control, 
was developed at China Lake starting in 1958 to photograph the back side of the 
moon, according to former Navy scientist Gordon McCarty, now retired and living 
in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Doig, a Navy historian at China Lake, said his research confirms the 
accounts by Nicolaides and the others, although formal reports, blueprints and 
drawings of the devices cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stuff here wasn't documented well or the documents were packed off 
to a federal documents center" and lost, Doig said. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the lack of formal evidence is attributable to McLean's own style of 
encouraging quick, informal projects to push technology. In some cases, McLean 
built Navy hardware in his own garage workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Doig said the resentment over the Hughes award is prompted by the strong pride 
the China Lake scientists had in their achievements.  
</P>
<P>
 Shunning higher-paying jobs in Los Angeles, they went to China Lake in the 
'50s out of an old-fashioned belief in their country and for the leading-edge 
work McLean was doing, Doig said. "They called this place the Secret City," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartwright said that while Williams deserves a lot of credit for his work at 
Hughes, much of the same technology was developed at China Lake. "There is a 
lot of personal emotion between what we did and what they did," Cartwright 
said. "It is scratching an old wound." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaides believes that Williams and other Hughes engineers borrowed 
liberally from the China Lake work of McLean, McCarty and Keilman. Hughes 
officials were frequent visitors to China Lake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Williams asked China Lake officials for a special gimbal -- a type of 
bearing -- that McLean had invented for the Sidewinder, which Williams then 
used in building a demonstration model for his satellite controller, Nicolaides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows whether Williams talked directly to my dad," said McLean's son, 
Donald. "It is a strong possibility that Williams picked up some of his 
technology by going up to China Lake in the late '50s and early '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, McLean was close friends with Allen E. Puckett, a Hughes scientist 
who would later become chairman of Hughes Aircraft. McLean even entered a 
business deal with Hughes in the 1960s, but the deal went sour and McLean ended 
up in a long and unsuccessful court fight against Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Finch, a Baltimore attorney who represented the McLean family, said 
McLean's technical work "should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars." The 
family has received only modest royalties for commercial applications of his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Savikas, the patent attorney who has long represented Hughes, said he 
could not recall any evidence involving a secret rocket program at China Lake. 
But he recalled that when the government submitted a technical article that 
described one spacecraft project at China Lake, the judge ruled in the 1970s 
that it did not diminish the validity of the Hughes patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Savikas added that the secret program was not likely to have a bearing on 
Hughes' patent, because an anti-satellite device would have been different from 
a geosynchronous communications satellite and probably would not be controlled 
by ground commands, a crucial distinction in the Hughes patent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaides, however, responded that the Justice Department never fully 
researched or documented in court the scope of the work at China Lake that 
preceded the Williams patent filing. Thomas J. Byrne, the lawyer representing 
the government, has declined requests for interviews for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Hughes had hoped that the patent case might be worth $1 billion 
and was disappointed in the $114-million award by Claims Court Judge Turner. 
The firm is appealing the decision, Savikas said. 
</P>
<P>
 While McLean is held in high esteem by Navy scientists, Williams has the same 
hold on the retired Hughes scientists who worked at his side in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He built the original device in his garage," said Murray Neufeld, who worked 
under Williams. "There is very little question in my mind that it spawned the 
whole satellite business. It is a tribute to Don Williams. I didn't realize how 
privileged I was until it was all over." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Williams, apparently distraught over marital difficulties, shot 
himself with the service revolver owned by his wife, a Los Angeles police 
officer. His body was discovered in the bathtub of his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really big blow to everybody," said Boris Subottin, a retired Hughes 
scientist who worked with Williams. "It was a very small group of guys who were 
doing this whole business." 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the huge stakes in the lawsuit, the work done by Williams and 
McLean would likely be long forgotten, much as engineers are seldom recognized 
for their work even when it changes the course of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he thought about was doing something for his country," said LaV McLean, 
McLean's widow. "He wasn't in it for the money -- his top salary was $38,000 a 
year."

STEPPING UP TO THE TABLE; GAMING INDUSTRY EXERTS CLOUT WITH LOBBYING EFFORTS, 
POLITICAL DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Like many losing bets, it seemed a sure thing at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's welfare reform experts reckoned that a 4% tax on gambling 
revenue would be a good source of financing for expanded job training and other 
new programs for welfare recipients. Tax increases are always politically 
touchy, but Clinton's aides were confident that the public would accept a new 
"sin tax" on casinos. The potential payoff: $3.1 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But only days after the tax proposal was floated, a group of Democratic 
lawmakers whose districts include gambling operations trooped to the White 
House to raise objections. Casino owners launched a fierce lobbying effort of 
their own. The Administration quickly folded, with the President promising to 
find other funding sources for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 From slot machine super-plexes to riverboat casinos, America's gaming industry 
has literally hit the jackpot. Legal gambling is now a $30-billion-a-year 
business, and Wall Street analysts estimate it will double in size in just 
three years. Once limited to Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City, the industry is 
breaking ground on projects from coast to coast. Casino gambling, on land or 
riverboats, is authorized or running in half the states; parimutuel betting is 
legal in 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with gambling's explosive economic and geographic growth has come a 
corresponding increase in political influence. Nevada casinos have long been 
important lobbyists in Washington. But now the industry is operating at a new 
level, filling campaign war chests with contributions, hiring well-connected 
lobbyists and mounting savvy public relations campaigns to overcome or 
neutralize the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emerging trend in the gaming industry is to pay more attention to federal 
issues," said Alan Feldman, a vice president of Mirage Resorts Inc., which 
operates casino-hotels in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nev. "We have, as an 
industry, national interests, and we should be participating in those." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides battling proposals to enact a federal gambling tax -- an idea that may 
resurface as lawmakers look for ways to offset lost tariff revenues under a new 
global trade agreement -- casino operators say they are concerned with more 
mundane legislative issues. As a major service-sector employer, the industry 
wanted its two cents' worth to be considered in the debate over health care 
reform. And it is a vigorous advocate of federal, state and local programs that 
promote tourism and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, gaming executives say they want to improve the industry's image. 
They point out that in the 48 years since gangster Bugsy Siegel opened Las 
Vegas' first resort casino, the Flamingo, gambling has evolved into a 
legitimate big-business enterprise, with some casino chains making the lists of 
the nation's largest public companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of lobbying clout, the gambling industry still trails such 
traditional heavyweights as the National Rifle Assn. and the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. But it appears intent on rapidly muscling its way into the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a big industry," said Charles N. Mathewson, chairman of International 
Game Technology, a Reno-based slot machine maker. "But we've never been 
properly represented in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an analysis of 1993-94 Federal Election Commission records by the 
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, three of the top 10 contributors of 
"soft money" political donations are closely tied to the gaming industry. 
</P>
<P>
 ( Soft money is a term used to describe contributions to national political 
party organizations for election-related activities. Unlike donations to 
individual candidates, soft money is exempt from contribution limits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big contributors: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mashantucket Pequot tribe, which runs the highly profitable Foxwoods 
casino in Connecticut. It has given the Democratic National Committee $215,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank J. Fertitta Jr., former owner of the Palace Station Hotel-Casino in 
Las Vegas. He gave the Republican National Committee $230,000 in soft money 
last fall, followed by $24,000 in restricted donations, according to the CRP 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mirage Resorts' Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas, which chipped in $230,000 
to the GOP, and the company's chairman, Steve Wynn, who gave $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the largest contributions to the GOP came after Republican National 
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour solicited financial support last October at a 
meeting with casino executives at Mirage's Shadow Creek resort in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides these big donations, an independent computer analysis of FEC records 
by The Times reveals many smaller contributions, both restricted and 
unrestricted, during the 1993-94 election cycle: 
</P>
<P>
 * $105,000 to the Republicans from Marnell Corrao Associates, a construction 
company headed by the chairman of the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $60,000 gift to the Democratic Party from Bally's Casino Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * $37,750 to the two national parties from Mike Sloan, general counsel for 
Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * $19,000 to the parties and their subsidiaries from William G. Bennett, 
former chairman of Circus Circus, and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * $24,000 to Democratic Party committees from John E. Connelly, chairman of 
President Riverboat Casinos, and his wife. They donated another $20,000 to the 
victory fund of House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 * $24,000 to the GOP from Las Vegas' Lady Luck casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is also a rich source of funds for individual campaigns. Circus 
Circus, which has its own political action committee, has spread $49,500 among 
Democratic and Republican office-seekers in 10 states. Caesars World Inc. has 
given $22,071 to candidates in four states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is trying to be more politically savvy," one lobbyist said. 
"They are giving in the areas where they can be the most help." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money finds its way back to the states. The Republican National 
Committee sent $50,000 to the Nevada GOP after receiving the Shadow Creek 
contributions, according to FEC records. In New York, a Republican state 
senator called for a federal investigation into allegations that a $100,000 
donation from the Mashantucket Pequots to the state Democratic Party was 
intended to persuade Democrats to block a GOP bid to legalize gambling in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Casino executives say the industry does not favor one party over another, but 
some acknowledge that the Clinton Administration jeopardized its relations with 
them by proposing a gambling tax. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democratic Party official said the large contributions generated by the 
Shadow Creek meeting suggest that the industry leans toward the right. 
Executives who attended the session, many of whom are Democrats, scoff at the 
idea -- though they concede that their drive for greater influence in 
Washington is a broad-based effort. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than mere dollars figure in the gaming companies' growing 
political presence. Many are signing up some of the nation's most sophisticated 
lobbyists -- a sign of an interest group's coming of age in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 GTech, a Rhode Island-based lottery company, has hired Akin, Gump, Strauss, 
Hauer & Feld, one of Washington's premier law and lobbying firms. (The company 
also contributed $109,543 in soft money to the two parties during the 1991-92 
election cycle.) MGM Grand is represented by Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly, 
another high-powered lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Native American groups that operate casinos have retained 
representatives in Washington. The Mashantucket Pequots have hired Patton, 
Boggs & Blow. The Seminole tribe of Florida is represented by the Jefferson 
Group. California's Morongo Band of Mission Indians has hired Winston & Strawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-plus groups that operate gambling establishments have their own 
Washington trade organization, the Indian Gaming Assn. Las Vegas interests, led 
by Promus Cos. and International Game Technology, plan to launch their own 
trade group, the American Gaming Assn., early next year. But industry sources 
say its development has been slowed by the traditional rivalries of gambling 
proprietors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaming executives have agreed that they want a big name to head up the 
Washington trade group. Among the possibilities mentioned so far: Fay Vincent, 
the former baseball commissioner, and Tony Hope, chairman of the Interior 
Department's Indian Gaming Commission during the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 One industry lobbyist, who requested anonymity, said the person chosen to lead 
the new trade group will need a thick skin, because "we could become a sin tax 
target here." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization "is going to be well-funded," said another lobbyist, who 
compared its potential influence to that of the tobacco lobby. "They want to be 
a big force. They want to be very visible. And they want to be able to protect 
their interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are relative newcomers in Washington, casino operators already 
have plenty of political battle scars. Many have waged fierce state-level 
fights with church groups determined to keep gambling illegal. They are likely 
to face heavy opposition at the national level as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing a snow job on the part of state and national representatives 
who are trying to promote this industry," said Mike Russell, a spokesman for 
the Christian Coalition, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's political 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that gambling contributes to a variety of social ills, Russell said 
the Christian Coalition plans to track gaming industry political donations and 
include information about gambling in its voter guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials are well aware of what -- and whom -- they're up against, 
but they are confident that they have simple economics on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moral question is fairly easily diluted by the message of revenue and job 
creation," one executive said. "If you talk to representatives who come from 
states that now have gambling, if they ever had a problem (with opposition on 
moral grounds), they don't now." 
</P>
<P>
 The foray into national politics comes at a key point in the industry's 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas is adding several new multimillion-dollar casinos. Native American 
tribes are scrambling to build casinos on their lands. For the first time, 
casinos, racetracks, riverboat operators and tribal councils that traditionally 
viewed each other with suspicion are joining forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even as gaming proliferates across the country, some states and localities 
that have already opened their doors to the industry are having second 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem appears to reflect the industry's explosive growth. 
Casinos and riverboats have saturated some areas of the country, leaving 
profits and revenues lower than expected. Casino operators in some Southern and 
Midwestern states complain that they have become stuck in regulatory quagmires. 
</P>
<P>
 To industry executives, the image-building exercise in Washington means they 
must abandon their traditional low profile. Relative to its wealth, the gaming 
industry has been among the nation's least visible corporate entities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who served as head of the Nevada Gaming Commission 
for five years, said the industry has been "behind the times" in establishing 
its political credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sense that we kind of kept things to ourselves," Reid said. "We 
didn't bother anyone and they didn't bother us." 
</P>
<P>
 From this point on, those bets are off. Full House 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for new sources of revenue and anxious to compete with their 
neighbors, the states have rushed to embrace gambling in its varied forms. Of 
the 50 states, 48 allow some form of wagering, if only bingo or charity casino 
nights. And 26 either have -- or have authorized -- casino gambling, at least 
in a limited form.

INSIGHT; VIEW FROM WASHINGTON; FOLKS ALL HATE BIG GOVERNMENT -- UNTIL THEY'RE 
IN BIG TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

and other national issues from The Times' Washington bureau.

 Jerry Sparks, from the Machinists union in Sunnyvale, Calif., was saying how 
his members need to be "looked on with a little dignity and respect" and should 
be saved from the corporate scrap heap when Lockheed merges with Martin 
Marietta. His voice on the edge of breaking, Sparks implored the audience, 
"There is a lot about our problems we cannot solve ourself." Ron Jones, from 
Colossal Graphics in Palo Alto, asked for help in protecting his patents from 
overseas piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 And Deepak Chopra, from UDT Sensors in Hawthorne, complained that he can get 
big foreign orders for his sensors -- but then it's tough finding a bank to 
provide a loan so he can fill the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here were the complaining Californians, coming all the way to Washington for a 
new sort of town meeting 3,000 miles from home. On a sunny, cloudless day last 
month, 140 people gathered in a Senate office building for a daylong talk fest 
hosted by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to discuss the travails of a state 
still struggling to recover from its worst slump in 50 years. With national 
unemployment at 6.1% of the work force, California's jobless rate is 8.9%; the 
figure is 10% in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer has clout, representing the state with the biggest single block of 
electoral votes -- 54 of the 270 needed to elect a President. And this enabled 
her to produce an impressive collection of Administration celebrities -- Vice 
President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, Labor Secretary Robert 
B. Reich, budget director Alice Rivlin and Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
among others -- to discuss policy and field questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintonites delivered glowing accounts of their accomplishments, bragging 
about a reduced deficit for three years running and claiming credit for a 
revived national economy that generates 250,000 new jobs a month. Everyone 
talked of the blessings enjoyed by California -- its educated residents, huge 
markets and terrific location for benefiting from booming world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message: Believe in our policies. If the country prospers, California 
will come along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time for questions. The audience in the Dirksen Senate Building 
was quiet at first, perhaps in awe of the big-name political folks, perhaps a 
bit jet-lagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers (and formerly a UC Berkeley economist), joked, "This is 
California weather; I know you're awake," and they began lining up at the 
microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 What quickly unfolded was a lesson in reality: that we all want help from the 
government, the Big Daddy in Washington we love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supposedly, these are days of distrust of the federal colossus. Candidates run 
for Congress by demonizing Washington as a den of vipers they single-handedly 
will exterminate. But after all the raging about waste, interference, rules and 
regulations, Americans realize they want the long arm of government to do 
something, anything, about their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Thomas of Coronado, Calif., speaking for the International Federation 
of Professional and Technical Engineers, wanted his workers to share in the 
defense conversion funds going to a San Diego shipbuilder. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria C. Ma of Xxsys Technologies in San Diego, complained how hard it is for 
smaller firms to raise capital for marketing exotic products, such as her 
firm's wrapping designed to keep freeway pillars from falling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen B. Gates, the head of Kaiser Electronics in San Jose, complained about 
regulations and accounting rules hampering the firm's efforts to develop 
civilian-oriented products. 
</P>
<P>
 They all were crying for help because of the pains suffered by a California 
going cold turkey after decades as the biggest government junkie of all, 
mainlining those defense dollars. The state lost more than 600,000 jobs in 
three years; most of those, some 340,000, were linked to defense firms, 
subcontractors and related services. 
</P>
<P>
 The message from the Californians to the Clintonites was simple: Your grand 
talk of policy sounds fine, but give me something to get that defense monkey 
off my back. 
</P>
<P>
 In a less than soothing response, Tyson used an economist's stilted version of 
Clinton's famous campaign line, "I feel your pain." As she put it: "California 
has had a very painful period of structural readjustment. It has to restructure 
its economic base and redeploy its skilled work force." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians like to think of themselves as rugged individuals, scorning 
welfare and embracing hard work. But Tyson's answer might not have been enough 
to satisfy the California business executives, union officials and academics 
who came to Boxer's Washington seminar -- not to mention the millions of voters 
back home.

SCHOOLS ARE CREATING MULTIMEDIA COURSES AND EVEN DEGREES AS STUDENTS SEEK TO .

</P>

 Like others who have read headlines trumpeting the promise of 
telecommunications, Edmond Sanctis thought it would be nice to have a road map 
to job prospects along the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all the predictions that the convergence of computers, telephones and 
television will generate more than a million new jobs over the next decade, 
Sanctis could find little advice to steer him in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a few years ago, the former Columbia University student teamed with 
colleagues and economics professor Eli M. Noam to start one of the first 
graduate programs in the nation aimed at training students for the Information 
Age. Columbia's Institute for Tele-Information offers an MBA in the management 
of information, communication and media resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology-wise, I've always been computer-literate, but I've never had a 
sense of what the potential of the information highway is," said Sanctis, who, 
after graduating last year, became a management associate at NBC specializing 
in developing new media. Sanctis said Columbia's program helped him see "that 
there is this huge potential unexplored territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoked by the spread of cable TV, personal computers and a seemingly infinite 
number of new wireless communications devices, more and more Americans are 
becoming intrigued by the idea of careers in telecommunications. And a growing 
number of schools -- including Columbia, UCLA, USC and San Francisco State 
University -- are responding with special courses and new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this summer, USC's Annenberg School of Communications reorganized itself 
to offer better background instruction in computers and telecommunications, 
interim dean Gerald Davison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school now draws on resources in its film and engineering departments to 
train students in new communications technology. In addition, USC has expanded 
its library resources to allow students to surf the global computer network 
known as the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was long overdue," Davison said, adding that the collaboration among 
academic departments "is consistent with the convergence going on" in the 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But potential job-seekers are finding that the rapid pace of technological 
development is creating uncertainty and turmoil rather than career insight. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there's a lot of excitement about the information highway but 
also a lot of unknowns about how it will develop," said Michael Wirth, chairman 
of the department of mass communications at the University of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the new jobs may not show up for a while, as the telecommunications 
industry undergoes consolidation prompted by deregulation and heightened 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, experts say many new jobs will emerge eventually, particularly 
in marketing telecommunications services and in creating the programming that 
will be needed for the expanding number of cable channels and ever more 
challenging computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers recently forecast that 
private-sector employment in telecommunications and information could rise by 
as much as 1.4 million jobs by 2003, though that projection is at odds with 
Labor Department estimates that see communications employment shrinking over 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who have the best crack at whatever jobs emerge, experts say, are 
those who are technically savvy and can reach out to local markets to explain 
how consumers can apply or benefit from new technology. Demand is already 
growing for tech support personnel who can field queries about computer 
hardware and software operation, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there will be demand for creative people who can blend disparate 
media such as film, text, animation and graphics into entertaining or 
informative multimedia packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can give people a lot of comfort in saying 'Here's the magic 
formula for success,' " said Stewart Personick, vice president for information 
networking research at Bellcore, the research arm of the regional Bell 
telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I were a student trying to prepare for a career in telecommunications, 
I would develop competencies for things that involved programming," he said. 
"Telecommunications will be a big industry, and I think you can (best) be part 
of it by being a creator of multimedia -- a creator of information." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few schools offer full-time degree programs in multimedia, but a growing 
number of continuing and adult education programs, including one at San 
Francisco State, have been started recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from experts such as Buzz Hays, former director of Lucas Films' THX 
division, San Francisco State's multimedia program trains students in 
Information Age technology, exposing them to everything from the Internet to 
electronic media production. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important that people get this knowledge now, because many 
careers will involve aspects of the interactive digital world," said Beth 
Rogozinski, development coordinator of the multimedia program. Digital 
Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
 Visionaries are putting a lot of stock in the information superhighway. But 
the communication and computing industries will need to change in unforseen 
ways if they are to throw off practical employment opportunities. Only the 
motion picture business is projected to show job gains over the next decade.

MUTUAL FUNDS: INVESTORS MAY FIND GOLD IN PRECIOUS METALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best may be yet to come for investors in the Lexington Strategic 
Investments mutual fund, which invests in minerals, metals and hydrocarbons. 
Put the emphasis on may.  
</P>
<P>
 The peaceful transfer of power in South Africa in the last year -- coupled 
with a growing worldwide demand for gold jewelry -- translated into 80.8% 
growth for the fund over the past 12 months and 31.32% over the past three 
months, according to Morningstar Inc., which tracks the mutual fund industry. 
So far this year, it's up about 24%, making it among the best-performing mutual 
funds in the United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as worries about inflation have driven the price of gold to about $400 an 
ounce, fund manager Bob Radsch is rubbing his hands in the hope that the South 
African gold stocks the fund holds will keep rising in value. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's mouth-watering is if gold has a pretty decisive move to 420 (dollars 
an ounce), which it could if jewelry demand is strong enough," Radsch said. "At 
that point, a short squeeze could develop for producers who have sold forward. 
That would be good for the price of gold bullion." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher bullion prices are good for South African gold mines because they would 
encourage greater production. Last year worldwide gold production was 2,281 
tons, just under worldwide demand (principally for gold jewelry) of 2,501 tons, 
Radsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, what goes up can come down, and funds based on gold stocks are 
notoriously volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Strategic Assets fund has done well this year and rose a stunning 
267% in 1993, making it the best-performing mutual fund in the United States, 
it has also had some slumps. It was down 60.71% in 1992, down 19.34% in 1991, 
down 44.27% in 1990, up 55.16% in 1989 and down 46.68% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 And even as one gold fund does well, another can do badly: The Monitrend Gold 
fund is down 10.91% over the past three months and down 34.48% over the past 
year. That's mainly because Monitrend does not invest in South African stocks 
and has thus missed out on the salutary effects of the political changes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the funds are attractive to investors despite the tendency for returns 
to fluctuate wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fidelity Select Precious Metals Fund, for example, attracted $100 million 
in new investments during September. That's after sales were flat for the 
previous nine months, Fidelity said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lexington Fund holds mainly the American Depositary Receipts of South 
African gold mines, including Western Areas Gold Mining and Free State 
Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Radsch is optimistic because demand is great in the Far East, strong in the 
United States and recovering in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jewelry demand has exceeded gold production over the last couple of years," 
he said. "The difference has been made up in the past by big Russian gold sales 
in 1991 and some central bank sales in 1992 and 1993, but those sales seem to 
be coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of paper manufacturers are soaring amid signs that the economic 
recoveries in the United States and Europe are going to exceed expectations. 
The trend continues to help funds that specialize in such types, and one of the 
most successful has been the Fidelity Select Paper & Forest Products Fund, said 
Morningstar Inc.

 The Fidelity fund is up about 20% in 1994, led by gains in stocks such as 
Stone Container Corp., Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Co. The fund has 
been rising since the end of 1990, recording gains of 34.8% in 1991, 12.1% in 
1992 and 18.6% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought lumber looked the best because it was the biggest beneficiary of 
the upswing in the housing market late last fall," Scott Offen, who manages the 
$65-million Fidelity fund, said in a recent report to shareholders. Therefore, 
Offen loaded up on shares of Weyerhaeuser, the largest U.S. private owner of 
forest land. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., has been steadily increasing linerboard 
prices this year because of strong demand worldwide. Linerboard is used for 
building walls and corrugated boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My top stock, Stone Container, which focuses almost exclusively on the 
linerboard market, has been a standout for us," Offen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Chao, a paper industry analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., said he expects 
paper stocks to rise further. "The pricing recovery in pulp and other paper 
grades is occurring across the board," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 12 months, transaction prices for pulp are up 62% and up 36% for 
linerboard, Chao said. Further price increases are going to be implemented in 
the fourth quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are raising our 1995 earnings estimates to reflect this phenomenon," Chao 
said. 
</P>

 At first glance, the data makes you think that people investing in bond mutual 
funds for the long term may want to buy funds with sales charges, or loads, 
rather than those without such charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Why pay a load that typically eats up 4% of your investment before your money 
goes to work? 
</P>
<P>
 Because load bond funds are up a cumulative 94.7% in the past 10 years. That's 
16 percentage points better on average than no-load bond funds, according to 
Dalbar Financial Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say load funds perform better because they take more risks -- to 
overcome the disadvantage of the sales charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Louis Harvey, Dalbar Financial president, said holders of no-load funds do 
worse than those of load funds over time because no-load investors tend to 
change their minds too often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repeatedly," Harvey said, "investors bought their funds and sold them at 
precisely the wrong times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attempts to time the market have been greater in no-load funds and the 
retention rates are also lower, resulting in lower performance than that turned 
in by (load) fund investors." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the loads are a form of discipline, discouraging investors 
from leaving the fund at the wrong times.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: RENTAL LIVING: THE BATTLE OF THE SECURITY 
DEPOSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With roughly 5 million rental units in the state, it's not surprising that 
landlord-tenant disputes frequently dominate the dockets in small claims court 
and keep the phones ringing at the state Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stickiest battles between landlords and tenants is the use and 
abuse of security deposits, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants often claim that landlords try to keep too much. Landlords say tenants 
abuse the deposit, trying to use it as their last month's rent rather than what 
it is: a financial cushion sheltering the landlord from damage to the dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are fairly clear state rules governing tenant security 
deposits, including how much can be collected and how much can be withheld. 
Here's the rundown: 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How large a deposit can the landlord demand? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The most a landlord can require is an amount equal to two months' rent for 
an unfurnished unit or three months' rent for a furnished unit. However, the 
required deposit can be increased by another half-month's rent for tenants who 
have water beds or other water-filled furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much of the money is refundable when I move out? 
</P>
<P>
 A. All of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlawful to characterize any portion of the deposit as "non-refundable." 
However, a landlord can legally use the deposited money to pay for cleaning and 
repairs and to compensate for "unusual wear and tear." The deposit cannot be 
used to pay for cleaning or repair of items that were damaged through normal 
wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
 The pivotal issue is whether the items would have required cleaning or repair 
regardless of who rented the unit or if it was required specifically because of 
your actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My landlord deducted $60 for cleaning even though the apartment was cleaner 
when I moved out than when I moved in. Is that legal? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Some landlords hire a professional cleaning service to spruce the place 
up each time it is available for rent. But the cost should not be borne by the 
former tenant. You are liable for cleaning costs only if the unit is in worse 
shape when you leave than it was when you moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can I use my deposit to pay the last month's rent? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Technically, no. The deposit is supposed to ensure that you leave the 
apartment in reasonable condition. So landlords can require that the money is 
left untouched until they inspect your apartment after your departure. However, 
if you miss a rent payment, the landlord can withhold that amount from the 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What if I move out before the end of my lease? Can the landlord keep the 
deposit for rent that I didn't pay but had agreed to? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. But a landlord must attempt to reduce his or her loss -- and yours -- 
by trying to re-rent your apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How long before the landlord must return the deposit? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The deposit must be returned within 21 days. If amounts were deducted, 
you're also entitled to an itemized statement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do I do if the landlord keeps all -- or a portion -- of the deposit 
without cause? 
</P>
<P>
 A. If the amount involved is less than $5,000, you can take the landlord to 
small claims court. Notably, if the landlord's behavior was unwarranted and 
egregious, in addition to recovering your deposit, you can get court fees and a 
"bad faith" award of up to $600. 
</P>
<P>
 However, make sure you're prepared before you go to court. Send the landlord a 
letter, clearly stating the amount in dispute and why you think it should be 
returned. Keep a copy. Take photographs of the apartment when you move out to 
prove that you didn't trash the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The clearer the case you present to the small claims judge, the better your 
chances of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens to my deposit if the building is sold? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There are two possibilities. The landlord can either return the security 
deposits to the tenants following the sale or transfer the money to the new 
owner. Before returning or transferring the money, the selling landlord can 
deduct amounts from the deposit to pay for unpaid rent or damage, just as when 
you move out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if such deductions are made, the landlord must provide an itemized 
list of the deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if the deposits are transferred to the new owner rather than returned, 
the selling landlord must notify the tenants in writing. The new landlord 
becomes responsible for returning the unused portion of the deposits when 
tenants move out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where can I get more information? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The California Department of Consumer Affairs offers a free booklet titled 
"California Tenants: Your Rights and Responsibilities." You can get one by 
calling (800) 952-5210.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CLOCKS TICKING ON QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Like many victims of the earthquake last January, we stand to receive a 
large insurance settlement to rebuild our home. However, an attorney recently 
told us that we must pay taxes on these funds. Is this true? It hardly seems 
fair. -- W.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Under Internal Revenue Service rules governing casualty losses and 
insurance reimbursements, settlement funds promptly reinvested are not subject 
to income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 How much time do you have to spend the money? When an event has been declared 
a national disaster by the President, as was the case with the Northridge 
earthquake, a taxpayer has four years to reinvest any insurance proceeds 
received to repair or replace a personal residence and personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock begins ticking at the close of the tax year in which the insurance 
funds are received. Ex-Spouse Hits Social Security Snag 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am a 65-year-old divorced woman who was married for more than 20 years. I 
receive a pension of $1,400 per month. My ex-husband receives about $1,000 per 
month in Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 When I applied for spousal benefits on his account, I was told that because 
two-thirds of my pension exceeds 50% of his, I will not get any spousal 
benefits. Can this be true? -- A.C.K . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, it can be true if your pension is from a public agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, recipients of a government pension are subject to what is 
called the government pension offset, which can reduce any spousal Social 
Security benefits you are otherwise entitled to by two-thirds the amount of 
your pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In your case, two-thirds of your $1,400 monthly pension is $924, nearly twice 
the $500 you would be entitled to receive as spousal benefits on your 
ex-husband's Social Security account. (Remember, spousal benefits are half 
those of the primary wage earner.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, all is not lost. Although you will not actually receive any Social 
Security benefits on your ex-husband's account, you are technically eligible 
for them as the ex-spouse of a recipient. As such, you remain entitled to 
Medicare benefits through that account. Figuring Capital Loss in Stock 
Transactions 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Over the years I invested about $10,000 in a particular stock. Many of 
those purchases were made with reinvested dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently sold the shares for about $8,000. My loss, including broker's 
commissions, will exceed $2,000. How do I figure my capital loss, given the 
fact that I paid taxes on the reinvested dividends? -- L.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You figure your losses as you would if you had made the purchases all at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply add up your total investment in the stock: original purchase plus all 
reinvested dividends. This is your out-of-pocket cost, or cost basis in the 
stock -- all of it after-tax. Now deduct your proceeds from the sale. Add in 
your broker's commissions. The result of this computation is your capital loss. 
Mutual Fund Trust: Just Keep a Record 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have opened mutual fund accounts for my grandchildren under the 
California Uniform Trusts for Minors Act. Over the last few years, these 
accounts have produced small dividends and capital gains -- so small that they 
do not exceed the $600 amount that minors are allowed to get tax-free each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in 10 or 15 years, these accounts could have grown substantially. How 
do I demonstrate to the IRS then the incremental nature of this growth if no 
tax return is filed? I have been preparing a dummy tax return for each child 
each year and filing it away. Is this necessary? What else should I do? -- A.C 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A. You are being very conscientious -- and perhaps putting yourself to more 
work than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 According to our experts, it is necessary only for you to keep adequate 
records demonstrating the gradual increase of these funds. You do not need to 
prepare dummy returns. Simply recording the value of the funds as of the 
beginning or end of each calendar year should be sufficient until the time 
comes when your grandchildren have sufficient taxable income to declare. 
Inherited Stock: Calculating Taxes 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When my mother-in-law died in 1991, we inherited stocks worth about 
$200,000. These are now worth $300,000 and we intend to sell them. On what 
amount do we owe taxes? What form do we use to show that we inherited the 
stocks and that they were worth $200,000 as of that date? -- L.G.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You owe taxes on the $100,000 that the stocks appreciated in the three 
years since your mother-in-law's death. There is no specific form you must use 
when you file your taxes to demonstrate your inheritance. Simply list your 
mother-in-law's date of death as the acquisition date of the stock on Schedule 
D. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the IRS ask you any questions about that date, you should be prepared 
to show evidence of your inheritance of the shares and their value as of that 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 If your mother-in-law's estate went through probate, those records will 
provide the evidence you need. If the estate was appraised for any reason, 
those records are ample evidence as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pinch, you can gather newspaper stock market listings from her date of 
death to show the value of the shares when you inherited them.

HOW USE OF 'PERSONAL TOUCH' HAS BUILT A MINORITY PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER ALAN HARPER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the returned phone call, no matter how late the hour. It's the special 
gift, the shoulder to lean on. Touches like these have helped make Terrie 
Williams' reputation as a public relations expert and trusted adviser in the 
entertainment industry and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have benefited from Williams' skills range from neophyte 
job-seekers to big names such as Eddie Murphy, Nelson Mandela and Sally Jessy 
Raphael. A social worker-turned-entrepreneur from suburban New York, Williams 
made her mark in just six years as head of the largest minority-owned public 
relations firm in the nation, one that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very good, she's a pro," said Howard Rubenstein, a prominent press 
agent who has known Williams for 15 years. "She's honest. She gives you a very 
straight answer. There's no dancing with her. Her name and (reports of) her 
stage presence pop up all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she opened her doors in 1988, Williams' client list has included former 
New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins, Washington Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, 
comics Sinbad and Martin Lawrence, actor Wesley Snipes, actor and filmmaker 
Robert Townsend, Time Warner Inc., astronaut Mae Jemison and singer Janet 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 40, author of a newly published book, "The Personal Touch: What You 
Really Need to Succeed in Today's Fast-Paced Business World," attributes her 
success to trying "very, very hard to think about the human beings" she deals 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a deeply spiritual, caring and thoughtful person, and there isn't 
anything that I wouldn't do for someone that I care about," Williams said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foreword to her book, Bill Cosby wrote, "Terrie Williams has become a 
success because she knows how to deal with people and she knows how to treat 
everyone with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams returns telephone calls with a husky, weary voice even as she 
prepares to board a red-eye flight in Los Angeles to come home to New York. She 
holds hands or lends a shoulder when necessary, even when she's resting in 
Mexico or is in France with another client. 
</P>
<P>
 She also finds the unique gift. For Toni Fay, a friend and vice president at 
Time Warner who has hired Williams, it was a makeup compact that erupts into a 
wolf whistle when opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams grew up in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., earned a bachelor's degree from Brandeis 
University and a master's in social work from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressed out in 1978 after being involved with terminally ill hospital 
patients for 2 1/2 years, Williams took a public relations seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 She began free-lancing and tackling jobs where she could do public relations 
work. Then, in the early 1980s, the publisher of Essence magazine wanted her to 
handle public relations for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the dream job I had been waiting for," Williams said, but she was 
deeply involved in another job at the time. "There was no way it would have 
been right to leave that project." 
</P>
<P>
 Essence waited six months, and in 1983 Williams moved to the magazine for a 
five-year stint that ended with a vice presidency and a networking base on 
which she formed her company. 
</P>
<P>
 At the launch, she had two stars lined up: Eddie Murphy and Miles Davis. She 
and Davis clicked after she introduced herself when he was a patient at the 
hospital where she worked. She met Murphy at Davis' 60th birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes her relationships with clients are rocky. She has quit Murphy and he 
has fired her, but they have stuck it out. For her 40th birthday, Murphy sent 
"an incredible basket with a bottle of Geritol and Epsom salts," Williams said. 
"It really made me laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughts of the late Miles Davis, however, bring tears to her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miles was a wild, crazy, talented guy who could tell the funniest stories and 
was as real as real could be," Williams said. "He was just a very special 
person. I miss him more than words could ever say." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things they had in common was a love of basketball. Davis regarded 
the play on parquet as poetry in motion, she said. "He used to hear music in 
the guys' sneakers streaking across the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a friend who played in the National Basketball Assn., 
Williams began to work for NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
 She recognized that young players are but "6-foot-5 babies" who "are awesome 
on the court, but they don't have someone in their lives to guide them." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why she became involved with an NBA program that teaches rookies how to 
socialize and how to deal with the stress of fame and money at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 John Salley, formerly of the Detroit Pistons and now with the Miami Heat, 
remembered his early, lonely NBA days in Motown and how Williams befriended 
him. She has offered him advice on all manner of things, he said, including how 
to handle his wedding a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't nobody better; the lady can do it all," Salley said. "She's a real 
giving woman." 
</P>
<P>
 That also involves the giving, or getting, of jobs. Hundreds of people, from 
attorneys interested in practicing entertainment law to public relations 
interns, have been through the Terrie Williams Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been able to send a lot of people to Terrie because of her 
unselfishness," said Anthony P. Carter, manager of public affairs at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. "There's a joke about how 'I got my job through the 
New York Times.' There are a lot of African Americans who can say, 'I got my 
job through Terrie Williams.' I'm a big fan."

SEA OF BLUES AND GREEN AT DANA POINT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Underwood, 55, of San Juan Capistrano didn't have to take to the freeway 
this weekend to listen to his favorite music. It was as close to his doorstep 
as Doheny State Beach, the setting for the second annual Orange County Blues 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "First there was the blues. Anyone who likes any kind of music likes the 
blues," Underwood said as he relaxed in his beach chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood was among about 10,000 people who came to the festival Saturday to 
enjoy the combination of an idyllic setting bordered by tall, bearded palm 
trees and a sailboat-dotted sea and the down-and-out lyrics and soulful music 
of 11 blues groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood said he much preferred the Dana Point blues festival to the one held 
annually in Long Beach. "There it is hot and overcrowded with no place to stand 
or sit. Here we have ocean and ocean breeze," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet another clear advantage of the Dana Point festival for south Orange County 
dwellers, Underwood and others in attendance said, is that it has brought two 
full days and nights of blues each year to their back yard. In South County, 
blues fans complain, few bars, restaurants or hotels offer their favorite 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is hurting for the blues," said Don Duncan, a vocalist from 
Dana Point who was working as an emcee for the Lifters. Duncan, who was raised 
in New Orleans, said people there like what he called "Cajun funk" blues, while 
Orange County prefers "straight-from-the-soul blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Hyshiver, 57, of Laguna Niguel said she had a been a jazz fan all her 
life and then "got hooked" on blues when she attended the first Dana Point 
festival last October. She recalled that when the festival last year was held 
inland at Heritage Park, it brought noise and nuisance complaints from 
neighbors. Moving the stages to the beach, she said, was a smart idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's, like, no holding back with this thing," Hyshiver said as she pumped 
her arms to an energetic rendition of "In the Midnight Hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was much more mellow and older than the throngs that attend rock 
concerts, which prompted many families to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Phillips, 34, said he and his wife, Kary, brought their 8-month-old son, 
Greg, to the festival because the baby likes to sing to the blues when they 
play it at their home in Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally serious. Big Greg loves the blues and little Greg seems to too," 
Phillips said. The couple had spent the night at a nearby motel and intended to 
devote the entire weekend to absorbing the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Victor Stanley of San Clemente similarly said they brought their 
8-month-old son, Spencer, along with his stroller and playpen because they 
wanted to expose him to music. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I don't have to worry about his ears being blown away," the mother added, 
observing that she would be much more reluctant to take the child to a 
hard-rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was a dyed-in-the-wool blues fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am more into Dixieland jazz," said Martha Bell of Dana Point. But Bell said 
her husband, Henry, who formerly played clarinet in a band, has a preference 
for soft blues. She said that since her husband was in the hospital facing 
surgery, she brought a tape recorder with her and planned to play back some of 
his favorites for him today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy all music," said Bob Blanks, 44, of San Clemente. Blanks said he had 
come with his 7-year-old daughter, 4-year-old son and a friend simply for 
"something to do" on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanks said he was wearing a beeper on his belt so his wife could reach him to 
let him know when she would be joining them for a barbecue on the beach later 
that evening. "I would not answer it for work today," he said.

DRAWING ON TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTER ALLOWS POLICE TO ALTER FUGITIVES' IMAGES, 'AGE' 
MISSING KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The suspect's goateed face stared from the computer monitor, and Orange police 
artist Michael Streed went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Streed punched up on the screen an older photograph of the man -- this one 
showing him barefaced and chubbier -- and put it next to the first. With a few 
clicks of his computer mouse, Streed removed the cleanshaven chin from one 
photo and placed it on the other. With a few more clicks, he shaved the rest of 
the goatee and drew in the philtrum, the indentation under the nose. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finished, Streed had created a genuine-looking composite image, 
merging features from two different periods and looks. The rendering later 
helped witnesses identify the man -- a master of disguise who is said to gain 
and lose weight drastically -- as the main suspect sought in the murder of a 
Yorba Linda supermarket manager and shooting of an Orange security guard this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the wanted poster of the 1990s -- a cutting-edge art form that most 
police agencies still lack the equipment and ability to produce. Using a grant 
from a group that searches for missing children, the Orange Police Department 
is the only agency in California now using a computer system that alters 
photographs of fugitives and "ages" children who have been missing for years. 
</P>
<P>
 And Streed, a 36-year-old officer who draws animal cartoons in his spare time, 
is among a new generation of police artists whose use of computer graphics may 
one day render obsolete the old-fashioned composite drawing -- and the skilled 
hands that have produced it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the beginning stages of doing away with police artists," said Thomas 
F. Macris, a longtime San Jose police sketch artist who helped create one of 
the first computer systems for preparing composites based on hand-drawn 
features. It was part of the evolution that led to computerized photo 
enhancement used by Streed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the research and development could be supported with enough money, you 
could have a composite program that could get rid of the police artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Some departments have used computers for years to create simple composites -- 
assembling the eyes, ears, nose, hairstyle, glasses and other features from 
computer archives containing thousands of pictures of facial parts and 
accessories. These software programs allow investigators who cannot draw to aid 
a witness in re-creating the face of a suspect, a big help for agencies that 
can't afford a staff artist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Streed and a handful of police artists nationwide are beginning to employ 
the next level of technology, which allows police to feed photographs into the 
computer and then use graphics software to alter or even blend them. 
</P>
<P>
 One imaging program, developed by Santa Ana-based Infotec Development Inc., is 
finding use in searching for missing children whose past photographs can be 
merged with those of siblings or unrelated contemporaries to create a vision of 
how the child might look with the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you redraw it, you might lose something from the original," Streed said. 
"You might not have the nose the way it looks. You might have eyes the wrong 
size." 
</P>
<P>
 In time, experts predict, computers will be used to scan police photo files 
for suspects who match features described by a witness. A Northern California 
firm called Visatex Corp. is already experimenting with a system to do that. 
Other expected advances will allow police to create pictures of faces with only 
skull fragments to go on. Such reconstructions are now done by forensic 
anthropologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer has been another valuable tool in my bag of tricks," said Karen 
T. Taylor, a forensic artist with the Texas Department of Public Safety who 
trains police artists and prepares composites for television's "America's Most 
Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hand-drawn composites, used routinely to hunt criminals, find missing persons 
and identify bodies, have been on the law enforcement scene since Scotland Yard 
produced a crude caricature a century ago, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once largely replaced by the Identi-Kit -- a system in which eyes, noses and 
mustaches are applied to a foil face in a manner compared derisively to the Mr. 
Potato Head game -- the drawing made a comeback by the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 It is work that often grabs the public's attention. Sheriff's investigators 
were able to identify a murder victim three weeks ago after the man's 
girlfriend recognized a sketch in the newspaper. But in another recent case, 
the mother of a murder victim in Huntington Beach became so frustrated with the 
pace of the police investigation that she hired her own sketch artist, then 
held a press conference to release a new composite drawing of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Police drawings generate strong interest -- even controversy -- because they 
invite the public to take part in a criminal investigation and attach a face to 
a crime, artists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do seem to get more emotional about it. They're more disappointed if 
it doesn't work," said Marilyn Droz, who for 17 years has been a sketch artist 
for the Huntington Beach Police Department and agencies in Orange County. 
"Sometimes they attach an importance to a composite that it doesn't deserve. . 
. . I guess it's because it's so visible." 
</P>
<P>
 Streed, a trained portrait artist, still prepares basic composite drawings by 
hand, but he has used the computer-imaging equipment to help other agencies 
hunt about a dozen fugitives and missing persons, including five children. None 
has been found yet. Streed hopes to get more business from Orange County 
departments that lack the computer gear, which costs about $25,000 and was 
provided to Orange last year by the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children, based in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 During a demonstration of the age-progression software, Streed calls to the 
screen a photo of a Hayward girl, Michaela Garecht, who was 10 when abducted by 
a stranger five years ago. He blends it with a photograph of an older girl with 
similar features but leaves the original eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never mess with the eyes because the eyes are the big identifier," Streed 
says. He stretches the jawline, widens the face and adds a more up-to-date 
hairstyle with fuller bangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Streed places his creation next to the original photograph of Michaela 
for comparison. "Same girl -- same eyes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Heafner, a former FBI graphics chief who runs the missing-child 
center's computer program, said such advances have helped the group locate 
about 40 children in nearly four years. "We've had good results," he said. "The 
proof is in the pudding." 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts caution that technological advances alone are no substitute 
for skillful interviewing of witnesses and empathy -- and what Macris calls 
"the power of intuition." 
</P>
<P>
 Some worry that a photographic composite might be dismissed too quickly if it 
is not the exact likeness people expect from pictures. Streed said the computer 
equipment is still most effective in the hands of artists with an eye for 
shadows and shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the computer has, poof, made it a touch-of-a-button thing," 
Taylor said. But, she added, the technology has made the work of some police 
artists quicker and set a new standard to keep them sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told classes, 'You need to be able to draw as well as that computer,' " 
Taylor said.

FINDING PROPER HOMES FOR KIDS WITHOUT THEM; SOCIAL SERVICES: THOSE WHO WILL 
PLACE A 10-YEAR-OLD WHOSE AUNT IS ACCUSED OF TORTURING HIM FACE A SOLOMON-LIKE 
DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A father who shot and wounded himself when he and his wife were having marital 
troubles five years ago. A grandmother. A foster home of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, social workers, judges, attorneys and therapists must 
decide which of these options is the best temporary refuge for a 10-year-old 
boy who was removed from the Orange home of his aunt, 31-year-old Cynthia 
Medina, last month. Medina is accused of burning the child's tongue with hot 
knives and anally penetrating him with a miniature baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Based upon their findings, the Orange County Social Services Agency will 
either ask a Juvenile Court judge to place the boy in a relative's home or send 
him to live in foster care with people to whom he is not related. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which marks the first time that Orange County prosecutors have 
charged someone with torture, offers a glimpse at the wrenching decisions that 
social workers and judges must make in trying to make choices that are in the 
best interests of children already traumatized by severe abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to sort through all of the emotional rhetoric coming at us from 
every side to figure out what to do," said Bob Griffith, deputy director of the 
Orange County Social Services Agency. "A lot of times, it can be very 
complicated and difficult choosing between alternatives, none of which may be 
ideal, but all of which have some factors in their favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the question of who an abused child should live with is fairly 
simple. A family member who is willing and able steps forward to take the 
child, agrees to abide by the court's orders and no one contests the decision. 
The county pays foster parents -- including relatives outside the nuclear 
family -- to care for the child; the amount of the payment depends upon the 
child's age and special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 10-year-old boy's case illustrates the more complicated cases of 
family breakdown that increasingly are making their way into the Juvenile Court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many "of these children are damaged by the time they get to us. They're not 
cherubic little angels," said Harold LaFlamme, the Santa Ana attorney whose 
firm represents children in many Orange County dependency cases. "They have bad 
habits, bad hygiene. Sometimes the placements fail because the foster parents 
just simply can't handle the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 In every case of child abuse, social workers confront a host of ethical 
questions as they try to find the best placement for a child. Is it really in a 
child's best interest to put him in a home with the parents who abused him if a 
foster parent who is not related to the child is providing better care? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it fair to give adults guilty of abuse 18 months to turn their lives around 
and reclaim their children? What of the bonds that the children forge with 
their foster parents during this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, in order to remove a child from his parents and place him in a 
foster home, social workers must prove one or more of the following: placing 
the child with his parents would pose a substantial danger to his health; the 
parent must be unwilling to have physical custody; the minor suffers from 
severe emotional damage; the minor will be at substantial risk of being 
sexually abused; the parents are incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents always have first choice -- even if the parent is the offender," 
said Superior Court Judge David Velasquez, who presides over dependency cases 
in Orange County. "It's only after reasonable efforts have failed to make the 
parents' home suitable that you can place the child away from the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when parents are deemed not immediately able to care for a child, the 
Orange County Social Services Agency is required by law to give them 18 months 
to meet a variety of conditions that would make them suitable caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
 These conditions typically include undergoing drug or alcohol rehabilitation 
and parenting courses, among other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it is up to social workers to decide whether the parents have truly 
changed their ways. Although some parents are never reported for abuse again, 
others continue to physically and emotionally harm their children time and time 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 months -- an eternity in the lifetime of a young child -- social 
workers can seek to sever parental rights and place the child in a foster home 
with non-relatives if a parent fails to comply with the conditions set by the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Axelrod, who supervises the attorneys who represent the Social Services 
Agency in dependency cases, says the burden of proof rests with the county 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be clear and convincing evidence before the agency has the 
authority to place a child in foster care with a non-relative," Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Medina case, there is no shortage of relatives willing to take the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father and grandmother have filed papers requesting custody, 
according to social services officials, who said that the father has "very 
strong standing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not the abuser and is at least apparently interested and willing to 
take the child," Griffith said. "We are in the process of assessing his 
capability of caring for and protecting the child." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had been living with his aunt since his parents' divorce in 1989, an 
arrangement that is relatively common, according to social services officials. 
Neither parent felt able to care for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 8, the boy was rushed to the hospital suffering from internal 
injuries allegedly inflicted by Medina. According to authorities, Medina flew 
into a rage when she caught the boy playing with her marijuana cigarettes. 
Prosecutors have charged in court that the boy's injuries were so severe that 
doctors had to perform a colostomy. Medina, a playground supervisor at an 
elementary school, has been charged with torture and felony child abuse. Her 
45-year-old husband, Edward, has also been charged with child abuse for 
allegedly doing nothing to stop the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials refused to discuss specifics of the Medina case, they said 
their placement investigation routinely includes reviewing police reports and 
talking to family members, alleged abusers, children, doctors, teachers and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more severe the kid's physical problems, the more sophisticated the 
placement has to be," LaFlamme said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the boy was released from the hospital. County social workers have 
placed him in a foster home with non-relatives until they complete their 
investigation to determine the best long-term home for him. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scheduled to go before a judge with their recommendation within two 
weeks. Under the law, they have 21 days from the time the child was taken into 
county custody to investigate.

VOLUNTEERS GIVE LOCAL AGENCIES A FALL CLEANING; CHARITY: MORE THAN 1,400 GRAB 
HAMMERS, BROOMS AND PAINTBRUSHES TO SPRUCE UP HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Since opening in July in a modest house, the Family Visitation Center has had 
an ugly little secret: its play area. 
</P>
<P>
 The infants and toddlers who come to the center to spend time with their 
biological parents had to make do with a rotted sandbox and a dilapidated 
playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tara Garrett, one of only three part-time staff members, couldn't 
spare anyone to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday she got the repairs she needed, and flowers too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Visitation Center was one of 47 health and human services agencies that 
received a helping hand from more than 1,400 volunteers who swept across the 
Valley with brooms, hammers, paintbrushes and, in some cases, gladiolus bulbs 
and impatiens. 
</P>
<P>
 The phalanx of volunteers came from 53 Valley companies as part of United 
Way's annual Community Care Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distractions of the January earthquake, more than 1,400 volunteers 
showed up, an increase of 300 from last year, said Barbara Bickel, spokeswoman 
for United Way's North Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual workfest, which began in the Valley four years ago, has become the 
model for Community Care Days being held this month in all six regions of the 
Greater United Way of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event began with a 7:45 a.m. breakfast kickoff rally at the Los 
Angeles Times Valley Edition in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, volunteers dispersed to 54 project sites where they worked from 9 
a.m. to noon, collectively putting in 4,000 hours of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tasks ranged from cleanup and minor repairs to the repair of a fence 
damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really good because the donors get to see where their money goes," said 
Dina Warren, a United Way media representative who was helping out with a group 
of Sunkist volunteers at the Family Visitation Center. At the same time, Warren 
said, "the corporation gets to see why their money is needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the existence of a center where parents can maintain supervised 
contact with children who have been removed from their care was a surprise to 
volunteer Linda Shepler, manager of consumer response for North Hollywood-based 
Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just down the street, and we didn't even know this place was here," 
said Shepler as she stenciled red and yellow tulips onto the fresh blue paint 
of the playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away at the Telfair Health Center, run by the 
Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. at Pacoima's Telfair Elementary School, a team of 
20 volunteers from Great Western Bank wound up their three-hour assignment with 
hamburgers donated by McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 They had prepped the center for its open house this Friday by wallpapering the 
reception room, washing down the walls and floors and planting shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Their team leader, Great Western business analyst Kiersten Obuch, epitomized 
the volunteer spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Obuch came out for Community Care Day after reading a solicitation 
for volunteers in the employee newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 She was embarrassed to find only two other employees of the Chatsworth-based 
bank had showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Obuch took on this year's recruitment as a personal mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help Your Community and Have Some Fun!" she wrote in a staff bulletin she 
distributed to every Great Western employee. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Responses flowed in. Becoming the unofficial coordinator, Obuch 
worked out assignments for 125 bank volunteers who worked Saturday and more who 
signed up for United Way projects in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Then her alarm woke her while it was still dark Saturday morning, and Obuch 
wondered if she really had the right stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently married, she has her own new house to care for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my own painting and my own cleaning to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knew how to cast out the doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought, 'Everybody had to give a little bit, so that's not a good 
excuse,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She put on her work clothes and helped her community.

ELECTIONS / CONGRESS 24TH DISTRICT; GOP TARGETS BEILENSON IN HIS BID FOR A 10TH 
TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With five weeks left before the election, House minority leader Newt Gingrich 
on Saturday said attorney Richard Sybert's bid to unseat U. S. Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) is one of the top priorities of the national 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The combative Georgia legislator made his remarks after he helped Sybert, a 
former Cabinet officer in Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration, raise more than 
$25,000 for his campaign during an event at the sprawling Lake Sherwood estate 
of automobile mogul Robert Nesen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Sybert is going to get the maximum support possible from us," Gingrich 
said in an interview after the fund-raiser. That support will amount to more 
than $60,000 in direct and so-called coordinated campaign money contributed by 
the national party to the Sybert campaign, Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's presence Saturday further confirmed how the national GOP is 
targeting Beilenson, who is seeking his 10th term to a seat that represents 
Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Malibu and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Others scheduled to headline Sybert fund-raisers before the Nov. 8 election 
are U. S. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas), the GOP minority leader in the Senate and a 
1996 presidential hopeful, actor Charlton Heston and Haley Barbour, chairman of 
the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Cabinet secretaries from the Ronald Reagan Administration -- Jack Kemp and 
Edward Bennett -- were in Woodland Hills last month to help Sybert raise money. 
In the primary, Sybert, who was formerly a partner in a major downtown Los 
Angeles law firm, contributed more than $400,000 of his personal assets to the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a race that is clearly winnable for Sybert," Gingrich said. That's 
the case in no small measure because of the deepening unpopularity of the 
Clinton Administration's policies, he said. Because of Clinton, Beilenson "is 
like a swimmer with a 40-pound weight on his leg," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich also said Saturday that he had just reviewed a poll taken in August 
by Arnie Steinberg, Sybert's pollster, that shows Sybert leading Beilenson "by 
eight or nine points." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert campaign manager James Vaughn confirmed the numbers but said they were 
achieved only after pollsters had asked a series of "what if" questions that 
mapped out how the Sybert campaign plans to characterize its candidate and 
Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the year when Democratic incumbents who have been in Washington for a 
long time and are affiliated with the Clinton Administration are in big 
trouble," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson has shown some independence from the Democratic leadership, but he 
is still part of the Democratic machine, Gingrich said. "Don't kid yourself," 
Gingrich said, "you don't get on the House Rules Committee unless you are part 
of the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson is the third highest-ranking Democratic member of the Rules 
Committee, the powerful panel that serves as a traffic cop for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has previously accused Beilenson of using his Rules Committee post to 
quash GOP-crafted legislation to curtail illegal immigration and toughen the 
nation's fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson's campaign called Gingrich's visit the latest 
demonstration of how Sybert's campaign is being artificially propped up by 
outside Republican personalities and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Sybert has no inherent support in the community; he is not from the 
community, and in fact he tried to run in (another) congressional district 
before settling on this one," said Craig Miller, Beilenson's top political 
consultant, responding Saturday to Gingrich's visit. "It's a campaign that is 
heavily dependent on Republican politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert first moved into Beilenson's 24th District about a year ago. Earlier he 
had contemplated running against fellow Republican Carlos Moorhead, the 
congressman from the Glendale-Burbank-Pasadena area, but was finally dissuaded 
from doing so by GOP leaders. Sybert has previously lived in Pasadena, and 
still owns a home there. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such criticism, Miller said he expected the national Democratic Party 
to give Beilenson its full financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller questioned the accuracy of the Sybert poll numbers but said the 
Beilenson campaign had done no polling of its own. "Polls are for politicians 
like Sybert who do not understand this district," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 guests, including actor Tom Selleck, paid $500 each on Saturday to 
have brunch at Nesen's estate in Lake Sherwood and hear Gingrich give a pitch 
for Sybert. Nesen is one of Ventura County's biggest car dealers. His Nesen 
Motor Car Co. Inc. sells a number of brands, from Rolls-Royces to Hyundais. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get rid of those liberals," Nesen said later outside his home, a 
palatial structure crammed with political memorabilia. Nesen was the U. S. 
ambassador to Australia in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's campaign manager said the Nesen event raised more than $25,000 for 
Sybert. The proceeds included an unexpected $1,000 check from Gingrich's own 
campaign committee and a $2,000 check from the National Restaurant Owner 
Assn.'s political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Gingrich spoke at a fund-raiser at the Odyssey Restaurant in Granada 
Hills for U. S. Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), where about 150 
guests paid $100 each to hear the tough-talking Gingrich, a former history 
professor, lash out against the Clinton Administration. McKeon is expected to 
have an easy time of besting his Democratic challenger, James Gilmartin, a 
Palmdale attorney. In 1992, it was Gilmartin who McKeon defeated to win his 
first term in Congress.CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 24

COALITION MEETS TO TACKLE RANGE OF PROBLEMS FACING THE VALLEY; ACTIVISM: MORE 
THAN 100 GATHER TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION AND THE 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
 In an impassioned voice, William (Blinky) Rodriguez sounded the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we leave this room today thinking this was just another meeting, then this 
is a sad day," said the activist who helped negotiate a San Fernando Valley 
gang truce that has held for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to 100 people gathered Saturday at Cal State Northridge for a meeting of 
the San Fernando Valley Unity Coalition. Dubbed "A Voice for the Valley," the 
conference drew everyone from college professors to business leaders to 
activists who all share the same concern: the welfare of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They came together to discuss a broad spectrum of topics -- economic 
development, health, education, community affairs and government relations -- 
and develop strategies for bringing such vastly varied interests together for a 
common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackling large-scale community problems -- be they gang violence or a lack of 
low-cost health clinics -- "is like a football game," said Richard Patlan of 
the national dropout prevention program Cities in Schools. "If people see the 
team winning, they want to get involved. We want to get some wins." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the group's most ambitious undertakings has been a comprehensive 
demographic study of the Valley. The coalition is analyzing the 63-page report 
to decide which problems and issues are most pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows many trends that warrant further study, Patlan said. The 
study indicates, among other things, that Asians and Pacific Islanders have 
become the fastest-growing minority groups in the Valley; that the population 
of senior citizens in some areas grew by 80% from 1980 to 1990, and that 
Valley-wide their numbers increased by a substantial 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities, especially some impoverished neighborhoods, are becoming 
less and less ethnically diverse, according to the data. 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas are "starting to look like South-Central or East L.A., communities 
becoming separated because of poverty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition was born during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, when members of 
various groups and businesses joined together to keep the peace in the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 After tensions eased, organizers realized they had created a diverse action 
group that already had quickly garnered broad-based support. They turned their 
attention to making sure the Valley, which many members say is treated as Los 
Angeles' stepchild, was not forgotten when cleanup and recovery efforts began. 
The Northridge earthquake in January strengthened the group's resolve, members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put tax dollars into the community and we want to make sure we have a 
voice," said coalition publicist Millie Jones, who directs public affairs for 
the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors, a key supporter of the coalition. 
The Valley has long suffered what amounts to "taxation without representation," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While in-depth projects like economic development and demographic studies play 
out slowly, the group also carries out more short-term programs. It is now 
finishing a community resource guide, a single book to list social service 
agencies throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the coalition provided immunizations for children of the San 
Fernando Gardens housing project in Pacoima. About 10 agencies, ranging from 
hospitals to social service groups, collaborated to administer more than 500 
shots at the Guardian Angel Catholic Church.

VALLEY BRIEFING: ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL; REBUILDING THE VALLEY'S POST-QUAKE 
MASONRY WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The concrete block walls that until Jan. 17 separated San Fernando Valley 
neighbors from each other and the rest of the outside world are being steadily 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the city -- which didn't regulate the pre-earthquake 
construction of block walls -- has stringent requirements. Naturally, this 
means wall construction costs have been upgraded, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Block wall construction, which cost between $25 and $28 per linear foot before 
the Northridge quake, now costs about $45 to $55, according to Sam Dempsey, a 
Van Nuys contractor who has performed about 25 block wall jobs since the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the increased costs, however, business is brisk, and not just 
because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sun Valley plant of Angelus Block Co., the largest concrete block maker 
in Southern California, sales have more than doubled compared with a year ago, 
said Tom Reed, sales manager. He said the sales jump also reflects the fact 
that a year ago revenues were severely weakened by the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations for wall construction are in effect only in the city of 
Los Angeles. But the county is also considering changing its building code 
section on block walls, said Bill Haglund, a county engineer and a member of 
the review team. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the city has issued 12,178 building permits for block 
wall construction in the San Fernando Valley, according to statistics updated 
last month by the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department. The Brick 
</P>
<P>
 Shown is a typical eight-inch channel block. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel bricks are used every two vertical feet. Wall-Building Regulations 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Northridge earthquake, there were no requirements on construction 
of block walls six feet high or lower. Thousands of block wall fences collapsed 
during the quake, leading city officials to introduce construction regulations 
for walls three and a half feet to six feet in height. Building permits must 
now be obtained before construction begins, and two on-site inspections are now 
conducted by building officials. Building the Wall 
</P>
<P>
 1. Trench is dug for the concrete foundation block, called "footer". 
</P>
<P>
 2. Steel rebar is set vertically every two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, rebar was typically spaced every four feet. The new building 
code requires spacing of no more than every two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Concrete is poured for footer. 
</P>
<P>
 The footer must be at least two feet wide by one foot deep or one foot wide by 
20 inches deep. Pre-quake, most footers measure one foot square. 
</P>
<P>
 4. After footer dries, staggered blocks are laid. Vertical rebar comes up 
through cells in the blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the standard block is eight inches high and about six inches wide, 
walls may be built of any size brick, masonry or concrete that can be 
reinforced with rebar. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Horizontal rebar is placed through the channel blocks every two feet, or 
every three rows of eight-inch blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Horizontal reinforcement rods, seldom used before the quake, are now required 
by code. 
</P>
<P>
 6. When wall is completed, the cells through which the vertical rebar pass are 
filled with concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The footer (concrete foundation) was supposed to be one foot wide by one foot 
deep. Finding a Contractor 
</P>
<P>
 With all the opportunities to make a quick buck, a number of unqualified 
people have been selling their services as masonry contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitive bids can expose an inexperienced or unqualified contractor. Wildly 
low bids sometimes indicate that a contractor is misrepresenting himself and 
his qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure your contractor is licensed, contact the Contractor's State 
License Board at 800-321-2752. You can also check whether any complaints have 
been lodged against him or her.

FIREFIGHTERS RESCUE STRANDED HIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County firefighters dropped from a helicopter and scaled a hillside to 
rescue two Tustin hikers who strayed from the trail Saturday and ended up 
clinging to the steep, slippery shale shouting for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were stuck there on the side of the hill," said Danielle Parker, 23, who 
spotted the couple around 2:30 p.m. while walking through the Tucker Wildlife 
Sanctuary with her fiance, his two boys and her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man had taken off his shirt and was waving it," she said. "The girl 
seemed like she had her feet wedged in as well as she could. They were shouting 
'Help. We need help. We're stuck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Parker alerted a park employee, who called firefighters. At the time, the 
firefighters happened to be practicing helicopter rescue techniques two miles 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moseyed on up there and got them down," said Battalion Chief Gene Begnell. 
"They were both lying flat against the shale. It's very difficult to climb in 
and once you start sliding, you could go all the way to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Begnell said the couple, Sally Cervantes, 23, and Eduardo Isaac Perez, 23 -- 
both wearing just tennis shoes and shorts -- had been hiking and thought they 
could make it up the hill and "got to a spot and realized they couldn't. They 
were up there for a while before anyone spotted them."

GETTING A FEEL FOR NATURE WITH A HELPING HAND; ZOOLOGY: SCOUTS LEAD BLIND, 
UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTHS ON SENSORY SAFARI OF MOUNTED CREATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of spending another Saturday watching cartoons, Ryan Frederick, 12, 
donned his Boy Scout uniform and spent the day leading a blind boy through 
tents filled with wild animals. The stuffed and mounted kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of fun leading," said Ryan, who lives in Brea. "I thought it would 
be kind of hard and boring; instead it's easy and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 blind, handicapped or underprivileged youngsters participated 
in Safari Club International's second annual Sensory Safari, a hands-on 
educational program at Featherly Regional Park. All animals were donated by a 
Fullerton taxidermy company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose the sightless because it's a hands-on experience," said John 
DeFalco, president of Safari Club International's Los Angeles chapter. "We 
included the underprivileged because they never get to go to the zoo. For many 
of these kids, their lives are confined. Their eyes are their hands. In a zoo, 
you can't get this close to an animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Safari Club International is an organization that works to protect animals and 
hunting. The club helps preserve wildlife species through financial and 
political support for professional wildlife management. 
</P>
<P>
 Each blind person was paired with a guide from Southland Boy Scouts and Girl 
Scouts troops. The Scouts led their partners through two tents. Each tent had 
25 African and North American wildlife species. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Wright, 11, the boy Frederick was guiding, delighted in Sensory Safari. A 
legally blind youth from Roland Heights, Evan darted from one exhibit to the 
next, petting, hugging and kissing the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evan? Would you like to feel the ox?" asked Frederick, leading him by the arm 
to the large furry beast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," said Evan, wrapping his arms around its body. 
</P>
<P>
 Each station was manned by a Safari Club member who gave the youngsters bits 
of information about the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like to hear everyday talk about the animals," said Mari Lou Carlson, a 
member of the Safari Club's Los Angeles chapter. "And then to see the younger 
Scouts helping the other kids, it's just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by her Scout, 12-year-old Jenny Kaufman's face lit up as she touched a 
dall sheep. Jenny is also legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This part is soft," said Jenny, a resident of Upland, in describing the 
sheep. "The horn is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the wildlife exhibits, there also was a climbing activity in 
which youngsters in harnesses walked on a steel rope from one tree to the other 
by pulling themselves along with ropes. Much to the their delight, Disney's 
Donald Duck and Goofy also were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tree thing was fun," Evan Wright said. "Most kids don't get to do that."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; UNZ 
BUCKS TREND AGAIN WITH BROADSIDE AGAINST 'SINK OUR STATE' INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike Unz?: After winning 43% of the Orange County GOP primary vote against 
Gov. Pete Wilson with a platform that criticized multiculturalism, political 
correctness and bilingual education, Republican entrepreneur Ron Unz has taken 
a strong stand against Proposition 187, the immigration initiative on the Nov. 
8 general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came close to endorsing the initiative until I actually read the provisions 
carefully, and found that they were crazy," Unz said in a statement. He said 
"no sincere Republican or conservative" should support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the "Save Our State" label used by initiative proponents, Unz 
called it "Sink Our State," claiming it is immoral, would be costly to the 
state and would create an identification system that reminds him of "old 
Communist Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Republicans said they weren't too surprised because they believe Unz 
espouses more of a Libertarian, rather than Republican, philosophy. A gleeful 
Democrat, meanwhile, wondered if Unz was taking the opposite position of Wilson 
because of their past rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron Unz would take this position because he believes in it and I don't think 
it has anything to do with any remaining animosity against Wilson," said Jo 
Ellen Allen, the vice chairwoman of the local GOP. "It just shows that 
Republicans can disagree on more than the abortion issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it plays well in Santa Ana: A poll recently conducted for Republican 
candidate Jim Morrissey in the 69th Assembly District showed that the candidate 
who backs Proposition 187 gets wide support in the central Orange County 
district, which has a large ethnic population and a 21-point Democratic voter 
edge. According to the survey of 600 voters, Morrissey's position in favor of 
the measure was supported by 58% of those polled, compared to 27% opposed. (A 
recent Field Poll showed statewide support at 57%.) Morrissey will be playing 
up that issue since his Democratic opponent, Mike Metzler, opposes the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bushwhacking: For months, Rep. Robert K. Dornan has downplayed the prospect of 
a Democratic challenge in the upcoming November election. 
</P>
<P>
 But, accustomed to the guerrilla warfare of campaign politics, Dornan has 
decided to take nothing for granted: He has enlisted the support of former 
President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush will be featured at an Oct. 19 fund-raiser for Dornan ($1,000 per couple 
for the private party) at the Chanteclair restaurant in Irvine. A photo of Bush 
and Dornan are on the invitation with a message from the former President: 
"Friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 After being surprised by a well-financed primary challenger in 1992, Dornan 
said he's gathering forces to ward off a surge by Democratic opponent Mike 
Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can happen, it can happen. I don't want to be surprised ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser will be Bush's first visit to Orange County since the 1992 
election, when local Republicans gave him the lowest support for any Republican 
presidential candidate in 56 years. However, Dornan says local conservatives 
have realized their mistake in not backing Bush, a "man with character," 
compared to the "emperor from Arkansas (who) has no clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Farber replied: "This (visit from Bush) just shows how desperate Dornan has 
become. He has already raised over a million dollars. What is he going to do 
with all the money except to buy the respect he cannot earn?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Term limits: Brett Williamson, the Democratic candidate in the 45th 
Congressional District, has challenged incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) to sign the "Voter Protection Pledge" sponsored by the 
U.S. Term Limits group. By signing the pledge, Williamson gave his support to 
the state law, which is still before the courts, limiting Congress members to 
six years in office. Williamson said he will abide by the limit even if the law 
is overturned by the courts, and wants Rohrabacher to pledge that he will serve 
only until 1998 if he is reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher is making no such promise. He released a statement saying he has 
signed a "much more significant" pledge that commits him to voting for a term 
limits constitutional amendment that is opposed by House Democratic leaders. 
"What's more significant -- the time one congressman stays in office, or 
setting term limits for all members of Congress?" Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 'U' stands for . . .: For weeks, Democratic state attorney general candidate 
Tom Umberg's campaign hounded Republican incumbent Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren for 
having an unimpressive 10- to 15-point lead over Umberg in early public opinion 
polls. Now, a new Field Poll shows Lungren pulling ahead of the Garden Grove 
assemblyman by 23 points -- with 44% support among likely voters, compared to 
21% for Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'U' in Umberg still stands for Uphill, Upstream, Unknown, and 
Unelectable," the Lungren campaign claimed in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager responded: "I find their comment very 
Underwhelming, and they are Underestimating us, just as the Republicans here in 
Orange County have over the last few years." UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Monday: 41st Congressional District Democratic candidate Ed Tessier has a 
fall campaign kick-off party and fund-raiser at Cancun's restaurant, 245 Gentle

SUNLAND-TUJUNGA RESIDENTS MARCH TO SHOW THEIR PRIDE IN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sick of insulting nicknames and negative publicity, dozens of residents 
marched Saturday to promote the virtues of their community and spotlight local 
efforts to control crime. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 paraded down Foothill Boulevard on Saturday in the first 
Sunland-Tujunga Pride March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've grown up here," said marcher Valerie Statland, 14, a Tujunga native. 
"I've been able to see the changes for the worse, and it's not right. I have 
friends who've been mugged. It's getting to be like South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to say we're going to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the pride march was to accentuate the positive and peel off the 
unwanted labels that have long stuck to these two communities, nestled at the 
base of the Verdugo Hills and home to a population of about 85,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Some marchers say they are prepared to face down drug dealers and abusers, 
gang members and others who pose a threat to the peace and stability of the 
neighborhood. And, they say, the faceoff has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Nelson, founder of the Tujunga Crime Stoppers, said her group has been 
instrumental in persuading apartment building owners to clean up their 
properties and evict residents convicted of drug dealing or other crimes. Its 
efforts, combined with the 35-unit Neighborhood Watch and a corps of 
red-jacketed Citizens Patrol volunteers, have made a difference, residents and 
police officials say. Nelson's group patrols crime-battered neighborhoods in 
cars, using cellular phones to call in suspicious activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the community initiatives are working. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the big problems here is narcotics," said Los Angeles Police 
Department Officer Ernst Cabriales, who has manned a substation operated by the 
Foothill Division in Sunland for six months. "For some reason, the drug of 
choice here is methamphetamines. There's a higher rate of theft caused by some 
of the users, who steal to support their habit. But it's not the entire area, 
it's only a problem in isolated areas, especially around Little Landers Park. 
That's where the Neighborhood Watch groups have really had success." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales said events such as the pride march, which followed a route south on 
Foothill Boulevard to Commerce Avenue and concluded with a rally at Little 
Landers Park, are important because they bring the community together. The 
Sunland-Tujunga Coordinating Council and the Rotary Club sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners said citizen patrols have had more impact on residential areas, 
but believe they have indirectly had a positive effect on commercial areas too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were robbed several times before we put up the gates," said Betty 
Merithew, owner of Merithew True Value on Commerce Avenue near Foothill 
Boulevard. "But nothing has happened in the last two years. We had our window 
smashed in and some things were stolen. The community patrols seem to have 
cleaned it up."

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 70th 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Jim Toledano of Costa Mesa and Republican 
Marilyn C. Brewer of Newport Beach. Here's how the candidates stand on four 
issues. "Three-Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano: "The 'three-strikes' law is more political showboating about crime. 
It wastes prison space on nonviolent felons, limits the amount of prison time 
given to violent first-time felons, and requires billions of tax dollars we do 
not have. Real reform means allowing courts to sentence first offenders 
according to the seriousness and violence of their crimes; long-term 
imprisonment of violent felons; adequate parole supervision, not unsupervised 
release; elimination of expensive multiple court hearings; permanent 
hospitalization of sex offenders, not the prison revolving door; and an end to 
our failed and appallingly expensive 'war on drugs,' which drives up the price 
of addictive drugs, the major cause of violent and property crimes today. Real 
reform is crime prevention, which is far cheaper than reacting to crime. 
Quality public education, leading to better jobs and community involvement, 
will prevent crime; clever slogans and billions more tax dollars spent after 
crime has been committed will not." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer: "I support California's 'three-strikes' law. I also support 
'one-strike' for rapists. But while these reforms will keep hardened criminals 
off the streets, we also must look to our neighborhood community groups, 
schools and churches to ensure that our youth develop a strong sense of right 
and wrong. And if they cannot get the message at home, I support expanded use 
of 'boot camps' that teach discipline, responsibility and job skills to 
troubled youth. Despite what the ACLU might say, I believe that tough 
intervention early on is the most compassionate way to deal with crime." 
Proposition 187, to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano: "Whatever the cost may be to California from illegal immigrants, 
this initiative is badly written and will be tied up in the courts and not 
accomplish any legitimate goals. I reject the racist assumption that illegal 
immigrants can be distinguished by sight from those here legally. I oppose 
putting thousands of children out of school and on the streets to commit 
crimes. I oppose requiring legal residents to carry Soviet-style identification 
cards. I oppose refusing treatment to potential carriers of epidemic disease 
because of their status. I oppose turning teachers and health-care workers into 
police. I support negotiating with the Clinton Administration for reimbursement 
of the cost of illegal immigrants, and I wonder why Republican governors never 
asked Reagan and Bush to pay these costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer: "I support SOS. And while the day after the election might find SOS in 
the courts, I think that process will bring about an important dialogue within 
the federal government as to how our nation deals with illegal immigration. 
California can't shoulder the financial or social burden of this kind of 
influx. I believe, too, that we need to revisit the idea of automatic birth 
citizenship for a child of non-resident aliens. California's financial welcome 
mat is too worn to even fund its own citizens' needs." Single-Payer Health 
Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano: "I favor a system of universal basic health care to supplement the 
present system. Whether health services are provided by a public or private 
entity, or a combination, is of little importance so long as those services are 
provided efficiently and fully, and so long as health-care decisions are made 
for medical reasons, not financial considerations. There are serious problems 
inherent in enacting major legislation by initiative, and this initiative is 
not perfect, but today the special interests and partisan politics have 
stalemated legislative reform. If this initiative passes, I will work to make 
it better. If it does not, I will work for a legislative solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer: "Single-payer will be the final nail in the coffin for California's 
economy. It's economic suicide to adopt a costly employer mandate if California 
is alone in the proposal's enactment. With such a drastic increase in taxes 
(some believe that it will increase our taxes by $40 billion per year), any 
business that may have wanted to move or expand here will quickly be on the 
phone to Nevada or North Carolina. I will be active in my opposition to the 
initiative and will only support health care reform that protects small 
businesses and jobs, provides tort reform, and preserves medical choices." 
Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano: "I oppose bringing the present airport-related noise, pollution and 
traffic problems which plague one part of Orange County to another. There is no 
room in urbanized Orange County for any major airport facility. El Toro is in 
the wrong place for a major commercial airport, and to bring the present 
facility to acceptable standards will be as expensive as building an airport 
from scratch. I will work with the federal government to find a site for a 
regional international airport which will replace inadequate and unsafe 
airports here and in San Diego. Meanwhile, if El Toro does shut down, we must 
work together to put 21,000 new jobs, and more, in a 21st-Century industrial 
facility to be built on that site." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer: "Anyone who gives a quick 'yes' or 'no' on a commercial airport at El 
Toro is doing so without all the facts at hand. We don't even know if a 
commercial airport is physically or economically feasible at the site. We 
haven't even discussed the alternatives to an airport that might make a lot 
more economic sense. To answer all our questions, we don't need an initiative 
-- instead, we need to let the existing planning process run its course. Only 
then should any public official take a solid stand for or against an airport at 
El Toro."

$687-MILLION BID WINS TOLLWAY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transit agency officials have awarded a $687-million contract to an 
international consortium that will build the 23-mile Eastern tollway that will 
parallel the Costa Mesa Freeway from the Riverside to Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids were received from four companies, but the contract was awarded Friday to 
Silverado Constructors, a joint venture of Santa Ana, San Diego, German and 
Japanese companies that submitted the low bid.The consortium's offices are in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin in early 1996 and be completed by late 
1999, said officials of the Transportation Corridor Agencies, a public group 
formed by special state legislation to construct three tollways in Orange 
County, including the San Joaquin and Foothill tollways. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll road will be administered by the Foothill/Eastern tollway agency. 
Under the agency's contract with Silverado, the consortium agreed to build the 
tollway without any cost overruns and guaranteed the completion date.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COMMUNITY CELEBRATES SAFE RETURN OF VICTIM; 
HOMECOMING: PARTY IS NEIGHBORS' FIRST CHANCE TO SHARE EMOTIONS WITH PAULA 
HARRINGTON, KIDNAPED AND TAKEN TO ARIZONA IN JUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the party of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of this 1,500-member community gathered Saturday at Val Verde Park 
to celebrate the return home of Paula Harrington, 26, a real estate agent 
kidnaped and taken to Arizona by an armed man in June. Her safe return a few 
days later was met with jubilation by residents, many of whom scoured the 
nearby hills for her, but the party was the community's first chance to 
celebrate with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just such a miracle she's home and safe," said DeeAnn Tippetts, owner of 
the real estate office in Castaic where Harrington was working when she was 
abducted. "You just can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hugs and thank-yous flowed freely between Harrington and more than 100 
friends, family members, law enforcement officers and others at the five-hour 
party. For Harrington, it was a reminder of the best part of an experience that 
has many dark memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to focus on each day, and when I get down, I focus on what's around 
me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's party was no back-yard barbecue. Five regional bands of various 
types performed onstage, sheriff's officials and volunteers showed up on 
horseback and set up a display of rescue equipment, and dozens of hot dogs and 
plates of Mexican food were handed out from nearby grills. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was actually two parties that merged during two months of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she started planning a party a couple of months ago to thank 
law enforcement officers and the dozens of residents who helped authorities 
search for her and distributed thousands of flyers throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents, meanwhile, were making their own plans. Shane Coleman, 
president of the Music Channel, an organization that arranges special events, 
said he wanted to give Harrington a proper welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Paula made it back from her abduction she told me about what happened, 
but the whole conversation was about how it brought the community together," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was abducted June 29 while showing houses to a man posing as a 
prospective buyer. She was found tied up two days later in a motel room in Gila 
Bend, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Her suspected abductor, Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, was arrested July 6 after he 
allegedly displayed a handgun to a dancer in a topless nightclub in Utah. He 
was extradited to California and is scheduled to stand trial Dec. 6 in Los 
Angeles on one federal charge of kidnaping and could receive life in prison 
without the possibility of parole if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington surprised local law enforcement agencies by giving them custom 
plaques she had made after her return home. One was handed to Harvey Cantor, a 
retired Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective bureau chief, whose 
last major case was the search for Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted you to have this so you would always remember me," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor, who owns a stack of plaques after his nearly 30-year career, said this 
is one he won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in my career I've had the pleasure of being honored 
this way by a crime victim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington has quit her real estate job, at least temporarily, saying the 
stress of trying to show residences was too much to bear. But she said she may 
have taken a step on the road back to normalcy when, with with the help of a 
co-worker, she took some former customers to view homes three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so anxious and scared I almost turned around on the freeway," she said. 
"But by the time I finished, it was fun. I said to myself, 'You did it.' "

INTERVIEW; ONE ICON, HARD-BOILED; ROBERT MITCHUM HAS BEEN MAKING IT LOOK EASY 
FOR 50 YEARS -- THE ACTING PART ANYWAY. IT'S THE LEFT HOOKS AND BUCKETS OF 
BLOOD YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Champlin, Charles Champlin is The Times' arts editor emeritus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No two star actors are alike, of course, and it is far more than a matter of 
appearances. The survivors are separated from the also-rans because the camera, 
and the audiences, perceive something beyond the parts and the lines -- some 
internal quality of menace, charm, intensity, wit, sexuality or simply the 
scars and strengths of real-life experience that are uncommonly interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Survive long enough and you become an icon. Hollywood no longer creates icons 
as numerously as once it did. A fair-sized body of work is required, but it's 
hard to compile a body of work in present films, even with Mike Ovitz at your 
shoulder. And the interchangeable stars of television often seem as ethereal 
and transient as the medium itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The scarcity of true icons makes those we have all the more appealing. Robert 
Mitchum has always seemed to make his unlikeness to other stars a kind of 
trademark, a star who regards his status with an amused indifference and who 
says what he would treasure more than anything else would be the ability to 
walk down a street unnoticed -- as impossible for him in Rome as in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
 At 77, Mitchum is still hard at the business of being Robert Mitchum. He is in 
fact off to Oslo early this month to star in a Norwegian film called "The 
Sunset Boys," which will also shoot in Cologne, Germany, with Cliff Robertson 
as one of his co-stars in a story about four physicians with a burial pact to 
see each other out in style. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll interrupt that production to fly to Arizona for a couple of days' work 
in "Dead Man," by the assertively independent Jim Jarmusch and starring Johnny 
Depp, then return to Oslo to finish there a few days before Christmas. The work 
for Jarmusch -- an interesting entwining of film generations -- sounds to be 
one of those cameos in which the actor's mere presence, an image shaped by a 
half-century of acting, saves the director 20 pages of exposition. (Charlton 
Heston's cameo in "Tombstone" functioned in much the same way.) 
</P>
<P>
 No other actor comes to mind who has actually done time on a chain gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum did, in Chatham County, Ga.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was 15," Mitchum said during a conversation at his home in Montecito 
recently. "They nailed me out of Savannah, as a dangerous and suspicious 
character, with no visible means of support, which was a common charge of 
vagrancy, and gave me 180 days on the chain gang, on the Brown Farm." It was a 
good deal for the county: "It cost 38 cents a day to feed a man, but the county 
rented us out to the highway department for $2 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum had been riding the rails since he was 12. Robert was born Aug. 6, 
1917. His father was killed in a railroad accident when Mitchum was 2, and his 
remarkable mother -- a Norwegian immigrant who was a linotypist and writer for 
a Bridgeport, Conn., newspaper -- had to farm out the children. At one point in 
his childhood, young Robert suffered from pellagra, which is associated with 
improper diet, and someone once argued that he was "obsessed by the phantom of 
failure," almost perfectly disguised by his easygoing style. 
</P>
<P>
 After many an adventure, Mitchum gravitated to the home of a sister in 
Southern California. He arrived characteristically in what the song calls a 
side-door Pullman car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the bums on the train said, 'Don't ride into the yards because 
the railroad cops would grab you and put you in Lincoln Heights jail and 
de-louse you.' But I was so exhausted I rode straight on in to the Alameda 
Street yards. There were four Mexicans sitting under a water tank and they had 
a guitar and a big jug of wine and they called me over and gave me some wine 
and played a few numbers. They showed me how to get out of the place; there was 
a 12-foot fence around it. Then they gave me directions to the Midnight Mission 
and I had a meal. And I said, 'This must be it, the Promised Land, because 
they've got a reception committee, even for the bums.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed awhile, then went back East and worked in a factory in Toledo before 
he tried California again. When he returned, he says: "I worked as a dishwasher 
and a busboy and a stevedore. Then I got married." He had met Dorothy Spence in 
1940; some 54 years later, in defiance of Hollywood tradition, they are still 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed steady employment and got a job at Lockheed, working the graveyard 
shift." He couldn't sleep and in time he went blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put me in Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in Glendale for 72 hours and 
I went to a doctor who said, 'I'm sorry to inform you' -- and I collapsed -- 
'that there's nothing wrong with you.' I said, 'You don't go blind if there's 
nothing wrong with you.' He said, 'You can't sleep because you know you'll have 
to go to work and you hate the job.' I said, 'What'll I do?' He said, 'Quit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Lockheed, he was left with $41.11, as he remembers, but found a 
job selling shoes on commission. "I'd get fired four or five times a day for 
wisecracking," Mitchum says, and then be rehired. "I made my own hours so I 
could go off and audition." Inevitably, being a handsome devil, he had found 
his way to community theater in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in "The Lower Depths" at a theater on La Cienega and, among other 
roles in Long Beach, played Duke Mantee in "The Petrified Forest," the role 
that pushed Bogart toward stardom in the 1936 film version. An agent saw him 
and urged him to try out for film roles. 
</P>
<P>
 He had stage experience but no training. "Training to be an actor is like 
going to school to learn to be tall," Mitchum said, an attractive heresy. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed on at United Artists in the early 1940s to do Hopalong Cassidy 
Westerns at $150 a week. He swore he was a terrific rider, explaining that he 
used to bust broncos on his father's ranch in Texas. He was thrown four times 
before he managed to look like a rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Film historian Ephraim Katz totted up that Mitchum appeared in 18 films his 
first year, 1943, most often as a heavy. William Boyd told him that he detected 
a meanness around the sleepy eyes. Which film came first is not entirely 
certain, but it seems to have been "Border Patrol." He also did a bit in "The 
Human Comedy" at MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his first visit to the spectacular rock formations called the Alabama 
Hills at Lone Pine near Mt. Whitney to shoot "Hoppy Serves a Writ," also in 
1943. Mitchum shot five more Westerns in Lone Pine, including his first 
starring part (and 23rd film), the title role in "Nevada" in 1944. It was one 
in a Zane Grey series that had previously starred Tim Holt, who had just gone 
into the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was starring, Mitchum found when they got back to RKO for 
interiors that he was still dressing in the upstairs locker room, with a locker 
that wouldn't accommodate his Western hat, and no place to shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I just went out in the park in the center of the studio and took off my 
clothes and got a garden hose and took a shower. Ed Killy, the director, ran 
out and said, 'What the hell are you doing? Put your pants on.' He dragged me 
into the producer's office and said, 'This is my star , for crying out loud.' 
So I got a dressing room." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum had been scheduled to appear at the fifth annual Lone Pine Film 
Festival next weekend. Then the date of the Oslo film was moved up and he 
reluctantly had to cancel. He videotaped an interview that will be shown 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival features only films -- and there have been 300 at least since 
1920 -- that have been shot at Lone Pine. "Gunga Din" and many a Gene Autry 
Western, as well as the Hoppys and "Bad Day at Black Rock" have been made 
there, along with innumerable commercials. This year's many offerings will 
include a 50th-anniversary showing of "Nevada," "King of the Khyber Rifles" 
(1954), Steve McQueen in "Nevada Smith" (1966) and Richard Donner's recent 
"Maverick" with Mel Gibson and James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really looking forward to it," Mitchum says of attending the festival. 
"I remember the Dow Hotel and a place up the street we called the Bucket of 
Blood. Don't know what its real name was or whether it's still there, but we 
kept it busy." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was done mostly among the vast rock formations. "But once," 
Mitchum remembers, "we shot on the alkali desert east of Lone Pine. And the 
heat! Unbearable, unforgiving. The cowboys would toss a handful of dust at the 
camera as they rode by. It took four hours to clean the damned thing, so you 
could sit in the shade of a cactus for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Things moved fast and Mitchum's big break came with William Wellman's "The 
Story of G.I. Joe" in 1945. "I did a test with Burgess Meredith (who played the 
great war correspondent Ernie Pyle) and I think Bill used it in the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting "natural" in front of the camera is not so simple as it sounds, not 
with rehearsals, retakes, equipment problems and the need to say the same lines 
in wide shots, close-ups and over the shoulder reversals. Mitchum's gift, 
recognized early on, was the ability to make each line sound as if he had just 
thought of it, even on the 20th reading. At first when, as he says, his roles 
mostly called for him to be shot, beaten, pummeled by gorillas and generally 
ill-used, the lines were no challenge. From "G.I. Joe" onward he revealed a 
range from quite good guys to very bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the naturalness was an apparent unwillingness to take the business 
seriously. "A casting office asked me if I'd ever thought of having my nose 
fixed. I said, 'It's already been fixed, by about four left hooks.' " RKO tried 
hard to change his name to Robert Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorothy and I were talking about that at lunch with Jill Esmond, Laurence 
Olivier's first wife. She said RKO wanted to change his name to Larry Oliver. 
'No one knows how to pronounce it, let alone spell it,' " Mitchum says, 
imitating a fluting English accent. Both actors stood their ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea where the camera is or what it's doing," Mitchum insists. "I 
remember one time I was working with Loretta Young and she started changing the 
lights. I mean, 'Put a half-scrim on this, put a snood on No. 2,' and all this. 
And she said: 'I don't know why I worry about this. Look at him, he's been 
working in nothing but leak-light all his life, and here he is and he doesn't 
know what we're talking about.' I said, 'I know , Loretta; I just don't care.' 
She said: 'I'm sure you don't. But I do . So put a half-scrim . . .' and so 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an attitude that endears him to directors -- none of those troubled 
conversations about motivation. "I assume the director knows his stuff," 
Mitchum says. "A lot of the time if you've got a really good cameraman you 
don't need a director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raoul Walsh would say, 'Roll 'em,' and walk away. He'd roll a cigarette on 
his blind side. (Walsh had lost an eye in an accident en route to a location in 
1928.) All the tobacco would fall out and he'd light it and whish! the paper 
would flare up, and he'd do that four or five times. And finally, after what 
we'd call a protracted silence, he'd say, 'Is it over? Cut it. How'd it go?' 
And the cameraman would say OK except the lamp fell off the table. Walsh would 
say, 'Did it look natural? You picked it up and put it back on the table?' 
'Yep.' Never watched a scene! Except the exteriors." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that Mitchum will be longest remembered for his villainous roles. As 
an ex-con bent on revenge against lawyer Gregory Peck and his family in "Cape 
Fear" (1962), Mitchum was truly frightening. "I didn't want to do the part at 
all," Mitchum says. "But the director, J. Lee Thompson, said, 'Who else?' And 
that stopped me." 
</P>
<P>
 Polly Bergen, who played Peck's wife, recalled later that Mitchum had been 
meant to manhandle her through a door, which was supposed to open but didn't. 
He pushed her so hard it drew blood on her back. They had to do the scene three 
times for technical reasons and Mitchum apologized for the rough treatment. 
Mitchum remembers that Bergen said, "Don't apologize, I dug it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was paid $250,000 for a cameo appearance -- as a good guy -- in Martin 
Scorsese's 1991 remake of "Cape Fear." Peck and Martin Balsam also did cameos 
and the original Bernard Herrmann score was used. "I looked at Bobby De Niro's 
tattoos and asked him if he had to go to makeup to have them put on every day. 
He said, 'Naw -- if you don't use soap, they don't come off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum had done his most memorable bad-guy performance in 1955's "Night of 
the Hunter," which critic Pauline Kael called "one of the most frightening 
movies ever made." As a demonic itinerant preacher with LOVE tattooed on the 
knuckles of one hand, HATE on the other, terrorizing two children and their 
mother, Mitchum, ranting and shouting, was as unlaid-back as he has ever been 
on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchum worked with David Lean in 1970's "Ryan's Daughter," another film that 
he initially did not want to do. "Lean and (screenwriter) Robert Bolt both 
called me. Bolt said, 'Well, what are you committed to do next?' I said, 
'Commit suicide.' He said, 'Well and good. But do the film first and we'll 
guarantee to see to your burial expenses later.' How can you refuse an offer 
like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has a particularly painful memory of Lean. "He was getting a life 
achievement award and they asked me if I would present it to him. I said that 
I'd be pleased and flattered to, but that they should ask him if it was 
agreeable to him. Instead, they went to David and told him I'd refused to do it 
and he wept. I didn't know, and he died only a short time later and I never got 
a chance to tell him what the truth was." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mitchum was making 1968's "Secret Ceremony," co-starring Elizabeth 
Taylor, for Joseph Losey in London, he says: "We were working in some sort of 
halfway house for nuns. You'd be shooting and a nun would go streaking along 
the balcony. One day we heard this ear-piercing, blood-curdling scream. We ran 
up to Elizabeth's dressing room and this chap from the income tax, the Inland 
Revenue Service, had come to claim full duty on the famous diamond that Richard 
had bought her. They worked out some sort of arrangement so that she'd have to 
put it into custody whenever she came into England." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Mitchum's major films are available on videocassette and are shown on 
television (except, alas, for "The Story of G.I. Joe"). At that, many in a 
later generation will identify him with Admiral Pug Henry in the two 
miniseries, "The Winds of War" and "War and Remembrance," or as the star of the 
briefly seen series "A Family for Joe," in 1990, in which he played a homeless 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he co-starred with Bo Derek in "Woman of Desire," which, 
bypassing both cinemas and television, went straight to video. He played an 
attorney, and the film was shot in Capetown and Johannesburg, South Africa. "It 
looked like a carpet commercial," Mitchum says, and the heat and the racial 
tensions made for an uncomfortable shoot, although John and Bo Derek are 
neighbors and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The public and private Robert Mitchums do not seem strenuously different. He 
has a fast and often sardonic wit. When he was asked if a photographer could 
come along to take some pictures, he replied, "Nudes?" He is certainly aware of 
his stardom and the difficulty of walking in public, but he lives as unstarry a 
life as possible. He reads widely and abundantly and wrote and sang two albums 
of songs in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 His seeming nonchalance served him well and was its own form of damage control 
at the time of his dubious arrest for possession of marijuana in 1948, an item 
hardly newsworthy by present Hollywood standards but potentially serious then. 
But posing cheerfully in prison garb pushing a mop, Mitchum seemed simply, 
well, Mitchum. 
</P>
<P>
 Like James Cagney and a few other icons who came up a hard road, Mitchum has 
seemed to regard acting as a job of work, more lucrative than many, sometimes 
astonishingly so. Yet the laid-back airs need to be regarded with some 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his long-ago protests to Loretta Young that he didn't care about the 
lighting, he knows his craft. Being natural on camera is itself an act, maybe 
the hardest of all, and not to be seen acting is ironically a high compliment 
for an actor. Whatever else is true, icons don't survive by accident.

DON'T WORRY, HE'S STILL RAILING; REMEMBER DAVID HARE, ANGRY LEFTIST WRITER OF 
PROVOCATIVE PLAYS ABOUT BRITAIN?; HE'S STILL THAT, BUT NOW HIS WORKS REVEAL A 
BELIEF IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. (MAKE THAT A GRUDGING BELIEF.)

 How pleasant to sit in an office at the National Theatre, sipping at a glass 
of white wine and talking with David Hare, one of Britain's foremost 
playwrights. Hare has an amiable, almost boyish charm; he talks with eloquence 
and wit, smiles easily and often, tells good anecdotes and lets slip delicious 
tidbits of gossip. It's hard to imagine more civilized, friendly company. 
</P>
<P>
 The David Hare one reads about so frequently must be some other guy. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a reputation, you see, as a stormy, outspoken character. Hare has the 
ability to make waves when he makes public pronouncements; it happens 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hare who took the unique step of responding angrily and publicly to a 
negative 1989 review by the then-New York Times theater critic Frank Rich that 
hastened the closure on Broadway of his play "The Secret Rapture," which 
originally opened in 1988 at the National. Wrote Rich of the Broadway 
production: "Mr. Hare, serving as his play's director at the Barrymore, is his 
own worst enemy." The memorable Variety headline about Hare's angered response 
read: "Ruffled Hare Airs Rich Bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it was Hare who went on BBC television in the early '90s and, in the 
context of a discussion about TV arts programming, noted that it was impossible 
to compare Keats with, say, Bob Dylan; Keats was beyond question a greater 
writer. The ensuing high art-low art debate -- cultural relativism, as it 
became known -- dominated Britain's arts pages for several months afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Hare is given to seething public condemnations of the Tory government, which 
has ruled Britain for 15 years; profile writers invariably refer to him as 
thin-skinned and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 So how come he's so agreeable today? Is he on his best behavior, or something? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," Hare sighs. "It's just that if I say something in public, a 
year's discussion seems to follow. The extraordinary torrent of stuff that 
follows every time I say something about the state of society means there must 
be an absence of real discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see that what I say can be annoying to people. It rubs them up the 
wrong way. But it used not to be out of order to discuss ideas in public." 
</P>
<P>
 What's beyond doubt is that Hare writes impassioned, provocative plays about 
the state of Britain from a left-wing perspective. It was true of "Plenty," the 
first of his works to hit Broadway, in 1983 (it was made into a 1985 film 
starring Meryl Streep and John Gielgud). 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally true of his play "Racing Demon," which has its American 
premiere, directed by Richard Eyre, as part of the UK/LA Festival 1994 on 
Wednesday at the James A. Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood (preview performances 
begin today). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Racing Demon" tackles what looks on the surface to be unlikely Hare 
material. It examines the plight of four Church of England vicars, ministering 
to a south London congregation assailed by poverty, unemployment and other 
social problems. The help these four men can offer their flock is limited. One 
might expect Hare to rail against an august body such as the Church of England, 
so inextricably is it tied up with Britain's Establishment; yet the play 
invites sympathy with the vicars' sometimes hapless attempts to help people in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hare did his homework assiduously and talked with Church of England clergymen, 
from higher-ranking deans and canons to lowly parish priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to see vicars in the inner city, they were doing social work, 
only on less than a social worker's pay," he recalled. "There was no mention of 
God whatsoever. God had been eliminated from the process, except as the person 
who empowered them to do this work. I think the play spoke for a huge cross 
section of society in Britain, namely people in the caring professions trying 
to bandage society's wounds in a period of great social change." 
</P>
<P>
 Now here is a more familiar David Hare, warming up to an anti-government 
diatribe: "The play speaks to people whose work is vocational, not 
entrepreneurial. The old, the sick, the dying, the poor -- they all have to be 
looked after by some people. And in the 1980s in Britain, these people felt 
overlooked and ill-rewarded. The Thatcher government refused to take their 
problems seriously, refused to talk to anyone in the caring professions. They 
became a very bewildered group, and I suppose the play speaks to that 
bewilderment. They identified with that slightly helpless feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 They identified in huge numbers. "Racing Demon," which first opened at the 
National five years ago, has been one of the theater's most popular productions 
in recent times, and has been revived into the repertory five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience for it seems inexhaustible," Hare agrees. "Many people have been 
to see it more than once, and it's also played to people who aren't the typical 
National Theatre audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there aren't any plays for the Christian audience these days. 
Christians have been alienated by theater in the last 20 or 30 years. 
Traditionally, of course, the theater was a religious place -- Greek theater 
was about man's relationship with the gods. But now Christians are turned off 
by what they regard as the secular, humanist, modern theater. So suddenly 
people are in to see 'Racing Demon' who have never been to the National 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Among these have been American visitors to London, who Hare says have enjoyed 
and appreciated "Racing Demon." Yet, he adds, "there's been no impetus for it 
to go to Broadway because people there fear it's so English and the audiences 
will be puzzled. Of course, the same argument applied to 'Plenty.' It took four 
years to get to Broadway, and the moment it got there people didn't know what 
the problem had been. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Plenty,' as with 'Racing Demon,' I've always argued the more English 
they are the better. There's no point in trying to meet American audiences 
halfway, so we're not changing any lines. After all, David Mamet and Sam 
Shepard play in London and people here don't quite know where Arkansas is, but 
it doesn't spoil their enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been irritating to find so many Americans who like and understand the 
play and so many American theater owners frightened of it. It's brave of Los 
Angeles to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clergymen who saw "Racing Demon" have been broadly approving, and religious 
publications in Britain have praised the play. In part this may be because Hare 
has reclaimed the figure of the English vicar from low farce -- clerics are 
often portrayed as fumbling, absent-minded figures with a tenuous grasp on the 
real world on the British stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vicars were a subject of satire," Hare says. "I saw no point in saying how 
ridiculous they are. For one thing I didn't feel it. I wanted to retrieve them 
theatrically." 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing Demon" also dramatizes the sharp differences in attitudes toward 
ministry that currently exist within the Church of England. Its lead character, 
Lionel Espy, is a middle-aged man of decent, liberal views, clearly exhausted 
by the sheer weight of social problems he encounters in his parish; he has 
ceased to preach God's word with any fervor. A younger vicar, Tony Ferris, is 
from the church's evangelical wing and believes in inspiring parishioners with 
visions of hellfire and everlasting redemption. A third, Donald Bacon, is a man 
of no theology who finds simple happiness in humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the play's about religion, it brought back to the theater a certain 
area that's been neglected for a long time," Hare adds. "Whatever materialism 
does or scientific advance appears to do, people are drawn to questions of life 
or death. While I was doing my research a dean said to me: 'People will always 
gather where the transcendental is discussed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing Demon" is the first in a trilogy of Hare plays that examine the state 
of Britain. The second, "Murmuring Judges," critically examines the British 
justice system, while the third, "The Absence of War," looks at dilemmas facing 
the modern opposition Labor Party. The three plays ran as a trilogy at the 
National last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 W riting the three plays in succession, says Hare, made him examine his own 
attitudes. He had, after all, emerged in the 1970s with left-wing credentials 
as a playwright determined to tear down the British Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three plays made me believe in institutions," he mused. "I want them to 
be good. I want the streets to be clean, the law just, the government wise. I'm 
not an anarchist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think institutions are silly anymore. I think people who work in them 
deserve a little respect from above. Yet we've lived through this extraordinary 
period in which our leaders have deliberately alienated themselves from people 
who work in institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Hare agrees he has thus traveled far in political terms, but adds a 
qualification: "In the 1960s, institutions existed to run an empire, a class 
system, to embody the fantasy that Britain was still a world power with 
universal gravitas. And Britain's role in the world didn't correspond to the 
seriousness with which the Establishment took itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I feel we're in the post-Thatcher ruins and we must get out of this 
together. I don't believe all power is bad, or all politicians automatically 
suspect. I now think democratic institutions could work." 
</P>
<P>
 His views were forged in unlikely circumstances. He was a pious prep-school 
boy from a suburban background; his father was a shipping-company purser. 
Interestingly, in view of his authorship of "Racing Demon," Hare believed as a 
young man that every word in the Bible was true. At Lancing, an eminent 
Anglo-Catholic boarding school, he almost became a sacristan and did become 
head boy; his intellect propelled him into Cambridge, where he studied English 
literature and rebelled against his own privileged education. 
</P>
<P>
 He immediately became a playwright, forming a group called the Portable 
Theatre, which toured schools in a bus. He and his colleague, Howard Brenton, 
wrote "nasty, brutal little plays," as Hare has since described them, to shake 
audiences out of their complacency. But by 1970 his first professional play, 
"Slag," marked him as hugely promising, and his reputation has grown since. 
Apart from "Plenty," Hare gained attention and a 1985 Evening Standard Drama 
Award for directing "Pravda," about a tyrannical press baron clearly based on 
Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, for the National Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 His hits have given Hare a certain celebrity cachet in Britain, as have his 
various relationships. He has three children from his marriage to TV producer 
Margaret Matheson, which was dissolved. Hare wrote four plays specifically for 
actress Kate Nelligan, which gave him an enduring reputation as someone who 
writes strong female roles. He lived for a spell with actress Blair Brown; she 
starred on Broadway in his "Secret Rapture," and Hare's associates believe that 
the fury of his response to Frank Rich was partly a defense of her. 
</P>
<P>
 N ow 47, he is married to inter national designer Nicole Far hi. Fittingly, 
Hare dresses with low-key elegance; he is handsome, with a shock of wavy brown 
hair and a face that, though now lined, betrays his days as an earnest 
schoolboy. Hare remains linked to a group of liberal intellectuals (Harold 
Pinter and Salman Rushdie are others) who despise the Tory government and are 
in turn targeted for scorn by the mostly conservative press. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also written screenplays (including Louis Malle's 1992 "Damage") and 
directed his own scripts ("Paris by Night," "Strapless," "Wetherby"). But his 
films, though he fiercely defends them, have suffered mixed notices -- and he 
now admits that the stage is his most effective milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater is the most profound form of fictional writing," he observed. "I'm 
impatient with novels. The complex things that happen when people pretend to be 
other people in front of other people -- that is, the theater -- don't happen 
for me when I read a novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater has been the cutting edge here for a while now. It's made more 
profound by the way you're made conscious of how other people are reacting to 
it as well as yourself. I'm in love with theater. When it works, it's so 
exhilarating."*

THE CIRQUE'S GLOBAL STRATEGY; CIRQUE DU SOLEIL IS BRINGING ITS LARGEST RUSSIAN 
CONTINGENT EVER FOR ITS PRODUCTION OF 'ALEGRIA.' IT WAS A STRUGGLE. THOSE 
RUSSIAN STARS HAD TO DEAL WITH QUEBEC ARTISTIC COMMUNISM -- AND JOY.

<P>
 Looking like a star is one thing. Acting like one is something else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 And so when Cirque du Soleil's very own Flying Fabio, more prosaically known 
as Vladimir Kekhayal, and his chair-balancing compatriot Vassily Demenchoukov 
arrived from Russia with all the attitude they could pack in their bags, their 
star quality was considered, well, a bit de trop . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like 'If I'm here, I'm the star, so you have to treat me as a star,' " 
says Gilles Ste-Croix, Cirque's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Au contraire, mon fre re.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would say, 'Listen. Cirque du Soleil is not like this. Everyone is the 
star. But if I need you to bring a carpet for another performer, if you need 
them to bring you something for your number, we all share.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'But that's communism.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yeah, that's Quebec communism. But that's how it works.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So went the occasionally rocky debut of Cirque du Soleil's first Russian 
imports for its early '90s show "Nouvelle Experience." To get them to Cirque's 
base in Montreal, Ste-Croix had grappled with Russian bureaucracy and an 
American producer for six months in the thick of perestroika in 1989. But at 
least Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms had propped open the gates for Russian 
artists to perform abroad. And with the fall of the Soviet Union at the end of 
1991, even more of Russia's best talent has made an exodus. This year, Cirque 
du Soleil has plucked its largest Russian contingent ever -- 16 -- for its 
latest shimmering production of circus theater, "Alegria," which opens Thursday 
at the Santa Monica Pier and on Jan. 24 at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians' arrival heralds growth for the 10-year-old Canadian company, 
which has become increasingly multinational as Cirque du Soleil evolves far 
from its street-performing roots. It's also fitting that so many Russians 
should be part of Cirque's eighth production, which celebrates the era's global 
changes in power. Unlike traditional circuses, which string together unrelated 
acts, Cirque du Soleil cloaks its acrobatics and clowning in lavish costumes, 
lighting and dance, all designed around a theme. And for "Alegria" -- joy in 
Spanish -- the phrase that shapes the evening is: "The fools have lost their 
king." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody now has a global concern, but they're also living in a world of 
uncertainty and complaining a lot about this," Ste-Croix says. " Alegria is 
like a scream of joy, a scream of life against the moroseness. We would say, 
'The king is dead. Alegria !' Because there is life after death in the sense 
that something new is coming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this $3-million production, something old is evoked in Cirque-speak, a 
visual language that may not be immediately decipherable. The old regime, for 
example, is represented by feathers and performers in bird costumes, inspired 
by the "gilded year" at the turn of the century ruled by railroad and petroleum 
barons. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new world, simply look down. "Alegria" has more performers under 18 
than any other Cirque production. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a child of 12 who does incredible feats and comes straight at 
you on the stage and looks at you in the eyes with a smile and goes, 'Hey!' " 
Ste-Croix says, "you are really taken by that power because they are there to 
be the future, whereas the old birds represent the period that we are living 
through that is dying." 
</P>
<P>
 If Cirque's 12-year-old Mongolian contortionists are prized for their youth -- 
and preternatural flexibility, to a degree peculiar to Mongolians, Ste-Croix 
says -- the Russians are sought after for their aerial abilities. That's 
because many former Russian gymnasts and acrobats with Olympic aspirations 
turned to the circus later in their career, says Pavel Brun, Cirque's artistic 
coordinator and choreographer of Andrei Lev's Flying Trapeze Team in "Alegria." 
</P>
<P>
 Cirque du Soleil's first attempt to build a Russian act after the fall of the 
Soviet Union went much more smoothly than earlier enlistment efforts. In 1992, 
the mayors of Moscow and Montreal signed an agreement joining the innovative 
Cirque with the more traditional Moscow Circus in staging a flying trapeze act. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal called for the Russians to recruit a group of 25 trapeze artists, 
from which Cirque selected 12. Then Brun and another coach worked with the 
troupe at the Moscow Circus' elaborate $50-million facility. The act was 
designed for Cirque's show "Mystere," now in its first of five years at the 
company's permanent theater in Las Vegas. (A third production, "Saltimbanco," 
will tour Europe next year.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Moscow-Montreal agreement had been lauded as the beginning of cultural 
exchanges between the two cities, but the circus flow has largely been headed 
in one direction -- to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they got anything out of it," Ste-Croix says of the Moscow 
Circus. "We could have had a collaboration that could have gone for years, but 
I think the system turned into a very rotten thing that is worse than what 
communism was." 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic standards have sagged, Brun says, and corruption has left its mark on 
the Russian circus. A few days before the Cirque trapeze troupe left Moscow in 
1993, the commercial director of the Moscow Circus was shot dead in the door of 
his apartment with a hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he knew (why)," Brun says. "Maybe not. Maybe it was financial. Is it 
normal that at the end of the 20th Century, you're opening the door of your 
apartment and somebody shoots you three times in the stomach? That's an example 
of (organized crime) involvement. Is it connected with the circus? Is it 
connected with the Las Vegas project with Cirque du Soleil? I don't know. But 
it makes me really sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Soviet rule, the govern ment prized the circus, but its attentions were 
like a cobra's embrace. Hailing the circus as the art of the people, the 
government institutionalized the big tops, sending it into a spiral of ruin and 
eventually prompting its artists to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular appeal was price. Two years ago, a ticket went for 15 rubles -- 9 
cents. The big tops had come down in the '60s and '70s, and up came 69 
permanent circus buildings in every city of more than 200,000 people. Shows 
were held 11 months a year, a droning continuity that clashed with the 
tradition of itinerant companies whose briefer appearances drummed up 
expectations and audiences. Audiences shrank, and a financial crisis for the 
circus mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since you have buildings, it was like 'All right, this is the circus,' " Brun 
says. "It's like a gas station. It's like a supermarket. It exists. No 
celebration anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, too, the Communist Party ordered the arts to bow to politics. 
In addition to acrobatics, audiences would be treated to party posters and 
portraits; beneath a bust of Lenin, poets would declaim their love of the red 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Soviets, travel to countries with more liberal circus traditions -- 
often impossible anyway -- required Communist Party membership. Even then, 
artists needed approval from the KGB, the Ministry of Culture and the 
Soyuzgoscirk, the bureaucracy that governed the country's 7,000 circus artists 
and told them where they had to perform. And when artists were allowed to 
perform abroad, their pay went to Soyuzgoscirk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very administrative, like everything at those times, and I would say 
that Soyuzgoscirk was a real product of totalitarianism," Brun says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the perestroika years of the late '80s held bureaucratic roadblocks. In 
the '80s, Brun, who had studied at the Moscow Circus School, was performing 
mime with Moscow's top free-lance jazz-rock musician, Aleksei Kozlov, whose 
performing group, Arsenal, melded jazz, movement and puppetry. The group, 
described in Hedrick Smith's "The Russians," was famous in Russia, wildly 
popular with youth but detested by Communist officials in part because it was 
beloved by Americans in Moscow -- the U.S. Embassy invited the group to perform 
at its July Fourth and Thanksgiving celebrations. 
</P>

 When Arsenal was invited to participate in the Live Aid concert at London's 
Wembley Stadium in 1985, the Ministry of Culture responded that travel would be 
complicated because the group was in Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those years, you say the word Mongolia and it seems almost impossible to 
reach you," Brun says. "They say, 'OK,' but forget about it. But we were in 
Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brun, 36, says there was a payoff for performers coming of age in 
difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this pressure, all this frustration, all this stupidity made us very, 
very resistant. To be a modern dancer, to be a jazz musician, to be an 
avant-garde circus performer was prohibited. It made my generation a lot 
stronger because we did it anyway. And I would say a lot of artistic 
achievements of the '70s and '80s were a lot higher than now in Russia, where 
everything is legal and you can do whatever you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brun quit Arsenal in 1988 and began working with the Moscow Circus' 
experimental workshop. He met Cirque founder Guy Laliberte in 1990 in Paris at 
the Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain. Laliberte later went to Moscow to see 
the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was it. I was hooked by my heart," Brun says. "Because I realized 
that Cirque du Soleil was the exact place where I can express myself as much as 
I can, where I can have -- what's the American word? -- fun, where my 
experience will be appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 Clown Slava Polunin was widely appreciated in Russia via the most official of 
channels -- national television -- even though his Yellow Clown persona was an 
alternative meld of influences ranging from Antonin Artaud to Samuel Beckett to 
Robert Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Polunin, who performs for Cirque with his 8-year-old son Ivan, is credited 
with creating the first Russian clown theater in the '70s, a time when politics 
had turned circus clowns into chilly technocrats. Polunin's Academy of Fools 
revived the art of clowning by incorporating philosophy, social criticism and 
surrealistic painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Polunin's tragicomic character Asisay (a bit of baby talk with no real 
translation) would speak in a kind of "double language," as Brun, who 
interprets for him, put it. "You can speak of one thing, but you can keep in 
your mind totally different things." The authorities didn't catch on to his 
double meanings, "because his childish image was like an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of the '80s, Asisay was a fixture of Russian television and 
Polunin became a star. "His fame in Russia was equal to the fame of rock 
stars," Brun says. 
</P>
<P>
 For cube gymnast Mikhail Matorin, 29, joining Cirque du Soleil was a simple 
matter of picking up the phone. The former Moscow Circus performer had seen 
Cirque acts at the Paris circus competition in 1990, and he had applied two 
years ago to join the company. Ste-Croix called him in Moscow a couple of weeks 
before the Montreal debut of "Alegria" in April. By then, Matorin was in the 
enviable position of being courted by circuses in France and Canada, and he 
needed only to pick up and go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to choose between Cirque La Luna, which is the moon, and Cirque du 
Soleil, which is the sun, and I chose the sun," he says. "They just amazed me 
by the movement, by the music. It was beautiful, and when I changed my act and 
created new things, I was always thinking about the Cirque du Soleil." 
</P>
<P>
 Matorin performs with a five-foot-square cube, manipulating it while on foot 
and dangling from an aerial wire. Matorin's signature act, a highlight of 
"Alegria," was created by his father, an artistic director of the Moscow 
Circus. The idea of juxtaposing the human body with a cube was inspired by 
drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and such Salvador Dali paintings as "Gala Looking 
at the Hypercubicus Christ." It took a year and a half to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 F or Matorin, joining Cirque has meant realizing a dream: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more interesting to perform here. Even if we forget about the financial 
side, the convenience, it's more interesting to perform in front of happy 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 For Brun, joining Cirque has meant understanding that a dream will never be 
realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a wonderful Canadian big top," he says, "and you will see lots 
of Russian performers and a wonderful international troupe, but for me it's 
kind of painful that it's unrealistic to expect that this big top of Cirque du 
Soleil could be created in the Red Square in Moscow. I want to do that, but I 
know it will not happen in the near future. Because the needs of the people 
over there are unfortunately a lot different. They are thinking about what they 
are going to eat, how they are going to dress, are they going to be killed 
tomorrow because of some street gangs or will they stay alive. I'm not afraid 
of that, but it makes me very, very sad because we were expecting something 
different."* Vital Stats

DANCE; BEYOND THE BAD BOY YEARS; LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW: IF YOU 
THINK MARK MORRIS IS DANCE'S BAD BOY, YOU'RE TOO OLD. BUT, READ ON, YOU MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO DETECT SOME RESIDUAL ATTITUDE. 
</P>

edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once hailed as the innovative "bad boy" of modern dance, Seattle choreographer 
Mark Morris vaulted to the international big leagues in 1988 when he and his 
company took over residency from Maurice Bejart and the Ballet of the 20th 
Century at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. He was 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter controversy dogged him during his three-year tenure there, however. 
Pro-Bejart factions, used to the old dance spectacles, attacked Morris' 
pure-movement approach to dance. Their anger -- and Morris' reckless public 
statements -- boiled over into a major press war. One paper finally printed, 
"Mark Morris, Go Home!" in a headline. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morris and his beleaguered troupe stuck it out. Eventually they garnered 
general enthusiasm with "The Hard Nut," Morris' deconstruction of the 
"Nutcracker" ballet, made in his final year there. But the years took their 
toll on him and the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris never lacked supporters, though. Ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov 
invited him to co-found his modest White Oak Dance Project in 1990, and that 
relationship continues. A year later, the MacArthur Foundation gave Morris a 
"genius" grant. Last year, the first book-length biography of him, written by 
New York dance critic Joan Acocella, appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his return, he has been committed to keeping his Mark Morris Dance Group 
working. The New York-based troupe dances about 90 performances a year, most of 
which take place outside New York City. The 16-member company (including 
Morris) operates on a $2-million annual budget, quite a comedown from the 
Monnaie's multimillions. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking time off from rehearsals for a work he is creating for San Francisco 
Ballet, Morris looked back on the years since Brussels with wry, sly and 
typically open directness. He and his troupe will make their only Southern 
California date this season on Wednesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: How do you feel about being known as the "bad-boy" choreographer of 
modern dance? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: First of all, I'm only called a 'boy' by people that are older than I 
am. You have to be 38 or older to call me that, I guess. I tried to see that 
appellation as a certain fondness. That's how I chose to see it. I think it 
means one is precocious or something or (that) one doesn't lie too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you doing in San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm here starting a piece for the San Francisco Ballet -- there's no title 
yet -- to Lou Harrison's Piano Trio. Lou is brilliant and of a generation in 
which a lot of West Coast composers were seriously learning and hearing Eastern 
music, Asian music, which has turned into a sad state of so-called world music, 
a postmodern pastiche of Eastern and Western forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou predates that. He's dealing with a direct knowledge of Eastern music. It's 
very smart and beautifully produced music in general. I like to work with him. 
He's a friend of mine too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you do much free-lance choreography? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't do very many commissions for other companies. In this case, this is 
the second piece for San Francisco Ballet. I'm doing two commissions this year. 
(The other is for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.) The rest is for my company. 
</P>
<P>
 My preference is to work with my company. I like to work in ballet. So those 
are the commissions I do for things my company doesn't do. 
</P>
<P>
 But also there are a lot of people who want (my) dances. I just don't want to 
give it to them. I don't want to put my company on unemployment. I could have a 
fabulous career as a free-lance choreographer -- and not have a company. That 
is the farthest thing I want. I work in opera when I can. That can become 
tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your relationship now with Mikhail Baryshnikov and the White Oak 
Dance Project? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It keeps on dancing. White Oak still is happening. Frankly, for the last 
few months, we've been on the opposite schedules. I haven't seen them much. I 
haven't seen Mr. Baryshnikov much. But that happens. They're doing some of my 
works. They're traveling all over the place. Hurray for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have you been up to recently? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What I've always been doing: I make up dances that I think are what should 
happen, how I particularly decide to respond to music and employ people as 
dancers. That's my choice, and if that's surprising or unconventional or blah 
blah blah , that's not my problem. I don't like to see the same thing all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about Joan Acocella's biography? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's excellent. I didn't write it. I definitely did not write it. 
It's her opinions and theories and stuff. I think it's perfectly admirable, and 
it's also not a trash dance book like many are that show who slept with whom 
and who took cocaine. That's not too interesting, really. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Acocella says the company doesn't dance much of your pre-1985 works 
anymore. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if that's true. It probably is true if she observed it. Some 
of it is because I do work with live music a lot and I can only bring back 
pieces that I can have that happen. That's the reason. Partly. Some of the 
dances I'm not interested in seeing anymore. There are dances since 1985 we 
don't do because I don't like them too much or their time is gone. I am 
basically interested in doing new dances rather than reviving chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you create? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I just go in there. I make up a lot of stuff, edit and change things as I 
go along. But once I'm finished, I'm finished. "Gloria" is one of the few 
(works) I simplified after I made up. That was a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would you comment on the repertory you and the company will be dancing in 
Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't like to talk about it. I can tell you the music and something. 
"Lucky Charms," done in June, is to a piece of music by Jacques Ibert 
(Divertissement) that I've known for 20 years or more. I heard it again 
recently and had to make up a dance right that second. It was written for a 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rondo" I just made it up in Boston in July. I've just done it few times. I'm 
still revising it as I go along. It's a solo, so I can do that. It's to 
Mozart's Rondo in A minor, a piece I couldn't get rid of. I had to make a 
dance. It's a private dance to watch. It's a quiet, private dance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there an untold story? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Maybe. I don't know. Ask Joan. Lots of people find some sort of 
associations in my dances, or something is evoked that isn't necessarily a 
narrative. Whether that's what I meant or not, it doesn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you mind when people do that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I mind when people decide it's like that or there's the story and (that) 
it's obvious to everyone -- because it isn't to me.  
</P>
<P>
 "Handel Choruses" is old. It's four solos to very big choruses from various 
sources. What I wanted basically was the biggest possible musical forces with 
the smallest possible dance forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Office" is very new. I made that up in Columbus, Ohio, premiered it in 
the spring for Zivili (a folk dance troupe), for six dancers. It's basically 
set in a sort of a waiting room. That's about it. It's in five movements and 
the cast diminishes until there's just one person left. It's a going-away 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it about death? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Acocella says that you're tired of "Gloria." That true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if that's true. I've been watching it for many years. It's a 
good enough dance so it can keep going. I don't want it to be a signature 
(work) or whatever. People like to watch it and people like to do it, and I do 
too. I like the music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has your work changed? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Again, ask Joan about that. I notice these things long after other people 
do. I make up the next dance. Of course, it changes all the time. To me, since 
I make up new dances all the time, it's a gradual thing. If you see my work 
every two or five years, you probably see bigger changes than I do. I don't 
know any better. I just go from dance to dance. I try to surprise myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been working actually more with American music than I normally have, 
and less Baroque music than I have for a while. It depends on the situation, 
scale. I still use a lot of vocal music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How stable has the company been since your return from Brussels? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Several people have gone to dance elsewhere or to stop dancing or to get 
married and have children or whatever. That's natural. I'm all for that. I have 
a couple of new dancers in the company. It's been going fine. We're very busy, 
which is great for us and not so great for other people, I suppose. Basically I 
get to do what I do best, to make up dances and have them performed. 
</P>
<P>
 We travel a lot. I'm only in New York a few days every few weeks, basically. 
We work all the time. We have to raise funds, the way we did before (Brussels). 
I'm prohibited from doing giant, giant projects very frequently like I could in 
Brussels. That's OK. I did that while I could. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about Brussels these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't miss Brussels. (The Monnaie Theatre) -- well, that's spectacular 
and that doesn't exist anywhere in the States and that's too bad. But it 
doesn't come free. It was quite difficult, quite stressful. Politically, 
Brussels itself is a difficult place. I had fabulous resources, and my company 
really pulled together in a beautiful way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you want now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I want studios and a theater and an orchestra at my disposal at all times. 
That doesn't happen much in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You prefer dancing to live music, but the company will be using taped music 
at the Irvine theater, won't it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Right. I can't have live music every single second. We occasionally do 
repertory tours with taped music. It's my preference to stay someplace long 
enough to rehearse and perform with living musicians. But that's only my 
preference. I don't get to do it all the time. It's not a bad show just because 
it's a taped show. I hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the small size of the theater (750 seats) bother you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I love that size. This thing is, American theaters are large, very big. You 
can see fabulous things from far away, beautiful patterns. You can get a sense 
of what's going on. But I like smaller because I just do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you read your critics? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I read everything, every single word that's written about me and my 
company. I prefer writing that is written well. I like the language, and so if 
you can use the language, that pleases me. What happens too often is that 
people review other people's reviews instead of what they've seen. That's 
unfortunate. I prefer raves. But life would be dull if that's all that 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you see as the state of dance today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's not a fair question. I don't know about it. I work with companies a 
lot. I see shows a lot. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of interest in 
good work, as far as I'm concerned. Right now, it's kind of lumpish. That's 
theater dance in general. It's complicated. It has to do with interest and 
funding and people getting the opportunities to do work or the best (people) to 
go into the field of dancing. It's not particularly urgent right now. 
Consequently, there are fewer people and, consequently, fewer good works. I 
don't know what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anyone's work you admire? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Merce Cunningham, and he's been around forever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have any plans to come to Los Angeles soon? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know, because I don't do (the bookings). We go anywhere where we're 
hired to, frankly. It doesn't seem -- a lot of things don't stick in Los 
Angeles, which is too bad. It's sort of a different place from others. Opera 
doesn't particularly stick there. Ballet doesn't really stick there. Darling 
Bella (Lewitzky) has been there for so long and valiantly standing up for 
dancers' rights and concerns, and that's brilliant. I love her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Anything you want to bring up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My dancers are the greatest ever and, of course, none of my pieces would 
exist, etc. That's usually what doesn't get said. I say it and nobody writes it 
down and then the dancers say I never talk about them. 
</P>

MOVIES; A BELA AND HIS CHIHUAHUAS; THE MISSION FACING MARTIN LANDAU IN 'ED 
WOOD' WAS TO PLAY BELA LUGOSI WHEN HE WORKED IN SCHLOCKY '50S HORROR FLICKS AT 
THE END OF HIS CAREER. IMPERSONATE HIM? LANDAU BECAME LUGOSI.

 Forget the buzz and speculation heralding Martin Landau's amazing portrayal of 
Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's eccentric biopic, "Ed Wood." Here's the inside 
skinny -- Landau will win the best support ing actor Oscar. No, the guys at 
accounting-firm-to-the-stars Price-Waterhouse haven't opened their eternally 
buttoned lips and, no, this isn't some prophecy from Criswell Predicts, the 
cheesehead soothsayer and Wood's buddy and sometime actor. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this comes from a fairly unimpeachable, if unbelievably coincidental, 
source. After a recent lunch of Chinese garlic shrimp, Landau opens his fortune 
cookie to behold the following promise: "You will receive some high prize or 
award." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hilarious -- I've never gotten one like this before," Landau laughs 
-- then carefully tucks the fortune into his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning an Oscar for a role in a movie about a guy who would have committed 
blasphemy just thinking he might win an Oscar would be sweet irony indeed. "Ed 
Wood" relates the saga of one Edward D. Wood Jr., a fellow who was making 
cheesy, awful movies long before whoever it is who makes all the Ernest movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the average filmmaker's pocket change, Wood created throughout 
the 1950s such jaw-dropping duds as "Plan 9 From Outer Space," "Night of the 
Ghouls," "Glen or Glenda" and "Bride of the Monster," each boasting turgid 
dramaturgy, howlingly bad dialogue, acting stiffer than a corpse and dime-store 
visuals -- in one notorious case, Wood used wobble-prone cardboard tombstones 
and paper plates spray-painted silver for UFOs in "Plan 9." Wood also had a 
fondness for wearing women's clothing that didn't prevent him from getting 
money from Southern Baptists to make "Plan 9." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Wood enjoyed the relative level of, well, "success" that he did was 
his relationship with Lugosi. Lugosi, who immortalized himself in the world of 
cinema with his portrayal of Dracula in the 1930s, was by the '50s a virtually 
forgotten and unemployable morphine addict whom many thought was already dead. 
Wood exploited what small cachet Lugosi's name had left and Lugosi was 
revivified by the chance to work again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain the man suffered at that time in his life was amazing," Landau 
offers. "He started taking the morphine because he did have leg injuries from 
World War I. Whether that was an excuse, I don't know, but that was the 
original reason for the morphine use. He was also an alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that Bela Lugosi Jr. has decried the film's portrayal of his 
father, Landau says: "I don't ridicule him. If anything, it's almost a love 
letter to him. I never talked to his son, and from what I hear, he did not 
approve of some of the language. But that's not the point. I don't think I 
demean him at all. I salute him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, where most actors are happy to master a thick accent and turn their 
character into a caricature, Landau, 63, plays Lugosi as a colorful, feisty old 
man crippled by a profound sadness. Denise Di Novi, who produced the film with 
Burton, said she realized how good Landau's performance was going to be "in the 
first screen test, the makeup test. He gave a look to the camera, said a line 
of dialogue, and I was ecstatic. It gave me shivers. From that first makeup 
test, he was Bela. He found a niche that made him sympathetic, complex, funny, 
tragic -- he brought it so many colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Di Novi also marveled at Landau's dedication, when he agreed to do one of his 
most difficult scenes with no notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scene where Bela tries to kick drugs cold turkey. He had to scream 
and moan and cry; it was very rough. It was a scene scheduled for another time, 
but we were at that location and we finished early one day. It would have 
helped the schedule to do that scene that day. I thought, I can't ask him to do 
this, but as producer I had to give it a shot. I said, 'Martin, I feel so bad,' 
but he just said, 'Oh, sure.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a half-hour to prepare for this scene, which was the most extreme 
situation he had in the film and he did it brilliantly," Di Novi says. "I was 
awe-struck by that. He was so ready -- I've had actors who would never have 
done that, and would have been offended if you even asked, and he didn't even 
quibble." 
</P>
<P>
 And why should he? Landau is no stranger to shooting on the run. Though he's 
best known for his role as Rollin Hand, master of disguises, on "Mission: 
Impossible" and his two Oscar-nominated turns -- Abe Karatz, the hustler of 
"Tucker: The Man and His Dream," and Judah Rosenthal, the doctor who has his 
mistress murdered and gets away with it in "Crimes and Misdemeanors" -- many of 
Landau's paychecks have come from cheap, direct-to-video movies and overseas 
TV. Which, coincidentally, was one of the reasons why Burton wanted him to play 
Lugosi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird," Landau says. "Tim called me out of the blue. He said, 'You've 
worked with everybody, you've done very good movies with major directors, 
you've done tacky, rotten movies with awful directors. You have a presence and 
there are a lot of things that coincide (with Bela).' That's how he came to me. 
I was shocked. He said, 'You popped into my head and I couldn't get you out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Landau, in fact, had appeared in the monumentally mediocre "Cleopatra" -- sort 
of what Ed Wood would have made had he had money to play with -- and that 
never-ending shoot scotched his chance to appear in Federico Fellini's "8 1/2," 
though his co-star, Richard Burton, offered to take ill for a week so he could 
show up in the processional at the end of that film. And Landau has played a 
very Woodian character himself -- a desperate, down-on-his-luck film producer 
who conjures up a million excuses for taking meetings in a seedy diner in 
"Mistress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known that guy," Landau says. "They use piss and glue and saliva to put 
a movie together. That guy was pitiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always in lower-budget films, the second take" -- Landau rolls his eyes -- 
"they're very concerned with how much film they're using. I've worked on films 
where they've actually used ends (unused portions at the end of a canister of 
film). You're in the middle of a huge emotional scene, they say, 'Hold it! 
We've got to reload the camera.' I'd say, 'You just reloaded the camera!' 
They'd say, 'Yeah, but we didn't have much film in the camera. Just pick it up 
from where you left off.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you try to bring to characters in those types of movies, the worse 
off you are," Landau says with a laugh, noting the sort of low-rent motivation 
that goes into those characters: "A guy wakes up -- 'I think today I will do 
something terrible! I'm an awful person!' " 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of role became a thing of the past after Landau's two Oscar 
nominations. But he admits he still has trouble finding good parts. "The 
interesting thing is, I haven't got a clear stand," he says. "If you look at 
Joe Pesci or Danny Aiello, you know pretty much what you're getting there (in 
terms of a performance). I'm never quite the same in anything and, as a result, 
that's been a problem. Even when I was on 'Mission: Impossible,' I played that 
guy playing different characters, and I loved that. I'm not a type-caster's 
dream. I've lost roles where a director absolutely refuses to see me: He says, 
no, he's not funny. I say to myself, 'I don't want to be in your movie, 
schmuck.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So who hires me?" Landau asks, then answers his own question. "It takes a 
director with a certain kind of vision and appreciation for what I do -- they 
know they're going to get something from me that's gonna have a lot of colors." 
</P>
<P>
 To portray Lugosi, Landau learned that, despite the veteran vampire's 
propensity for histrionics in Wood's movies, less was still more. Though hours 
of makeup were applied daily to turn him into a chillingly convincing Lugosi, 
Landau is able during his interview to do the same thing credibly with a few 
contortions of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "My face is very alive, and he had a certain limitation to his face," he says. 
"I had to learn his face. When I put the makeup on, I would learn to 
subordinate certain muscles in my face. I open my eyes wide. He rarely does. 
(Landau squints a la Lugosi.) You see a lot of teeth when I smile; you see no 
teeth when he does. (Landau twists his mouth into Lugosi's devilish smile.) He 
held his head at certain angles, he had a certain walk which is different from 
the way I walk." (He hunches down, minimizing his tall frame, becoming small 
and frail like Lugosi.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than just playing Lugosi's overacting for easy laughs, both Landau and 
Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's script offer a context for it. What 
plays as nutty scenery-munching in Wood's own movies makes a bizarre sort of 
emotional sense in Burton's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very aware of that," Landau says. "The 'Glen or Glenda' moment where 
(the name of Lugosi's nemesis, Boris) Karloff is brought up and he goes howling 
right into his next scene. Coming to work and the kind of dignity he has, then 
losing it at the mention of Karloff. The thought of Karloff was sickening to 
him, because Karloff did eclipse him." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the character of Bela Lugosi in "Ed Wood" is much like Abe in 
"Tucker": Both deal poignantly with outsiders being accepted into another 
family and subsequently thriving. "It resurrects his life," Landau says. "With 
Abe, it was a complete resurrection, in the sense that he was someone who never 
had a family and suddenly got the family he never would have had. They are two 
unlikely partners. A man who literally hadn't touched certain feelings in a 
long time, and that rebirth -- they're clearly different characters, but that 
dramatic element was similar, and the arc was similar." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Landau's own roller coaster is back at a peak, and he's 
looking for another project. He says he's turned down a handful of high-profile 
projects because the writing wasn't there, and dismisses the projected 
"Mission: Impossible" movie with a wave of his hand and the comment, "Commit 
suicide on film? Not interested." 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is a biopic about James Dean, who was a friend of Landau when 
he was just starting out as an actor. There are two competing scripts in the 
market, one approved by Dean's family, which Landau calls "benign and bland," 
the other of which intrigues him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very good part of Jack Warner in it," he says. "Love the role. I'm 
also a character in it. They've caught me pretty good as a young fella. It's 
actually not bad. I have no problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which means Landau would be appearing in a film in which another actor is 
portraying him. "Well, it's a lot of years later," Landau says. "Jimmy's sort 
of frozen in time. He was 24. I go to Budapest and there's a T-shirt shop and 
there's a life-size cutout of James Dean. His T-shirts are everywhere. It's 
very strange to go through an entire life running into Jimmy eternally young." 
</P>
<P>
 So, getting back to that fortune cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Landau was considered the front-runner for the trophy for both previous 
nominations, only to go home empty-handed. Has this cookie signaled a change 
in, well, fortunes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'm just one step at a time," he says. "The best reviews I ever got were 
for 'Mistress,' and no one saw that. It's nice that at this stage in my career 
I'm getting calls from good directors and good scripts. That's the most 
important thing. That's gold. That's why you raise your hand to be an actor in 
the first place."

 -- Lyrics by Trent Reznor 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forget, for a moment, all the talk about Trent Reznor's eerie, mud-caked 
performance at Woodstock '94 . . . or the self- loathing that made this year's 
"The Downward Spiral" perhaps the darkest album ever to crack the national Top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the inquiries about his bloodthirsty "Natural Born Killers" 
soundtrack album . . . or why he lived for a year in the Benedict Canyon house 
where Sharon Tate and others were murdered by Charles Manson followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock's hottest new antihero will deal with all that and more later. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Reznor wants to talk about something that has been nagging him: 
questions, especially in the British press, about whether the rage that fuels 
his sometimes venomous music is genuine, and whether he isn't just a tad too 
eager to be a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 These suspicions about Reznor arise in the Nirvana-inspired age of the 
reluctant superstar and are an outgrowth of the punk-rock code that frowns on 
theatrics and sees mainstream popularity as a sign of artistic compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But growing up in small-town Pennsylvania, Reznor liked being entertained, 
from the fire-breathing theatrics of KISS to horror movies, the scarier the 
better. He enjoys punctuating his concerts and videos with dramatic lighting 
and other effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some kid come up to me recently after he read some things and he was 
all upset," Reznor says, sitting in his hotel room here. "He said, 'I just want 
to ask you one question: You do mean what you write about, don't you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor pauses and shakes his head in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he says forcefully -- as if to answer anyone else who is wondering. 
"I've felt everything you hear in those songs. It's all real. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started writing, I did a couple of things that were just (expletive)," 
he says, smiling now at how bad it must have been. "At one point, I thought, 'I 
like the Clash. I'll write something like they would,' and I came up with this 
half-assed thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "So as an experiment, I started putting down how I felt inside, very private 
things -- depressing things that you're not necessarily proud to say or that 
you want anyone else to hear. But it felt true, and it was amazing later when 
I'd look out and see people in the audience singing along." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor, whose West Coast tour begins a four-day stand Monday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, is on a roll now. He's got his boots propped up on a coffee table 
and he's addressing the second issue -- the one about just how he is reacting 
to his rapidly escalating stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out of this (industrial rock) scene where it wasn't cool if too many 
people liked your band, and I started feeling uneasy around the time of the 
Lollapalooza tour (in 1991), when things started getting bigger," he continues. 
"I went around asking, 'Who are all these new fans? Why do they like our music? 
This isn't for them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I realized that it's stupid. It's not up to me to stand at the door and 
say, 'You are cool, you can come in, but you aren't cool, so stay away.' 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, I realized that I would never have been allowed in under those 
rules, because when I was growing up, I was never one of the kids that anyone 
called cool. That's where a lot of the anger started." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If D. A. Pennebaker, the noted documentary filmmaker who captured Bob Dylan 
and David Bowie at critical moments in their careers, wanted to make a movie 
about a contemporary rock figure, Reznor would be the ideal choice. The 
29-year-old Nine Inch Nails leader is at the absolute center of the sociology 
of today's rock. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most powerful moments, he pushes the relatively polite alienation of 
most post-Nirvana bands to new levels of aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor, through the album "The Downward Spiral," uses some of the grotesque 
images of horror films and old-fashioned heavy-metal music and weaves them into 
such personalized tales of self-destruction and self-loathing that they become 
uncomfortably lifelike. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the world of Nine Inch Nails seems off-limits -- and the most 
unsettling part is that Reznor accompanies the stories with such a seductive 
musical assault that it's hard not to feel a certain visceral thrill when 
listening to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bowie and Prince, Reznor senses a liberation in forcing an audience to 
confront its own sexual and social taboos. His videos are frequently filled 
with death, sadomasochism and perversion. In the 1992 video for "Happiness in 
Slavery," a man is turned into ground meat by a machine. (MTV passed.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is I'm not a big fan of videos, but if we are going to make them, 
let's make them as interesting as possible," he explains. "I like the idea of 
subversively communicating with people . . . so that you make people see things 
in different ways. The same way with the live show. . . . When we started 
playing live, it was us just trying to play the music as honestly as we could. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as we went along, anger became more of a source of inspiration or energy. 
It could be anger at an apathetic audience or it could be from thinking back to 
how I was feeling when I wrote the song. Turning the whole thing into rock 
theater was more interesting to me than watching five guys dressed like gas 
station attendants with their heads down. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, rock music was never meant to be safe. I think there needs to be an 
element of intrigue, mystery, subversiveness. Your parents should hate it. If 
it pisses you off, that's great. If you think I worship Satan because of 
something you see in the 'Closer' video, great." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the heart of Reznor's artistry is his music. Beyond the shocking images of 
"The Downward Spiral" -- the year's most compelling album -- there is an 
anguished cry for something to believe in at a time when government and 
religion and family no longer seem to provide answers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bowie's "Low" -- along with Pink Floyd's "The Wall" -- that Reznor 
listened to in the months he was writing and recording "Downward Spiral." They 
are both icy, alienated works by which he measured his own feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the pusher, I am the whore . . . I am the need you have for more," he 
declares in "Mr. Self Destruct," describing an age in which obsessions and 
addictions have replaced morality and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Interscope Records' Jimmy Iovine, who has worked as engineer or producer with 
Bruce Springsteen and U2, was so excited by Reznor's potential three years ago 
that he spent more than a year working out a Nine Inch Nails joint venture with 
TVT Records, which held the band's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when you are looking at somebody new, you feel 50% sure about their 
talent or maybe even 75%, but with Trent I was 1,000%," Iovine says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people can play the guitar really well, and then there's Jimi 
Hendrix. A lot of people write really well, and then there is Bono or Kurt 
Cobain or Bruce. . . . These are people who bring something extra to what they 
do, a vision that is wholly unique, and that's Trent." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rubin, who is head of American Records and a rival of Iovine in the 
search for exciting, cutting-edge bands, is equally lavish with his praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trent is the most exciting musician of his generation, no question," says 
Rubin, who has produced records for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mick Jagger, Tom 
Petty and Slayer. "His whole vision blows me away." 
</P>
<P>
 You can learn a lot about some one by talking to the people who work with him. 
All too often in the pop world, managers and agents are reluctant to speak on 
the record about their clients because of fear they'll say something that will 
displease the star. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reznor manager John Malm Jr. and agent Gerry Gerrard are comfortable 
talking about their red-hot property. 
</P>
<P>
 They and others picture Reznor as someone who is totally devoted to his music 
and has endless creative energy. He produced the "Natural Born Killers" 
soundtrack album in a portable setup in his hotel room while on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the mystery and provocation of his stage shows, videos and photos, you'd 
think Reznor always feels the need to play a role. 
</P>
<P>
 When the door opens to his hotel room, you half expect him to be waiting in 
the dark -- the way Prince used to do interviews before he stopped talking to 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 But sunshine fills the room and there's no trace of the anger you hear in the 
music or see onstage. Reznor is wearing a plain black sweat shirt, jeans and 
boots. The only hint of rock 'n' roll rebellion is two modest earrings, one 
dangling from each lobe. The room is surprisingly tidy for a rocker on the 
road. A portable tape player and some tapes are the only items on the dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor speaks easily and at length, eventually skipping the sound check to 
make sure all the questions are answered. He is polite and unusually 
articulate. He's not above flashes of temper, but they are no more frequent 
than those of most artists talking about the trials of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my persona in the media is accurate," he says, picking up a cup 
of coffee from the table in front of him. "I'll do interviews and I'll talk to 
someone and I'll read it and it'll come out like I'm some vampire hanging in a 
corner -- and I'm afraid that people will look at that and think that 
everything about me is a gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is in the late Kurt Cobain's home state, the pressures of stardom 
come up. At the mention of Cobain, Reznor looks out the window and pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't the biggest Nirvana fan in the world," he says finally. "I have 
since realized that part of my negativity toward them was probably jealousy. 
Even after I realized they were a good band, there was no getting away from 
them. They were everywhere -- on the radio, on MTV, in the papers. And when 
something hits me over the head constantly, my reaction is to want to get away 
from that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I heard that he killed himself, it was a sad feeling. Even at the 
level we are at, which is much lower than where Nirvana was, there are 
pressures that I have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor looks again through the window and gathers his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I worked hard at something and I achieved more than I ever thought 
was possible," he says. "At the same time, the price for me is a bit of 
normality. On a spiritual and human level, I still have a ways to go. There's a 
whole world of living out there that I don't know about. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pretty serious relationship with someone that I realized I couldn't 
have, because no person can deal with what I'm doing. It's hard to have someone 
who understands that I'm going to be in the studio for the next six months, 
then I'll be on tour for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once thought that all this (success) would bring you happiness, turn you 
into the life of the party, but that's all very immature. You get a taste of 
all that and you realize that's not it. So you go on searching." 
</P>
<P>
 Like millions of other kids, young Reznor was often told that he was just 
wasting his time listening to rock 'n' roll and watching horror movies -- 
starting with "The Exorcist" and through all the Freddy and Jason shockers. But 
those are two of the influences that shaped his artistic vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, apparently, was life in tiny Mercer, Pa., near the Ohio border. One 
reason he is fascinated with life on the extreme, he says, is because he grew 
up in a place that was so conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing going on culturally. The place was much like the town in 
'Blue Velvet' -- trees, cornfields," he says, referring to the David Lynch 
film. "The rest of the world was a million miles away. It wasn't bad, but it 
just instilled in me that I don't want to end up here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like an outsider because everything was based on things I didn't care 
about, primarily athletics. If you were on the football team, you were a 
celebrity. If you were in the band or took art class, like me, you were an 
outsider." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor -- who lived with his grandparents after his parents were divorced when 
he was 5 -- was raised Protestant and went to Sunday school for a while, but he 
eventually rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is it bored the life out of me and a lot of questions I had weren't 
answered," he says. "I also thought a lot of the members of my church were 
hypocrites, that the whole thing was a sham." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, he went to nearby Allegheny College, where he studied 
computer engineering for a year. He still felt like an outsider, and turned to 
music for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The good thing about college was discovering a new world of music -- 
synthesizer-based bands, such as Kraftwerk and Einsturzende Neubauten that he 
never heard on the mainstream radio stations that he could pick up in Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked technology and electronics. I liked the way it sounded . . . the idea 
that you could make a record with a machine," Reznor recalls. "It was more 
interesting than guitar-bass-drum bands." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year, he left college and moved to Cleveland, which was the closest 
rock scene to Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor had no idea of how to get into the music business, so he started 
working at a Cleveland recording studio doing odd jobs -- including cleaning 
the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 More than the $200 a month salary, the job gave him a chance to learn the 
recording process. Whenever the studio wasn't in use, he was given the run of 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The young keyboardist played in various groups but couldn't find other 
musicians who were as serious as he was about music. Around that time, he met 
Malm, who would become his manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trent was very soft-spoken, quiet, but he stood out," Malm recalls in a 
separate interview. "He was talented and very driven. One day he brought me a 
tape (that he made) and asked me to listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Malm loved the tape -- which included early versions of some of the songs that 
would be included on "Pretty Hate Machine," the 1989 debut album that Reznor 
released under the stage name Nine Inch Nails. (Since then he has continued to 
make albums on his own, using a band only for live shows.) 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor remembers the tape as his moment of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my greatest fear after those years of dreaming about making music was 
to discover I really didn't have anything to say . . . ," he says. "I think the 
reason I was 23 before I ever wrote a song was that I was afraid of testing 
myself. What would I do if I discovered I didn't have anything to say?" 
</P>
<P>
 T hings moved relatively fast for the new team. Reznor and Malm signed in 1989 
with TVT Records, a small New York label that gave them a $45,000 recording 
budget. The key attraction, Malm says, was a promise of total artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 But tensions surfaced early between Reznor and the label, Malm says. And they 
didn't improve as "Pretty Hate Machine" became such an underground hit (about 
250,000 copies sold) that Nine Inch Nails was invited to join the first 
Lollapalooza tour. The band ended up stealing the show and saw the sales of its 
album increase dramatically during the brief tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the source of the friction between him and TVT, Reznor says simply 
"everything." 
</P>
<P>
 About Reznor, Steve Gottlieb, president of TVT Records, says: "Trent is a 
musical genius, and one of the most inspired artists of our time. In spite of 
our problematic working relationship, I have nothing but the utmost love and 
admiration of his creative output." 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of Reznor's potential, major labels raced forward to try to get the band 
away from TVT. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Iovine, who had just started Interscope, was among those pursuing Nine 
Inch Nails. He worked out a complicated joint-venture agreement with TVT that 
assured Reznor the freedom he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the anger from "The Downward Spiral" is a reflection of his 
depressions during the TVT days of uncertainty, Reznor says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started making 'Downward Spiral,' I was also very depressed and the 
theme of self-destruction was heavily on my mind," he says, sitting in the 
hotel room. "I wanted to make a record that explored the feeling that makes you 
feel so isolated that you feel self-destructive about everything in your life. 
I even plotted out the different ways you can go about destroying yourself. It 
was my attempt to chip away at all the darkness inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor was thinking about recording the album in Los Angeles, which led him by 
accident in early 1993 to the Tate house. Looking for a place to live here, he 
drove around with a realtor one afternoon, looking at several houses, including 
one in Benedict Canyon that impressed him because of the isolation and the 
lovely view. 
</P>
<P>
 When plans fell through for an alternative recording site in New Orleans, 
where Reznor now lives, he decided to rent the Benedict Canyon house, whose 
history he had since learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't rent it because someone had been murdered there or for publicity, 
and I certainly don't give a (expletive) about Charles Manson," Reznor says. "I 
just loved the view. If it affected the way the record sounded, it was simply 
because it was so isolated. I'd go for a week without leaving the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision this year to play Woodstock was strictly for money, not for a 
stake in rock history. The Woodstock fee -- a cool $250,000 -- would help 
finance Nine Inch Nails' high touring costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first Woodstock meant nothing to me, historically or whatever, and I 
didn't have any interest in being a spokesman for a generation or any of that 
crap," he says. "The idea was just go in and play and leave the statements to 
the rest of the bands." 
</P>
<P>
 But he got into the spirit of the weekend once he got to Woodstock and saw 
300,000 people trying to have fun in the mud. So, on the way to the stage, he 
tripped his guitar player, who fell flat into the mud. The result was the whole 
band ended up in a mud match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like a calculated move, but it might have been some subconscious 
attempt to identify with the fans," Reznor says. "One thing that kind of 
disturbed me about the whole weekend was the fans had all these horrible 
conditions, the rain and all -- and the bands have a trailer and shower and 
nice place to sleep. The mud kind of made us all one." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails' Seattle show is at the Center Arena, which is next to the 
grounds on which the public memorial was held for Kurt Cobain in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an honesty to both bands that I like, but Nirvana tended to look at 
things in a more positive way, while Nine Inch Nails tends to be darker, which 
is what I like because it's closer to how I feel sometimes," says Ben Beranek, 
an 18-year-old fan as he stands outside the arena, watching some girls pass by. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most hard-rock bands, Nine Inch Nails draws a high percentage of 
females -- a sign of Reznor's sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say," says Julie Torres, 18, of Seattle. "He's sexy and scary." 
</P>
<P>
 You watch some of the young faces and you can imagine the look on Reznor's 
face the first time he saw "The Exorcist" back in Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the audience during "Closer," a boy, no more than 14, sings every word as 
aggressively as Reznor does onstage: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I want to (expletive) you like an animal.  
</P>
<P>
 My whole existence is flawed.  
</P>
<P>
 You get me closer to God.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails' tour runs through February, but Reznor is already thinking 
about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much aware of the dangers of becoming a cliche . . . Mr. Anger, 
someone who gets meaner, angrier on record," Reznor said earlier in the day in 
his hotel room. "When I don't feel it, I won't write about it anymore. I 
promise you that. I don't care if no one buys a record ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 But is there any happiness in Reznor's life? 
</P>
<P>
 "On a career level, I feel very happy," he says. "I'm so surprised that 
Woodstock turned out the way it did. It's like we just stepped up another 
plateau. 'Downward Spiral' debuted at No. 2 on the charts. I'm happy about 
that. No reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I want to begin work immediately on another record as soon as the 
tour is over. I've never gone into the studio in this (frame of mind). . . . My 
goal for the next album is to make it anti-'Downward Spiral' in terms of 
something that is not heavily produced." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the themes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says, with the flash of a smile, "don't look for my 'married and 
happy' album yet."

THE LAW OF THE SCHOOL YARD; JANE DOE, A PETALUMA STUDENT, STARTED A RUMOR THAT 
CAME BACK TO HAUNT HER. NOW SHE'S AT THE CENTER OF A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER KIDS 
AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Magazine staff writer Nina J. Easton's last piece for the 
magazine was The Merchants of Virtue, about the men leading the GOP's crusade 
for values. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jane Doe heard the smutty story, she acted like any normal sixth-grader: 
She giggled, got "grossed out" and passed the rumor on to her friends. Then, in 
the fall she entered seventh grade, where she became the target of the very 
same rumor. Boys and girls from her Petaluma junior high taunted her between 
class, during class, after school: "Hey, I hear you had sex with a hot dog" or 
"I wonder what kind of hot dog she prefers" or just plain "hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse made Jane grow up fast, too fast. By the middle of eighth grade, she 
had stopped riding her bike to friends' houses or designing dresses for her 
paper dolls, instead locking herself in her bedroom while she listened to Ugly 
Kid Joe belt out "I hate everything about you" over and over. By then, her 
depression and anger had grown so deep, the only way her parents could think to 
rescue her was to relocate. They moved 30 miles up the highway, leaving behind 
their schools, their friends, their church. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard Homrighouse first heard the hot dog rumor, from Jane and her 
father, he acted as he believed a competent guidance counselor should: He 
listened sympathetically, told them the behavior was unacceptable, and warned 
one of the boys. Four years later, Homrighouse would find himself sitting 
before a legal reporter, racking his brain for every detail of that and other 
encounters with the straw-blond girl he had befriended in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 What Homrighouse said or didn't say, did or didn't do, during his encounters 
with Jane Doe, as she is known to protect her anonymity, is at the heart of a 
lawsuit she has filed against Homrighouse and the Petaluma schools. Doe's 
lawyers say there is a name for the kind of bullying Jane endured: "sexual 
harassment." And by failing to stop it, they contend, the school violated Title 
IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms such as sexual harassment are increasingly entering the lexicon of the 
schoolyard, and in this post-Anita Hill era, adults are hastily borrowing from 
their own experience to explain -- and cope with -- childhood breaches of civil 
behavior. We know that sexual language and innuendo are common to children, 
particularly junior high students as they stumble awkwardly into puberty. The 
question is: Should we be using legal action, rather than families or school 
mediation and education, to try to socialize young people? And what will happen 
if we do? 
</P>
<P>
 The Petaluma case has become a cause celebre for feminist groups and could 
have far-reaching consequences on how educators address a discipline problem as 
old as co-ed schools. Ever since 1988, when another Petaluma mother complained 
to the federal government about her daughter's abuse, the U.S. Department of 
Education has quietly pressured school districts to treat tawdry teasing, even 
among elementary-school children, as illegal sexual harassment. Defense lawyers 
in the Doe case will challenge that practice, contending that the department 
broke its own rules when it construed Title IX, historically used to attain 
equity in girls' sports programs and the like, to outlaw schoolyard 
name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's rights groups, meanwhile, see this issue as the latest front in their 
battle for gender equity. They hope the judge in the Doe case will clearly 
delineate a school's obligation to protect students from vulgar verbal 
assaults. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights "has been 
investigating and resolving complaints but without clear guidance," says Ellen 
Vargyas, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. "People at all 
levels are struggling with the issue. We know what the model is in employment. 
But we also know the workplace is different from schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Feminist legal experts like Vargyas contend that a school has an even broader 
obligation to stop harassment than an employer. If the court upholds that 
interpretation, school districts will rush to cover their legal backsides with 
policies designed to treat sexual teasing differently than other discipline 
problems. "What responsibility do the schools have, versus the parents?" asks 
Scott N. Kivel, attorney for the Petaluma schools and formerly a school 
principal. "Are we trying to protect our children from every wrong? If every 
offensive comment is going to bring litigation, we're not giving children a 
sense of reality that they have to deal with these situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Petaluma, the quiet farming-turned-bedroom community of 47,000 north of San 
Francisco, is typical of the towns across America where "peer-on-peer sexual 
harassment" is being played out. Gangs and guns in school are still remote, 
and, mostly, the kids here get in trouble for alcohol and cigarettes and 
fights. What added to the horror of last year's kidnaping and murder of local 
girl Polly Klaas was precisely the ordinariness of the place: Wide sidewalks 
and huge supermarkets and affordable houses in developments sprawling east of 
the 101 freeway. Even the town's underlying social drama seems almost quaint: 
Eastsiders newly ensconced in their tract houses feel they can't get a fair 
shake from an Establishment controlled by the westsiders living across the 
railroad tracks, smug in their lovely Victorian homes and spending their old 
money in the antique stores now dotting Petaluma's vintage downtown. Kenilworth 
Junior High, which Jane attended, is an eastsider school tucked under the shade 
of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Doe's dad is a firefighter, and her mom worked as an office administrator 
until a bad back forced her to quit. The defense attorneys want to portray Jane 
as an angry underachiever who has had to live in the shadow of her older 
sister, a track star and honor student. They question the motives of parents 
who hired an attorney to consider legal action after reading about the earlier 
Petaluma case, which resulted in a $20,000 settlement -- an agreement, they 
hasten to add, that was made by the school's insurance company without its 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Doe's attorneys, meanwhile, depict Homrighouse as a middle-aged man who still 
subscribes to the outdated notion that "boys will be boys." Feminist groups say 
Homrighouse, 53, and his school are examples of how America's education 
Establishment has dropped the ball on sexual harassment. "Why did they throw 
their hands up in the air and remain passive?" asks Doe attorney Maria Blanco, 
staff lawyer at San Francisco's Equal Rights Advocates. "Or did they believe it 
was not that serious?" 
</P>
<P>
 Doe's side faces an admittedly steep legal hill: Under an earlier ruling in 
the case, they must prove that the school intentionally discriminated against 
Jane because of her gender. They also must make a case that girls can sexually 
harass other girls, something Blanco says has already been established in the 
workplace. Jane's lawsuit focuses on the behavior of boys, but it is clear from 
her own words that the most vicious bullies were the Kenilworth girls who wore 
Raiders jackets and too much makeup and ran together as the tough crowd. "The 
girls were more spiteful," Jane recalls, in an interview granted after much 
negotiation with her lawyers. "If a girl wanted to get into a fight with me, 
she'd call me a 'hot dog' or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But her $1-million lawsuit could have implications far beyond any new legal 
ground it may hoe. Its mere filing poses troubling questions about how we 
should admonish childhood aggressors. Do we tell them their behavior is wrong, 
or that it is illegal? What do we want to teach them about the role of the 
courts and the government in settling interpersonal disputes? What will be the 
impact of attaching an adversarial adult label such as "sexual harassment" to 
broad categories of childhood behavior? Are we helping our children connect 
across the gender divide, or are we drawing new battle lines? 
</P>
<P>
 To the feminist attorneys and educators leading the crusade on schoolyard 
sexual harassment, the issue presents a tempting opportunity to shape the 
behavior of boys before they turn into abusive men. Nan Stein, project director 
at Wellesley College's Center for Research on Women, calls today's schools 
"training grounds for domestic violence." There are plenty of horror stories 
for Stein to draw on: the Spur Posse's game of sexual conquests in Lakewood; 
newspaper descriptions of "whirlpooling" in New York City pools, where boys 
surround girls to rip off their bathing suits; the trial of boys in a New 
Jersey suburb accused of gang-raping a mentally disabled girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The everyday sexual teasing that goes on outside the glare of news cameras can 
be equally disturbing. First-graders on a bus in Minnesota shout about sexual 
acts they couldn't possibly understand. Fifth-graders in Missouri rub their 
penises through their pants to embarrass the girls. In Maryland, 
elementary-school girls try to kiss boys' genitals; the boys, in turn, jump on 
the girls' backs, crotches pressed against the girls' buttocks, in a stunt 
called "nutting." Teen-agers at an elite Los Angeles high school use their 
computers to publish a newsletter filled with lurid descriptions of the 
supposed sexual habits of the popular female clique. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with nearly a dozen parents and children around the country, a 
consistent story emerges: Watching a child tormented daily by peers, parents go 
to the school for help. The discipline meted out by school officials doesn't 
stop the abuse. The parents transfer their depressed child out of the school 
and into therapy. Increasingly, they then call on the Education Department's 
Office for Civil Rights to discipline the school district. As of 1993, the 
office was investigating 78 cases of schoolyard sexual harassment, up from 10 
in 1988, though some of those recent cases involved teachers accused of abusing 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the phone lines, the voices of these parents and their children crack 
with anger and sadness. From Linda Wolfs in Iowa: "I understand why she can't 
trust people. She's lost friends. It's just not fair. Jenny will be in therapy 
for a long time." From Mary DeRosa in Massachusetts, whose daughter had to 
finish her last two years of high school at home: "It breaks your heart 
thinking what they go through." From Lisa Bye of Maryland, a junior 
high-schooler who was the target of a boy who grabbed at her shirt and crotch: 
"I felt so sick and ashamed. My counselor said I should just get on with my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're beginning to realize this behavior is unacceptable and dangerous to 
females," says Diane K. Shrier, clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics 
at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. She notes 
that research studies show girls have high self-esteem until adolescence, 
"where you see increased depression and self-esteem problems. Some of that may 
very well have to do with how they are treated sexually." 
</P>
<P>
 But before feminists and judges and lawmakers reach into the adult arsenal of 
language and tools to combat the problem, it's important to keep a few things 
in mind. First, the studies that purport to prove that sexual harassment is 
rampant on schoolyards cast a wide net. The most widely quoted research, a 1993 
survey of 1,632 eighth-to-11th grade students by the American Association of 
University Women, included dirty jokes and gestures, spying in the showers and 
"mooning" alongside forced kissing, grabs or pulling at clothes. In that 
report, 81% of all students -- boys and girls -- reported that they had 
experienced sexual harassment at least once in their school experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But, says James Garbarino, director of Cornell University's Family Life 
Development Center, even as some adolescents are acting more abusively toward 
each other, others are treating the opposite sex in a spirit of casual 
egalitarianism. And John Schowalter, director of training at the Yale Child 
Study Center, sees the rise in peer-on-peer sexual harassment cases as the 
fallout of an inevitable cultural change. "Young women are much more aware of 
their rights, of people trying to invade their space and person. They're much 
quicker to say: 'I'm not going to put up with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the feminist groups pushing this issue usually portray the problem 
exclusively as another example of female oppression. As Jane Doe's case shows, 
though, the truth is more complex. In the AAUW survey, nearly as many boys 
(76%) as girls (85%) reported being harassed, and girls were commonly the 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
 At its root, sexual harassment is about the abuse of power. But it's not clear 
whether that should apply to the schoolyard. "Sexual harassment has a power 
differential, an exploitative component," says Celia B. Fisher, director of the 
graduate program in developmental psychology at Fordham University and a paid 
expert witness for the defense in the Jane Doe case. "It's difficult to see the 
power differential between a 13-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl," she 
continues. "Boys do not have more power. Adolescent boys are just as insecure 
as girls. There is no evidence that girls see boys in a more powerful 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Third, research suggests that this is a normal, if ugly, stage of development. 
The AAUW survey found that first incidents of sexual harassment peaked in the 
seventh grade, a year when pimple-faced students are awkwardly discovering and 
testing their own sexuality and, not surprisingly, the year that Jane Doe's 
torment began. Academic surveys show that bullying in general drops off 
dramatically after age 12 or 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Children tease and flirt and touch and fight -- all behaviors widely 
considered off-limits in the workplace. And even the teasing has shades of 
meaning. A child may be experimenting with new sexual language or awkwardly 
expressing interest in someone or being cruel, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Brown, professor of educational psychology at the University of 
Wisconsin, says that sexual teasing is particularly prevalent among junior 
high-schoolers because they have just emerged from late elementary school, a 
period where children have a strong tendency to segregate themselves by gender. 
"One important task of that (junior high) age is to reacquaint oneself with the 
opposite sex," Brown says. Teasing at this age, he adds, is "clumsy. They don't 
know how to be playful, rather than hurtful." A child's perspective on the 
impact of that name-calling, researchers say, isn't fully developed until late 
adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this nuance is lost on the Education Department's staff, which, after 
all, is paid to write and enforce regulations, not analyze child development 
theory. Officials at the department's Office for Civil Rights see more 
similarities than differences between the workplace and schools. "In 
employment, victims of harassment complain of lost income, lost promotion 
opportunities and unfair working conditions," says Norma V. Cantu, President 
Clinton's assistant secretary for civil rights. "In education, victims complain 
of hostility, inability to concentrate, poor grades, depression. So the stakes 
are very high. The control by the (school) administration is identical to the 
control in the workplace. You are in a controlled classroom setting where there 
are disciplinary practices in place to create an environment where students can 
learn. The administration has been held responsible for what happens within the 
four walls of the classroom, just like the employer is responsible for how the 
employees are treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the words "sexual harassment" entered any school district's vocabulary, 
many schools were guilty of ignoring this kind of behavior. But others treated 
it as they would any other discipline problem: with warnings, written 
apologies, detention and suspension. Now schools, responding to pressure from 
the Education Department and women's groups, are putting this behavior in a 
separate category. Off-limits to most school officials in this charged 
political environment are such common strategies as mediation efforts (a victim 
shouldn't have to face her abuser) and dress codes (that would suggest the 
school is blaming the victim). There is also an emphasis on punishing the 
abuser, even though many researchers say it is far more effective to first 
educate children about the hurt they are inflicting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among some feminists leading this charge, there is deep concern about 
courts and legislatures applying an adult standard to children -- particularly 
when it doesn't take into account age and childhood development. Wellesley's 
Stein employs terms such as "bullying" and "teasing" in the curriculum she is 
designing for elementary schools, reserving the words "sexual harassment" for 
junior high and above. And, notes Eleanor Linn, associate director of programs 
for educational opportunity at the University of Michigan and a paid expert 
witness for Jane Doe's side, education efforts should be cautious about 
branding misbehaving children as criminals because of the frightening images 
the word "illegal" would conjure up in the mind of a young child. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agencies and legislatures now drawing the lines on schoolyard sexual 
harassment have never been particularly adept at subtle distinctions. A 1993 
California law permits children as young as the fourth grade to be suspended or 
expelled for sexual harassment. And the Office for Civil Rights operates under 
the assumption that all sexually explicit taunting is sexual harassment, 
regardless of the age. 
</P>
<P>
 When elementary school boys on a bus in Eden Prairie, Minn., hurled dirty 
words at the girls, school officials employed the usual artillery of discipline 
-- detention, suspension and transferring a student to another bus. But an 
Office for Civil Rights official called to town in 1992 to investigate 
concluded these actions weren't enough: The matter should have been handled as 
"sexual harassment," adhering to the procedures and disciplines set forth under 
the district's own policies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the federal level, Jane Doe's lawyers saw an opening for a lawsuit in 1992 
when the Supreme Court ruled that students could seek damages from schools 
under Title IX. Kim Jamieson, deputy superintendent of the Petaluma City School 
District, contends that these cases could be financially devastating for 
struggling schools. But Ruth Jones, a staff attorney for the NOW Legal Defense 
and Education Fund and one of Doe's volunteer lawyers, sees lawsuits against 
schools and their officials as a necessary evil: "I feel really strongly that 
girls have a right to go to school without this happening. The way we establish 
the rules and lines of behavior is by litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 With its shifting alliances, power struggles and raw brutality, the seventh 
grade world that spawned Jane Doe's lawsuit is complex and subtly savage. A 
12-year-old can be summarily exiled for crimes not apparent to the adults in 
her life, teased and tormented mercilessly while her parents look helplessly 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear even to Jane why she became the target of the hot dog rumor. She 
didn't develop early. She wasn't a slow student. She's always had lots of 
friends. One former Kenilworth student said in a deposition that Jane became a 
target simply because she had started the rumor about someone else the year 
before. In her deposition, Jane acknowledged hearing the rumor from an 
out-of-state friend and passing it on to her girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos from that period, on the upstairs bureau of the Doe's new red-tile-roof 
house to the north of Petaluma, show a petite blond girl with a wide smile. The 
rebellious James Dean posters plastered in her room are softened by the 
surrounding dried flower bouquets, mementos from her dance performances in high 
school musicals. The story the walls don't tell is that, like any family, 
Jane's has had its share of internal strife -- marital and other conflicts that 
led to family therapy when Jane was in sixth grade, fights with her parents 
that once prompted Jane to leave home and stay with a friend overnight. All of 
these sensitive details are now the prerogative of lawyers who have license to 
pick over Jane's family life like hungry gulls. The girl who opens the door 
this August morning is a matured version of the thin 12-year-old her mother 
pointed out in a photo the week before. At 16, she's 5-foot-6, with the curves 
of a grown woman and the same pretty, wide- brimmed face of a Midwestern farm 
girl under her blond bangs. As Jane settles into the BarcaLounger, curling her 
stockinged feet under her jeans, two personality traits begin to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is the tough, nonchalant exterior she has so carefully constructed. 
The previous week, Jane's mother had described her daughter well: "She's very 
strong willed. You never have to guess what she's thinking, and yet she's this 
really soft person inside who gets her feelings hurt easily." On this day, 
Jane's responses to questions about the teasing and taunts she endured are 
languid: "I didn't care 'cause he was a jerk anyway," she says of one incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Only toward the end of the interview does she hint at her level of depression 
during that period. In describing an encounter with a friend at church camp, 
she says: "I was having a hard time because everyone in my group was feeling 
like God is there for you, that He feels everything. But I had a really hard 
time with that because I didn't think that if He could feel all the pain I was 
going through, He would have kept me at Kenilworth." 
</P>
<P>
 The second trait is her exceptionally strong streak of distrust toward the 
adults in her life: Her mother, her therapists, her attorneys. "I don't believe 
in counseling. I think it's stupid," she says at one point. "There's something 
about people being paid to listen to me, it doesn't comfort me." Later, she 
says she found the deposition process good sport, saying she enjoyed playing 
"mind games" with the opposing attorney. "I would make sarcastic retorts, and 
he would turn and do it back to me, except he was getting really mad and I 
wasn't," she says. "I guess it's kinda mean, but I'm glad I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane's troubles started in the fall of seventh grade, when a boy came up to 
her and said, "Hey, I hear you have a hot dog in your pants." Shortly after, 
another boy made the same comment. When she realized that she had become the 
target of the hot dog rumor, she told Homrighouse, and one of the boys involved 
was warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the boys were the first to start the name- calling, girls would use 
the hot dog taunts as a way to try to provoke Jane into physical fights. Jane 
complained to Homrighouse about a girl who was threatening her. The following 
year the school suspended another girl who slapped Jane in the face while she 
was waiting in line for her yearbook. When the harassment was at its peak, Jane 
says she was most afraid of riding her bike past one particular girl's house: 
"She was just psycho. She'd harass me. She was just mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the court's decision in the case is likely to turn on contested facts 
about how often Jane actually sought help. Jane says she complained to 
Homrighouse as many as two to three times a week during this period, and that 
the counselor -- concerned about her plight -- allowed her and her friends to 
eat lunch in a school office so they wouldn't be bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the defense's child development expert says that Homrighouse took an 
appropriately "holistic" view of Jane's problems, disciplining provocateurs 
when necessary but also working on Jane's self-esteem and continued conflicts 
with both teachers and peers. Homrighouse, who declined to be interviewed for 
this story, recalled in depositions that during the seventh grade, he met with 
Jane about the hot dog rumors only once -- which resulted in the warning. In 
other meetings with Jane, he says, they discussed her conflicts with a girl, 
problems with a history teacher and his recommendation that she attend a 
self-esteem-boosting leadership camp. He says he doesn't recall allowing Jane 
to eat lunch in the school office. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jane entered the eighth grade, she came to him to discuss the stress she 
was enduring because of the hot dog rumor, Homrighouse recalled. He told her at 
the time that the behavior constituted illegal sexual harassment and added that 
as a counselor, he was not authorized to suspend students, though he described 
alternative punishments. He stressed that Jane hadn't provided the names of any 
students and seemed mostly to want to talk to someone about it. "My 
understanding was that since I had invited her to return and she hadn't, then 
(the teasing) had stopped," Homrighouse added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Does -- particularly Jane -- had viewed Homrighouse as a friend and ally, 
but gradually changed their minds. "He acts like a very concerned person," says 
Jane's mother. "But you walk out the door and forget it -- he doesn't have 
time.' " The school's attorneys respond that if Jane was so miserable, she and 
her parents should have immediately taken their case to the assistant 
principal, Linda Noll, who was in charge of both discipline and Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane knew that Noll was the school disciplinarian, but says she was more 
comfortable with the more amicable counselor. She adds in her deposition: "I 
thought of it more as whenever people got into fights, they were sent to Mrs. 
Noll." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, once Noll did get involved -- during the second semester of 
Jane's eighth-grade year -- heads began to roll. Noll suspended the girl who 
slapped Jane. Later, she suspended a boy who stood up in class and asked Jane 
why she had had sex with a hot dog. The day after that incident, Jane's father 
marched into the school, met with the principal, vice principal and 
Homrighouse, and demanded that they put an end to the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Jane was deeply distraught. She didn't want to go to school, or even 
leave the house, and got into angry fights with her mother, saying she wanted 
out of Kenilworth -- and Petaluma. "She'd have screaming fits," recalls her 
mother. "She refused to go to school in the morning. I was the bad guy because 
I made her go to school. Our relationship just kind of fell apart at that 
point. She realized we wouldn't move, we wouldn't take her out of school. In 
her eyes, we weren't doing anything to help her." 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw came just one week after Jane's father met with school 
officials. Jane was eating her lunch when a new girl at school demanded they 
make a date to fight after school. When Jane refused, the girl and her friends 
began obscene name-calling. A playground supervisor rescued Jane, who was taken 
to Noll's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that last incident, she just said, 'I can't stay here anymore, Mom,' " 
Jane's mother recalls. "I went and picked her up, and she fell into my arms 
sobbing. I said, 'That's it,' and I pulled her out that day." The following 
week, Jane was enrolled in a Santa Rosa school, 25 miles away. When that 
commute became untenable, and the harassment in their Petaluma neighborhood 
continued, the Does moved to a town half-an-hour north. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane now attends a private high school and says she's happy with her new life. 
"I've changed so much in the past few years," she says as she describes with 
enthusiasm the church summer camp that has helped her blossom. Then she laughs 
at how her newfound confidence sometimes surprises her: "I feel so 
well-rounded!" 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents say the move was the best thing ever to happen to Jane, but they 
remain bitter that the school's unwillingness or inability to stop their 
daughter's torment forced them to uproot their family and incur the costs of 
private tuition and therapy. "It was a big disruption in our lives," says her 
father. "I'm a basic person with real basic values. You can mess with me, but 
once you treat my wife or kids unfairly, then you have to deal with me, and 
we'll do it through whatever legal avenues we have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 This story has a deeper history, and it can be found in the clutter of file 
boxes crammed inside Louise Brawdy's formal dining room. Louise's daughter, 
Tawnya, attended eighth grade at Kenilworth Junior High in 1987. Her mother is 
convinced the experience almost killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-sized chest that Tawnya inherited from her mother came early in 
puberty. Tawnya was also a special education student. To the school's 
insensitive jocks, that combination was irresistible. The chanting -- "moo, 
moo" -- began every morning and followed Tawnya throughout the day. "Every day 
she would walk into the classroom, people would make obscene gestures, say 
disgusting things, mooing," recalls one girl, Jennifer Childs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd try letting her off at different spots," Louise Brawdy says. "I'd just 
say, 'Don't pay any attention. They'll realize it's not getting a rise and 
it'll go away.' " Louise complained to school officials. The principal was 
alerted at least four times, by school employees as well as Louise. He warned 
the students that they would be suspended if the abuse didn't stop. But the 
name-calling continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, when she was cleaning Tawnya's room, Louise found a will. "She 
had written who she was leaving her stuffed animals and her tapes to," Louise 
recalls one August morning as her eyes brim with tears. "This was a 13-year-old 
kid and these were her most prized possessions. I was devastated." Louise sighs 
as she tells her story. By now the tears have washed clean her eye makeup and 
she no longer bothers to hide them. "I didn't know what else to do, who else to 
turn to. I didn't know how else to explain or say it. I had been watching her 
with the headaches, the stomachaches, not wanting to go to school, the grades 
dropping. But I didn't even realize the depth of depression she was in." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1988, after learning about Title IX from an acquaintance 
knowledgeable about education law, Louise took her daughter's case to the 
Office for Civil Rights, filing the first peer-on-peer sexual harassment 
complaint under that law. A federal investigator in 1989 concluded that the 
Petaluma schools had engaged in sexual discrimination under Title IX by failing 
to stop the abuse. The schools promised to clean up their act with new 
policies, procedures and training. 
</P>
<P>
 So by the time Jane Doe brought her complaint to Homrighouse, the school had 
in place a sexual harassment policy. Indeed, on Feb. 24, just a week before 
Jane's mother pulled her out, Kenilworth teachers received a memo urging them 
to review the policy and distribute it to students if necessary, "in addition 
to taking disciplinary action." The memo was prompted in part by the meeting 
with Jane Doe's father. 
</P>
<P>
 The Does didn't apply the words "illegal sexual harassment" to their own 
daughter's abuse until reading about a lawsuit that the Brawdys subsequently 
filed. They got in touch with the Brawdy attorneys and began considering legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with the help of an experienced civil rights activist named Linda 
Purrington, a Petaluma copy editor raising a young daughter on her own, Brawdy 
founded a group called "Parents for Title IX" to support families going through 
similar experiences, publishing a newsletter for more than 400 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes crammed into her living room contain the details of cases around the 
country. Whenever she starts to wallow in grief about her own daughter -- who, 
she says, still suffers from depression and troubled social relations -- Louise 
Brawdy grabs on to the lifeline of language from her newfound political cause. 
"This is a cycle that has to be broken," she asserts, as she puts her emotions 
in check. "If we don't start teaching our girls about equality in the system, 
it's not ever going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching girls -- and boys -- to stand up for themselves. teaching boys -- and 
girls -- to stop hurtful behavior. In the 1990s, parents and educators and 
policy-makers need to decide whether the legal system is the best vehicle to 
teach those lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 No one should minimize the emotional toll on children like Tawnya Brawdy and 
Jane Doe, who, researchers say, are at risk later in life for all sorts of 
problems. The lesson from these children is that even with all our strides 
toward tolerance and equality, we are still inept at teaching our youth how to 
respect each other and their bodies. "We are fumbling and learning," says the 
University of Wisconsin's Brown. "There's a discomfort with many adults over 
what qualifies as normal and what doesn't. Because we as adults are confused, 
we are not very effective at instructing children. There is a lack of 
consistency among adults in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are so confused about their own sexuality," says Vargyas of the National 
Women's Law Center. "We sort of pressure boys to experiment with their 
behavior, and somehow girls are supposed to know what's welcome or unwelcome, 
what's appropriate or not appropriate. Then there's the whole issue of how do 
you communicate the unwelcomeness?" 
</P>
<P>
 Popular culture is no ally in this. America's children are being raised in a 
culture of wholesale commercial sex and in-your-face displays of wrath. They 
mindlessly mimic rap lyrics referring to girls as "hos" and "bitches" or 
scratch graffiti on bathroom walls with imaginative descriptions of the barely 
concealed body parts they see sprawled across the tube. The sexual liberation 
of the '60s and '70s obliterated the old rules of etiquette between the sexes, 
leaving adults at a loss to provide the language and social skills to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But labeling the abusive behavior "sexual harassment" may take us down a road 
we don't want to go. "Maybe there should be a moratorium on touch," one 
feminist educator said during a national strategy session last spring. Another 
sexual harassment crusader, author Susan Strauss, suggests: "How about asking 
if a hug is OK before giving it?" Keith Geiger, president of the National 
Education Assn., warns that just as teachers and coaches have had to affect a 
more distant physical relationship with their students, so too will children 
with each other. "It saddens me," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a litigious society, and sexual harassment is a legal term. It takes 
judgment calls out of the hands of educators and gives the accuser a powerful 
tool over schools, teachers and even other parents. The law punishes rather 
than educates, and it draws lines of behavior in black and white, rarely 
capturing the gray nuances of childhood life. It doesn't distinguish between 
the name- calling of an elementary-schooler (which probably doesn't deserve 
suspension) and breast-grabbing by a high-schooler (which probably does). 
</P>
<P>
 A better answer instead may lie in the schools' latest response to a different 
problem, violence. Conflict resolution programs, adopted by more than half of 
the nation's schools in the past five years, teach children how to rely on 
themselves and other peers to resolve disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another answer must come from home. Because most bullying takes place outside 
the view of adults, adult role models can be particularly important, 
especially, says Geiger, because too many parents encourage a "macho attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Acutely aware that schools alone aren't equipped to deal with all 
interpersonal disputes, the National PTA now urges its local units to 
"encourage parents not only to look at what they are teaching, but also what 
models they are providing in their own relationships, and what they are saying 
to children in response to what they see on TV or in other media," says Ginny 
Markell, chair of the group's Health and Welfare Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Doe and Brawdy cases came to light, the Petaluma schools have 
adopted a new "sexual harassment" policy that provides for punishment ranging 
from counseling to expulsion. They may have missed the point: An earlier policy 
growing out of the Brawdy case, brimming with legalese about sexual harassment 
and Title IX, didn't prevent Jane's abuse. What school districts here and 
across the county still need is widespread teacher training and a curriculum 
designed to teach children how to treat one another with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Before filing their lawsuit, the Does suggested to Petaluma administrators 
that the school discuss the issue of sexual harassment at student assemblies 
and that a policy be sent home for parents to sign. "They need to educate those 
children and they're not doing it," says Jane's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, it's too late. The issue is in the courts, and the Does have no 
intention of backing down. "This has been real hard for me," Jane's mother 
adds. "But it's important for us to be aggressive in following it through to 
show our daughter that we believe in her, and what was done was wrong. And that 
we'll do whatever needs to be done to protect her now."

VOICES: THE QUAKE STILL HITS HOME -- HARD; EMOTIONAL AFTERSHOCKS RUMBLE ON IN A 
QUIET WEST ADAMS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS LEFT NEARLY SILENCED BY THE EFFECTS OF 
THE JAN. 17 TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mattie Dyer Martin, 56, and her husband Alvin, 62, have lived in their West 
Adams-area home for 22 years. But after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
their block and large sections of the surrounding neighborhood were turned into 
a ghost townthe name given to areas so devastated by the temblor that they are 
uninhabitable until they have undergone extensive repairs. Six houses in the 
ghost town were damaged beyond repair and have been torn down. Some others and 
an apartment building stand empty. The Martins' home suffered serious damage, 
though they are able to live in it now after costly repairs. Mattie Martin was 
interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's very depressing. The people who are gone, they were my friends. You're 
used to seeing your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them (who have left) were my nieces. Seeing their house torn down was 
awful. I've cried many times. When I was a little girl my aunt and uncle lived 
in that house. I was there all the time. I had my birthday parties there. My 
nieces have found another place to live. They're not coming back. It's just a 
big empty lot. It means nothing now. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time after the quake, one man whose house was wrecked would come 
and sit in front of his house all day in his car. Another one would come and 
park and just walk up and down smoking a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, something will be done in these empty spaces. I hope they don't put 
up apartments. You can get some pretty lousy tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the empty houses were torn down, homeless people were sleeping in some 
of them. Things were stolen, too. One man had his house jacked way up off the 
foundation and people broke in two nights in a row and stole all the china that 
belonged to his late wife. They took his two shotguns and other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, they stole his washer and dryer. I saw the U-Haul truck and I 
thought, "Oh, Maurice is getting his furniture out." But it was the stealers. 
It was broad daylight. Who'd have thought? 
</P>
<P>
 How they got his washer and dryer, I don't know. That house was almost tumbled 
down. They were crazy to go inside. It looked like you'd give it one little 
push and what was left would fall down. Maurice, I talked to him about a month 
ago and he's just lost. He still doesn't know what he's going to do. He's past 
80 and suddenly he can't stay there anymore. I think he's living with family. 
</P>
<P>
 Our block seems to have gotten it the worst around here. It's weird because it 
seems to have come through here on an angle. My niece's house just dropped off 
its foundation. One of my nieces couldn't get out. She was stuck inside there. 
A friend had to kick the door away from the frame.  
</P>
<P>
 One man's main gas line broke. You could hear the hiss and smell the gas. But 
it was early in the morning. You couldn't see anything. We were without gas and 
electricity for three days. The water wasn't drinkable. My son went and got me 
three gallons of water and it was $7. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a TV with batteries and I'd get so upset watching. They just talked 
about Northridge and the Valley, the problems there. But we had terrible 
problems here. Up and down the street people were sleeping in cars. You 
couldn't get water. You couldn't get a cup of coffee. Everything was closed. 
When you finally did find a place open, they were out of what you needed. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, moving sounded real good. I wouldn't have cared where it was. I just 
wanted to get the hell away from California. My husband said, "We won't be able 
to see our grandkids every day." I said, "That's OK, I'll fly in." But he said, 
"No, it makes more sense to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 My husband is not a person who scares easily. But he'll tell you now that he 
was scared to death. Not that you could tell it then. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a basket case. I went to the doctor because my nerves were just 
shattered. The earthquake was on a Monday and by that Friday I'd lost eight 
pounds. I just couldn't eat. I just stayed close to my husband. If he was out 
of my sight for two minutes, I went and found him. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think this has brought us any closer because we've always been 
exceptionally close. When we go out, we've had people say it looks like we're 
really enjoying ourselves. Total strangers tell us. But it's made me a little 
more dependent on him and more grateful for the care he took of me. He won't 
let me out of his sight for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I still feel apprehensive. I feel we're going to keep having earthquakes and 
it's going to be worse. It's a combination of the experience of the quake and 
the aftershocks, plus seeing the damage every day. I feel the least little jolt 
and it all comes up again. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to be a crystal salesperson. I had $2,000 or $3,000 worth of crystal. 
It's all gone. The floor was covered with broken glass. My son was scooping it 
up and he said, "Mom, at least we don't have to worry about washing this darn 
crystal any more." The city brought a big trash container and it was half full 
of broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
 We have three girls and a boy. The family has been just beautiful. One of my 
daughters was over here every day. 
</P>
<P>
 We did not get knocked off the foundation but we did have lots of damage. We 
have a high estimate of $47,000 and a low one of $30,000 for repairs. We've 
already done the retrofitting. That was $6,500. That was to keep the house 
stable so it doesn't shake off the foundation in aftershocks. We've been 
accepted for a loan and we're pretty sure about a contractor. He did our 
retrofitting. He's doing the houses on both sides of us. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireplace was a mess. We had the chimney taken down and the hole patched. 
That was $650. The block wall in the back yard came down. That was $4,000 to 
replace, but one side is still open and people are just walking through. It's 
scary. You're just sitting there and some weirdo goes through. 
</P>
<P>
 Our house is paid for. I don't want to get a loan and be in debt for 18 years. 
But that's what we've got to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I do feel good about one thing. We were very blessed because no one was 
killed.

VOICES: RECREATION IS HARD WORK; PARKS CENTER DIRECTOR SAYS 'COMMUNITY 
STRONGHOLD' NEEDS VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENDA HOWRY, Glenda Howry has been the recreation director at Jordan Downs 
Recreation Center in Watts for eight years. The only full-time employee at the 
center, she has a staff of eight part-timers who volunteer 10 to 15 hours each. 
The park serves residents of Jordan Downs, especially the 2,600 children under 
15 who live there. On any given day, 200 play at the park, and Howry is trying 
to enlist the community's support to better serve the children. She was 
interviewed by Enrique Lavin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I arrived at the Jordan Downs Recreation Center, it was destroyed. For 
two years it hadn't had a full-time director or been maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 The center hadn't had any major repairs in 30 years. There was no irrigation 
system in the baseball playing field, so it was basically rocks, glass and 
dirt. There was no fencing around the baseball diamond and no bleachers for 
spectators to watch games. The children's play area was a safety hazard -- the 
swing poles had rusted through. The asphalt around the play area was lifted in 
chunks. The gymnasium itself had not been painted in 10 years. The floor of the 
gym had water damage and been eaten by termites. 
</P>
<P>
 I was here two years before they did anything. But after some community 
involvement and a large number of youths participating in park activities, 
which was brought on by a committed part-time staff, the whole center was 
refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of organizations like Kids In Sport (formerly the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation Sports Club for Kids) and our park advisory (a group of 
community volunteers that raise funds for the park), we have enough equipment. 
The only thing we need now is bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 I have my gripes and complaints about the city Recreation and Parks 
Department, and yet they have always been there for us. In our community, which 
needs so much, they've given a lot. Our recreation center was the only center 
open during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 If more people came out of their shells or their offices and saw what was 
actually happening to the inner-city park, officials would see that these parks 
do need extra dollars because they'd see how the parks are serving all these 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 People have to understand that the recreation center in the inner-city is the 
community stronghold. That's the place where the whole community gathers, good 
times, bad times. It's everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The community has grown faster than the park's facilities. In baseball, for 
instance, we had 12 teams on one field. It gets hectic when you have that much 
activity going on in such a small space. I had to turn away 60 to 70 kids 
because we don't have coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true not only with the baseball season but with all our sports 
programs. These are outlets. Watts has no movie theaters, skating rinks, video 
arcades, there's nothing. The only place the children in the community have is 
the local recreation center.  
</P>
<P>
 It's sad we have to turn children away because we don't have the people there 
to implement the programs and the ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a program fanatic. If you keep kids busy with something to do, then 
they'll always be there. So naturally my greatest concern about the facility is 
the lack of adult volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me there's no interest from inside or outside of the community to, 
as they say, "make a difference." People feel that dollars and cents will make 
a difference. However, they don't understand that more so than dollars and 
cents, we need adult role models. 
</P>
<P>
 The children need adults at the parks to help them and encourage them. Many of 
the children are not getting this at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the number of people we serve, one person gets burned out, because 
they're wearing too many hats. You are the sports director, equipment buyer and 
manager, the day care director, you wear many titles and there's no buffer.  
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see people do what they say they are going to do. Money will 
help. But we need people, committed people to come in and teach the community 
how to get involved and be leaders. Not all leaders are born, leaders are 
taught how to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is begging for help.

GAME OF THE WEEK; COUGARS FALL INCHES SHORT OF UPSETTING CARSON, 21-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Crenshaw High's 21-20 loss to Carson Friday afternoon is any indication of 
how the Cougars will fare in City Section play this season, Southern Pacific 
Conference opponents better watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars out-passed, out-rushed, out-hit and out-hustled Carson, but fell 
short on the all important scoreboard, thanks to a questionable fourth-down 
fourth-quarter mark by officials that led to Carson's winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After rallying from a 14-6 fourth-quarter deficit to take a 20-14 lead, 
Crenshaw appeared to have stopped the Colts' Joseph Redmond short of a first 
down on a fourth-and-one play from the Cougars' 17-yard line with 2:16 
remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Once both teams cleared from the middle of the field pileup, however, Carson 
gained the first down by inches.  
</P>
<P>
 "It did not look like they had it," said Crenshaw tailback Farrell Payton. "He 
looked like he was down short of the first down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following a team misconduct penalty against Crenshaw for arguing against the 
first down, Carson needed only one play to tie the score when Redmond blasted 
in from eight yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts then took the lead, 21-20, on an extra-point kick by Rafael Mares. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:51 remaining, Crenshaw tried to come back and drove the ball to the 
Colts' 31-yard line. The Cougars' vision of winning, however, ended when a pass 
bounced off the hands of receiver Kirk Oliver into the arms of Redmond at the 
14-yard line with 1:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good game, but we just had some bad breaks," Crenshaw Coach Robert 
Garrett said. "On our last drive, we knew that we were either going to score (a 
touchdown) or move in close enough for a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw--which outgained Carson in total offense, 380 to 242 yards--took a 
6-0 first quarter lead on a 10-yard run by Payton. Carson responded later in 
the quarter when Llewelyn Miller caught a screen pass from Ramon Rogers and 
scored a touchdown from 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that we get a chance to play them again because we know that we'll be 
ready," Payton said. "It will surely be a good game."

 The football game between Manual Arts and Los Angeles on Friday afternoon 
should have been played at night because the stars were out for the Toilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Brian Beckom topped a host of impressive performances, rushing 
for 163 yards and three touchdowns in Manual Arts' 36-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line controlled the line of scrimmage, all I had to do was pick 
my holes," Beckom said. "Thanks to them, I had a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to Los Angeles' offensive line, quarterback Patrick Regan had 
probably the worst game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Romans failed to get a first down, Regan completed one 
pass, was intercepted twice by Toiler safety Fred Jackson and sacked three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Regan was either hurried or being chased by two and three 
Toiler defenders all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line isn't giving me any time to find receivers or make my reads," Regan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Toiler quarterback Willie Laffitte, he just kept calling Beckom's 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fourth play from scrimmage in the third quarter, Beckom burst up the 
middle untouched for a 53-yard touchdown that boosted Manual Art's lead to 
30-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckom scored on touchdown runs of three and five yards in the first half, the 
second of which gave the Toilers a 23-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story for the Toilers was a defense that made four sacks for minus-54 
yards, blocked two punts and scored a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back Jermaine Estrella tackled Wesley Watson in the end zone to give 
Manual Arts a 16-0 lead in the second quarter and he blocked a punt out of 
bounds at the Romans' four-yard line to set up Beckom's second touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to help the defense as best I can," Estrella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out for this game ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts' final score came on a 10-yard touchdown reception by Tim Boykins 
with 2:22 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Manual Arts 2-2; Los Angeles 1-3

 Locke High football Coach E. C. Robinson said he didn't know that he was 
breaking any rules when he visited the home of an athlete outside the school's 
attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he visited the home of James Tillman, who is playing on the bee 
team at Fremont this season, at the request of the player's father last summer 
to watch a videotape of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit violated California Interscholastic Federation rules despite consent 
of the parent. The Locke football team was placed on probation Sept. 14 for one 
year by the City Section's Interscholastic Athletic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the mistake I made," Robinson said last week. "Next time I'll 
tell the parent to bring the player to come visit Locke instead." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was sparked by allegations from Fremont High that Robinson 
had enticed Pathfinder players to attend Locke with offers of free shoes. Locke 
defeated Fremont, 32-21, for its first victory of the season Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason players want to come to Locke is because they want to be in a 
winning program," Robinson said. 
</P>

 Standing tall -- Despite having a relatively short team, Verbum Dei High won 
the Southern Section Division IV-A basketball title last season. The Eagles 
expect to be even stronger this season with the addition of Jamaal Johnson, a 
6-7 junior transfer from Fremont. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just for kicks -- Former Cal State Los Angeles soccer player Juan Carlos 
Sanchez finished his rookie season with the Anaheim Splash of the Continental 
Indoor Soccer League. Sanchez scored three goals in 12 games for the Western 
Division champion Splash (20-8), which reached the league semifinals. In his 
best game, Sanchez scored two goals in a 12-8 victory over last year's league 
runner-up, the San Diego Sockers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On the run -- Salesian High placed three runners among the top nine to win the 
Division IV title in the Bell-Jeff cross-country invitational at Griffith Park 
Sept. 24.  
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Santillan ran the 2.9-mile course in 15 minutes, 47 seconds. Freshmen 
Marcos Aguirre and Andy Cortez were sixth and ninth, respectively, in 16:22 and 
16:39 for the Mustangs, who totaled 60 points to outdistance Maranatha (104) 
and Flintridge Prep (108) . . . Marisa Avendano of Cal State L.A. finished 
second in the Nebraska Kearney invitational, covering the 5,000-meter course in 
18:23. The sophomore also won the Aztec Invitational in San Diego and the 
Whittier Invitational for the Golden Eagles, who are ranked third in NCAA 
Division II . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Mosqueda, 28, has been named an assistant cross-country and track coach 
at East Los Angeles College. Mosqueda set community college national records in 
the 1,500 and 5,000 meters competing for the Huskies in 1985.

<P>
 Blast from the past -- City football teams have struggled in intersectional 
competition during the first three weeks of the season, winning only five of 29 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the case 30 years ago today, Oct. 2, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fremont team led by quarterback Joe Dawkins, who went on to play at Arizona 
State and with the New York Giants, defeated Santa Barbara, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles High, which went on to share the 1964 City title with Gardena, 
beat San Marcos 39-12. Junior fullback Charles Moch, the defending state 
220-yard dash champion, led the Romans with four touchdowns. The team also 
included All-American UCLA linebacker Mike Ballou and Hal Griffin, a Rhodes 
scholar at UCLA.

FILM CLIPS / DOCUMENTARIANS' DELIGHT: ED WOOD: A MAN, A 'PLAN,' A BANAL . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the high-tech world of '90s Hollywood, special-effects experts are elbowing 
each other out of the way to get at the latest computer, high-tech devices. But 
in the case of Tim Burton's film "Ed Wood," which celebrates the career of 
Edward D. Wood Jr., the cheesiest director of all time, the special effects had 
to mimic the tawdry ones in Wood's own films -- a special challenge for effects 
head Paul Boyington. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely but irresistible subject of Wood, whose claims to fame include 
two of the films mentioned as among the worst ever made -- "Plan 9 From Out 
Space" and "Glen or Glenda" -- as well as the chance to work with Burton, drew, 
in addition to actors Johnny Depp (who plays Wood) and Martin Landau (who plays 
Bela Lugosi), Boyington, one of Hollywood's top special-effects experts, who 
found he had to consciously downplay his expertise in order to mimic the master 
of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start studying this guy's technique and you find out how wacky he really 
was -- that's the appeal and reason for all of this interest," says Boyington, 
41, who is credited as supervisor of special effects on "Ed Wood." His previous 
credits include "Ironweed," "Nightmare on Elm Street II," TV's "Monsters" and 
"The Dennis Miller Show," and music videos for Keith Richards and Megadeth. He 
has earned an Emmy for special effects for 1992's "The Last Halloween," and 
three Clio nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of his usual fare of high-tech models and computer animation, 
Boyington worked with wood models and pie-plate flying saucers for "Ed Wood," 
the props of choice of Wood himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one of the scenes, we actually flew some paper plates and bowls that were 
painted silver," says Boyington -- a real Wood touch. "But we did have some 
saucers cast in resin that we're programmed to make them look like they were 
rocking on a fishing line. Tim (Burton) would always say, 'Make it look 
high-end but keep it looking like Ed Wood.' Ed Wood's technique was sort of 
like the way Picasso took realism and destroyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burton film marks a renaissance of sorts in interest in the career of 
Wood, whose films peaked in the '50s. In fact, there are no fewer than four 
documentaries available on video about the life of the transvestite Wood, who 
died in 1978 -- and one more in the works. His techniques and questionable 
effects certainly loom large in the documentaries, as do his bizarre use of 
stock footage, disastrous dialogue and horrific acting. The films include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ted Newsom's "Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora" for Rhino Video, released in 
video stores Aug. 31 for $19.95; 
</P>
<P>
 * Cult Movies magazine publishers Buddy Barnett and Mike Copner's "On the 
Trail of Ed Wood," the first Wood documentary, which was released in 1990 and 
is available through the magazine; 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Carducci's "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The 'Plan 9' Companion," 
available for $24.95 through mail order or select cult video stores since 1992; 
</P>
<P>
 * A one-hour Ed Wood segment on the BBC's 1991 documentary series "The 
Incredibly Strange Picture Show," available through the Discovery Channel, and 
</P>
<P>
 * Brett R. Thompson's "The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr.," planned for a 
late-November or early-December screening at the Directors Guild and an 
art-house release in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 So which is the best? Depends on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsom's, Carducci's and Thompson's are the most recent. Newsom's has the 
interview with Wood's widow, Kathy. But Thompson says that his will include 
Wood's first Betty Crocker commercial and footage of Wood's disastrous first 
film, "Crossroads of Laredo," which couldn't be released because Wood lost the 
soundtrack.  
</P>
<P>
 Carducci says: "Mine is the most comprehensive. While it's mainly about the 
making of 'Plan 9,' it has a more thorough overview of Ed's life." 
</P>
<P>
 And Newsom's? "We cover Ed Wood from cradle to grave and then some," he says. 
"We also have the women in Ed's life."  
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Buddy Barnett says he and Copner were the first to begin 
the Wood process. "I can't tell you why the delayed interest with Ed Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's the fascination with the seedier or sad side of Hollywood life, 
the combination of dreamer and failure. Or maybe there's a little bit of Ed 
Wood in all of us that we just need to know."*

FILM CLIPS / DOCUMENTARIANS' DELIGHT, CONT.: MISSISSIPPI IS INDELIBLY BURNED 
INTO THEIR MINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elaine Dutka 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics have labeled "Freedom on My Mind," winner of the Grand Jury Award for 
best documentary at the Sundance Film Festival, an antidote to Alan Parker's 
"Mississippi Burning" -- that aesthetically gripping but factually dubious 
civil rights drama released by Orion Pictures six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than portraying the FBI as heroes, this movie -- which plays at the 
Nuart in West Los Angeles through Wednesday -- points the camera at the 
ordinary citizens who participated in the Mississippi Voter Registration 
Project that triggered thousands of arrests and numerous murders between 1961 
and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Mississippi Burning' adopted a very Hollywood approach to the tale," says 
Marilyn Mulford, a producer-director of "Freedom," which was screened last week 
at an event sponsored by the Hollywood Policy Center and the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. "It was essentially a cop story, a search for bodies, 
which overlooked the real heroes who put their lives on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI was made up mostly of local racist Mississippians who didn't consider 
it their job to protect the activists. Witnesses hesitated to come forward for 
fear the FBI would leak their names. The movement didn't trust them at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Field, best known for 1981's "The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter," 
is the docu mentary's other producer-director. Like Mulford, she's a Berkeley 
resident who got her cinematic training at the radical Newsreel Films in the 
late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Lining up development money from the National Endowment for the Humanities, 
Field embarked on the $850,000 documentary in 1989. Taping the Freedom Summer's 
25th reunion provided valuable footage, as did the TV networks, which provided 
archival material. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a four-year period, Field and Mulford interviewed dozens of activists -- 
black sharecroppers and organizers, as well as white college students bused 
south to capture the nation's attention. The low-profile Bob Moses, "the Gandhi 
of the Mississippi movement," agreed to participate. USC professor-playwright 
Endesha Ida Mae Holland, a former prostitute whose activism led hard-line 
segregationists to kill her mother, also made the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles earthquake and a New York City ice storm delayed the printing 
of the optical track and forced cancellation of the first Sundance screening in 
Park City, Utah, last January. Since then, however, there's been hardly a 
hitch: Film festivals came calling; critics raved; a CD-ROM is a possibility 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 That Mississippi summer, Field is convinced, was a watershed in American 
history. The grass-roots organization succeeded in registering more than 80,000 
members of the multiracial Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and though 
President Johnson refused to seat the group at the Atlantic City Democratic 
convention, its efforts paved the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people have come up to me saying that this was the first time they saw 
the races working together," Field says. "Life today is very ethnically 
divided. Betrayed by the federal government, the smartest people of our 
generation moved outside the system."*

FILM CLIPS / 'WILD BUNCH': IN 25 MORE YEARS, IT'LL BE G-RATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a year, Warner Bros. has been wrestling with the same problem: 
How to re-release a film with the same rating it received in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is Sam Peckinpah's violent Western classic "The Wild Bunch." The 
film's MPAA rating at its release was R but is now NC-17. The sticking point, 
the MPAA says, is the content of 10 scenes -- reportedly "character scenes," 
not ones of violence or sex -- that Warners sources say were in the film when 
it received an R rating but were later trimmed to shorten the film. And those 
cuts followed six minutes snipped by Peckinpah himself because of their 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Warners has restored the director's cut, which is already available in video 
stores. But it wants to put back the 10 other scenes before the film's 
theatrical re-release, which was to have been this year to coincide with its 
25th anniversary. Now, because of the ratings snafu, the re-release is planned 
for sometime next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Warners sources say they are considering releasing the lengthened film with an 
R rating. The MPAA's position is that Warners can release the film as it was 
shown in 1969 with an R or add the 10 scenes and accept an NC-17. The MPAA's 
decision, Warners sources say, seems all the more intractable in light of the R 
rating given to "Natural Born Killers" -- a film Warners considers much more 
violent than "The Wild Bunch."  
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the thorny situation, Warner sources say, is that none of the 
parties involved in the 1969 rating decision are still around to know if the 10 
scenes were in the film when it received the R. 
</P>
<P>
 That's irrelevant, says MPAA spokeswoman Barbara Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is how the film was released in theaters under that original 
rating," she says. "If they (want) an R, they can re-release it as they did in 
1969; it has to be exactly the same." The MPAA says it can't recall a studio's 
defying the MPAA and putting a different rating on a rated film, and Dixon 
would not say what repercussions there might be.*

 Dorsey 27, Washington 13--Dorsey used a balanced running attack to overcome a 
one-man show by Washington's Dennis Northcutt and beat the Generals at 
Washington.

 Dorsey running backs Jamell Gordon, Raymont Skaggs and Bervick Deculius 
combined for 214 rushing yards. Gordon stood out among the Don backs with 84 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as his Generals fell to their conference rival Dorsey, Northcutt, the 
5-11, 145-pound junior, stood tall against Dorsey's big, touted defense, 
rushing for 108 yards in 19 carries. He also scored on an 81-yard kickoff 
return, which tied the score at 7-7 in the first quarter. 
</P>

88 yards for a touchdown, but it was not enough to keep Eagle Rock from winning 
its fourth consecutive game, a Northern Conference contest at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Rock immediately cut Lincoln's lead to 8-6 when fullback Marco Hernandez 
scored on a 48-yard run on the Eagles' first possession. Joe Albarran 's 
32-yard field goal put Eagle Rock ahead, 9-8, and from there the defense for 
both teams took over.

 Belmont 0, Verdugo Hills 0--The Dons and the Sentinels seemed to have their 
backs to the line of scrimmage more than they faced it as they racked up 
numerous penalties in the scoreless tie at Belmont. In one drive in which the 
Sentinels emerged with few penalties, running back Fabian Villa had runs of 17 
and 16 yards to bring Belmont tantalizingly close to the end zone at the

Conference game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders, who had not beaten Garfield in four seasons, scored their 
first touchdown on Ricky Lloyd's one-yard run in the second quarter. Michael 
Adams caught a 29-yard pass from junior quarterback Robert Loera to highlight

 From mid-August to mid-September, nearly 32,000 Cubans set off in makeshift 
rafts and leaky boats, heading for America. They left behind the oldest and the 
youngest, the women, the underground entrepreneurs who are surviving, if not 
prospering, in Cuba's minimal economy. The rafters were mostly young men, 
mostly from urban neighborhoods, where battered, filigreed buildings are 
overcrowded but rent free, where the food lines are long and the choices are 
few, where the revolution is down but not out, and where there is, once again, 
no exit.

PERFORMING ARTS; AFTER 10 YEARS WITH BELLA LEWITZKY AND 10 YEARS WITH HER OWN 
DANCE COMPANY, LORETTA LIVINGSTON REFLECTS ON HER CAREER -- BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE 
ASKED.; A DANCER'S LIFE, BY THE DECADES 
</P>

<P>
 Loretta Livingston's career seems to happen in decades. A dancer-choreographer 
who first became widely known during her 10 years with the Bella Lewitzky Dance 
Company, she's now about to mark the 10th anniversary of her own troupe, 
Loretta Livingston & Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 But with milestones come mixed feelings. "It was not an anniversary that I had 
intended to observe," says Livingston, 44, seated in the West Los Angeles 
studio where she rehearses. "I like what I haven't done yet. My enthusiasm is 
always for where I'm going and I didn't want to take the time to stop and look 
back. It didn't seem like I'd done enough to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet persuaded and encouraged by her board of directors' invitation to pick a 
program of works that she'd like to see again, the choreographer changed her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Livingston has indeed done a lot. Not only has she earned a 
reputation as a skilled and lyrical performer, but she's also one of the few 
artists who have managed to sustain a modern dance company in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 That company -- which Livingston co-founded with dancer-husband David Plettner 
in 1984 -- has been recognized with acclaim and honors, including multiple 
awards at the Southern California-oriented Lester Horton Dance Awards in both 
1992 and 1993. Loretta Livingston & Dancers' 10th-anniversary concert takes 
place at the Japan America Theatre on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the process of putting together an anniversary show has 
provided Livingston with an occasion for reflection. "I thought that when I got 
to a certain age, my age, that I would be grown up, that all the mysteries of 
life would be revealed to me, that everything would fall into its place," she 
says. "Life would be happy and I would move forward, an incredibly rich and 
wise person." 
</P>
<P>
 But the more Livingston lives and works, the more she realizes that's not the 
way it is. "I hit this age and I know less than I did before," she says. "All 
life is a mystery. My friends continue to die of AIDS. My family members are 
starting to go. At the exact minute when I thought life was supposed to 
synchronize into its grace, it flipped on me -- and right at the time that I 
was having my 10-year slump." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston has made her choreographic mark with a dual focus on matters both 
intimate and global. Many of her dances put the balancing act of emotional 
intimacy under scrutiny, yet she also frequently addresses historical and 
ecological topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired in part by Hiroshima survivors' journals, Livingston's "Don't Fall, 
Pomegranate" (1989), for example, is a stark solo that resounds with images of 
Apocalypse. Similarly, "A Window in the Passage" (1991) is a four-part dance 
with a loosely narrative focus on people adjusting to a new environment. It was 
influenced, in part, by Livingston's response to the Persian Gulf War, which 
took place as she was shaping the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paper/Scissors/Rock" (1986), on the other hand, is an emotionally intricate 
love pas de deux for the choreographer and Plettner. 
</P>
<P>
 To Livingston, though, there's a connection between the two types of dances. 
"For me, the threads of the big geological-archeological concerns is the macro 
metaphor for the micro that we go through, the chronology for each of us as a 
human. They are two opposites perhaps, but to me they're not polarized." 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the 10th-anniversary concert program are "Balances" (1983), a solo 
using delicate feats of balance as a metaphor, "Paper/Scissors/Rock" and "The 
Archives" (1991), a dance that features a gallery of characters who portray the 
history of world cultures. A total of eight dances are on the bill, including 
the premiere of the duet "Balances, Too." 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary bill includes more of Livingston's intimate works, though 
that's partly because the choreographer's more ecological dances tend to be 
epic and not suited to a mixed-bill format. "I chose works that are mostly 
about relationships," Livingston says. "A lot of them are smaller works, duets 
and trios. They were the ones that went into the humanness of us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston's concern with the environment may be partly attributable to a life 
spent entirely in California. Born in Paso Robles, she moved to Los Angeles to 
study with Lewitzky and to attend CalArts in 1971. Livingston joined the 
Lewitzky company in 1973 and began to tour as she completed her studies at 
CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, she began to take on more prominent roles. And by the time 
Livingston met Plettner in 1980 -- when the Lewitzky company toured North 
Carolina and he auditioned to join the group -- she was one of its key artists. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Plettner joined the Lewitzky company, but Livingston ended up leaving in 1983, 
and Plettner soon thereafter. "My real school was 10 years on the road with 
Bella, being apprenticed to a master," she says. "I left because I needed to 
grow in a particular way that I could not unless I was on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 The parting was more than amicable and Lewitzky has remained a staunch 
Livingston supporter. "We worked together in the leaving," Livingston says. 
"She understands because she did it." 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, in 1984, Livingston and Plettner formed Loretta Livingston & 
Dancers. "It was one foot in front of the other," Livingston says. "Make work. 
Ask dancers that you know to be in the work. Get enough work together so that 
you can do a concert. Put on your first concert. Pay it off for a year. Do it 
again next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hardly an easy process. "I was paying for everything myself, 
putting it on credit cards, going through inexpensive venues," Livingston says. 
"I didn't intentionally not look down the road, but I was fully absorbed in the 
simple task of trying to do the first steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston's goal was to give herself an artistic base. "Forming a company was 
about having a home for my work," she says. "In the beginning, it was often my 
colleagues in the Lewitzky company who would give me their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first five years were quite foundational," Livingston continues. "There 
was a little bit less permanency (to the company roster), but after that, it 
began to be stable." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the company's six dancers are Livingston, Plettner, Madeline 
Soglin, Michael Mizerany, Lynne DeMarco and Stacia Voytek). All have been with 
the choreographer for at least five years, except Voytek, who came on board two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston also has had long-standing working relationships with lighting 
designer Doc Ballard, costume and scenic designer Martha Ferrara and stage 
manager Kathy Ogilvie. She has worked on many occasions with composers Jeffrey 
Rona and Larry A. Attaway, both of whom are represented on the anniversary 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Her key collaborator, though, has always been Plettner, who is also the 
troupe's administrator. "Without David, I would not have a company," says 
Livingston, who, with Plettner, lives in downtown L.A. "He has built the 
organization absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Partners Livingston and Plettner are now marking the 10-year anniversary of 
their company with both trepidation and a sense of accomplishment. "The 10-year 
mark seems to be the make or break," she says. "I have observed many 
choreographers who just can't do it after 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Livingston herself went through a burnout in recent months. "After we 
premiered 'The Grandma Moses Project' in 1993, I was tired," she says. "I 
didn't bounce back the way that I had after all my other premieres. By the end 
of the summer, I realized that this was the 10-year slump." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking some time off, Livingston was ready to face a second decade. And 
Plettner sees the occasion as a chance to map out where they go from here. 
"This 10th anniversary has been an occasion to take stock," he says, speaking 
by phone after returning from a dance company business trip. "As an 
organization, we've been successful and fortunate. On the other hand, there are 
still challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Loretta Livingston & Dancers continues to struggle with being a 
dance company in a town that's not traditionally regarded as a dance center. 
"We're beginning to understand that being a West Coast artist presents special 
challenges," says Plettner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an aesthetic, social and political agenda which is shared by most 
tastemakers on the East Coast. It's a narrow agenda and Loretta's work -- as 
with other West coast artists -- doesn't usually fit it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel well-understood on the West Coast, but you need to tour to survive. 
So we're beginning to look to Europe and Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, here at home, Livingston is creating new work again. The 
10th-anniversary concert includes the premiere of "Balances, Too," a duet for 
Livingston and Soglin, set to excerpts from Pablo Neruda's "Book of Questions" 
-- the acclaimed writer's final work, a sometimes aphoristic and philosophical 
tome written entirely in the question format. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also looking forward to presenting a new full-length dance about L.A. 
in the spring of 1996. "Tales From the Plate, Moving North" will be set to 
music by Murielle Hamilton, with whom Livingston worked on 1993's "The Grandma 
Moses Project." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most of all, Livingston anticipates the wisdom that supposedly can 
come with age. 
</P>
<P>
 "My senior-citizen dance class members laughed with such mirth and wisdom when 
I told them that I thought I would know the answers to the universe at age 45," 
she says. "They know that they'll never know either. And that's the joke of 
life. You never get to know." Vital Stats

ART; COMMENTARY; BEYOND THE BUZZ OF ART; JOHN M. MILLER'S MINIMALIST BUT LOOPY 
WORKS OFFER A WELLSPRING OF EXPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Beginning with Mondrian, geometric abstract painting has principally 
functioned as a secular assertion of a Renaissance ideal: Art was considered to 
be a vehicle for the redemption of human perfection, which had been destroyed 
in mankind's fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Balance, precision, harmony, holistic order -- these were the rigorous 
ingredients specific to painting that abstractionists thought necessary for 
achieving the goal. And because they were abstract, rather than figurative, 
geometric paintings were thought to be generic enough to allow any viewer to 
enter into a dialogue with the redemptive concept. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of this tradition, the geometric abstract paintings of John M. Miller 
have an astonishing proposition to make. Balance, precision, harmony, holistic 
order and the rest are fine, but what does one do with idiosyncrasy, 
irrationality and other less-than-normative conditions, which are nonetheless 
integral to life? 
</P>
<P>
 Banish them? Corral and tame them? Subject them to homogenizing assimilation? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Miller's paintings so mesmerizingly do, give those eccentricities free 
rein to participate in their own redemptive exercise? 
</P>
<P>
 At 55, Miller is among the most important abstract painters working today. 
He's at the top of his form, too, as evidenced by two visually lush, 
conceptually sophisticated recent paintings included in "Plane/Structures," a 
survey of current abstraction in L.A. on view at the Otis Gallery, Otis College 
of Art and Design. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will travel to six more sites around the country during the next 18 
months. Meanwhile, Miller also anchors a second survey, titled "In Plain Sight: 
Abstract Painting in Los Angeles," organized for the Blue Star Art Space in San 
Antonio, Tex., where it's currently installed. Together, these surveys amply 
demonstrate his stature as a painter of the first rank. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller brings to geometric abstraction a perceptual rigor essential to the 
best of the genre. Yet, the loopy eccentricity of his paintings ratchets their 
level of accomplishment up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
 The paintings are composed simply. One or more panels of raw, unpainted canvas 
each features a regular, painted pattern of angled bars. Single rows of longer 
bars alternate with double rows of shorter bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has been working with this basic format for 21 years. If it sounds 
simplistic or repetitive -- well, you've probably never seen his paintings. 
There's endless subtle variety within the established format. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing Miller's paintings is no mean feat, either, and not just because he 
shows his work in public only irregularly. Rather, these are canvases that are 
exceedingly demanding of a viewer's time. 
</P>
<P>
 A cursory look at a Miller painting yields little but a buzz of visual noise. 
Many who breeze by, merely glancing out of the corner of their mind, are likely 
to mutter, "Oh, Op art," and quickly move on. But the quality of these 
paintings is such that protracted looking yields commensurate pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same with Miller's color, which verges on the indescribable. In the 
show at Otis, one painting includes a panel of black bars abutting a panel of 
equally dark hue, except the latter is made from black magna paint mixed with 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the artist mixes red or green into the black, and sometimes the bars 
are painted white with a slight tint of color. Either way, only protracted 
looking allows the submerged color to float to the surface of your conscious 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Otis painting pairs a black half with one that glows with golden 
ocher bars. The sharp difference in the two sides is oddly reconciled at the 
edges where the two panels meet and black bars join with ocher ones. There, 
each bar of color seems to slide effortlessly into the other, while the 
pictorial space magically merges shallowness with depth. 
</P>
<P>
 These seemingly simple paintings get more and more complicated the longer you 
look at them. For instance, both rows of bars in Miller's paintings are tilted, 
from the upper left to the lower right. Yet, the angle of the single bars is 
steeper and more precipitous than that of the double bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the kicker: The angles of the big bars and the small ones are at 59 
degrees and 29 degrees on the diagonal, respectively. Because a painting is a 
rectangle, with horizontal and vertical edges at 90 degrees, you might 
logically expect the painted bars to be tilted at 60 degrees and 30 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's slight deviance from the expected norm is just enough to gently 
animate the painting's surface, at a perceptual level hovering just below the 
threshold of cogent grasp. (In this, the structure is like his use of 
indescribable color.) The resulting pattern exudes a perceptual liveliness that 
would be lacking with more evenly divided angles. 
</P>
<P>
 The paintings' visual imagery also echoes the physical weave of cotton thread 
of the canvas. The double bars create a compositional movement exactly opposite 
the direction established by the bigger single bars. Visually, the resulting 
crisscross movement seems to knit the painting together into a stable whole.  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the paradoxical creation of visual stability using 
eccentrically tilted and colored bars endows Miller's paintings with a 
philosophical dimension of bracing intelligence. The post-Renaissance motif of 
painting on a flat, portable, rectangular surface is peculiar to Western 
culture. Traditionally, a rectangle's natural emphasis on verticality and 
horizontality carries weight as a schematic approximation for an upright figure 
standing vertically on the horizontal plane of the earth. It reflects the 
viewer, standing before the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The format also presents the viewer as an earthly reflection of a heavenly 
creator. The intersection of vertical with horizontal, expanded to spiritual 
dimensions, works as a sign for the intersection of a supernatural with a 
natural realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's eccentrically tilted bars operate within those standard, age-old 
schemes -- as does most geometric abstract painting of the 20th Century. Yet, 
his work also gently tips over those conventions. Dazzlingly precise and 
exquisitely controlled, Miller's paintings also mischievously revel in an 
oblique irrational space -- which is, of course, the messy place where life is 
actually lived. 
</P>
<P>
 These are geometric abstractions that seek neither to banish nor to tame. 
Instead, they search for generosity, with which everyone might be embraced.

 Bargains? At Disneyland ? Although certainly not your first stop for discount 
shopping, it is possible to escape the Happiest Place on Earth without being 
the Poorest Person in the Universe. Some tips: Getting In  
</P>
<P>
 By now, everyone who lives in Southern California probably knows that one can 
take advantage of discount admissions during the slow season, a policy 
Disneyland started in 1991. This year both children and adults pay the $23 
admission (regular-season admission is $31 for adults, $25 for children), a 
rate guaranteed through the Christmas season. There are no discounts, however, 
for parking, which costs $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Disneyphiles take advantage of the $199 annual passport option, which 
guarantees admission to the park for a year, plus preferred parking and 
merchandise and food discounts. For bargain hunters, the $99 passport is good 
for 338 days a year, with holidays and other peak days excluded. An annual 
parking pass is an extra $25. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go four times (a year) it's a deal," says Chris Massey of Laguna 
Beach, who bought the $99 annual passes for his family. He estimates that he 
and his wife bring their young daughters to the park at least 14 times a year. 
"We come over just for breakfast and ride a few rides until the crowds get 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 While you'll miss the "Main Street Electrical Parade" and the fireworks 
display by hitting Disneyland during the off-season, the "Lion King" parade 
still runs down Main Street twice a day, the "Beauty and the Beast" show is 
presented four times in the late afternoon and evening, and "Fantasmic!" is 
featured twice each evening on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other hitch to visiting the park after summertime is that it is also 
the time for renovating major rides. On a recent visit, It's a Small World was 
down for its annual repairs. To avoid shattering disappointment, a preliminary 
phone call to the park is advised to ensure that the kids' favorite attraction 
will be active that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Disneyland during the week is always advisable, but for those who can 
go only on the weekend, try Sundays -- crowds aren't as heavy as they are on 
Saturday. And get there early. The park opens at 9 a.m., with lines getting 
long by noon. Eating  
</P>
<P>
 Although invisible to the naked eye, Disneyland does house a picnic area for 
families looking to avoid doling out too many Disney Dollars. Tucked behind the 
bushes just west of the main gate are about 15 aluminum picnic tables and 
benches, soft-drink and juice machines and a line of lockers for storing 
coolers and picnic baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a dollar to rent a locker, but it pays for families such as the 
Clarks from Utah, whose Bonnie Clark says, "We have big families so we have to 
bring our own food." Clark, who made the trip with her family and her 
brother's, fed 12 people and figures she saved about $50 by serving up ham 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nagaishi family, from the San Gabriel Valley, were pleased to spend $30 
for lunch for two parents and four kids in Tomorrowland's Terrace, where a 
Terrace Combination -- a cheeseburger, fries and a large drink -- goes for 
$5.70. There are also $2.99 children's specials sprinkled throughout the park, 
featuring hot dogs, burgers or even spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 A fruit salad in a sit-down restaurant can run anywhere from $5.25 to $6.95, 
depending on where you are in the park, but fresh seasonal fruit is available 
from food carts for about a dollar apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The best deal for sweets is the 10-cent candy stick, which comes in a variety 
of flavors and can last at least 20 minutes apiece. Shopping  
</P>
<P>
 There's no getting around it, you're going to leave Disneyland with something 
bearing mouse ears. Once you've accepted this, you can find some reasonably 
priced items. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mickey Mouse autograph book ($3.95) and pen (the cheapest, $2.10), combine 
for an interactive souvenir. Once the kids have the book and pen, they're free 
to pester the many Disney characters roaming Main Street and Toon Town 
throughout the day for their autographs. And if the kids are lucky, maybe 
they'll get a story told by either Peter Pan or Mary Poppins, thrown in at no 
extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A basic Mickey Mouse watch runs $21.95, while the requisite mouse-ear caps are 
$4.95. Postcards sell for 25 cents. And, yes, there is such a thing as a sale: 
Some souvenir shops mark down items by as much as 50% when they get new 
merchandise. In Fantasyland's Disney Villain shop, for instance, mugs featuring 
Ursula, the octopus villainess from "The Little Mermaid," recently were marked 
down from $12.99 to $6.99. 
</P>

CONTENTIOUS WEDDING ONLY PART OF IRVINE FAMILY FEUD; SOCIETY: JOAN IRVINE SMITH 
AND EX-HUSBAND DISCUSS SON'S ESTRANGEMENT, WHICH HE SAYS COST HIM $100 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To hear Morton Irvine Smith tell the story, he gave up $100 million for love. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Huntington Beach mutual funds salesman, a presumed heir to one of 
Southern California's wealthiest founding clans, would not be denied the "love 
of my life" even if Mom couldn't deal with his fiancee's working-class Boston 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when young Morton would not cancel his date at the altar with Marianne 
Campbell two weeks ago, Orange County's Joan Irvine Smith -- according to 
Morton -- simply voided her son's inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, according to Morton, mirrors King Edward's celebrated abdication of 
power and wealth to marry the love his life, actress Wallis Warfield Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the very private walls of his parents' estates in San Juan 
Capistrano and Middleburg, Va., they are telling a much different story. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview, Joan Irvine Smith confirms only one element of the story: 
"that it (the marriage) will be a continuing cause of estrangement of Morton 
from the rest of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that she comes from a middle-class family has nothing to do with 
it," said Smith, comfortably sunk in a living-room chair with bare feet propped 
up on a puffy ottoman. "It was how she conducted herself over the 10 years I've 
known her. She was very antagonistic toward my relationship with my son." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the remainder of the tale, she says, "I trust that many will put as 
much credence in this story as in the periodic rumors that 'Elvis lives'. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 And she takes particular umbrage at the fact that Morton invited the National 
Enquirer to cover his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morton's actions have now created the public spectacle of talk show debate 
and continued media attention, which have caused even greater strain on family 
relationships than his marriage to Marianne Campbell." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morton's father, Morton Whister (Cappy) Smith, the real story 
could be taken straight from the script of the movie "Arthur," with young 
Morton playing the lead role of a carefree, carousing party-animal who has done 
his best to embarrass the family. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a role, his dad suggests, that Morton has played better than Dudley 
Moore did on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid is nothing more than a bum," the elder Smith said, adding that "the 
boy" struck a fatal blow in their father-son relationship when a wedding guest 
told the National Enquirer that Cappy Smith did not attend because he feared 
being cut off from his ex-wife's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you act common, you are a commoner," said the legendary, 79-year-old 
horseman who runs his own horse breeding operation. "Nobody with an ounce of 
sense would do that to his family. As far as I'm concerned he's not my son. I 
don't love him. I think he's a s---." 
</P>
<P>
 For a family whose members closely guard their privacy, the public airing of 
such family matters is unusual but far from unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Joan Irvine Smith has fought very public battles with the Irvine 
Co. -- the vast barony founded by her great-grandfather -- in attempts to 
protect her inheritance. In her last legal bout with the company, she won a 
$149-million judgment for the family's share of the real estate empire sold in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the family's most intriguing drama, however, played out in 1959 but 
still remains a mystery in some quarters. The death of Myford Plum Irvine, then 
president of the Irvine Co., is known as the "double-bullet suicide." His body 
was found in the family ranch house with shotgun blasts in the abdomen and 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years after the fact, rumors continue to circulate that Irvine had 
rung up large Las Vegas gambling debts at the time and that they might have 
been somehow related to his death. State Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, a former 
Irvine Co. executive, said the prominent executive's death became the subject 
of national speculation, particularly after a coroner ruled it a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a family who owned one-fifth of an entire county," 
Ferguson said. "No one's ever written the real story about them. If it were, it 
would be one of the most interesting stories ever written about life in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is a family whose patriarchs and matriarchs have schmoozed 
with Presidents, foreign dignitaries and movie stars, while largely avoiding 
the glitz and other trappings of celebrity, not to mention the unflattering 
focus of the tabloid press. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that concern for discretion and decorum appeared to go out the window 
last month, when Morton set off a full-scale family feud by proceeding down the 
aisle with Campbell, a Long Beach nurse, trailed by Enquirer photographers and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said he doesn't regret the decision to allow the tabloid to cover the 
event. He said he received no payment for the story, which Enquirer reporter 
Dani Cestaro described as having "romance and everything our readers are 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be fun to have them there," Morton said of the paper. "I 
wasn't looking for the cheap shot. . . . I thought middle-class America would 
eat this up." 
</P>
<P>
 What has "sickened" him, however, in the days since his Sept. 16 nuptials was 
the article's reference to his father and the purported reason that he, like 
his mother, did not attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father is like a God to me," Morton said. "He is the definition of a 
gentleman. He is the finest rider who ever lived and the world knows it. I had 
no idea about the severity with which (the Enquirer) was approaching this 
thing. I told them that my dad was not to be discussed. . . . I wonder whether 
my kids will ever get to know my father now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and father, however, contend that the Enquirer's presence was done out 
of sheer spite, a reflection of her youngest child's "immaturity." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no conception of what marriage and commitment means," Joan Irvine 
Smith said, herself four times divorced. "He likes to throw his weight and name 
around, and he really has never done anything on his own. And some of this 
would become embarrassing to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morton doesn't listen to anyone," she said. "I've worked hard in my life. I 
didn't sleep until noon and go out and drink all night. I was not in favor of 
any marriage for him right now, particularly not this marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cappy Smith: "He grew up lying around the pool with a beer in his hand 
nursing a hangover and waiting to start another one. How long would you like to 
watch that? Every man who has a son hopes for something great. He's been a 
thorn in my side. He's the black sheep of the family all right, with a big bell 
hanging 'round his neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Morton is the only child from Cappy Smith's 16-year marriage to Joan, 
which ended in divorce in 1979, the father said he feels closer to Joan's two 
other sons, born during her previous marriages to Charles Swinden and Russell 
S. Penniman III. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other boys (James Irvine Swinden and Russell S. Penniman IV) graduated 
from good colleges," Cappy Smith said. "Russell went to the Naval Academy, and 
Jimmy went to Wharton Business School. . . . All (Morton) carried was a 
bellyful of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton admits that he's long been "accused of having too much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the dinner table, I could always tell a good story," he said, laughing. He 
said the family has not come to appreciate how hard he has worked to become a 
successful mutual fund salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a bigger kick in the teeth than them saying, 'We don't think 
enough of your character to be (at the wedding),' " Morton said. "If my family 
were there, none of this would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 For Morton's parents, though, their son's character was not the only 
consideration in their decision not to bless the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Smith said Campbell's middle-class roots had "nothing to do" with the 
family's disapproval. "You can be from (working-class) Boston and conduct 
yourself like a lady. It had nothing to do with her background. It was how she 
conducted herself over the 10 years I've known her." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Smith and Campbell, a 30-year-old pediatric oncology nurse at Long 
Beach Memorial Medical Center, have both spoken of difficult times in their 
relationship. And it didn't improve even after Irvine Smith took Campbell on a 
chauffeur-driven shopping spree in Beverly Hills shortly after they met. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who has likened the venture to the make-over in the movie "Pretty 
Woman," said Irvine Smith wanted to buy her a new wardrobe because Morton's 
mother "didn't like the way I dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Smith said Campbell was generally ungrateful. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after, Irvine Smith said she always hoped that the relationship 
would somehow "go off the track" it was on. But, she said, the "last straw" 
came at a family Christmas dinner three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the whole clan assembled at the Oaks ranch in San Juan Capistrano, 
including family matriarch Athalie Clarke, Irvine Smith said her three sons 
stood -- one by one -- to pay tribute to her with toasts. When it was Morton's 
turn, Irvine Smith said, Campbell "rose from her seat and shouted, 'God dammit, 
Morton, stop brown-nosing your mother.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Irvine Smith said, the room "fell dead silent, and Morton 
struggled to complete his toast. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said his mother's version of events is inaccurate at best. At the time, 
Morton said, he and Campbell were seated at a side table when she made a 
private quip. Morton said that it was not disparaging in any way toward his 
mother and that Campbell did not stand, nor did she shout, as his mother 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, I didn't even know this was a big deal," Morton said. "You're talking 
about someone who is paranoid here. My mother is the type of person who thinks 
there are cameras everywhere and guns are pointed at her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets her information from a network of untruths that are forming her 
reality about me. I have nothing against my parents. I love my parents. In a 
lot of ways, I think I'm just like my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, Irvine Smith has been listening as the family feud has 
become public. It's been the subject of radio talk shows where gossip jockeys 
have been trading quips at the expense of the Irvine family name. 
</P>
<P>
 And local residents, some familiar with the family and its long history in 
Orange County, have been listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ferguson said he was somewhat taken aback when he heard of Irvine 
Smith's reaction to her son's determination to go his own way and against her 
wishes, because of "her own history" as fiercely independent in personal and 
business affairs. "This is out of character for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought she would be proud of her kid for cutting out on his 
own," Ferguson said. "She certainly hasn't lived life according to society's 
established rules. There may be more to this than we need to know, or have a 
right to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has had limited contact with Irvine Smith, former Irvine Mayor 
Sally Anne Sheridan said the story doesn't surprise her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not somebody I would consider to be a warm and fuzzy person," Sheridan 
said. "She wants what she wants. A lot of rich people own and disown their 
kids. When you parallel their lives with other wealthy people from Newport 
Beach or other places, I don't think it would be much different." 
</P>
<P>
 How concerned is Irvine Smith about how this is playing in Orange County 
society circles? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully," she said, "people will see this for what it is. A lot of people I 
have heard from don't understand how any son could attack his mother over 
personal differences." Who's Who in the Family Tree

wool on a large scale. Bought out partners in 1876, 13 years before Orange

horseback riding with her grandfather. At age 24 replaced her mother on the 
Irvine Co. board of directors and immediately began questioning management. 
Transformed the family company into a sleek corporate entity, then sold her 
21.1% interest and bought 11% interest in the purchasing company. Sold that 
stock and almost immediately went to court to fight for triple the money that 
other company stockholders were getting. Settled with her mother for $255.8

U.S. STRIKES DEAL WITH JAPAN TO OPEN MARKETS; TRADE: BREAKTHROUGHS IN FOUR KEY 
AREAS ARE HAILED AS A GENUINE MILESTONE. BUT TOKYO'S FAILURE TO AGREE ON 
AUTO-RELATED EXPORTS COULD STILL LEAD TO SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic end to a tense round of trade diplomacy, the United States and 
Japan reached a series of agreements Saturday that Clinton Administration 
officials said would crack open the lucrative Japanese market for four major 
U.S. industries and generate billions of dollars in new exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty hours of overnight negotiations, concluded only minutes before senior 
Japanese officials were about to return to Tokyo, produced surprising 
breakthroughs in every area under discussion with one significant exception: 
The two sides could not come to terms over autos and auto parts. These exports 
account for two-thirds of America's $60-billion annual trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 With no progress achieved on automotive issues -- a senior trade official said 
the Japanese "weren't ready to be serious" -- U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said he would take steps that could lead to the imposition of sanctions 
on Japan. The penalties, if imposed, would be intended to force Japan to 
increase its limited purchases of replacement parts made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said "it is 
extremely regrettable" that the United States decided to take steps toward 
sanctions over the auto parts issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were insisting that we relax our auto inspections," Murayama said. "But 
as we cannot relax safety (standards), we were not able to yield." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the auto parts impasse was overshadowed by the progress made on other 
fronts, as government officials and business executives cheered the sudden 
turnabout in an angry relationship that had been sliding toward the brink of a 
trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements will make it easier for insurance companies to do business in 
Japan, for manufacturers of medical and telecommunications equipment to sell 
their products to the Japanese government, and for makers of flat glass, used 
in automobiles and construction, to enter a lucrative market that had been 
virtually closed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal for the United States and a good deal for Japan," 
observed Kantor, a view he said was shared by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of U.S. officials and outside trade experts, Saturday's 
breakthroughs represent a genuine milestone. After nearly 15 months of 
bickering, the two countries, whose trade relations produce ripple effects that 
span the globe, have agreed on a system to measure the success of foreign firms 
in gaining access to the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has long been considered one of the most difficult markets to enter. 
Despite its government's assurances to the contrary, U.S. trade officials say, 
the door is barricaded by a combination of bureaucratic regulations, unofficial 
standards and other, often invisible, barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what U.S. officials have characterized as a history of backsliding by 
Japan on previous trade agreements, a buoyant Kantor said he is confident the 
new accords will stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "These agreements will not only work, they're results-oriented, they're 
tangible, they're concrete," said Kantor, who presided over nonstop 
negotiations that began at 3 p.m. EDT Friday and concluded at 11:05 a.m. 
Saturday. "They'll be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade official and frequent critic of Japanese 
trade practices, said the agreements "put U.S.-Japanese relations on a new 
plane. It's a win-win proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Prestowitz said the agreements should halt the dramatic rise in the value of 
the yen against the dollar, a phenomenon that has made Japanese products 
increasingly expensive in the United States. The Japanese currency began 
climbing to new highs against the dollar when a U.S.-Japanese summit fell apart 
amid bitter recriminations last February. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, Japan "gets credit internationally for being 
forward-looking and flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Another prominent critic of Japanese trade practices, House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), said "another wedge was driven into the Japanese 
market" as a result of the new accords. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear when the U.S. really stands up, Japan opens up," Gephardt said. 
Even so, he added, the agreements "still only address a small percentage of our 
trade problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior members of the Japanese delegation, Trade Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, headed home immediately after the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief meeting with Japanese reporters, Hashimoto said the agreements 
would help smooth often-difficult U.S.-Japanese relations across the board. The 
goodwill should spill beyond trade to encompass political and diplomatic 
issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials emphasized that the agreements avoid setting specific 
"numerical targets," an initial U.S. objective that Tokyo had vowed for months 
to block. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said the accords will make it possible to gauge the 
openness of Japanese markets. "The Japanese government for the first time is 
committed to use objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate 
the progress made under these agreements," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse over measuring progress has been the biggest hurdle during the 15 
months since Clinton visited Tokyo in July, 1993, and launched the current 
round of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final hours of their talks Saturday, the two sides agreed there must be 
"progress in the value and share" of foreign goods and services in the Japanese 
market, with a goal of achieving "over the medium term, a significant increase 
in access and sales." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no difference of opinion as to what that means," Kantor said. "The 
idea of 'progress in value and share' cannot be misinterpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the agreements will work as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 * Japan will open to foreign manufacturers the process by which it purchases 
telecommunications equipment, an $11-billion market in which Japanese companies 
get 95% of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 * In government purchases of medical equipment, Japan will allow fair bidding 
and provide a complaint mechanism for foreign firms that feel they have been 
treated unfairly. The medical equipment sector is dominated by the United 
States, which accounts for 52% of global sales of such products but only 23% of 
the Japanese market. Increasing that share to 40% would generate an $440 
million more a year in sales, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Japan will reform its insurance regulatory system, introduce unspecified 
liberalizing measures and strengthen its antitrust policies. The changes are 
designed to open the world's second-largest insurance market in which foreign 
companies account for only 3% of all policies sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Japan will open its $4.5-billion flat-glass business to foreign producers. 
Over the past 20 years, U.S. officials said, three Japanese companies have 
maintained exactly the same market shares -- 50%, 30% and 20%. Japan also 
agreed to promote greater use of insulated glass and safety glass, products in 
which U.S. companies are considered leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the rough parameters of the agreement have been worked out so far, and 
"there is a lot of negotiating that will need to be done" over the next month, 
a senior trade official said. But even an agreement in principle represents 
progress, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles are excellent. It should have a significant impact on U.S. 
sales in Japan," said Ralph Gerson, executive vice president of Guardian 
Industries Corp., a large glass manufacturer in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no agreement was reached in the automotive arena, there have been 
limited signs of progress in market penetration. Ford announced last week that 
its sales in August were 152% higher than a year earlier. Still, U.S. auto 
sales in Japan remain minuscule. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said that regulatory barriers to foreign replacement parts make it 
"nearly impossible for competitive foreign auto parts producers to break into 
the Japanese market." Japan buys 2.6% of its replacement, or "after-market," 
auto parts from foreign companies; in the United States, 47% of these parts are 
imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Any decision to impose sanctions over the auto impasse would proceed under 
Section 301 of U.S. trade laws. The first step, which could take up to a year, 
would be an investigation of the problem and additional negotiations with 
Japan. Kantor, citing Japan's cooperation in other sectors, refrained from 
using the "Super 301" provision, in which Japan would have been given the 
stigma of an "unfair trader." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn., 
said he is "marginally encouraged" by the action. But, he added, "the 
Japan-U.S. trade problem will not be solved without opening Japan's automotive 
market, for both vehicles and parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn., called 
the Section 301 trade action "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Midori Tani, director of international communications for the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, said "the fact that the United States and 
Japan could reach an agreement . . . has a great value."

MISCUES HAVE SOME INSIDERS DOUBTING BROWN'S CHANCES; POLITICS: AS CAMPAIGN 
ENTERS CRUCIAL STRETCH, SHE NEEDS A 'BLOCKBUSTER' TO RECOVER MOMENTUM, SOME 
ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Kathleen Brown campaign, once considered an unstoppable juggernaut headed 
straight for the governor's office in Sacramento, now is struggling for its 
political life in the view of many California political experts -- most of them 
Brown's fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though recent polls show the race still close, several developments in 
the last month have contributed to deepening alarm inside and outside the Brown 
campaign and led many Democratic insiders to conclude that hopes for winning 
the governorship are slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most pessimistic of them, the fear is not whether Brown will lose, 
but by how much. A significant Brown loss, by 5% or more, could create a 
"downdraft" effect that would defeat Democrats running for other statewide 
offices, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reasons for concern have been beyond Brown's control. Opinion 
polls nationally, and to a lesser extent in California, suggest a powerful 
Republican undertow that could bring down many incumbent Democrats, and make 
life that much tougher for Democratic challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past few weeks, a series of stumbles and miscues by Brown's 
campaign has triggered widespread second-guessing of whether she squandered her 
chance this summer to overtake incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson, for whom voters 
still seem to have little affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Brown and her campaign spokesman declare that they are right where 
they want to be. "We're very confident of winning," said Steven M. Glazer, a 
senior adviser to Brown, the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic political consultants and strategists described the Brown 
campaign in interviews with The Times in terms that ranged from "not working" 
to "an abomination." 
</P>
<P>
 The corps of Brown campaign critics even have included Brown's husband, 
television news consultant Van Gordon Sauter. And one Brown insider said 
Thursday that changes were being planned to present Brown in a more personal 
and aggressive fashion, putting her in closer contact with average voters. 
</P>
<P>
 With about five weeks to go before the Nov. 8 general election, Brown needs to 
score some sort of dramatic breakthrough -- a "blockbuster," as one insider put 
it -- if she hopes to defeat Wilson, many Democratic political consultants and 
independent analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The views of the Democratic experts were not unanimously gloomy. Some argued 
that Brown could turn her campaign around, noting that a month can be a 
lifetime in California politics. "I think she can still win," said political 
consultant Darry Sragow, who ran Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's 
unsuccessful primary campaign against Brown this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another respected strategist said: "I don't think she's doing nearly as bad as 
the conventional wisdom says." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the experts interviewed by The Times cited the inexperience and 
proneness to error of a candidate and campaign team running at this level for 
the first time. By contrast, Wilson has a highly seasoned group that has been 
with him for years, winning two races for the U.S. Senate as well as the 
governorship. His campaign not only guards itself zealously against miscues, 
but is quick to pounce on opposition errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson on Friday completed an effective September "Rose Garden" strategy, 
using his incumbency to promote some of his key issues -- particularly crime -- 
and he will be on the road almost constantly the rest of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson will be all over the place," said Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur. 
"She's been spoiling for Pete Wilson to come out and campaign. She's about to 
find out: It's not going to be a particularly pleasant experience for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican strategists are so confident that Wilson will win that they believe 
he can afford to spend some time and resources on behalf of down-ticket 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's core problem -- according to political experts -- is that she still 
has failed to define herself and her goals clearly or forcefully enough to move 
voters to her column. The major public opinion polls indicate that Wilson, even 
though he is not a popular governor, maintains greater credibility on the 
issues of most concern to the people this fall -- violent crime, illegal 
immigration and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the criticism of the Brown campaign has gathered intensity just as 
the candidate finally has polished her campaign speeches, in both content and 
delivery, and has seemed far more at ease on the stump than she was last 
spring. So far, however, this image of Brown has not been transmitted to the 
Californians who will vote based on television news coverage and campaign 
commercials -- that is, most voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the first critical sign of a faltering campaign is lack of funds. One 
observer said this past week that the campaign was beginning to "hit the wall" 
on contributions. But Glazer insisted that the campaign had enough money to 
carry it to Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democrat, who is associated with another statewide race and who has 
watched the Brown campaign closely from the beginning, said it is "reaching the 
phase where panic sets in." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this frantic searching around for things to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's husband, Sauter, has been reported to be unhappy about the way Brown 
was being portrayed in the campaign run by consultant Clint Reilly, commenting 
in Ontario last month: "It's been very difficult for me to recognize my wife in 
this campaign." He said the image presented to voters was not the Kathleen 
Brown he knows as "an intelligent, articulate, well-rounded individual who 
wants to restore confidence in government." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's recent campaign stumbling has capped a year in which she has been 
repeatedly criticized on the issues of campaign strategy and effectiveness and 
has rarely exuded an aura of confidence or consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 She continues to be haunted by the death penalty issue after months of seeking 
to assure voters that she would be tough in enforcing the state's capital 
punishment law even though she personally opposes the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The most painful recent wound, at least to insiders, was self-inflicted. Brown 
was quoted in the Sept. 10 issue of the National Journal as saying she had 
maintained her personal principles by -- unlike a number of other leading 
Democrats -- not changing her mind on the death penalty when she ran for 
statewide office. She then named, among others, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 
engaged in a bitter contest against Republican Rep. Mike Huffington. Feinstein 
and other Democrats were outraged, and Brown had to correct herself because 
Feinstein, in fact, had changed her views long before running for statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Brown appeared to be whining when she complained to a Sacramento Bee 
reporter that she was let down by supporters who went to Washington to work in 
the Clinton Administration rather than in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people who said yes to me and then they went away. . . . I had 
been seduced and abandoned," Brown was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 In themselves, these are relatively minor events, but for Democratic experts 
they provided accumulating evidence of a troubled campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the critical portion of the election campaign remains ahead. It is the 
period in which the media -- particularly television news -- will focus more 
intently on differences between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still six weeks," said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll. "We're not 
looking at huge margins in the polls. Wilson is still negatively perceived." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on the record, consultant Sragow -- who is not involved in the 
gubernatorial campaign -- was more charitable about Brown's chances than were 
others who follow the campaign closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Several work for other statewide Democratic candidates and would discuss the 
Brown campaign only if they were not quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impression is that it's sliding away from her," said one Democratic 
insider not directly involved with the Democratic slate. "Some external event 
needs to occur to turn this thing around for them." 
</P>
<P>
 One potential for changing the dynamics of the campaign is debates. But Wilson 
resisted Brown's efforts to set up a series of debates and both campaigns 
declared Friday that there would be no gubernatorial debates. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Wilson, though not a gripping speaker, is not likely to make a 
major error in a debate. In 1990, Wilson went into his one debate far behind 
nominee Dianne Feinstein in the polls and emerged from it leading in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democrat working in another statewide race offered this critique of the 
Brown campaign: 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown should never have stonewalled the press for months about reasons for 
her opposition to the death penalty. When she finally confronted the issue, the 
response came across as phony. People still do not understand her personal 
opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown allowed her opponents to define her to voters before she could do so 
-- basically portraying her as an opponent of the death penalty and as the 
sister of former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * She missed a major opportunity to grab voters on primary election night with 
a pointed victory speech that told viewers who she was and why she wanted to be 
governor, and why Wilson should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 This Democratic tactician also was sharply critical of the shotgun fashion in 
which the campaign aired more than two dozen different television commercials, 
saying none of them aired long enough to make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not penetrating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Wilson camp, spokesman Schnur said Brown made a major strategic error 
by trying to checkmate Wilson on the crime issue with television ads during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like Bill Clinton putting up a sign in the war room: 'It's Desert 
Storm, Stupid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that crime is Wilson's issue no matter what Brown does, Schnur 
said, just as Clinton never could have defeated former President George Bush in 
1992 by attacking him for the Persian Gulf War. Rather, the sign in the Clinton 
campaign "war room" read: "It's the economy, stupid." Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 37 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Saturday: Neither Republican Gov. Pete Wilson nor Democratic 
nominee Kathleen Brown had any public events. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Wilson was scheduled to appear at the reopening of St. John's 
Hospital in Santa Monica, which was damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Brown planned to fly to Washington, D.C., for a two-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Saturday: Both U.S. Senate candidates -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
and Rep. Mike Huffington -- were in Washington, where Congress is in session. 
There were no campaign events scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Both candidates will remain in Washington today. There were no 
campaign events scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "A CEO who managed a business this way would be fired by its board of 
directors. As California's top CEO, Pete Wilson deserves to have his contract 
terminated by the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steven M. Glazer, Brown's senior adviser, in discussing new 30-second 
television ad that hits Wilson on the state's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This scheme could cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars every election 
cycle. At a time when government is compelled to cut essential services, it is 
indefensible to spend taxpayer money to finance political campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gov. Pete Wilson, in vetoing a proposed election campaign finance measure 
passed by the Legislature.

AGENTS BEGIN MASSIVE SWEEP ALONG BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the setting sun gleamed off the steel border fence where Mexican immigrants 
gather in the shadows between despair and uncertainty, Operation Gatekeeper 
rumbled into action Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Using horses, bicycles, sedans, all-terrain vehicles and small high-speed 
boats, about 200 agents of the U.S. Border Patrol deployed in a three-tiered 
formation along fields, canyons, riverbanks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation culminated months of preparation and politicking by unleashing 
an unprecedented show of the Border Patrol's force designed to repel a 
seemingly unstoppable advance of humanity: illegal immigration. Driven as well 
by the potent force of electoral politics, the much-touted federal crackdown 
along the busiest 14 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Operation Gatekeeper goes full blast," said Gustavo De La Vina, Border Patrol 
chief in San Diego and new western regional commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. "We are tying everything together that we have been 
working on for the past 18 months: personnel, fences, lighting, technology. We 
are starting to roll." 
</P>
<P>
 The day was heavy on photo opportunities and press availabilities, conveying a 
sense that the Border Patrol is overcoming what U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin 
described as a "generation of neglect." The mission of the perennially 
overworked, underfunded agency has been synonymous with futility; critics have 
alternately derided the Border Patrol as abusive and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not seen this type of attention before," Border Patrol spokeswoman 
Ann Summers said as she steered her van along the dusty concrete levee of the 
Tijuana River. "In the past, it was always something negative. It's a nice 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 On the south riverbank, word of the Border Patrol buildup spread quickly among 
the food vendors who serve as the unofficial communications network for the 
immigrants. In a conversation through the border fence, one would-be immigrant 
asked William Pink, chief of the Imperial Beach station, if he was an "old" 
agent or part of the new reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tried to beat the start of the operation by staging daylight "banzai 
runs," charging in groups through the fields and farmland west of the San 
Ysidro port of entry. Pursuing Border Patrol vehicles raised sheets of dust and 
black-gloved agents tumbled out to chase the immigrants through the underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Andrade said he had never seen so many agents. The farm worker from 
Jalisco, a bantam, curly-haired 36-year-old who was interviewed on the south 
riverbank, had been caught twice in the last two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting harder to cross," Andrade said. "Last time, this agent roughed 
me up a little bit. He said, 'Why did you run?' I said, 'Because I was trying 
to escape. Your job is to catch me. Mine is to keep running.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday night, the beefed-up Imperial Beach station had recorded more than 
500 arrests, significantly exceeding its daily total during previous weeks. 
Commanders predicted that the arrests would continue to rise in the coming 
weeks, then decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's deployment showed the resources that have been pouring into the 
region: shiny new Jeep Cherokees and Ford Broncos replacing dilapidated 
vehicles, computerized fingerprinting systems with overhead television monitors 
speeding the laborious ritual of filling out interview forms with prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no specific figures for the cost of the operation, the 
Border Patrol received an additional $45 million in its 1994 budget, the bulk 
of which went to the San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Gatekeeper is an augmented version of a blockade in El Paso that has 
stymied immigrants in a 20-mile area and provoked demands from politicians for 
a similar crackdown in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno answered those demands during a recent border visit when 
she pledged to match the El Paso results. The operation is at least partly a 
Clinton Administration counterattack timed to neutralize Gov. Pete Wilson's 
emphasis on the immigration issue and aid California Democrats in November, 
officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 But commanders hope that the five-month effort will also dissuade illegal 
immigrants or push them east of the Tijuana-San Diego zone into rural hills and 
forests where enforcement is easier. The true test will come in January and 
February, when a 40% personnel increase will be complete and illegal 
immigration picks up after the traditional year-end decline. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Mexican side of the border, immigrants and experts predicted that 
Operation Gatekeeper will work -- but only to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite political rhetoric depicting illegal immigration gone wild, Border 
Patrol arrests have declined 20% during the last two years in the increasingly 
well-guarded San Diego sector, while increasing in Arizona. The U.S. initiative 
will probably accelerate those trends, forcing immigrants into more crossing 
attempts, swelling crowds on the Tijuana border and propelling smugglers of 
immigrants toward the arduous eastern routes, said Hugo Miguel Ayala, director 
of the Mexican border police unit known as Grupo Beta. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more migrants in the area for more days," said Ayala, whose 45 
officers are on alert. "They will expend more physical and economic effort, it 
will take more time, they will face greater risks. But I do not think the flow 
will stop." 
</P>
<P>
 As the migratory flow encounters resistance, authorities will contend with the 
dangers of crime against immigrants in isolated terrain and of violence between 
U.S. agents and frustrated would-be immigrants, according to Mexican and U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the attitude of the Border Patrol is correct and respectful, that is one 
thing," Ayala said. "But if there are abuses, there could be a strong 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol alignment is designed to keep the peace, commanders said, 
adding that field agents participated in the planning. Rather than massing 
agents in confrontation with migrants at the line as in El Paso, the 
three-tiered maze of patrolling vehicles extends a mile inland. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we have acted on what (the illegal immigrants) did," Pink said. 
"Now they are playing to our tune. . . . We've suggested that if there's 
violence, the agents can back off from that particular area. We have the 
resources now to contain it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol has conducted similar operations, although with less 
fanfare. When De La Vina deployed an extraordinary number of agents in January, 
1992, arrests surged and smugglers organized mass charges of illegal immigrants 
through the freeway ports of entry into southbound traffic. More illegal 
immigrants are also expected to try to use fake documents or hide in vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a deterrent, Grupo Beta officers on the Mexican side of the border are 
warning immigrants of the dangers of freeway dashes, and the INS has assigned 
more inspectors to the legal ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans and the CHP are prepared to help respond to an influx of freeway 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of releasing all captured immigrants back to Tijuana, the Border 
Patrol is trying to head off conflict by busing some prisoners about 120 miles 
east to be repatriated at the Calexico-Mexicali crossing. Agents will designate 
up to four Calexico-bound buses a day for young male prisoners, officials said. 
The reinforcements Saturday also included 93 agents transferred from the San 
Clemente immigration checkpoint on Interstate 5, which has been closed in a 
test of whether inland agents are more effective on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will remain closed for six weeks, reopen temporarily and then 
close again in February, when the checkpoint agents will join 250 agents 
arriving from the Border Patrol Academy. At the end of a trial period, the INS 
will decide the fate of the inland checkpoints at San Clemente and Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 Although agents seemed generally enthusiastic Saturday, others were more 
cautious. The president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that 
represents the agents, described the politically charged scramble to launch the 
operation as "bureaucratic insanity," saying he remains skeptical about whether 
the initiative will succeed in securing the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly the potential for incidents is going to build up," T.J. Bonner said. 
"The smugglers are going to move their cargo through. It may not get through in 
these 14 miles to the extent it used to, but it will get through. We are just 
outgunned in every respect." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Border Patrol Deputy Chief William Veal said the new 
initiative should be evaluated as part of an ongoing strategy that features 
more fences and lights, tougher prosecution of smugglers, and computer-provided 
identification of wanted criminals and statistics on repeat crossers and other 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to slow down the revolving door," he said. "You have to take 
the long-term view."

 In the gender-bending waters of Lake Apopka, alligators aren't quite male. 
They aren't quite female either. They may be both. Or neither. 
</P>
<P>
 This sexual confusion in the wild, discovered in this steamy Florida swamp 
last year, is so disturbing to scientists that they keep performing test after 
test on the scaly reptiles, trying to prove themselves wrong. But the more they 
look, the more evidence they find. In fact, hardly any young alligators with 
normal sexuality can be found in this vast lake on the suburban outskirts of 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere around the world, the same astonishing phenomenon is turning up in a 
menagerie of fish, birds and other wild animals. Testosterone levels have 
plummeted in some males, while females are supercharged with estrogen. Both 
sexes sometimes are born with a penis and ovaries, and some males wind up so 
gender warped they try to produce eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is really fouled up. It is indeed real, and it is scary," said Tim 
Gross, a University of Florida wildlife endocrinologist on the team that 
discovered the feminized alligators. "We didn't want to believe it, in all 
honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 This is no fluke of Mother Nature, no quirk of evolution. This is probably a 
legacy of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife scientists have uncovered persuasive evidence that artificial 
pesticides and industrial chemicals are infiltrating wombs and eggs, where they 
send false signals imitating or blocking hormones, which control sexuality. 
Although the parents are unharmed, their embryo's sexual development is 
disrupted, and some male offspring are left chemically castrated and females 
sterile. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential consequences, if unabated, are almost unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 If males aren't male and females aren't female, they cannot reproduce, and 
some outwardly healthy populations could be a generation away from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biologically, this is the most significant thing that could impair species 
and populations across the continent and across the globe," said Timothy 
Kubiak, chief of contaminant prevention and investigations at the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 So far about 45 chemicals, many of them organochlorine pesticides widely used 
by farms and households to kill insects and weeds, have mimicked estrogen or 
inhibited testosterone in laboratory tests and in wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what this portends for humans -- who often encounter the same 
chemical residues in their food and water. But because hormones play a role in 
the human body identical to other creatures, some scientists are alarmed by the 
potential of adults passing infertility and other reproductive defects such as 
prostate cancer on to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability of these chemicals, called endocrine disrupters, to leave the 
parents unharmed but afflict the unborn is so alarming it was not even imagined 
by author Rachel Carson, who warned of pesticides run amok in her 1962 
environmental classic, "Silent Spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The most insidious aspect is that the damage easily goes undetected; the 
animals look healthy, even to experts. Their bizarre sexuality is discovered 
only if their internal genitalia are examined or their hormones are tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the threat of environmental hormones is newly recognized, many 
scientists and government agencies have given it a rare urgency. Other 
researchers, however, remain skeptical, saying more evidence is needed to 
comprehend the scope of the threat and pinpoint the chemicals to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the scientists' findings are so new they have yet to be reviewed by 
their peers and published. Nonetheless, 21 biologists recently took the 
unprecedented step of warning in a position paper that "impacts on wildlife and 
laboratory animals . . . are of such a profound and insidious nature" that 
swift government action is warranted. In response, the National Academy of 
Sciences is hastily convening a panel to analyze the findings and guide 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fear is that we will find more and more instances of this as we learn what 
to look for," said Ohio University reproductive biologist Brent Palmer, who 
found male cormorants in the Great Lakes and possibly some male frogs in 
California producing female egg proteins. "It doesn't seem like a few isolated 
incidents. The problem keeps snowballing and getting worse and worse." Sexual 
Messengers 
</P>
<P>
 Estrogen and testosterone are the body's sexual messengers, ordering embryos 
how to grow. When a pregnant animal is exposed to even a minuscule dose of a 
hormone during the onset of its embryo's sexual development, the gender of the 
offspring can be irreversibly altered, biologists say. In some cases, the 
father could be passing the defect to his young via his sperm or semen. 
</P>
<P>
 Because hormones also regulate the embryo's immune system and brain 
development, the offspring might also be prone to disease and behavioral 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the hand-me-down poison, from parents to offspring," said World 
Wildlife Fund senior scientist Theo Colborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, most populations of animals seem nowhere near collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But many animals that are dependent on heavily polluted waters for their food 
are suffering serious reproductive defects that have been linked to 
environmental hormones -- alligators and turtles in Lake Apopka, sea gulls and 
some fish off the coast of Southern California, great blue herons in British 
Columbia, terns in Massachusetts, sturgeon in the Missouri River, trout in 
Great Britain, seals in the Netherlands, and an array of fish, birds and 
mammals in the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's bad enough to scare us, it's bad. And when I sit down and think 
about this, it scares me stiff," said Charles Facemire, a Fish and Wildlife 
Service toxicologist in Atlanta who has investigated contaminants for nearly 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife biologists also have begun studying whether hormone-disrupting 
chemicals are behind the unexplained declines of some creatures, such as frogs 
that are vanishing throughout much of the Western United States, and several 
endangered and threatened species. Many bald eagles are failing to reproduce 
along the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River. In South 
Florida, a feud has erupted over whether environmental hormones are to blame 
for sperm and testicular disorders in the last living 30 to 50 Florida 
panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, the severity of pollution has dramatically declined since 
the 1970s, when die-offs and birth defects in eagles, pelicans and other 
animals prompted chemical bans and cleanups. But zoologists suspect that 
smaller volumes of pesticides and other chemicals originally thought to be 
benign may be gradually depleting populations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Great Lakes, 4 parts per million of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, 
will kill an eagle's embryo. But a much tinier amount -- perhaps measured in 
parts per billion -- during a key stage of development might be enough to alter 
the newborn's hormones and leave it sterile, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If contaminants prevent an animal from reproducing, it will not replace 
itself," said zoologist David Crews at University of Texas, Austin, who created 
hermaphroditic pond turtles by painting eggs with 1 p.p.m. of PCBs. "No normal 
animal will be born there." 
</P>
<P>
 To the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates chemicals, most 
worrisome is the abundance of commercially sold substances that seem capable of 
altering hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are the world's most widely used herbicides, including alachlor, 
atrazine and 2,4-D. About 170 million pounds of the three herbicides are 
sprayed each year on U.S. corn, soybeans and other crops, as well as gardens 
and lawns. Nonylphenols, popular industrial compounds used in plastics and 
detergents, also were identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these are things you can buy off the shelf at your local hardware 
store," Facemire said. "We're finding more all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of these chemicals, evidence of their ability to tamper with hormones 
is based on laboratory tests. In wild animals, including Florida alligators, 
the most compelling proof has been detected in waters polluted with either DDT, 
a pesticide that blocks testosterone, or PCBs, which imitate estrogen. Used in 
enormous volumes until they were banned in the United States in the 1970s, 
these chemicals still pollute hundreds of lakes, streams and coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the impact on animals is documented, the human implications remain 
highly theoretical. Some reproductive scientists suspect that exposure to 
environmental hormones could be lowering sperm counts in men and contributing 
to sharp increases in prostate and testicular cancer as well as breast cancer 
and endometriosis in women. 
</P>
<P>
 But veterinary toxicologist Stephen Safe of Texas A&M University is skeptical. 
Although he acknowledges that the wildlife data in highly polluted waterways is 
convincing, he is skeptical about inferring any impact on humans or on wildlife 
in less contaminated areas. People, he says, constantly are barraged with 
naturally occurring hormones in plants and food with no ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment and organisms, including humans, have tremendous resiliency," 
said John McCarthy, vice president for science and regulatory affairs at the 
American Crop Protection Assn., which represents pesticide manufacturers. "It 
doesn't mean you should go out and bombard them unnecessarily, but it just 
doesn't seem like we're going downhill fast and headed toward a crash in a 
generation or two." 
</P>
<P>
 But most scientists look to animals as sentinels for environmental quality and 
human health. Holding out for more proof before restricting the chemicals, 
Kubiak said, "is like waiting for the gangrene that started in your legs to go 
up your arms before cutting off your legs." Gulls a Tip-Off 
</P>
<P>
 Few people were paying attention when the first hint of trouble arose more 
than 20 years ago, off the coast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea gulls on Santa Barbara Island -- a major breeding area -- were showing 
peculiar sexual behavior. Females were pairing up and sharing nests. Upon 
closer examination, two Southern California scientists found the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 They counted as many as 19 female gulls on the island for every male. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, they wondered, had all the males gone? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the skewed gender ratio, the island's colony of Western gulls 
started to collapse, dropping from 3,000 pairs in the 1950s to about 700 by the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Avian toxicologist Michael Fry of UC Davis had a theory. 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered if DDT, notorious for thinning the eggshells and killing the 
embryos of Southern California pelicans and cormorants, could be to blame for 
the missing males. Between 1950 and 1970, about 4 million pounds of the 
pesticide was pumped into the ocean at the Torrance headquarters of Montrose 
Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulls, unlike pelicans and cormorants, had seemed to be unharmed by DDT. They 
had no visible birth defects or other physical disorders. But looking further, 
Fry was shocked to find many gulls had both testes and ovaries. To confirm his 
finding, he injected gull eggs from uncontaminated Mono Lake with amounts of 
DDT comparable to that found on Santa Barbara Island. In his laboratory, he 
crafted hermaphroditic birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out that DDT has two very different effects," Fry said. "In gulls, 
DDT in eggs caused abnormal development of the males. Chemical neuterization." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry's work -- published in the journal Science in 1981 -- was the first 
evidence that environmental contaminants seemed to be feminizing wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 While some scientists noted it, most shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, common wisdom held that contamination that did not kill or maim 
animals was harmless. If an animal was alive, it was assumed to be healthy and 
fertile. Most biologists dismissed Fry's discovery as an inexplicable quirk at 
a uniquely contaminated spot. 3,000-Mile Parallels 
</P>
<P>
 But 3,000 miles away, Quebec scientist Glen Fox was intrigued. Fox, a Canadian 
government wildlife toxicologist, had noticed female herring gulls sharing 
nests at Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario -- also contaminated with DDT as well 
as PCBs. He called the California toxicologist for help, and Fry found the 
identical half-male, half-female phenomenon. Still, their work was met with 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great difficulty convincing the scientific community that this was a 
real thing," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, zoologist Theo Colborn was researching a book on Great Lakes 
wildlife for a conservation group when she began turning up studies indicating 
more than a dozen birds, fish and mammals were suffering ailments linked to 
heavy DDT and PCB contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The oddest part, she thought, was that problems weren't showing up in adults 
that grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, when pollution had peaked. Instead, 
cormorants born more than a decade later had twisted, mutated bills, and the 
only healthy eaglets seemed to have parents that had just migrated to the 
lakes. Most young trout and other fish had disappeared, except for those that 
had been stocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very evident that the problems affecting wildlife around the Great 
Lakes were not in the adult animals, but their offspring. The offspring that 
survived were not in very good shape," said Colborn, now a senior scientist 
with the World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping into an electronic database, Colborn pulled together hundreds of 
scientific reports. She learned reproductive problems had been detected in 
almost every developed country since modern chemicals were introduced after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the reports came from scientists from a wide array of disciplines 
who rarely see or hear about each other's work, no one had noticed the 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the fall of 1988, it became very overwhelming that there was something 
really wrong," Colborn said. "As I put it all together, I had to do something 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the summer of 1991, Colborn convened a meeting of 21 North 
American and European zoologists, pathologists, immunologists and other 
scientists researching the endocrine systems of humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days, they issued an alarming six-page statement. "Many wildlife 
populations are already affected by these compounds," the scientists concluded. 
"It is urgent to move reproductive effects to the forefront. . . . A major 
research initiative on humans must be undertaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, at a follow-up workshop, the warnings only intensified. Rarely 
does such a clear consensus emerge in science. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Fry had assumed the worst of the reproductive damage was over. PCBs 
and DDT were banned in the 1970s, and contamination levels in fish and wildlife 
have gradually decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, when he visited New Bedford Harbor -- a bird breeding area 
near Cape Cod contaminated with PCBs -- 11 of 15 terns he examined had the same 
bizarre sex organs he had seen in California a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues have become believers. 'A Big Whodunit' 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun rises over Florida's Lake Woodruff, three air boats slice through 
the tranquil morning mist, their engines roaring like Cessnas rising from a 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Franklin Persival races his craft across the swamp's overgrown carpet of 
water lilies and pulls up to a pink nylon banner tied to a cypress. The banner 
means an alligator nest, spotted from the air, is hidden just offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing a pair of wooden stakes, a wire loop, a magnet and some dental floss, 
Persival bounds onto the muddy banks. He deftly sidesteps saw-like blades of 
marsh grass, fist-sized spiders and mounds of fire ants, approaching a small 
clearing, where he finds a five-foot-wide nest woven like a basket from grasses 
and branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, Persival sets up a crude radio-activated trap atop the nest, hoping 
the unsuspecting mother alligator will crawl through and get her snout snared. 
</P>
<P>
 The research is grueling in merciless 98-degree heat, but the six-man team 
stops its alligator rodeo only long enough to dodge late-afternoon lightning 
storms. They know they have little time to waste if they want to save the 
lake's alligators from extinction. So many questions, so few answers -- "a big 
whodunit," says Persival, a National Biological Survey scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, the team collects eggs, blood and tissue from alligators at both 
Lake Apopka and Lake Woodruff, a national refuge on the St. Johns River about 
50 miles north of Orlando. Woodruff is considered a healthy lake, useful for 
comparing estrogen and testosterone in its alligators to those from Lake 
Apopka, one of Florida's most contaminated waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Tower Chemical Co. spilled a large quantity of Kelthane, a pesticide 
containing DDT, along Lake Apopka's banks. Fertilizers and insecticides 
routinely flow off nearby citrus groves and other farms, while little fresh 
water is allowed in. Even Hurricane Andrew took a swipe at Apopka and stirred 
up its polluted sediments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that could happen to a lake has happened to this one," said 
University of Florida alligator biologist Ken Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s, alligator births at the lake have dropped fivefold, 
which prompted the scientific team to begin exploring the cause. Apopka 
provides an ideal test case, since the population crash was fairly recent, and 
the research offers the most convincing proof so far that chemicals still are 
causing hormonal damage in wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The first breakthrough in finding why alligators are vanishing came in the 
fall of 1992, when endocrinologist Tim Gross, conducting routine sex typing on 
Apopka's turtles, couldn't tell males from females. 
</P>
<P>
 The following March, zoologist Louis Guillette Jr. and Gross examined 
6-month-old alligators hatched in their laboratory from eggs from the lake. 
Males had the high estrogen and low testosterone typical of a female, while 
females had double the normal estrogen and were laying clutches that, instead 
of containing the usual one egg, had as many as seven, all dead. A few months 
later, the scientists confirmed sexual abnormalities in gators born in the wild 
-- four of 12 had part-male, part-female genitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sent up signals and flags and fireworks and we knew something was going on 
there," said Guillette, director of the University of Florida's reproductive 
analysis laboratory. " . . . We now know that every single animal that we 
thought was a female in Lake Apopka had abnormal gonads." 
</P>
<P>
 DDE, a metabolite of DDT, was found in the tissues, and the team replicated 
the link in the laboratory when they painted eggs with minute amounts -- as low 
as 10 parts per billion -- and the young were born with abnormal hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, not a single alligator at Lake Woodruff had hormonal or sexual 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unconvinced, the researchers returned to both lakes this summer. At 
night, they kicked around every imaginable theory, even an unlikely one they 
jokingly named the "shanty-town girl hypothesis" -- that perhaps Lake Apopka is 
a magnet for poor, weak female gators. "We wanted to be 100% sure," Gross said, 
"before we opened our big mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, they finally published their findings in a scientific journal, 
warning that their two years of studies "have only begun to address what we 
believe could be a serious, widespread threat to wildlife populations" and 
perhaps humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Vital questions remain. How is the damage physically passed from mother or 
father to embryo? How many chemicals are to blame, and at what concentrations? 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is circumstantial evidence, but if you want to indict a certain 
chemical, we need a whole lot more evidence," Persival said. "Even if we then 
find what chemical it is, then what do we do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gross suspects that "anything that eats anything off that lake potentially can 
be affected." But his fears go further. "I think Lake Apopka is just one case. 
I don't think it's even the worst case. Those (chemicals) have been used 
worldwide over a lot of environments." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of species, from grebes at Southern California's Salton Sea to 
dolphins along the Atlantic Coast, suffer from mysterious ailments that could 
be linked to environmental hormones. Hoping to determine the national scope, 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is seeking federal research funds in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps future generations are in better shape today because DDT and PCB 
pollution levels have receded. Or is the worst yet to come because other 
chemicals that might be creating sexual chaos still are used? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers, scientists say, lie hidden in the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seeds for the next generation are already planted," Gross said, "and that 
is what's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: The implications for humans. Tracing the Damage 
</P>
<P>
 Many wild animals exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals are suffering 
severe reproductive problems, including hermaphroditic sex organs and 
abnormally low birth rates. Substantial evidence has been found that 
contamination has caused disorders in alligators in Florida's Lake Apopka, sea 
gulls in California's Channel Islands, terns in Massachusetts and various fish 
and birds at the Great Lakes. With some species, such as Florida panthers that 
have low sperm counts, wildlife experts only suspect a link to pollutants.

 Species affected: Terns Imitating Hormones 
</P>
<P>
 Hormone-imitating chemicals in the environment can cause infertility or other 
reproductive disorders that can devastate wildlife populations for generations. 
Here is how they work: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pollutant accumulates: A female animal eats food, such as fish, contaminated 
with an environmental pollutant that accumulates in her tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 * False signal: During an embryo's development, the pollutant from the mother 
invades a reproductive cell and binds to its receptor, which sends a false 
signal mimicking estrogen. To the cell, the signal from a fake hormone is 
indistinguishable from a natural one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proteins manufactured: The signal turns on the manufacture of certain 
proteins, such as those that produce egg yolks. A male fetus could then develop 
both a penis and ovaries. Such an offspring would be unable to reproduce.

STABLE ECONOMY ALL BUT CLINCHES BRAZIL'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an aside during an explanation of monetary policy, on the eve of 
Brazil's most recent attempt to halt the spiraling inflation that has plagued 
this country for more than a decade. But as economist Helio Portocarrero 
reflected three months ago on the anguish and turmoil that he and other 
Brazilians had endured under 2,500% annual inflation, he unknowingly summed up 
the almost certain outcome of this week's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what," he said, "anybody who can make it so that when people go 
to the grocery store, the prices are the same that month as they were the month 
before, he could be anything in this country he wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 63, is the man credited with making that happen. As 
a result, pollsters and analysts say that barring a miracle, Cardoso will be 
elected the next president of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardoso will win," said Carlos Augusto Montenegro, president of IBOPE, a 
polling organization. "The only question now is whether he wins on Oct. 3 or 
Nov. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate wins more than 50% of the presidential vote Monday, the top 
two contenders will face off in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Cardoso's success is an economic plan he devised earlier this year 
while serving for six months as finance minister. The plan both curbed 
government spending and overhauled Brazil's currency. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the government balanced the budget through tougher measures against tax 
evasion and a special constitutional amendment that allowed it more discretion 
in spending. Then it launched a new currency, the real, to replace the old 
cruzeiro. One real was made the equivalent of one dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the plan went into effect in July, inflation has dropped from 50% a 
month in June to less than 1% in August. And as inflation and prices dropped, 
Cardoso, who resigned his post to run for president, shot up in the polls, 
leaping from 15 points behind to 20 points ahead of socialist candidate Luis 
Inacio (Lula) da Silva in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's emergence reflects a dramatic turnaround in the mood of this vast 
country. Just six months ago, the nation's electorate was poised for a major 
overhaul of the federal government. The current president, Itamar Franco, was 
being vilified daily in the press and among the populace as incompetent or at 
best inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of political corruption -- including a presidential impeachment two 
years ago and a congressional budget scandal last year, involving scores of 
legislators and hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks and outright 
thievery -- had turned a vast number of frustrated voters toward Lula, a former 
union leader and grade school dropout. Defeated in a presidential runoff five 
years ago by the later-impeached Fernando Collor de Mello, Lula promised 
radical reform; Lula's Workers' Party boasts about its nearly unblemished 
record of honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula was so far ahead in the polls that, as late as July, analysts were 
debating whether he could capture the presidency in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the introduction of a new currency under the Cardoso-designed 
economic plan, Brazil has discovered a nearly forgotten sense of economic and 
political stability; a quiet optimism has crept across the nation. Franco, for 
instance, suddenly enjoys an 82% approval rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can feel that sense of optimism all around," said David Fleischer, an 
analyst and political science instructor at the University of Brasilia for 22 
years. "The main factor is the currency and falling prices. Right now, you have 
a general tone of confidence in the discourse of Cardoso and his group -- and 
that's changed the electoral tone. People have decided not to 'throw the 
rascals out,' because maybe the rascals aren't rascals because they stabilized 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has taken a decided turn for the better. Exports are up, having 
posted a record $4.2 billion last month. Imports are up, which means prices 
should remain stable or continue to fall. For the first time in years, 
consumers can buy stoves and refrigerators on credit and do something as simple 
as budget their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment is pouring into the country. Net foreign investment has 
jumped 50% since July. In August, it was a record $1.5 billion. "And it could 
go as high as $3 billion a month if Cardoso is elected," predicted Julius 
Buchenrode, director of investment management for Chase Manhattan Bank in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial analysts speculate that Brazil may be returning to the high 
growth and low inflation that made it the "miracle economy" of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The successes generated by the plan and widespread approval have allowed 
Cardoso -- author, scholar, former senator and briefly a political exile during 
the country's 21-year military dictatorship -- to easily ride out political 
missteps that might otherwise have severely damaged his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the campaign, his center-left party formed a coalition with the 
right-wing Liberal Front Party (known here by its Portuguese initials, PFL), 
made up of supporters of Brazil's former military dictatorship and wealthy 
landowners. Months later, he was forced to dump his first running mate after 
newspapers uncovered financial improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Cardoso was tainted when the finance minister was forced to resign 
after he inadvertently admitted that he had used his office to aid Cardoso's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's campaign has weathered those political storms, leaving Lula's party 
confused and bewildered. "We have been surprised by the plan," said Marco 
Aurelio Garcia, a Workers' Party official and senior aide to Lula. "We knew it 
would have an impact, but not with such a high intensity. Not even Cardoso 
expected this much of a boost." 
</P>
<P>
 Lula's only hope now is that they can force a runoff, where he hopes to change 
the debate from stabilization to development. "That will be the key," Garcia 
said. "The plan has a great number of deficiencies. For one, it has locked the 
poor in at a low wage. They are lowering the taxes on imports, which will cause 
a recession. We don't want to grow on the basis of catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospects of a Lula comeback are so remote that most observers have 
switched gears to figuring out what Cardoso will do to continue the climate of 
growth and stability and to close the chasm between the rich and poor. Cardoso 
has promised to sell off billions in state-owned companies to reduce the budget 
deficit and to implement widespread social reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have to be constitutional reforms in social security, the relation 
between the states and municipalities and federal government, and a reduction 
in the number of taxes," Buchenrode said. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish those goals, Cardoso will need a two-thirds vote from a 
legislature that has been an almost unmanageable assembly of 19 parties, tinged 
by scandal and devoted more to regional bosses and personal interests than to 
solving urgent national problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The current legislature, for example, still has not passed this year's budget 
for lack of a quorum, and last year's efforts at constitutional reform fizzled 
because of political bickering. And the upcoming legislature should be much 
like the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the legislature, Cardoso has been pushing hard to win the election 
outright, with the hope that a mandate will force Congress to go along with his 
proposals or face constituents' displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardoso's alliance with the right-wing PFL and other parties has raised 
doubts among some political observers as to whether he will be able to bring 
about the much-needed social reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good bet because Cardoso doesn't have the right allies to improve 
the country," said Giancarlo Summa, author of "Revolution Goodby," a survey of 
the Latin American left. "To improve the country, you need very deep social 
reforms, which would move the center of power and wealth. Right now, you have a 
country which is the ninth economic power in the world where 10% of the 
population has 48% of the total income. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When you start to modify this situation," Summa added, "you have to face very 
strong economic and political opposition. It will be difficult, if not 
impossible, for him to do that when he is allied with one of the strongest 
concentrations of the old military regime and the conservative oligarchy of 
this country."

U.S. TRIES TO ADAPT ROLE AS HAITI UNREST GROWS; CARIBBEAN: ATTEMPTS TO END 
CLASHES, LOOTING FAIL AS CONFUSION RISES. AMERICANS SAY POLICE WILL BE 
DISARMED. 
</P>

<P>
 With their tactics and rules changing by the day and the hour, U.S. forces 
took futile steps Saturday to stop looting and searched seven sites for illegal 
weapons. But U.S. commanders left the city largely in the hands of the remnants 
of the Haitian police force and the same civilian gunmen who had brutally 
crushed a mass pro-democracy rally 24 hours before. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of U.S. Army combat soldiers, acting on what a military source called 
"unreliable sources," visited homes and even one 30-acre estate in search of 
hidden arms caches belonging to civilian police operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing said a disarmament campaign is under way to 
dismantle the brutal police and paramilitary apparatus, but the military source 
said Saturday's searches were not part of an aggressive new disarmament policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, U.S. Army military police were dispatched to cordon off 
stores and warehouses to chase off looters, who quickly returned to finish 
their work after the U.S. forces left. At one warehouse, security guards hired 
by the owner opened fire on the local slum dwellers after the Army had gone, 
injuring at least seven, including several children. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of isolated and persistent looting and three brutal, 
state-sponsored attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators that left at least 13 
dead and 105 wounded, confusion reigned among many Haitians about the direction 
the U.S. military mission is taking. 
</P>
<P>
 As Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters that he expects more 
bloodshed, commanders on the ground said their mission is "evolving" as they 
adapt their rules of operation to react to events. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanders and U.S. officials said the apparent confusion was the result of a 
delicate balancing act: an attempt to check police and military brutality while 
maintaining those institutions long enough to prevent a vacuum of law and 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the uncertainty, many Haitians have begun to wonder which side the United 
States came to protect, particularly after armed police agents known as 
attaches clubbed, stoned and shot pro-democracy demonstrators Friday as they 
marked the third anniversary of the military coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Disarming the attaches has been the top demand of Haiti's overwhelming 
majority of poor, who have borne the brunt of regime brutality that human 
rights groups say has left thousands dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scenes on the capital's streets Saturday appeared to reinforce the 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 When throngs of impoverished Haitians stormed and pillaged a warehouse owned 
by a suspected military officer near the capital's port, U.S. military police 
were dispatched with Haitian police in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 When the MPs arrived -- advising the Haitian officers how to respond -- police 
launched tear gas and, within 10 minutes, managed to restore order. But when 
the MPs took up positions around the warehouse with the Haitian police, it 
reinforced the Haitians' growing suspicion that the U.S. Army had begun to back 
the wrong side in their mission to restore stability, democracy and ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, armed police agents still controlled the streets, 
brandishing weapons and threatening to disrupt future demonstrations. Aristide 
supporters were forced to cancel a demonstration scheduled for Saturday rather 
than risk a repeat of the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are out now because they think the Americans will protect them," said 
Pierre Yvans Delsoin, 34, who spent 17 days in jail earlier this year for 
allegedly supporting Aristide. "But the GIs said they are not here to give us 
security. The American military presence should have reduced the violence, but 
the contrary is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate evidence of increased U.S. military patrols or a 
beefed-up U.S. presence in the capital after Perry told reporters traveling 
with him in Europe that Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest 
city, would be "blanketed" to curb violence during the next two weeks in 
advance of Aristide's expected Oct. 15 arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Military commanders on the ground, however, indicated that their tactics are 
changing as rapidly as the mood and events in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Their decision not to stop the state-sponsored bashing of Aristide supporters 
also may soon change, several commanders and U.S. officials indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rules are changing as we speak," Lt. Col. Otis Cooksey, the battalion 
commander for the MPs, said as his men carried out his latest order to stop the 
looting and disperse the crowds. "It's an evolving mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether it was also "mission impossible," Cooksey smiled and said: 
"Let's say it's a very challenging situation that we have. Right now, we're 
working with the Haitian police, trying to keep them together until the 
situation is stable enough for the legitimate government to take power and an 
interim multinational force to be in place." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials in Port-au-Prince took pains to stress the achievements of less 
than two weeks: the reconvening of the Haitian Parliament; the return of the 
capital's elected mayor after two years in hiding; the peaceful seizure of 
state radio and television from military-installed managers, and the homecoming 
of hundreds of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Swing emphasized the same list of successes to two visiting 
congressional delegations, who met with U.S. commanders and Haitian political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 As Swing met with the group, he told reporters the weapons-seizure campaign 
was under way. "We are . . . going after caches of arms in the country, trying 
to get under inventory and lock and key the weapons of what I would call 
paramilitary apparatus of the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign offered mixed results. During a scheduled visit to the Kilik 
Naval Base, troops were invited in by Haitian officials and confiscated 119 M-1 
rifles, two M-60 machine guns and 55 bolt-action rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the raids on houses based on the "unreliable sources" had a different 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 At the decaying estate of dancer/choreographer Katherine Dunham, several 
hundred combat-ready troops swarmed over the lush property for hours in search 
of an arms cache. They were acting on a tip from a notorious anti-Aristide 
paramilitary member who was arrested Friday and claimed that Aristide 
supporters were hiding weapons on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army lay barbed wire across the stone path leading to the gated property 
and assumed combat positions. Tanks and Humvees were stationed nearby as 
military intelligence officers questioned the workers on the estate, which has 
a small guest house and is a center for aspiring dancers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those interrogated was Micka Normil, who works with the dancers. "They 
told me that if I wanted to see my mother and my father again, I'd better 
talk," Normil said. "They kept asking me, 'Where are the guns?' I said, 'Here 
we have no guns. Here we dance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the Petionville section of the capital, one man did have a gun, but the 
Army wouldn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 A company of 10th Mountain troops that had stopped at a supermarket turned 
down an attache offering to sell them his M-1 carbine rifle. He appeared while 
several soldiers were inside the Big Star Market buying mops, brooms and 
laundry soap. A sergeant told him he wasn't authorized to buy the weapon under 
the Army's guns-for-money program, and he referred him to headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have no transportation," the attache said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry, but we can't take you," the sergeant said. "We have no authority."

CORONER'S OFFICE A PRIME TARGET OF SIMPSON DEFENSE; TRIAL: WORK DESCRIBED BY 
DEPUTY EXAMINER WHO HANDLED AUTOPSIES IS QUESTIONED. HIS BOSS CALLS HIM 
'COMPETENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A homicide detective walked into the Los Angeles County morgue a few years 
back and asked Deputy Medical Examiner Irwin L. Golden what he was up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, according to the officer, responded by bending over a suicide victim 
and wrapping the still-attached noose around his own neck. "I'm just hanging 
around with my friend here," the detective quoted Golden as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, stories about Golden's style and performance have generally stayed 
within the circle of hardened veterans who work Los Angeles homicides. But as 
the man who performed the autopsies on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, Golden -- rightly or wrongly -- now finds himself in the public 
spotlight focused on the O.J. Simpson murder probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden has become a target in the defense strategy of attacking virtually 
everyone who collected, handled or tested more than 240 pieces of physical 
evidence since the June 12 murders. And for defense attorneys seeking to 
undercut the government's case, the 15-year veteran of the county coroner's 
office presents an attractive target -- in part because of his on-the-stand 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes looked tentative or confused when he testified during Simpson's 
preliminary hearing in July, several experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more serious, based on his statements on the witness stand, the 
experts contend he may have mishandled the autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that point will be debated during the trial, records and interviews 
show Golden made mistakes in an October, 1990, shooting case in which he had 
the fatal bullet going the wrong way. A judge dismissed murder charges against 
a suspect in the case after other forensic experts exposed the error, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of such difficulties, prosecutors are scrambling to find another 
pathologist with a national reputation to help with the case. They have been 
turned down by medical examiners in San Francisco and Miami, officials in those 
cities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said that Golden's competence 
will be a "real issue" in one of the most closely watched murder cases in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think that a case of this high profile, they (the coroner's office) 
would want to have their very best people," Cochran said. "And if they had 
their best people on this case, then the citizens of Los Angeles County should 
probably have some questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, 54, declined repeated requests for interviews. But a woman at his 
Burbank home said the deputy medical examiner "doesn't think he has anything to 
defend." 
</P>
<P>
 "He did his job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's chief medical examiner-coroner, Lakshmanan 
Sathyavagiswaran, declined to discuss the Simpson case autopsies. He called 
Golden a "competent" medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys routinely attack how police and coroner's offices gather and 
preserve evidence, especially in murder cases that depend largely on 
circumstantial evidence and scientific results -- such as the Simpson 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal: to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of jurors by implying 
that evidence has been contaminated, samples confused or the chain of custody 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 And, being human, detectives, criminalists and medical examiners almost always 
make mistakes while collecting hair, blood, clothing, gunpowder and other trace 
specimens amid the chaos and pressure of a crime scene, say former prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police departments throughout the world, in the investigative process, 
frequently bungle," said Vincent Bugliosi, the former Los Angeles County deputy 
district attorney who prosecuted the Charles Manson clan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Manson case, Bugliosi worked around the facts that one police officer 
had ruined fingerprints on a gun by grabbing it by the handle, while another 
had lost hair specimens when he dropped the evidence vial and it shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 With the case against their client resting heavily on scientific tests, 
Simpson's attorneys have tried to show similar mistakes in the case against the 
football great, who has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have established in court that police used a criminalist trainee 
to lift some of the most crucial bloodstains at the Bundy Drive murder scene; a 
crime lab employee mislabeled one blood sample; police left Simpson's white 
Ford Bronco unattended for a period of time, and, according to Judge Lance A. 
Ito, a lead detective made "reckless" statements to justify a key search 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugliosi said he doubts that any of these miscues will ruin the case. "I 
expect stuff like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many say the part of the investigation most vulnerable to attack is how 
authorities handled two of the most important pieces of evidence -- the corpses 
of Nicole Simpson and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has reported that detectives disregarded state law and their own 
policy by waiting eight hours before notifying the coroner's office about the 
killings and allowing personnel from that office to inspect the bodies. In a 
nationally televised interview Wednesday, Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
conceded that detectives should have called the morgue sooner and that the 
delay made the coroner's job "more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism also has been aimed at Golden and his handling of the autopsies. A 
board-certified forensic pathologist who joined the coroner's office in 1980, 
Golden has testified in court 700 times and performed 6,500 autopsies, 
including those on some of the Night Stalker victims and on Kitty and Jose 
Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Former colleagues say Golden, who earns nearly $118,000 a year from the 
county, is a competent deputy medical examiner who does his best in an 
overworked office. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, an outside review performed for the county found that the quality of 
forensic work done by the office was "surprisingly high" despite bad morale, 
marginal facilities and a workload that exceeded a recommended 300 autopsies 
annually per physician. The workload hasn't improved and deputy medical 
examiners continue to average 400 autopsies a year, just to keep pace with a 
caseload that includes 8% of the nation's homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just an assembly line -- cut the body open, make a guess and get it 
going on its way," said a former death scene investigator who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually felt rushed when I was there," said a former deputy medical 
examiner who left the office in the late 1980s. "I started out doing 600 
autopsies a year, then down to 500 a year. When I left, I was down to 450 to 
475 a year, but a third of those were homicides" -- the most difficult to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The former employee said work was further complicated by "crowded, antiquated 
and depressing" conditions in which doctors compete for operating tables, vie 
for the attention of assistants and deal with a backlog of bodies stored in the 
hallways. On a recent visit, the former pathologist noted that things had 
gotten worse -- leaks in the roof, crumbling plaster and a bad odor. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Leslie Abramson likens the coroner's office to "a Model T 
jalopy going down the road." She said Golden "knows how to drive but isn't 
given all of the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson, who defended Erik Menendez in his first murder trial, which ended in 
a hung jury, said Golden is honest and capable, despite differences she has had 
with him in court. She won an acquittal in the so-called Blak and Bloo 
nightclub murders, in part, by calling in an expert to dispute Golden's opinion 
that one of the murder victims could have moved after a bullet tore through his 
aorta, records and interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Golden's real problem is how he comes across. "Dr. Golden is not 
smooth, slick or overly articulate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 His behavior outside the courtroom came to public attention when, a few weeks 
after grueling testimony in Simpson's preliminary hearing, he allegedly waved 
something that looked like a gun in the lobby of the coroner's office and, 
according to police, said words to the effect of: "This is all you need to take 
out six or seven lawyers!" 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigated, but the city attorney did not charge Golden because 
authorities believed he meant it as a joke and could not determine whether the 
object was a real gun or a prop. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's spokesman denied that Golden ever made fun of corpses, as in the 
incident described by the homicide detective, but said some employees often 
adopt a gallows humor to cope with the gruesome nature of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when there is a levity involved," said spokesman Scott 
Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier also said millions of television viewers may have "gotten the wrong 
impression" about Golden because his "movements . . . and answers in court" 
betrayed nervousness from being in the glare of the Simpson case spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 But, based on his own testimony, some forensic experts fault Golden for what 
he says he did in the autopsy room. They believe he failed to perform some 
important tests or save evidence that may be crucial in the Simpson case, 
deficiencies that reflect on the coroner's office in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro attacked Golden's credentials by 
noting that the curriculum vitae he submitted to court was three-quarters of a 
page, listed no academic appointments and showed he had co-authored one 
four-page article in the last five years. Golden said he gives "intramural" 
lectures to his colleagues. The coroner's office declined to release Golden's 
resume to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, better-known medical examiners such as Werner U. Spitz of 
Michigan, author of a widely used text for forensic pathology, and Boyd 
Stephens of San Francisco have resumes listing pages of work experience, 
professional lectures, publications and service with professional associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-page resume for Stephens, who turned down a request from prosecutors to 
help with the Simpson case, shows that he wrote seven articles and a book 
chapter in the last five years and has given 51 seminars, meetings or lectures 
to outside groups since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 During a July 7 preliminary hearing, Golden testified about the autopsies on 
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. He acknowledged that no rape test was 
performed on Nicole Simpson. He said it was up to police to request the tests, 
but Spitz and others say rape kits are routine autopsy procedures in murders 
involving women. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden also testified that he discarded Nicole Simpson's stomach contents, 
which he examined to help determine the time of death. Experts said he should 
have saved those contents because they are evidence and subject to further 
examination. Golden testified that he saved the contents from Goldman's 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a particularly tense exchange with Shapiro, the deputy medical examiner 
conceded that he never matched the wounds on the victims against a knife that 
police brought to the morgue because they believed it was similar to the murder 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asks you to check to see, and you're telling us that you didn't think it 
was indicated for you to perform a proper evaluation?" Shapiro asked in the 
July 8 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I said it could be, it could be the weapon that caused some of the 
wounds, including the cutting wounds. It was a single edge, it had a single 
sharp cutting edge, and it's obviously consistent with many of the slashing 
wounds, and I, it was a six-inch blade, and, at the time, we didn't think it 
indicate, or I didn't think it indicated to go through each wound, wound by 
wound . . . to try to exclude that weapon. That can be done at some other 
time," Golden said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You understand a man is sitting in jail, faced with charges of double 
homicide, do you not? . . . When would you suggest doing that to protect his 
rights?" Shapiro asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now?" Golden replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyril H. Wecht, former Allegheny County, Pa., medical examiner and past 
president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, called the failure to 
perform a rape test "unforgivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wecht -- who is controversial among medical examiners because he often 
testifies for the defense -- also contended that Golden's failure to match the 
knife with the wounds on the bodies was the "most serious flaw" in the 
autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution cannot go to trial with Golden alone," Wecht said. Asked to 
describe the way the autopsies were performed, Wecht added: "I would use words 
like 'inadequate,' 'incomplete' and 'scientifically imprecise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wecht, now a private consultant living in Connecticut, based his comments on 
court testimony. The Los Angeles coroner's office will not publicly release the 
autopsy reports for Simpson and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 His boss has admitted that Golden committed errors in his work after another 
double homicide: the Oct. 3, 1990, killings of Ronald Gay and Linda Louis 
Phillips, shot to death while sitting in a car on West 81st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the car's back window shattered and two spent bullets inside, homicide 
investigators believed that Gay and Phillips had been gunned down from outside 
the car. Golden's autopsies supported that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden concluded that Gay had been shot from a distance. "There was no 
evidence of close-range firing on the skin surrounding the gunshot entrance 
wound," Golden wrote in his November, 1990, autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 He also concluded that Phillips died when a bullet entered her right arm, went 
into her right side and came out through her back, just left of the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wrong. Additional forensic tests commissioned by defense attorney 
Charles L. Linder, who represented a man accused in the murders, showed that 
Golden had it backward. Phillips had actually been shot in the back, with the 
bullet coming out through her right arm, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Gay's wound, Golden made no mention of an abrasion to the upper 
left of the bullet hole, marks that Linder's experts said indicated a "pressure 
contact" wound like the kind caused when a firearm is pressed against the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, Superior Court Judge William Pounders agreed to dismiss charges 
against Linder's client, who had been convicted of an unrelated slaying and is 
now in prison. After the dismissal, Linder filed court papers outlining 
scientific evidence showing that Golden committed "significant errors of a 
critical nature" and that the victims were shot by someone sitting in the back 
seat, not outside the car. A district attorney's spokeswoman confirmed Friday 
that prosecutors agreed to the dismissal "in the interest of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The new evidence also prompted Golden to change his mind. "Further review of 
the autopsy photographs in conjunction with the forensic report authored by 
(Linder's expert) leads me to conclude that the entrance wound was on the back 
and the exit on the right arm, having passed from back to front through the 
chest," Golden wrote in an addendum to the Phillips autopsy on June 21, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to questions recently submitted by The Times, Los 
Angeles coroner-medical examiner Sathyavagiswaran said: "Dr. Golden did make an 
error when he indicated that the bullet entered through the arm and exited in 
the back. I agree with opinions that a deputy medical examiner should be able 
to tell the difference between an entrance wound and an exit wound." He added, 
however, that certain conditions can make it difficult to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all make mistakes, but we deputy medical examiners are always ready to 
acknowledge our errors and rectify them as indicated by the addendum Dr. Golden 
issued on the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sathyavagiswaran also said that Golden made a mistake in not discovering the 
contact wound to Gay and that he has directed Golden to change that autopsy as 
well -- four years after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how these or any other mistakes might come back to haunt Golden in the 
Simpson trial is open to question. But defense attorney Cochran said he will 
attempt to bring the deputy medical examiner's past performance to the jury's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the triers of fact need to know that," Cochran said.

 During the past three years, members of the Los Angeles City Council have 
diverted more than $130,000 intended for public service and neighborhood 
cleanup programs to pay for their staffs' salaries, city records show. 
</P>
<P>
 With the entire council's approval, 10 members have almost routinely 
transferred money from the $20,000 annual city allotment given to each of the 
15 council members for donation to nonprofit and other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. I'm shocked," said Nina Royal, an activist involved in graffiti 
cleanup and neighborhood patrols in Sunland-Tujunga. "If it's allotted for 
community projects, it should not go to staff." 
</P>
<P>
 It is legal and within the council's jurisdiction to spend the funds on 
salaries, but that use clashes with the council's original intent for the 
money: to help community groups fight crime, blight, gangs, graffiti and other 
social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 City records show that between July, 1991, and June, 1994, 10 past and present 
council members transferred a total of $130,407 to their office salary accounts 
from their public service and cleanup accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Ferraro transferred the most, using nearly $43,000 during the 
past three years to pay staff salaries, according to the city records. 
Councilman Joel Wachs diverted the second-highest total, nearly $39,000 during 
the same period, the records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service and cleanup accounts--which each contain $10,000 
annually--are provided in addition to each council office's annual $640,882 
budget, which pays salaries for the council members and their staffs. Council 
President Ferraro has a $680,367 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although $130,000 may sound like a small amount of money, it represents 
hundreds of potential grants, which can be the lifeblood of community 
organizations. When the money has been donated, it has normally been given out 
in increments of between $250 and $2,500 to local business groups, police 
support organizations, anti-gang programs, recreation centers, arts 
foundations, and for beach cleanup efforts and school field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members who used the money for salaries instead of donations to 
community groups defend their actions, saying the money they spent on staff 
salaries or training helps their offices better serve their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro, whose district includes parts of North Hollywood, said he believes 
the best use for some of the money was to pay his staff so they could better 
respond to problems raised by constituents. He was uncertain whether the money 
allowed him to hire additional staff or simply maintain his current staff, but 
he said he was sure it did not pay for raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are a lot of groups that would like to have the money, but we 
have to decide how best to serve the district," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wachs spokesman said that in past years Wachs has donated money from the 
accounts to community groups but that this year all the money was used to 
retain staff that would have otherwise been eliminated by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of which way we chose to help our district," said Greg Nelson, 
an aide to Wachs, whose district stretches from Sunland-Tujunga to Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 News of how the money was spent sparked criticism from other city officials, 
taxpayer watchdog groups and nonprofit organizations that depend on such 
donations. But some community leaders were reticent about publicly criticizing 
the council members, saying they feared their comments would cause them to 
receive even less money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-ranking city official who asked not to be identified said the use of 
such money for salaries sends the wrong message to other city departments, 
which have coped with a hiring freeze and pay cuts for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give the departments the message to trim and look for ways to save money, 
and I think the council should live up to that message," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mathes, executive director of the California Environmental Project, a 
statewide group that has used volunteers to clean up the canyons in Wachs' 
district, said he has mixed feelings about how Wachs has spent the funds. Wachs 
has donated to his group in the past, and Mathes said he would like to receive 
further contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that by donating to smaller organizations like ours he would be 
showing that he cares for his community," Mathes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions about how the money could best be spent varied widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Mahfet, executive director of the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber 
of Commerce, said he didn't even know the council members had money to donate 
to community groups. And although he declined to criticize council members who 
spent the money on salaries, Mahfet said he hopes to get donations in the 
future from Wachs and Ferraro, the two councilmen who represent the chamber's 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully both will be of a mind to share with us," Mahfet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal, the Sunland-Tujunga activist, suggested that it could be used to help 
equip the city's Police Department with new crime-fighting tools, such as 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Councilwoman Laura Chick this year donated all $20,000 from her two 
accounts to the West Valley Police Activity League, a law enforcement booster 
organization that has donated computers and other equipment to the LAPD's West 
Valley bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick was among six past and present council members who did not divert any 
money to salary accounts during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents portions of the northeast San 
Fernando Valley, did transfer $9,197 from the two accounts to his salary budget 
last year, according to records. However, Alarcon's chief of staff, Annette 
Castro, said the money was transferred at the end of the fiscal year so that it 
would not divert back to the city's General Fund. She said the money remains in 
Alarcon's budget, and he has not yet decided how it will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's guidelines, if money from the two $10,000 accounts is not 
spent by the end of the fiscal year, it reverts to the city's General Fund and 
can be used to pay police salaries, street paving or any other city expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the amounts in the community donation accounts make up only a 
fraction of the city's overall $4.3-billion annual budget, the transfers 
provide a rare look at the power city lawmakers have to move money around from 
about half a dozen "discretionary" accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members can tap accounts to pay for work-related travel, conferences, 
meals and receptions. Each council member is also allowed to have an 
"officeholder account" that is funded by donations from supporters to pay for 
governmental, legislative and political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service and cleanup accounts for nonprofit organizations were 
created by the City Council in 1987 in an attempt to end the squabbling among 
council members over money for pet projects, which broke out every year when 
the city's budget was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 To quiet the rancor and debate, the council created the two accounts and put 
$10,000 in each so that every council member would have a predetermined amount 
to donate to worthy causes within his or her district. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service account was designed "to provide services that yield direct 
benefit to the public within the council districts," according to city records. 
The cleanup account was created "to provide community cleanup and graffiti 
removal services within each district," records say. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has the legal power to move the money out of those accounts 
and spend them as the council sees fit, said Deputy City Controller Tim Lynch. 
However, this can only be done with the approval of the entire council, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That approval was granted 30 times in the three-year period and rarely was 
there any debate or discussion about whether it was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there have been a few occasions when council members took 
the opposite tack, subtracting money from their salary account to make 
donations to community groups and cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Councilman Marvin Braude diverted a total of $2,800 
from his salary budgets to community groups. Last year, then-Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi spent $1,170 from his salary accounts on such groups. Account 
Transfers 
</P>
<P>
 Each member of the Los Angeles City Council is allotted $10,000 to donate to 
public service groups and $10,000 for cleanup programs. But over the past three 
years, council members have transferred more than $130,000 from those accounts 
to pay for staff salaries. A look at some of these transfers during the past 
three years.

FIRE SUSPECT WAS JAILED AT THE TIME, OFFICIAL SAYS; ARSON: DIRECTOR OF MEXICAN 
LOCKUP CALLS IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT TRANSIENT WHO CONFESSED COULD HAVE SET LAGUNA 
BLAZE. 
</P>

<P>
 The man charged with igniting last year's destructive Laguna Beach firestorm 
was behind bars in a jail in Mazatlan, Mexico, at the time of the blaze, the 
jail director told a Mexican journalist on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican government records indicate that 26-year-old Jose Soto Martinez was 
jailed May 15, 1993, and did not leave until July 8, 1994, said journalist 
Fernando Zepeda Hurtado, who spoke to the jail director on behalf of the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach fire erupted on Oct. 27, 1993. It damaged or destroyed 441 
homes and caused $528 million in damage after it raced up Laguna Canyon and 
scorched more than 14,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, arrested Sept. 16 in Fullerton after he was caught lighting small 
fires behind an apartment complex, has confessed to setting those fires and the 
Laguna blaze, authorities said. On Friday, he was charged with four felony 
arson counts and could face a maximum of 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leticia Aguayo, director of the El Cerezo jail in Mazatlan, told the 
Mexican journalist that it would be impossible for the former prisoner to have 
set the fire during the time he was imprisoned for residential burglary. He 
paid an undisclosed fine on the day of his release from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement authorities were expected in Mazatlan on Sunday 
to retrieve the jail's records, Zepeda Hurtado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez served time in Mexico under the name of Jaime Saile Higuera. His 
family knows him as "Jaime." The birth date on Higuera's prison forms matches 
Martinez's birth date. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim that Martinez was in jail and could not have set the Laguna fire was 
supported by family members at the home of Martinez's 52-year-old mother, Maria 
Teresa Campos, in Fullerton on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos and her family met with investigators from the Orange County district 
attorney's office for more than an hour Saturday night. They taped interviews 
with family members, took the prison documents to make copies and said they 
would review the case to determine whether charges should be dropped, said 
investigator David E. Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Urbina, 29, Martinez's brother-in-law, said the family had proof that 
Martinez was in jail, doing about a year-and-a-half sentence, during the Laguna 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the papers," he said. "We have proof. When the Laguna Beach fire 
happened he was in El Cerezo." 
</P>
<P>
 Urbina, who lives in Tijuana with Miriam Urbina, Martinez's sister, said 
Martinez "told lies because he thought people we're following him and wanted to 
kill him. He was afraid. They were real fears." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking exhausted, Urbina said that he did not believe his brother-in-law was 
delusional but that he lied because he genuinely believed his life was in 
danger from those in Mazatlan whose house he broke into. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite evidence that Martinez might not have started the Laguna fire, some 
law enforcement officials were still confident that they had the correct 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley, one of several law enforcement 
officials who triumphantly announced Friday that the case had been broken, said 
Saturday that he remains confident authorities have charged the right man. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first I've heard of an alibi," McKinley said, adding that the 
department was unaware Martinez had any relatives here before the charges were 
filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll check this out. If he was in a jail at that time, it should be easy 
enough to find out. You know, mothers will say anything for their sons. I've 
got six months' pay that says he set that fire. I'd be shocked if he was in 
jail at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos and three family members arrived at the Orange County Jail early 
Saturday morning before the start of visitation hours. As she waited to see her 
son in what would be their first meeting in weeks, Campos perused newspaper 
accounts of her son's arrest and confession to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if it were possible that her son could have ignited the fires, she 
emphatically replied, "No, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 25-minute visit, Campos descended the stairs, wiping tears from her 
eyes. "I can't talk right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Campos was unaware that her son was in custody. She filed a 
missing persons report with Fullerton police on Sept. 19. She gave them a 
photograph of her son, but police did not immediately make the connection that 
Campos' son was Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbina, Martinez's brother-in-law, said Martinez lived with him and his wife 
in Tijuana after his release from prison, and Martinez got a job fumigating at 
local markets. Martinez has also lived with relatives in Corona and with his 
mother and stepfather in Fullerton but was not a transient, Urbina said. 
Martinez's father, Urbina said, lives in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Martinez had a job making aluminum doors in Fullerton, Urbina said. 
Campos, his mother, is a diabetic and extremely distraught over the ordeal, 
family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said the jail story "throws an 
interesting wrinkle into the mix that must be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first I've heard of it," Purcell said of the possible alibi. 
"Clearly, no one would want to have the wrong person sitting in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Purcell also said there is substantial evidence that continues 
to point to Martinez as the prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "From everything I am aware of, it is pretty conclusive. I would defy anyone 
to lead you to the exact spot where the fire started," Purcell said, adding 
that Martinez did just that for authorities last week. "A year has passed, 
there were backfires set and some of the grass has grown back. It would be very 
difficult to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police arrested Martinez on Sept. 16 after authorities said he 
admitted he set fires behind a community college district administration office 
and in the laundry room of an adjacent apartment complex. He later made 
statements implicating himself in the Laguna fire, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, an illegal immigrant, told authorities he set the Laguna fire to 
conjure up a demon king named "Gotam." The suspect's knowledge of details 
surrounding the start of the fire added credibility to his claims, 
investigators said. In addition to leading investigators to the exact location 
where the fire started, he also claimed to use matches -- without an accelerant 
-- which is also consistent with the investigator's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young said investigators with the 
district attorney's office would be responsible for determining the validity of 
the family's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 District Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, who announced the filing of charges against 
Martinez on Friday, said then he was comfortable with the case against 
Martinez, despite the fact that it is not uncommon for people, particularly 
firebugs, to claim responsibility for large fires. Capizzi also said at the 
news conference that investigators were still piecing together Martinez's 
whereabouts before and after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi could not be reached for comment Saturday.

</P>
<P>
 "We have the papers," he said. "We have proof. When the Laguna Beach fire

WILSON VETOES BAN ON RESALE OF SEIZED GUNS; POLICE: GOVERNOR SAYS CRIMINALS 
WILL FIND OTHER WAYS TO GET FIREARMS AND THAT MANY LAW AGENCIES NEED THE 
REVENUE. MEASURE'S AUTHOR ACCUSES HIM OF CAVING IN TO THE NRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has vetoed a measure that would have stopped police agencies 
from auctioning off the firearms that they confiscate from criminals rather 
than destroying them. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of financially strapped police and sheriff's departments have used 
the auctions to raise money. But the practice has been widely criticized at a 
time when several communities are trying to reduce the number of weapons on 
their streets with highly publicized buyback programs -- offering tickets to 
rock concerts and sports events and other prizes in exchange for guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in vetoing the bill late Friday, argued that the measure by 
Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San Diego) was "chiefly symbolic" -- that it would 
not prevent criminals from acquiring guns by theft or on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also contended that the money from auctioning off the weapons to 
licensed dealers was needed to put more police in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotch accused the governor of playing politics with the measure by caving in 
to the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why the governor would want Saturday night specials, gang 
guns, or copycat assault weapons recycled into our communities," Gotch said in 
a statement Saturday. "Given that the primary opposition to (the bill) was the 
NRA, it looks like this veto was motivated purely by politics and not public 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The confiscated firearms, Gotch has argued, provide a relatively cheap source 
of guns. Used weapons often sell for a fraction of the cost of new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in his veto message, contended that the impact on the availability of 
guns to criminals "would prove illusory." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than reducing the number of weapons available to criminals," the 
governor wrote, "the real effect of this measure would more likely be simply to 
create a greater market for the gun manufacturers who regularly supply licensed 
gun dealers. If confiscated weapons are not available to dealers, the dealers 
will instead purchase newly manufactured weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he could appreciate the symbolic value of the bill, "which I in no 
way demean. . . . But I am reluctant to take a symbolic step which has the 
practical effect of denying needed revenues to police chiefs and sheriffs who 
presently use the proceeds of gun sales to enhance the safety of their 
communities by putting more officers on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 In his often-uphill battle to win passage for the measure, Gotch won the 
support of a number of local governments and law enforcement groups, including 
the cities of Los Angeles and Anaheim, the Peace Officers Research Assn. of 
California, Assn. of Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriffs, and Los Angeles Police 
Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Wilson noted, some law enforcement agencies opposed the measure because 
they depend on the hundreds of thousands of dollars generated by the weapons 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the governor has signed bills that increase penalties for 
illegal possession of firearms, regulate the possession of weapons by minors, 
require training for gun buyers, and permit judges to confiscate guns from 
spouse abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line with the governor, he is a strong supporter of a person's 
right to personally protect themselves, particularly women," Wilson press 
secretary Sean Walsh said. "And he feels they are entitled to have a handgun to 
protect themselves. But he also feels that with that gun comes enormous 
responsibilities."

FAMILY FEUD; ORANGE COUNTY HEIRESS DENIES SON'S CONTENTION THAT SHE SHUNNED HIS 
WEDDING LAST MONTH BECAUSE OF BRIDE'S WORKING-CLASS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To hear Morton Irvine Smith tell the story, he gave up $100 million for love. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Huntington Beach mutual funds salesman, a presumed heir to one of 
Southern California's wealthiest founding clans, would not be denied the "love 
of my life" even if Mom could not deal with his fiancee's working-class Boston 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when young Morton would not cancel his date at the altar with Marianne 
Campbell two weeks ago, Orange County's Joan Irvine Smith -- as told by Morton 
-- simply voided her son's inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, according to Morton, mirrors King Edward VIII's celebrated 
abdication of power and wealth to marry the love of his life, Wallis Warfield 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the very private walls of his parents' estates in San Juan 
Capistrano and Middleburg, Va., they are telling a much different story. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview, Joan Irvine Smith confirmed only one element of the 
story: "that (the marriage) will be a continuing cause of estrangement of 
Morton from the rest of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that she comes from a middle-class family has nothing to do with 
it," said Smith, comfortably sunk in a living-room chair with bare feet propped 
up on a puffy ottoman. "It was how she conducted herself over the 10 years I've 
known her. She was very antagonistic toward my relationship with my son." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the remainder of the tale, she said, "I trust that many will put as 
much credence in this story as in the periodic rumors that Elvis lives." 
</P>
<P>
 And she takes particular umbrage at the fact that Morton invited the National 
Enquirer to cover his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morton's actions have now created the public spectacle of talk show debate 
and continued media attention, which have caused even greater strain on family 
relationships than his marriage to Marianne Campbell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morton's father, Morton Whister (Cappy) Smith, the real story 
could be taken straight from the script of the movie "Arthur," with young 
Morton playing the lead role of a care-free, carousing party animal who has 
done his best to embarrass the family. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a role, his dad suggested, that Morton has played better than Dudley 
Moore did on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid is nothing more than a bum," the elder Smith said, adding that "the 
boy" struck a fatal blow in their father-son relationship when a wedding guest 
told the National Enquirer that Cappy Smith did not attend because he feared 
being cut off from his ex-wife's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you act common, you are a commoner," said the legendary 79-year-old 
horseman who runs his own horse breeding operation. "Nobody with an ounce of 
sense would do that to his family. As far as I'm concerned he's not my son. I 
don't love him. I think he's a s---." For a family whose members closely guard 
their privacy, the public airing of such personal matters is unusual but far 
from unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Joan Irvine Smith has fought very public battles with the Irvine 
Co. -- the vast barony founded by her great-grandfather -- in attempts to 
protect her inheritance. In her last legal bout with the company, she won a 
$149 million judgment for the family's share of the real estate empire sold in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the family's most intriguing drama, however, played out in 1959 but 
still remains a mystery in some quarters. In what is known as the 
"double-bullet suicide," Myford Plum Irvine, then president of the Irvine Co., 
was found dead in the family ranch house after suffering shotgun blasts in the 
abdomen and head. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years after the fact, rumors continue to circulate that Irvine had 
rung up large Las Vegas gambling debts and that they may have been somehow 
related to his death. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), a former 
Irvine Co. executive, said the prominent executive's death became the subject 
of national speculation, particularly after a coroner ruled it a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a family who owned one-fifth of an entire county," 
Ferguson said. "No one's ever written the real story about them. If it were, it 
would be one of the most interesting stories ever written about life in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a family whose patriarchs and matriarchs have schmoozed with 
presidents, foreign dignitaries and movie stars, while largely avoiding the 
glitz and other trappings of celebrity. Not to mention the unflattering focus 
of the tabloid press. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that concern for discretion and decorum appeared to go out the window 
last month, when Morton, 29, set off a full-scale family feud by proceeding 
down the aisle with Campbell, a Long Beach nurse, trailed by Enquirer 
photographers and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said he does not regret the decision to allow the tabloid to cover the 
event. He said he received no payment for the story, which Enquirer reporter 
Dani Cestaro described as having "romance and everything our readers are 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be fun to have them there," Morton said of the paper. "I 
wasn't looking for the cheap shot. . . . I thought middle-class America would 
eat this up." 
</P>
<P>
 What has "sickened" him, however, in the days since his Sept. 16 nuptials is 
the article's reference to his father and the purported reason that he, like 
Morton's mother, did not attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father is like a god to me," Morton said. "He is the definition of a 
gentleman. He is the finest rider who ever lived and the world knows it. I had 
no idea about the severity with which (the Enquirer) was approaching this 
thing. I told them that my dad was not to be discussed. . . . I wonder whether 
my kids will ever get to know my father now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and father, however, contend that the Enquirer's presence was invited 
out of sheer spite, a reflection of her youngest child's "immaturity." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no conception of what marriage and commitment means," said Joan Irvine 
Smith, 61, herself four times divorced. "He likes to throw his weight and name 
around, and he really has never done anything on his own. And some of this 
would become embarrassing to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morton doesn't listen to anyone," she said. "I've worked hard in my life. I 
didn't sleep until noon and go out and drink all night. I was not in favor of 
any marriage for him right now, particularly not this marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Cappy Smith said: "He grew up laying around the pool with a beer in his hand 
nursing a hangover and waiting to start another one. How long would you like to 
watch that? Every man who has a son hopes for something great. He's been a 
thorn in my side. He's the black sheep of the family all right, with a big bell 
hanging round his neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Morton is the only child from Cappy Smith's 16-year marriage to Joan, 
which ended in divorce in 1979, the father said he feels closer to Joan's two 
other sons, born in her previous marriages to Charles Swinden and Russell S. 
Penniman III. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other boys (James Irvine Swinden and Russell S. Penniman IV) graduated 
from good colleges," Cappy Smith said. "Russell went to the Naval Academy, and 
Jimmy went to Wharton Business School. . . . All (Morton) carried was a belly 
full of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton admits that he has long been "accused of having too much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the dinner table, I could always tell a good story," he said, laughing. He 
said the family does not appreciate how hard he has worked to become a 
successful mutual fund salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a bigger kick in the teeth than them saying, 'We don't think 
enough of your character to be (at the wedding),' " Morton said. "If my family 
were there, none of this would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 For Morton's parents, though, their son's character was not the only 
consideration in their decision not to bless the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith disputed the contention that Campbell's middle-class roots 
sparked the family's disapproval of the marriage. "You can be from 
(working-class) Boston and conduct yourself like a lady. It had nothing to do 
with her background." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Smith and Campbell, a 30-year-old pediatric oncology nurse at Long 
Beach Memorial Medical Center, both admit that their relationship was rocky 
from the start. And it did not improve even after Irvine Smith took Campbell on 
a chauffeur-driven shopping spree in Beverly Hills shortly after they met. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who has likened the venture to the make-over in the movie "Pretty 
Woman," said Irvine Smith wanted to buy her a new wardrobe because Morton's 
mother "didn't like the way I dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Smith said Campbell was generally ungrateful. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after, Irvine Smith said, she always hoped that the relationship 
would somehow "go off the track" it was on. But, she said, the "last straw" 
came at a family Christmas dinner three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the whole clan -- including family matriarch Athalie Clarke -- assembled 
at The Oaks ranch in San Juan Capistrano, Irvine Smith said her three sons 
stood -- one by one -- to pay tribute to her with toasts. When it was Morton's 
turn, Irvine Smith said, Campbell "rose from her seat and shouted, 'Goddammit, 
Morton, stop brown-nosing your mother!' " 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Irvine Smith said, the room "fell dead silent and Morton struggled 
to complete his toast. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said his mother's version of events is inaccurate at best. At the time, 
Morton said, he and his wife were seated at a side table when Campbell made a 
private quip. Morton said that it was not disparaging in any way toward his 
mother and that Campbell did not stand or shout, as his mother suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, I didn't even know this was a big deal," Morton said. "You're talking 
about someone who is paranoid here. My mother is the type of person who thinks 
there are cameras everywhere and guns are pointed at her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets her information from a network of untruths that are forming her 
reality about me. I have nothing against my parents. I love my parents. In a 
lot of ways, I think I'm just like my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, Joan Irvine Smith has been listening as the family feud 
has taken wings. It has been the subject of radio talk shows, on which gossipy 
hosts have been trading quips at the expense of the Irvine family name. 
</P>
<P>
 And residents, some familiar with the family and its long history in Orange 
County, have been listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said he was somewhat taken aback when he heard of Irvine Smith's 
reaction to her son's determination to go his own way and against her wishes, 
because of "her own history" as fiercely independent in personal and business 
affairs. "This is out of character for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought she would be proud of her kid for cutting out on his 
own," Ferguson said. "She certainly hasn't lived life according to society's 
established rules. There may be more to this than we need to know, or have a 
right to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has had limited contact with Joan Irvine Smith, former Irvine Mayor 
Sally Anne Sheridan said the story does not surprise her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not somebody I would consider to be a warm and fuzzy person," Sheridan 
said. "She wants what she wants. A lot of rich people own and disown their 
kids. When you parallel their lives with other wealthy people from Newport 
Beach or other places, I don't think it would be much different." 
</P>
<P>
 How concerned is Irvine Smith about how this is playing in Orange County 
society circles? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully," she said, "people will see this for what it is. A lot of people I 
have heard from don't understand how any son could attack his mother over 
personal differences." The Orange County Dynasty 
</P>

ON CALIFORNIA: BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The storm had passed. The last clouds were visible to the east, stacked 
against the Sierra. The sky over the San Joaquin Valley was a brilliant blue. 
An after-scent of rain hung in the air, along with the sweet, sticky smell of 
grapes ripening into raisins. A farmer squatted in his vineyard and poked a 
finger deep into the moist dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see," he said, "how much rain we got." 
</P>
<P>
 For growers in this dry land, rain most often is regarded as a blessing -- 
free water. "Pray for rain" is a common valley mantra. There are certain times, 
though, when an unexpected shower can ruin a crop. It can rot peaches, say, 
split pomegranates, stain cotton or abort the ancient process by which grapes 
are dried by the sun into raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of those times. Almost a third of the valley's raisin crop had 
been drying on the ground, exposed, when the rains came. It poured all 
Wednesday. The morning after, growers headed warily into the muddy vineyards to 
take stock. With luck, much of the crop could be salvaged, but there would be 
damage and higher costs. This particular farmer figured the rain had all but 
wiped out his profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I needed was one more day," he said, exasperated. "If I had gotten the 
pickers when I was supposed to, these raisins would have been in bins, safe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He did not, however, get his pickers on time. Not many farmers did. There was 
a shortage of field hands up and down the valley this year. This might come as 
a surprise to consumers of the screechy campaign rhetoric of Gov. Pete Wilson 
and proponents of Proposition 187, the so-called "save our state" initiative 
that, among other pleasantries, would require schoolteachers to round up 
undocumented children for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is all for it. He declares that California is awash under a brown tide. 
"Invaders," he calls them. This, of course, is dandy political music. A 
majority of Californians appear determined to drive out "illegals." They offer 
the word itself as a trump argument, perhaps forgetting a period in this 
state's history when Dust Bowl migrants also were "illegal" by virtue of the 
short-lived "Anti-Okie law." Wilson seems to have read well the political mood 
on this issue, an anger that was captured best by an author of Proposition 187: 
</P>
<P>
 "You are the posse," he told a gleeful rally in Orange County, "and SOS is the 
rope." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is all good and fine, except a lynch mob won't get the raisins picked. 
Nor will it sew the garments. Or hammer the drywall. Or cut the grass. Or 
baby-sit the children. Or take any of the other fine, low-paying jobs that 
California -- to its dubious credit -- has long reserved for undocumented 
workers. This was the point of Harry Kubo, an influential, and also politically 
conservative, agricultural leader in the valley, who told a Times reporter last 
week: "Let's face it. Fifty percent, if not more, of the agricultural work 
force in this valley is illegal. We'd sink economically without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubo's candor was remarkable, but the observation itself was hardly new. Nine 
years ago, a U.S. senator from California said pretty much the same thing. 
Debating a border bill, the senator warned against attacking illegal 
immigration "at the expense of a significant segment of American agriculture." 
A force of "temporary foreign workers," the senator went on, was "essential in 
order to ensure the timely harvest" of crops. 
</P>
<P>
 That senator, by the way, was named Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The raisin crop this year was especially abundant, creating a higher demand 
for workers. Washington state, meanwhile, lured crews away for its apple crop. 
And, finally, both legal and undocumented pickers alike seemed to sense the 
increasing hostility and stayed home. Said one grower: "They just don't want 
the hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, Proposition 187 proponents already can claim a success. They 
are beginning to scare away undocumented workers, and with a victory in 
November maybe they can go all the way. The question, then, will become: Who 
will do the dirty work? Who will take the low pay? The fantasy of Proposition 
187 supporters seems to be that once California is cleansed of its illegal 
menace, welfare recipients can be coerced into the fields, killing the 
proverbial two birds with one stone. These SOS people are nothing if not 
dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer who stood in his vineyard had his doubts. He's a conservative, but 
also a realist. After his labor contractor failed to deliver pickers on time, 
he went looking for workers at unemployment offices throughout the valley. He 
promised good pay, good conditions, the works, but also a lot of sweat. There 
were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one," he said, "wanted to do this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, it started to rain.

MOSCOW TO INVESTIGATE STUDENT'S DEATH

<P>
 Prosecutors are opening an investigation into the death of an American 
exchange student who was found strangled outside his Moscow dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Riccio, 21, of Glastonbury, Conn., was apparently thrown off a 
16th-floor balcony Sept. 20 after being killed.Russian police at first 
suggested he had committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary autopsy said Riccio had been murdered. The U.S. Embassy said 
"laboratory tests showed no drugs or alcohol in Mr. Riccio's blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown University junior arrived in Moscow last month to study for a year 
at Russian State University for the Humanities in the American Collegiate 
Consortium program sponsored by Middlebury College in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other Americans in Riccio's program were moved out of the dormitory and 
will continue their studies outside Moscow.

SLOVAK VOTERS REJECT WESTERN CAPITALISM; EUROPE: PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER VLADIMIR MECIAR RETURNING TO POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters here issued a clear rebuke of Western-style capitalism Saturday, 
handing the party of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar a strong election 
victory, according to preliminary results and exit polls after two days of 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar, who was ousted from power in March amid allegations of corruption and 
obstructing Slovakia's economic reforms, was expected to fall short of winning 
an absolute majority. But his likely coalition partners were doing well enough 
to ensure a Meciar-led government control of the 150-seat Slovak Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "These results are in total opposition to the principles of a market economy," 
said Iveta Radicova of the Institute for Central European Studies. "The 
majority of voters are saying what they really want is state paternalism -- a 
continued strong role of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial results showed Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
collecting nearly 34% of the vote, more than triple the tally of second-place 
Common Choice, one of several parties that have been governing since Meciar's 
2-year-old government was toppled in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar, a former amateur boxer and two-time prime minister, had been plotting 
his comeback almost since the moment he lost his job. In appeals heavy on 
patriotism and personal charisma, he has visited villages and workplaces across 
the economically depressed country promising everything from higher retirement 
benefits to tougher policies against Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Above all, we showed voters that we wanted to continue the path we started in 
1992," Augustin Marian Huska of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia told 
Slovak television Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing caretaker government had won praise from Western governments and 
economic organizations for putting Slovakia back on a path of economic 
transformation. But voters, apparently frustrated by the hardship of moving 
from communism to capitalism, turned once again to Meciar, who has pledged to 
soften the blow by cutting taxes and keeping government control of many 
state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we expected is being confirmed," said Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, who 
defected from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia in March after becoming 
disillusioned with Meciar. "Six months is too short a time to change political 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Milan Ftacnik, an official with the Party of the Democratic Left, accused 
Meciar of winning over Slovaks with "cheap promises" and populist rhetoric that 
promises only to further isolate Slovakia from its European neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ftacnik, a former Communist, warned that Meciar and the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia have yet to demonstrate that they can provide the political 
stability sorely lacking in Slovakia since the breakup of Czechoslovakia almost 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have shown that they can win elections but cannot govern on a basis of 
coalition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moravcik and other political leaders, appearing Saturday evening on televised 
round-table discussions, said it was still possible for a broad-based coalition 
of Meciar's opponents to form a government. Meciar's critics had warned during 
the campaign that his return would spell economic and political disaster for 
Slovakia, a fear that had been real enough to bring together former Communists 
and the religious right in the caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the likelihood of another anti-Meciar coalition grew increasingly unlikely 
as results were tallied. Early projections showed that one potential coalition 
partner was not even garnering the 5% of votes needed for parties to enter 
Parliament, while the other parties were all faring worse than pre-election 
surveys had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a disappointment for us," said Frantisek Miklosko, deputy chairman of 
the Christian Democratic Movement, one of the governing coalition partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Official results will not be available until today, but in the meantime Meciar 
is expected to begin pulling together a possible coalition, which will likely 
include the Slovak National Party and the Assn. of Workers of Slovakia, a 
splinter group of former Communists. Together, projections show, the parties 
would control more than 80 seats in the Parliament.

BLOWOUT MARKS CHINESE ANNIVERSARY; ASIA: JUBILEE COMMEMORATES 45 YEARS OF 
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC. RUMORS ABOUT DENG XIAOPING'S HEALTH CAST PALL.

 People agreed that it was the biggest party the Chinese Communists had thrown 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliant fireworks lit the autumn sky, and 100,000 carefully screened party 
faithful assembled in Tian An Men Square and sang the "March of the 
Volunteers." The national anthem's inspiring strains echoed over the adjacent 
Forbidden City, ghostly palace of fallen emperors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics said the party Saturday night was an especially big one because it 
might be one of the last. Such was the edgy mood of China on the 45th 
anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Day party, the first full-scale jubilee held here since 1989, was 
said to have more dancers, more fireworks and more colorful floats than ever 
before. Even the famous painting of Mao Tse-tung in Tian An Men Square was 
retouched and enlarged for the occasion. The painting, its colors softened and 
now measuring 33 square feet, hangs under the rostrum where Mao declared on 
Oct. 1, 1949: "China has stood up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people saw Saturday's celebration as a fitting send-off for 90-year-old 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, said to be hospitalized and widely rumored to 
be gravely ill. Few expect Deng to last until the People's Republic silver 
anniversary in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's alive, but his brain has stopped working. There is no way he can make it 
for five more years," said one foreign resident who has worked for 20 years in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to pave the way for a smooth transition, the official People's Daily 
newspaper in an editorial named Jiang Zemin, the nation's president and the 
Communist Party general secretary, as the natural successor to Mao and Deng. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deng's frailty lent an end-of-a-dynasty atmosphere to the nationally 
televised festivities. The question in many people's minds these days is: Will 
the death of Deng also herald the disintegration of a Communist Party that no 
longer seems in control of a country riding one of the world's hottest 
economies? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the problems that have historically plagued China in times of dynastic 
change are now in evidence. Inflation, the bane of the fallen Nationalists of 
Chiang Kai-shek, is running at an annual rate of 27% in China's major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed to travel under Deng's economic policies, a huge "floating population" 
of between 80 million and 100 million peasants roams the country seeking work, 
mostly in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economic liberalization has come widespread corruption and crime. 
More than 80,000 police officers, out of sight of television cameras, were 
positioned on the periphery of Tian An Men Square to guard against trouble. But 
in the back of the minds of many Beijing residents was the bloody shooting 
incident that took place only the week before a mile west of the sprawling 
central square. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, an army lieutenant stationed in a suburb of the capital, 
reportedly angered after being disciplined for beating a soldier, killed his 
superior officer and four other soldiers. He then hijacked a jeep and drove to 
Beijing, where he killed eight more people, spraying bullets into rush-hour 
traffic on a major road. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident spooked at least part of the populace. A Beijing woman married to 
a party cadre, asked if she was planning to attend the celebration Saturday 
night, answered, "Do you think I want to get shot dead in Tian An Men Square?" 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to previous National Day celebrations in the square, a touch of 
market economy rhetoric replaced political dogma. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly in front of the rostrum where the nation's senior leaders were 
assembled, one banner proclaimed, "Seize the Opportunity to Deepen Reform, 
Expand Opening Up, Promote Development and Maintain Stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from the leadership rostrum was Jiang, the heir apparent. Directly 
opposite him in the sprawling square was Mao's tomb, and written above the 
entrance to the tomb was a giant dedication to Mao. The calligraphy of the 
dedication was that of Hua Guofeng. Hua, like Jiang today, was once the dauphin 
chosen to assume leadership. In a historical footnote that may be sobering to 
Jiang, he lasted in power only a year after Mao died before fading into 
obscurity.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITIANS EXPECT TIDE TO TURN FOR REFUGEES; CARIBBEAN: 
BEACH TOWNS SAW THOUSANDS RISK THE SEA TO FLEE REPRESSION. NOW VILLAGERS HOPE 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL RETURN. 
</P>

<P>
 The half-built wooden boats lining the beach here lie rotting just a few yards 
from the Caribbean and now serve mostly as playgrounds for the children of this 
tiny village. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet just a few months ago, these boats and hundreds like them represented so 
much more: They bore silent testimony to Haiti's searing troubles and the will 
of thousands of its people to find a better life. Ultimately, they helped to 
convince President Clinton that he would have to send U.S. troops to restore 
order and democracy to the impoverished country. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earlier this year, this seaside village of 500 was one of the dozens of 
favored departure points for Haitian refugees seeking to sail to the United 
States on rickety homemade wooden boats. But now that U.S. troops have landed 
and exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is scheduled to return to power, 
the people of Bagadere say they hope and believe that they will see the 
reverse: family and friends coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, here on the central Haitian coast 50 miles from Port-au-Prince, 
Aristide remains a mythic figure of hope to the rural poor. His return is 
widely anticipated among villagers as the magical cure for the nation's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, in remote villages like Bagadere, optimism over the U.S. presence 
remains untarnished by the mounting violence and breakdown of order in cities 
like Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to that presence, the people here are enjoying their first days of 
openly expressing their support for Aristide without fear of the wrath of the 
Haitian police and military. And while the town is too small and too isolated 
to stage its own pro-Aristide demonstrations, it is clear that rural villages 
like Bagadere provide the backbone for Aristide's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the people here said, despite a lack of jobs or food, the presence 
of Aristide and U.S. troops in Haiti should be enough to persuade many who have 
left to return home from the refugee camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba. Perhaps even some who have made it all the way to the United States 
may return as well, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have family in Florida, and I think some will come back once Aristide is 
here again," said Bohomme Phillemon, a Bagadere villager. "I think my mother 
will come home from Miami. Most people here have some family in the U.S. But 
Aristide is the second God of Haiti, and I think some will come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Villager Charles Jadet, standing next to the skeleton of a boat designed to 
hold hundreds of Haitian refugees, added: "We need Aristide; he is the answer. 
Here we have no school, no medicine, no lights. He was going to bring our 
village electricity before he was kicked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the mood was far grimmer in Bagadere, a magnet for poor 
Haitians from all over the country who were seeking a remote place to build or 
buy a raft, far from the prying eyes of the Haitian military and police in 
Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 They would come by bus or taxi, walking in huge groups down dirt paths two or 
three miles in from the main coast road. To avoid paying bribes to the local 
police, they would shove off into the water late at night, hoping to reach the 
shipping lanes of the Caribbean in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people of Bagadere say that the flow of refugees streaming through the 
village all but ended when Clinton announced in late June that the United 
States would reopen a refugee-processing facility at Guantanamo Bay to handle a 
new surge in Haitians being picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a reversal of Clinton's policy announced in May to allow Haitian 
refugees to be interviewed on ships after they were picked up at sea to 
determine whether they could be allowed to enter the United States. That policy 
had given Haitians an incentive to keep trying to reach the United States, but 
the White House policy reversal in June dashed those hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Clinton's policy switch was felt in Bagadere almost immediately. 
"The people were here all the time, getting boats, but then when they said they 
would all go to Cuba, they stopped coming here," said Ulysses Chenet, another 
villager. 
</P>
<P>
 When the number of refugees dwindled, Bagadere was thrust back into isolation, 
with little contact with the outside world except for occasional forays by the 
Haitian police and paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to hide in the sugar cane or in the hills every time until they left," 
recalled Eliphet Mildor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you spoke out about Aristide, you ended up sleeping in the sea," 
added Armanz Subtil. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of U.S. troops in Haiti, the police have vanished, as they 
have in many parts of Haiti. But U.S. troops have not yet arrived, and so the 
villagers in Bagadere and other nearby towns have been left to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With limited resources, the U.S. military has kept most of its forces in 
Port-au-Prince and in Cap Haitien and is just now beginning to deploy 
significant numbers of troops into outlying cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the quick collapse of the Haitian police and military in many parts 
of the country has forced the Pentagon to increase the number of U.S. troops in 
Haiti as the burden of maintaining order has rapidly fallen upon U.S. military 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any law enforcement here, the people of Bagadere are eager for word of 
the progress of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are praying that the American troops will come -- we have not seen 
any," Phillemon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the power vacuum, the villagers' faith in Aristide's ability to fix 
their broken country remains unshaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, rural Haitians like those in Bagadere are placing a heavy burden of 
impossible expectations on one politician -- raising questions about whether a 
new surge of refugees will head out to sea once it becomes clear that Aristide 
cannot deliver the magic they expect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people of Bagadere, crowding around to tell their stories, insist that 
they will not abandon Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he doesn't bring food or jobs, with Aristide we will stay in Haiti," 
Jadet said.

SHAME, DISBELIEF IN SUSPECT'S PUEBLO; MEXICO: DANIEL AGUILAR TREVINO'S HOMETOWN 
ENDURES UNWANTED ATTENTION AFTER POLITICAL LEADER'S ASSASSINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen hours of hard driving separates Mexico City from the village of 60 
families where Daniel Aguilar Trevino was born in a dirt-floor shack. It is a 
pueblo so placid that sleeping dogs don't budge from the hard-packed roads for 
passing cars, and local police officials can't even remember the last arrest 
for a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And those officials barely recall "Danielito," the skinny, 28-year-old bean 
farmer and sometime ranch hand whose first trip to Mexico City has made him an 
infamous figure -- the accused killer of powerful Mexican political leader 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a man he knew only from magazine photos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know why he would do this," said his mother, Jovita Trevino, tears 
rimming her eyes. "I think somebody took control of his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week, when federal investigators roared into Jovita Trevino's rose 
garden with questions about her son, the peaceful village of Corralejo has come 
under siege from unwanted attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The village has fallen into the wide net that federal investigators are 
casting as they investigate the bold daylight murder of the second-ranking 
official in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled 
Mexico for 65 years. Ruiz Massieu was a former governor of the state of 
Guerrero who was rumored to be slated to become majority leader in the Chamber 
of Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail has led to the northeastern state of Tamaulipas because of Aguilar 
Trevino and two men he named as his accomplices in a statement to police. And 
suspicion has fallen on the head of the drug cartel that controls the state and 
a union boss who has been in prison for nearly six years, as well as several 
legislators, according to sources close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not confirmed any of the myriad reports appearing in the 
media and have denied only a few. The attorney general has not made a statement 
since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The breach of information has been filled with rumors and speculation. Some 
theories link Ruiz Massieu's murder to the March assassination of PRI 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Because both the victim and his 
suspected killer are from states notorious for drug trafficking, narcotics 
dealers have come under suspicion. Other reports indicate that Ruiz Massieu 
made enough enemies during his tenure as governor of Guerrero to explain a 
revenge killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers here denied press reports of massive arrests, although they said 
they have been questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Trevino's ailing 70-year-old father has retreated in embarrassment to 
his daughter's house in a neighboring city. Next door, a one-room house is 
guarded only by a dog and a few goats; the owners also left after their son, 
Carlos Cantu Narvaez, was linked to the assassination plot. Cantu, who was 
Aguilar Trevino's childhood friend, surrendered to police on Saturday, Reuters 
news service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it was Cantu who accompanied Aguilar Trevino in a green 
Chrysler on the day of the slaying, signaling to shoot Ruiz Massieu. And, 
investigators say, a third man, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, pointed out the 
victim for Aguilar Trevino in a magazine photo. Investigators contend that 
Aguilar Trevino's price for killing a man he didn't know was 50,000 new pesos 
-- $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aguilar Trevino's hometown, where most people eke out a living farming or 
raising animals, $17,000 is a fortune that could buy a neighborhood of six 
homes. It is 10 years of income for a campesino making barely $5 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But his mother said she had no clue that her son was desperate for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so mortifying for us," she said. "For the poverty we have, he didn't 
need to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been nothing in Aguilar Trevino's life that ever hinted at the cold 
role of an executioner. His passion is music, the louder the better. He likes 
fine clothes and the dances hosted at local ranches. He has no taste for 
politics other than to vote for the PRI in the August election. 
</P>
<P>
 The third son of six children, Aguilar Trevino comes from a family that was 
intertwined with most of the other families in Corralejo. Many of his relatives 
considered his life rather uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing elementary school, Aguilar Trevino started tending bean and 
corn plants on his father's farm. Sometimes he would find jobs on local 
ranches, caring for animals and tending gardens. More than a year ago, his 
mother said, he drifted to California, where he picked oranges for a season. 
But she was hazy on the details of his employers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he always sent money home. And eventually he saved enough to build a 
one-room house on his parents' property four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 days before the killing, Aguilar Trevino left his home, telling his 
family he had found a new job as a ranch hand. Police, however, said Aguilar 
Trevino told them he arrived in Mexico City three weeks before the slaying. His 
family knew nothing else when he left but took comfort from the fact that he 
said he would return in time to prepare for his December birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 His youngest sister, Delfina, remembers joking with him about killing his fat 
old dog to roast for his birthday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she added, "Why don't you kill a goat for the dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said he shook his head and replied, "I don't know what I'll kill." 
</P>

 Stormy weather postponed a robot search of the wreckage of the ferry Estonia, 
but murky sonar pictures appeared to show that the ship's cargo door was 
sheared off.More than 800 people died when the ferry sank Wednesday off the 
coast of Finland. High winds and waves prevented the deployment of two 
suitcase-size Sea Owl robots, which are equipped with three cameras and several 
mechanical arms. They would hover near the ferry and send pictures up to the 
surface for examination by investigators.

 The United Nations and Bosnian Serbs agreed to allow resumption of road 
convoys that have been under rebel blockade since a NATO air strike 10 days 
ago. Under the agreement allowing U.N. logistics and humanitarian aid convoys 
to resume, the Bosnian Serbs also accepted talks on restarting a vital U.N. 
airlift to Sarajevo, which had been grounded by rebel gunfire. The anti-U.N. 
blockade posed a potential humanitarian emergency for Serb-encircled government 
enclaves with winter nearing and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
hesitating to take tougher action against Bosnian Serbs.

ENDEAVOUR'S RADAR SURVEYS VOLCANOES; SHUTTLE: POWERFUL UNIT GATHERS 
THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES. ASTRONAUTS TAKE PICTURES, DESCRIBE THE SCENES BELOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Powerful radar waves from the space shuttle Endeavour sliced through clouds 
and sand Saturday to survey volcanoes and hunt for ancient river channels 
buried in the Sahara Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour's six astronauts described and photographed the scenes 138 miles 
below as the radar gathered three-dimensional images. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, ground controllers aimed the $366-million radar at the 
Klyuchevsky Volcano in Russia's Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 The volcano erupted Friday, perfect timing for Endeavour. Previous eruptions 
were recorded only in 1737 and 1945. The latest blast began shortly after the 
shuttle took off on its 10-day mapping mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Video beamed down by the astronauts showed thick, gray smoke billowing eight 
miles high from the volcano, located on a sparsely populated part of the 
Kamchatka Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite a sight," said astronaut Peter (Jeff) Wisoff. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday Saturday, the radar had scanned Hawaiian volcanoes and Washington 
state's dormant Mt. Rainier. High school students from Seattle set up homemade 
radar reflectors on Mt. Rainier and photographed the area as Endeavour orbited 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this week, the radar will focus on New Guinea volcanoes that began 
erupting two weeks ago and Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinatubo was among the volcanoes mapped by the shuttle radar during its 
orbital debut in April. There were no major eruptions then, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope the radar images will shed light on the climatic effects of 
volcanic ash and gases spewing into the atmosphere. The findings may also 
provide clues for predicting volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, said NASA 
program scientist Miriam Baltuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Other radar researchers are more interested in the past. Archeologists hope to 
find traces of ancient river tributaries buried by the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 These old rivers are generally one-third of a mile wide and carved in bedrock, 
which is a strong radar reflector. The search for 2,000-year-old mud walls of 
towns along China's Silk Road is expected to be much more difficult because of 
their small size and lack of bedrock.

CLINTON DEFENDS GAINS, ASKS HELP ON KEY BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With time running out and much of his legislative agenda already in oblivion, 
President Clinton made an appeal Saturday to salvage bills that aim to curb the 
influence of lobbyists and require Congress to abide by the laws it passes to 
govern everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's weekly radio address came at the end of a particularly dismal two 
weeks for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest blow was the death of health care reform, which had been the 
centerpiece of his presidency. Congress also has abandoned efforts to pass 
legislation on campaign reform, telecommunications, housing and a series of 
environmental issues. On Friday, the House is scheduled to adjourn for the year 
and the Senate will go into recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton emphasized several of his Administration's accomplishments, including 
efforts to reduce the federal payroll, streamline bureaucracy and make it 
easier for states to experiment with welfare reform. He also pointed to 
recently passed crime legislation that bans 19 types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all these steps forward, our political system is still too often an 
obstacle to change, not an instrument of progress," the President said. "One 
big reason is that here in Washington there are some 80,000 paid lobbyists who 
work to influence the government. In the last year, we've certainly seen how 
well-organized, lavishly funded campaigns by people protecting their . . . 
narrow interests work." 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying measure, which already passed the House, would tighten 
registration requirements for paid lobbyists and require fuller disclosure of 
the identities of clients and how much they are paying. It also places a 
virtual ban on lobbyists' gifts to lawmakers, which have included highly 
publicized resort vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the bill "will go a long way toward taking government out of the 
hands of the influence industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the bill is a farce and that it would stifle grass-roots efforts 
to influence lawmakers, rather than the special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, in an address to U.S. troops in Haiti, Clinton commended them for 
"performing a difficult mission with extraordinary skill. You have our thanks, 
our praise, our admiration and our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Though violence has continued since the arrival of the U.S. forces, the 
President said it has been curbed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to Clinton's radio address, Sen. Judd Gregg 
(R-N.H.) termed U.S. policy in Haiti "a mistake" and warned: "Our soldiers on 
the ground in Haiti are on a dangerous and vague mission where the rules of 
engagement are ever-changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trained to fight wars, not police communities and control rowdy and 
unpredictable crowds."

PAULA JONES' LAWYER TELLS OF 11TH-HOUR CLINTON CONCESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an eleventh-hour settlement offer in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual 
harassment case, President Clinton conceded that he may have met the woman in a 
hotel room and said he regretted "untrue assertions" made about her, Jones' 
lawyer said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Cammarata disclosed the draft of a statement by Clinton, which the 
President's lawyer faxed to Jones' lawyers in May in an attempt to stave off a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement talks delayed the filing of the lawsuit, but negotiations 
collapsed when White House sources were quoted on television as saying that the 
delay was due to Jones' not having a case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cammarata, Clinton's draft statement says: "I do not challenge" 
Jones' "claim" that the two met in a room at the Excelsior Hotel in 1991, 
although "I have no recollection" of it. "I may very well have met her in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did not engage in any improper or sexual conduct" and "I regret the 
untrue assertions which have been made about her conduct which may have 
adversely challenged her character and good name." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been known that Clinton offered a statement to settle the matter, but 
its terms had not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times Magazine first obtained the text of last May's statement 
for a story on Clinton lawyer Robert S. Bennett being published today. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones claims that while she was a state worker attending a public function at 
the hotel, Clinton dispatched a state police officer to summon her to a room, 
where he then suggested she engage in a sexual act with him. She said she 
declined. Clinton supporters have suggested Jones made up the story. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Jones said later Saturday that the suit will be dropped if 
Clinton reads a statement to reporters saying he does not deny the meeting took 
place and absolving her of any improper or sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Hays, director of the Paula Jones Legal Defense Fund in Washington, said 
the President has until noon next Sunday to read the statement and that the 
lawsuit would be dismissed 30 days after that, provided nobody on the White 
House staff or other Clinton operatives make statements about Jones or the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton refuses, Jones will proceed with her lawsuit, which seeks more than 
$700,000 in damages, Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula Jones is not in this for money. She's in it so she can get her good 
name and good reputation back," Hays said. "She is willing for the President to 
read the statement, and then she'll go away." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement proposed by Jones' attorneys Saturday would have the President 
say: 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not deny meeting Paula Jones on May 8, 1991, in a room at the Excelsior 
Hotel. She did not engage in any improper or sexual conduct. I believe her to 
be a truthful and moral person. I am sorry for the untrue assertions which have 
been made about her and which have adversely affected her character, good name 
and reputation. I have no further comment, today or ever, on my own conduct or 
my prior statements. Neither I, nor my staff, will have any further comment on 
this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, Clinton's attorney, could not be reached for comment Saturday. No one 
answered the telephone at his Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft statement originated by the Clinton camp would have the President 
saying he had no recollection of meeting with Jones at the hotel but would not 
challenge her claim that they had met there, and that he may have met her in 
the past. The rest of the two statements are the same.

GM WORKERS VOTE TO END THEIR WALKOUT; LABOR: THEIR DECISION IS OVERWHELMING. 
THE COMPANY HAS PROMISED TO HIRE NEW HELP FROM THE RANKS OF LONG LAID-OFF UNION 
MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Striking auto workers who said they were forced to build too many cars with 
too few people voted overwhelmingly Saturday to end their walkout in exchange 
for a General Motors promise to hire new workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand workers applauded, cheered and whistled when United Auto 
Workers leaders explained the deal at an auditorium near the Buick City 
complex. Employees then voted to accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11,500 workers who walked out Tuesday build General Motors Corp. cars, but 
more importantly, they also make transmission and suspension parts used in most 
GM vehicles. The shutdown at Flint threatened to hamstring GM operations 
nationwide and by Saturday had forced several plants to close or cut back 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 GM said it hoped to resume parts production Saturday night and run the plants 
all day today. If that occurs, the company expects only four plants to be down 
Monday because of parts shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, GM would hire more than 500 new workers from the ranks 
of long-laid-off union members whose benefits and callback rights have expired. 
It could set a pattern for resolving similar disputes over staff size and 
overtime that threaten to disrupt other GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the future you're going to see that solved across the country," 
Dave Yettaw, president of striking UAW Local 599, told his members at 
Saturday's session. 
</P>
<P>
 UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich said Friday that he and GM President Jack 
Smith would work together in the next two weeks to try to head off threatened 
strikes at several other GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yokich, who will become the union's president next year, praised Smith for his 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I think (Smith) has worked damn hard to try to keep both of us 
on an even keel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agreement does set a pattern, it is unclear how it might affect GM's 
campaign to cut staff and costs. Wall Street analysts have applauded GM for 
closing plants and eliminating 52,000 hourly employees since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, the strike had caused at least three other GM plants to shut down 
and four others to cut back their schedules. Three other plants told workers 
Friday that they should not report for work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement means work might resume today at Flint, but it will take several 
days before the supply of parts is back to normal.

DEMOCRATS WIN IN LOUISIANA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Louisiana Democrats narrowly maintained control of the state's congressional 
delegation Saturday, staving off a Republican challenge that would have put 
four of the state's U.S. House seats in GOP hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Rep. Jimmy Hayes, 47, won 72,059 votes, or 53%, with 100% of the 
vote counted in the southwest Louisiana district's precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 He edged out former Republican congressman Clyde Holloway, 50, who lost his 
home base two years ago in redistricting mandated by the 1990 census. Holloway 
garnered 54,609 votes, or 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Louisiana's open primary system, all candidates enter the primary, 
regardless of party affiliation. Any candidate receiving 50.1% or more of the 
vote is elected. Otherwise, the top two vote-getters face off in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven congressional races were settled by the primary. Incumbents in the 
state's other six districts ran unopposed.

BIG SISTER HILLARY HELPS BROTHER'S CAMPAIGN FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Rodham got some campaign help Saturday from big sister Hillary Rodham 
Clinton and introduced her as "the main dish" to Democrats whose votes he needs 
to win a tough U.S. Senate primary runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady, campaigning for her brother for the first time, urged voters 
at three rallies to help elect another pro-President Clinton senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to know what the President has accomplished and why it is so 
important we have senators like my brother . . . who will continue to support 
the direction my husband is moving the country in," she told about 300 people 
at the Sunset Lakes retirement community in Broward County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton said the Clinton Administration has strengthened the economy and 
lowered the deficit, and she touted the passage of the crime and family leave 
bills. She also promised not to give up the fight on national health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady, 46, said she felt the pride of a big sister helping her 
44-year-old brother, who is only "little by age." At a stop at a community 
center in Hollywood, Rodham joked about the clout his sister brings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You heard from the appetizer, you're about to hear from the main dish," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Rodham said, "Today is the crowning achievement in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, a former Penn State football player, is a political novice and former 
Dade County public defender. He faces former radio talk show host Mike Wiley in 
the runoff on Tuesday. Wiley opposes gun control and foreign aid and has a firm 
belief in UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham was first and Wiley second in the four-way primary Sept. 8, in which 
nobody won a required majority to avoid a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face first-term Republican Sen. Connie Mack, who was unopposed 
in the primary. Mack is the grandson and namesake of the former Philadelphia 
Athletics owner and manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham's campaign gained momentum through the summer, garnering endorsements 
from unions, state associations and newspapers, but he still has no TV 
advertising. His brother Tony Rodham, who worked for the Democratic National 
Committee, signed on as campaign manager in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley, heavily supported by the National Rifle Assn., won more than half the 
state's counties, most of them small conservative counties in north Florida. He 
says much of his vote is a rejection of the Clinton Administration.

WHAT IS PREYING ON FLORIDA'S PANTHERS?; SEXUALITY: SOME RESEARCHERS BLAME 
PESTICIDES FOR THE BIG CATS' PLIGHT. OTHERS CITE DEVELOPMENT AND INBREEDING. 
WITH ONLY 30 TO 50 LEFT, THE FATE OF THE SPECIES LIES IN THE BALANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Just past dawn, Florida Panther No. 52 is on the run, the beep from her radio 
collar growing steadily louder. 
</P>
<P>
 From the window of a Cessna, state biologist Darrell Land points out a spot, 
and the pilot spirals down, hovering above an emerald carpet of pines and 
palms. The sleek, tawny-colored cat is crouched below, checking out a herd of 
deer for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be damned!" Land said, checking the panther through his binoculars. 
"That's the first one I've seen in months." 
</P>
<P>
 Three mornings a week, Land takes to the air to track these rare, nocturnal 
felines using radio signals, scribbling each cat's location and identification 
number on a green topographical map spread across his lap. Only 30 to 50 
Florida panthers remain, making them one of the nation's most troubled 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, wildlife biologists have presumed that the big cats are vanishing 
because the marshy forests surrounding the Everglades have been chewed up by 
South Florida's sprawling farms and suburbs. With so little space to roam, they 
inbreed, passing on reproductive defects such as low sperm counts. 
</P>
<P>
 But now biologists are wondering if another factor also has been playing a key 
role -- chemicals that imitate hormones and feminize animals. 
</P>
<P>
 A scientific debate over the felines -- whose protection is a highly 
contentious subject in Florida -- has erupted between those who believe that 
pesticides are at fault and those who blame development and inbreeding. At 
stake in this argument is the fate of the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "My argument is contaminants and theirs is inbreeding," said Charles Facemire, 
a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contaminants specialist. "I believe these 
animals have been feminized. I have no proof. I may be dead wrong, but if I am, 
I will really be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Male panthers may have abnormal estrogen levels -- higher in some cases than 
many females. About 90% have large percentages of dead sperm, and more than 
half suffer from cryptorchidism -- in which one or both testes fail to descend. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those things have been shown to be caused by environmental estrogens 
or other endocrine-disrupting chemicals in other animals," Facemire said. 
"Every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Dunbar, wildlife research veterinarian for the Florida Game and 
Freshwater Fish Commission, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no data in panthers supporting any of that, so I am very pessimistic 
that we have a problem as far as estrogenic chemicals having effects," he said. 
"It is worth investigating, but people just have to use common sense about it. 
From what I see in the animals I am working with, it doesn't seem to be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Dunbar compared panthers with abnormal testicles to normal ones 
and found no correlation to their hormones. Both had high estrogen, so Dunbar 
suspects that is normal in panthers compared to other large cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (environmental hormones) were a problem, we would be seeing more symptoms 
in many species there," Dunbar said. Raccoons, bobcats, deer and bear seem to 
have no similar sexual problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Facemire, however, said Florida officials are wedded to the inbreeding theory 
because it is easier to fix. The state wildlife agency is planning to import 
cougars from Texas to mate with Florida panthers and increase the gene pool. 
But those cats could be doomed to sire abnormal offspring, too, if Facemire's 
theory is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 If the panthers' problems are caused by estrogenic chemicals, a massive 
investigation and cleanup of pesticides and other contamination would have to 
be conducted in the Everglades and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are highly charged, highly controversial issues," Facemire said. 
"Someone has to pay if we prove it's contaminants." 
</P>
<P>
 Although panthers roam the heart of a sugar and citrus belt, no one has tested 
the cats -- or the raccoons and deer they feed on -- for hormone-disrupting 
chemicals. DDT and other pesticides pollute nearby canals. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Florida wildlife endocrinologist Tim Gross said the most likely 
explanation is a combination of the two. "More than likely it's a pollution 
problem" behind the sperm abnormalities, while inbreeding probably causes the 
cryptorchidism, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Land, however, is dubious that the sperm and testes disorders are even posing 
a problem in terms of births. He believes the panthers are recovering, based on 
the number of kittens he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new generation of kittens could be infertile if pollution-caused 
problems have been passed from their parents. The true test will come when the 
young males are old enough to mate.

GROUP TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR TEEN-AGE MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the many memories Beatriz Olvera Stotzer harbors from her teen-age years 
in Boyle Heights, one strikes a nerve. It is the memory of several young 
Latinas becoming pregnant and seemingly being pinned with invisible scarlet 
letters by their families and the community, a situation that Stotzer believes 
helped launch the girls into a cycle of poverty and undereducation they were 
unable to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, their children -- including Stotzer's goddaughter -- also paid the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of my girlfriends got pregnant when they were teen-agers, and now their 
daughters have turned out the same way," said Stotzer, who works as a manager 
for the Department of Water and Power. "My goddaughter is now a teen-age 
mother, just like her mother was." 
</P>
<P>
 As president of New Economics for Women, a nonprofit development company 
founded in 1985 by a group of feminist Latinas who last year opened the Casa 
Loma family housing project in Westlake, Stotzer is helping develop a project 
to pluck some young mothers from the cycle of welfare dependency, giving them 
and their children a chance for a better life.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Stotzer's group initiated the renovation of the Hotel Cortez, a 
five-story 1921 structure around the corner from Casa Loma at 375 S. Columbia 
Ave. that has been abandoned for almost eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed in September, 1995, La Posada -- "the inn" -- will provide 
affordable two-year transitional housing for up to 60 teen-age mothers and 
their children, with on-site child care, counseling, job-skills training and an 
educational resource center, all intended to help young mothers finish high 
school and work toward becoming self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is filling a gap in service," said Maggie Cervantes, 
executive director of New Economics for Women. "We're trying to reduce their 
long-term dependency on welfare so they will be able to finish their education 
and support their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Living in a nurturing, supportive environment will provide the girls with a 
sense of self-worth, Stotzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society doesn't approach teen pregnancy in a compassionate way," she 
said. "We tend to look at these girls as throwaways. What La Posada will focus 
on is saving not just one but two generations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 La Posada, which is being developed with $4.5 million in public and private 
funds, will provide young mothers ages 16 to 21 with efficiency apartments 
consisting of a bedroom and bath. Community kitchens and meeting areas will be 
provided, along with a play area for children, laundry facilities and a small 
convenience store that will provide job training and employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 New Economics for Women will also help those who are under 18 become legally 
emancipated so that they, and not their parents, will be responsible for their 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a local transitional home for teen-age mothers is long overdue, 
said Heather Bryant, an intake coordinator for nearby St. Anne's Maternity 
Home. St. Anne's, which has long housed and educated pregnant teen-age girls 
until they give birth, can only keep residents afterward if they are wards of 
the court, and must release them once they turn 18 or as soon as their infants 
reach their second birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 "There needs to be another step," Bryant said. "A lot of times, these girls 
are uncomfortable living back at home, or get kicked out. So they stay with 
their boyfriends, and if that doesn't work out, they stay with their friends. 
They don't learn stability, moving from place to place." 
</P>
<P>
 Stotzer believes that one of the main reasons many teen mothers find 
themselves on their own with no choice other than to accept public aid is 
because of social prejudice, especially within the Latin American community, 
where familial rejection is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What hurts me most is that, as a society, we treat girls who get pregnant as 
being tainted," she said. "In Latin culture, they are often seen as prostitutes 
who are no longer pure. People ignore the fact that there was also a man 
involved who wanted his sexual desires satisfied. It's a double standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry May, who directs the Adolescent Pregnancy Childwatch program of Los 
Angeles, an advocacy group for teen-age parents, said the absence of an 
alternative to welfare also hinders the personal development of teen-age 
mothers, who accounted for 23,970 live births in Los Angeles County in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that there is no consistent support for these women," she 
said. "This is where New Economics for Women will help these mothers. It's the 
kind of comprehensive approach that is missing from many of our (public) 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Stotzer hopes the combination of an accepting environment and on-site social 
and educational support services will prepare the teen-agers at La Posada to 
move in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hopes to accommodate those who are interested in moving to either 
Casa Loma or Villa Mariposa, a similar housing project under construction 
nearby, when their two years at La Posada are up. This would allow them to 
continue to benefit from the support programs provided by all three facilities.

 "They'll be able to walk back and forth," Cervantes said. "It's always been 
NEW's philosophy to develop within a small geographic area, so that we can 
better provide service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Once La Posada nears completion, New Economics for Women will begin accepting 
applicants referred by teen pregnancy homes and programs as well as public 
social services. They also plan to advertise some of their vacancies, Cervantes 
said.

GIVING FULL IMMUNIZATION A SHOT; HEALTH: MOBILE MEDICAL VANS AND FREE CLINICS 
ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO REACH CHILDREN IN LOW-INCOME AREAS. THE YOUNGER THE 
BETTER, OFFICIALS SAY.

 Stone-faced 8-year-olds mentally prepare themselves. Infants in the background 
weep hopelessly while they're cradled in a stranger's arms.  
</P>
<P>
 Then a nurse produces a needle. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing off the bandage on the top of her left arm, 8-year-old Charde Tate 
shook her head confidently, affirming that she was ready for her vaccination 
shots minutes earlier. Charde and sisters Daniell, 10, and Charmaine, 5, 
recently received immunization shots from physicians assistants who visited 
South-Central's Praises of Zion Baptist Church in mobile clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made it more convenient for them to come here," said their mother, Paula 
Tate. "I liked the whole idea of them coming to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 After a measles epidemic swept Los Angeles County from 1987 to 1991, 
aggressive campaigns have been conducted to raise community awareness of the 
importance of immunizations against nine major preventable diseases. Before the 
epidemic, according to the county Department of Health Services, only 39% of 
preschool-age children had completed their immunizations by their second 
birthday. Now the figure is 58%.  
</P>
<P>
 But among African American and Latino children, especially those in low-income 
areas, the immunization rate remains lower than average.  
</P>
<P>
 "In our study the last couple of years, only 42% of Latino kids are up-to-date 
(with immunizations), and 25% of African American kids had all their shots by 
the time they were 2 years old," said Dr. David Wood, a pediatrician and 
assistant professor of pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "But they had 
seven to eight doctor visits a year for minor illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, pediatricians say, is that poor citizens of all 
ethnicities often cannot afford to take time off work for trips to the doctor 
or public clinics where shots are offered for free. In addition, many illegal 
immigrants are wary of taking their children for immunization, fearing they 
will be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials are hoping to combat that trend by promoting joint efforts 
between county and private providers, and by developing a tracking system to 
determine who has been immunized in highly mobile populations. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, health department officials countywide are promoting the use of 
the Watts Health Foundation's 12 mobile units and the 43 county health clinics, 
which some say are underused. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care if the patient is legal, illegal, poor or rich -- the shots are 
all free," said Nina Vassilian, senior health educator for the Department of 
Health Services. "We don't ask questions (of that nature)." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen shots are required for full immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis (whooping cough), polio, measles, mumps, rubella, Type B influenza 
and hepatitis B.  
</P>
<P>
 The county has had only isolated cases of measles, whooping cough and other 
highly infectious diseases in recent years. Nearly all children are fully 
vaccinated by the time they reach kindergarten because schools require the 
shots before children can be enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 But pediatricians say parents must be made aware that earlier immunization is 
the safest course. By age 2, children should have received four DTP 
(diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) shots, two oral polio vaccines and one MMR 
(measles, mumps, rubella) shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost is not a factor," said Paul Frederick, an epidemiologist with the 
immunization program at the Department of Health Services. "A big factor is 
education -- instilling in the minds of people how important that immunization 
schedule is. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1980 on up, we were hovering around the 40% to 50% range, and in 1990 we 
went up to 58%. We hope it's not sporadic," Frederick said. "By the year 2000 
we want to make sure that we have that 30% increase."  
</P>
<P>
 From mobile health clinics to computerized tracking systems, health experts 
are trying to reach every corner of the city. Wood said a universal tracking 
system should be ready in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, a computerized registry that will keep tabs on shots for all 
preschool children in the county, will be installed in five city health clinics 
by the end of the year. Wood will head the system funded by grants from the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some populations are highly mobile, many institutions remain 
constants in their lives. By tapping into those sources, health officials say, 
tracking and education can be made easier. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tail end of the measles epidemic, for instance, Vassilian started 
working closely with the Catholic Church, which has a high Latino following, to 
persuade parishioners to vaccinate their children before baptism.  
</P>
<P>
 But even with the support of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, it has been difficult 
to implement the project because of a low level of collaboration by individual 
churches. The health department has only been able to monitor 100 babies since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Immunization Baby Track has been more successful, Vassilian 
said. The program targets maternity hospitals in the county and works with 
volunteers who visit the mothers.

TAX BREAK HAS HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE; BUILDINGS: OWNERS WHOSE STRUCTURES HAVE 
IMPORTANT CULTURAL OR HISTORIC STATUS CAN EXPECT PROPERTY TAX RELIEF IF THEY 
RESTORE AND KEEP THEM UP FOR 10 YEARS. MOST ARE IN CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that could safeguard historic structures for affordable housing, the 
Los Angeles City Council has agreed to give owners of older houses and 
apartments a property tax break if they pledge to restore and maintain their 
buildings for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent decision could apply to an estimated 3,600 buildings that have been 
designated by the city as historically or culturally significant. In addition, 
other buildings could receive the tax break if their owners persuade the city 
that the structures are historic. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report says that more than 70% of the older houses and apartments are 
concentrated in a handful of areas: South-Central Los Angeles, Southeast Los 
Angeles, West Adams, Boyle Heights, Wilshire, Silverlake/Echo Park and 
Northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving historic older units is important, city officials say, because 
those properties traditionally have the most affordable rents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action is allowed under a 1976 state law known as the Mills Act, 
which permits cities to cut property taxes on historically significant 
structures by an average of 50% so long as owners agree to upgrade and preserve 
the buildings for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law has been in place for nearly 20 years, city officials say it 
became more attractive after recent changes broadened the definition of 
historic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 It was those changes and a desire to preserve more affordable housing in Los 
Angeles that led Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas to urge his colleagues to take 
advantage of the state law. His motion was seconded by Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who, like Ridley-Thomas, represents a district with many older 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Ridley-Thomas motion, the property tax break would be available to 
historic single-family houses with an assessed value of no more than $500,000 
and multifamily buildings with a valuation of $1.5 million or less. The new 
assessed valuation of properties would be determined under a formula that 
includes a variety of factors, such as a property's mortgage rate and monthly 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely directed at residential buildings, the tax break could apply 
to other structures on the city's list of 596 historic or cultural monuments. 
The tax break also would apply to some 3,050 structures in the city's seven 
historic preservation zones. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for the tax break, property owners would pay a non-refundable $25 
fee. If their application is approved by the city's Cultural Affairs board, 
they would pay an additional one-time fee of $243 for the tax reduction that 
could save thousands of dollars by lowering the property's assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is expected to return to the council for final action by late this 
month and, if approved as expected, would become law as early as December.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; THE GATHERING PLACE OFFERS PEACE OF MIND 
</P>

<P>
 For two years, Vincent Cook has thought of the Gathering Place as a home away 
from home, a welcome retreat from the inhospitable likes of government 
buildings and endless food lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who has been HIV-positive since 1986, says the center's new spruced-up 
digs on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard provide an even more inviting hangout 
than the drop-in center's previous location. "You can get some peace of mind 
here, get away," he said, helping himself to coffee and cookies in the center's 
dining room. "It's more like a house now than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Those such as Cook who have HIV or AIDS are rediscovering the Gathering Place, 
an aptly named center that provides its mostly black and Latino clientele an 
informal, homey atmosphere and a range of free services geared to provide a 
human touch: meals, massage therapy, dietitian and chiropractic services, 
individual counseling, support groups and a library for pleasure reading as 
well as keeping up-to-date on the latest AIDS research developments.  
</P>
<P>
 In August, the center moved half a block west of its second-floor quarters in 
an aging medical complex to a larger, 10-room space at 3966 King Blvd. Unlike 
the last location, it is free-standing and less clinical, said executive 
director Graciela Morales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all open space now," said Morales, leading a tour through the center. 
"It's soft, subtle -- more like a home." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said the move was as much facilitated by the need for a new look as by 
the January earthquake, which left its old space damaged and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior walls of the new site, which formerly housed a church, are 
painted in soothing pink, purple and mauve. Furniture and doors are pale wood, 
and three overstuffed sofas are grouped around a communal television set. The 
dining room is country style, set with an oak table and chairs and outfitted 
with a coffee maker and a steady supply of snacks.  
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit center provides client services Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m. The bulk of clients are referred by churches, AIDS agencies and 
other community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Though lauded by civic leaders as an exemplary community center in its 
two-year history, the center underwent a major administrative and personnel 
shake-up this year that at one point threatened to close it down. But Morales, 
who came on as executive director after serving seven years as a 
psychotherapist at the neighboring T.H.E. Clinic, said the Gathering Place got 
support from an unexpected place -- its clients, many of whom are homeless or 
impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Hang in there, girlfriend, we need you,' " recalled Morales, 
laughing. "A lot of them helped us move, right in the middle of the terrible 
heat wave. They know they can't get this kind of service anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 An energetic woman with rapid-fire speech and a penchant for hugs, Morales is 
deadly serious about enlisting whatever help she can for her clients -- a 
growing number of whom are women, children, parolees and the homeless. Of the 
nearly 125 clients the center serves each month, 20% to 25% are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gathering Place, founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet and 
the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange, relies heavily on private funding for its 
$340,000 annual budget. It has seven staff members, and most of its services 
are donated by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The clients "deal with so much," said Morales, who has been trying to drum up 
support for the center at local black churches and on Spanish-language radio. 
"Their needs are very basic -- food, a place to sit and talk. What they need 
most is simply human contact, like everyone else. When I see my clients, I 
don't see color."  
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 31, who is homeless but says he expects to get federal housing, says he 
appreciates the fact that he can go to the Gathering Place anytime -- no 
questions asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like that I can come here, and people share their problems. I take what I 
need away from here," he said.

 Johnetta Jones had been wanting for years to start a scholarship program in 
her late husband's name, but was always put off by the amount of work she 
figured it would take.  
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, Jones got the spark she needed. As she stood in the window of 
her View Park home watching Crenshaw Boulevard burn during the riots, she 
decided the time was ripe to start encouraging young people of color to pursue 
careers in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out at the street and saw not enough firetrucks, not enough police," 
said Jones, a retired schoolteacher. "I decided then that the only way to 
change the system is from within, not without."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones quickly established the Donald Jones Scholarship Fund, in memory of her 
late husband, a 32-year veteran of the county Sheriff's Department, who died in 
1984. At a dinner last week at Holman United Methodist Church, Jones and her 
scholarship committee presented the first three awards of $1,000 each. The 
recipients were all local college students pursuing Administration of Justice 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that the scholarship is intended to continue her husband's legacy 
of involvement with community youth, which included active participation in the 
Crenshaw YMCA and being a mentor to fatherless young men. Perhaps most 
important to her husband, said Jones, was ensuring that young people of color 
were made aware of career opportunities in law enforcement -- something that 
barely existed when he started in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few blacks in the department at that time. It was tough," 
Jones said. "But he hung in there, weathered the storm. He always believed in 
it . . . he thought that too many people judge law enforcement officials by one 
bad incident." 
</P>
<P>
 For 22-year-old Sean Smith, the scholarship means fewer financial burdens as 
he continues justice studies at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning a lot about the justice system that I never knew. It's 
interesting," he said. "Even though I always thought I wanted to do this kind 
of work, I was like everybody else in my neighborhood. I said, 'A cop? No way!' 
But then I thought to myself, 'Well, if it's true that the Klan runs the police 
department, then I need to get in there and make some changes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Aubert, 30, said the scholarship will enable her to pursue what she has 
always wanted -- a career as a private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deciding to go after Administration of Justice inspired me to go back to 
school," said the high school dropout, who is now back in school at El Camino 
College. "I feel now more than ever there will be changes for the better (in 
law enforcement) . . . blacks and Latinos have to go into the field and 
straighten things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The third recipient, 21-year-old Inglewood resident Emilson St. Julian, is 
also a student at El Camino College. St. Julian is an LAPD Explorer Scout as 
well as an LAPD reserve officer. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; INTERNMENT BARRACKS WILL BE EXHIBITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 1940s wooden barracks in Wyoming will be dismantled and brought to Los 
Angeles by midweek as part of an exhibit commemorating the wartime internment 
of Japanese Americans more than 50 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The 60- and 40-foot-long buildings were among those hastily constructed to 
house up to 10,000 Americans with Japanese ancestry at Heart Mountain Camp -- 
one of 11 run by the government during World War II, said Chris Komai, 
spokesman for the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on racial fears and anti-Asian sentiment, the U.S. government in 
February, 1942, ordered 120,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to 
evacuate their homes, give up their jobs and live in camps from California to 
Arkansas. The order became void in 1945 when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials want to include one of the barracks from Park County, Wyo., 
in a Nov. 11 exhibit titled "America's Concentration Camps: Remembering the 
Japanese American Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to reassemble the building for public viewing on a parking lot 
across from the museum, Komai said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other wood-frame structure will be stored for future use in a permanent 
exhibit at a proposed 65,000-square-foot pavilion that would be built next door 
to the nonprofit museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials went to look for the tar-paper-covered barracks in Wyoming 
because at the other camp sites, "there aren't many original barracks still up 
after 50 years," Komai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go up to Manzanar (Calif.), there's nothing there," he said. "The two 
buildings that we're bringing back have been changed the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Both barracks were relocated after World War II to nearby farms and ranches 
and converted into tool sheds. They were donated to the museum by landowners 
Rod Morrison and Tak Ogawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody needed to do something to recognize it before it went away," said 
Morrison, 38, whose barracks will be on display in November. It still contains 
old coal-burning stoves and old newspapers that former internees used to cover 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer in lessons learned, and I hope we definitely use this . . 
. and stop being afraid of things we don't understand," said Morrison, a 
Wyoming native and an engineer for a Pasadena design and construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart Mountain Camp has a strong local connection: 60% to 65% of Japanese 
Americans sent to the camp came from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those former internees, along with museum staff and other volunteers, 
left for Wyoming last week to help dismantle and prepare the wooden structures 
for transport. They were joined by four professional carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 No cost has been determined for the project, which will be accomplished 
through volunteer and paid labor. The disassembled parts were to be loaded onto 
flatbed and enclosed trucks by today, Komai said.  
</P>
<P>
 They could return by Tuesday or Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that they will hold up fine and that we will be able to bring 
them back intact," Komai said. TOMMY LI

 The Community Redevelopment Agency is scheduled to hold public hearings this 
week to consider drafts of five-year plans for Chinatown and the Downtown 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners will discuss the 17-page Chinatown plan at 6 p.m. Monday at 
Cathay Manor, 600 N. Broadway, said CRA spokesman Chuck Sifuentes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinatown redevelopment area covers 303 acres and is bounded by the 
Pasadena Freeway on the north, North Broadway and North Main Street on the 
east, Cesar E. Chavez Avenue and the Santa Ana Freeway on the south and Beaudry 
Avenue on the west. Key projects proposed for the area include completion of a 
gymnasium, a long-awaited cultural and community center, and new affordable 
housing for low-income families.  
</P>
<P>
 CRA staff is also recommending that commissioners approve spending $300,000 on 
a study to determine a plan for Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 a.m. Thursday, commissioners will go over questions or comments regarding 
the 18-page, proposed five-year plan for the Central Business District. The 
meeting will be held in the fourth-floor CRA Board Room in the Banco Popular 
Building, 354 S. Spring St. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the plans are available at CRA offices.

 Ed Murphy saw a disturbing trend among many of his Bell High School students 
facing life in a society increasingly dependent on television and computers for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not tell what was a commercial and what wasn't. The lines between 
the end of a sitcom and the beginning of a news program were blurry. Reality 
became fiction and vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Murphy said, they were video illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talent, intelligence and creativity are all there," said Murphy, 53, who 
teaches video production. "But these abilities aren't being tapped when 
students don't know anything about the technologies that produce what they see 
and hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1970s, Murphy has helped students decipher the endless stream 
of information through his "video literacy" class. Now, with computers becoming 
more commonplace and interactive video technologies looming, Murphy is training 
his students to face the information overload that comes with multimedia 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By incorporating hands-on training in multimedia, Murphy hopes to expand 
awareness of recent systems such as CD-ROM -- something most of his students 
would not normally be able to access. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids that come in here are not literate in either English or 
Spanish since they are recent arrivals," Murphy said. "But now as a society 
we're on the verge of an entirely different kind of literacy -- video literacy 
-- which is what I hope to teach them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show my students how not to be fallible to commercials and their 
accompanying stereotypes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way for a student to learn the fundamentals of where images come from 
and what they mean, Murphy said, is for them to produce their own. 
</P>
<P>
 In Murphy's crowded classes, which average 38 students each, students trade 
off with each other for time at several Macintosh computers available for 
developing graphics and text for their videos. The remainder are able to hone 
their skills on an editing machine that looks like a cross between a VCR and a 
television set, with a few controls foreign to both. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy if you have enough time to edit everything you shoot," said Jaime 
Mayorquin as he sat at a Macintosh composing an advertising flyer for a 
videotape yearbook that the entire class is producing. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape yearbooks, which sell for $10 apiece, are one of several 
hands-on projects for Murphy's students. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student is also required to produce a video of his or her own by the end 
of each term. Last year for the first time, Murphy and 28 of his students 
gathered their videotapes together and developed the Bell High School Video 
Portfolios CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Each compact disc features an interview with a student producer, along with 
comments by Murphy and another video production teacher, Larry Stone. The 
videos represent the range of productions done by Bell students, including 
public service announcements, essays, poems and music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The production process requires a computer with a double-speed CD-ROM drive 
with external speakers, purchased with money from a state grant encouraging 
schools to become "technology showrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 The disks have already been distributed to more than 500 schools and 100 
colleges and universities that have expressed interest in using nascent 
technologies as teaching tools. 
</P>
<P>
 For Francisco Santos, 19, who produced a video to accompany the song 
"Casimira," a tune by the popular norteno band Banda Machos, this exposure will 
be followed by further opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 With money saved from his job at a poultry processing plant in Vernon, Santos 
recently purchased his own camcorder and began filming quinceaneras , a 
traditional Latino birthday celebration for 15-year-old girls, for $150 per 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much better than cutting up chickens," Santos said. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; COMPLAINTS PROMPT REVIEW OF 
RECYCLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has decided to review the operations of a recycling 
facility that nearby residents say is the source of excessive noise and 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The review could lead to a commission decision on whether to revoke the 
conditional use permit of Aggregate Recycling Systems, Inc., 6208 S. Alameda 
St., which specializes in storing and recycling concrete debris. The permit, 
granted by the City Council in November, requires the owners to maintain 
conditions that will not adversely affect the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission also required the company to conduct all loading and 
unloading activities from its Alameda Street dock so as not to disturb any 
residences. A commission report dated Nov. 18, 1993, said violation of 
conditions could result in a citation or revocation of the conditional use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then the Community Development Department has received several 
complaints from neighboring residents about excessive noise and dust coming 
from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a problem since November of last year," said Petra Ramirez, 62, who 
lives on Cottage Street, virtually in front of the recycling facility. "We have 
problems sleeping and breathing, and nothing is done about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez and about 20 other residents attended the Sept. 21 Planning Commission 
meeting to complain about the recycling facility and present a petition with 
the names of 75 other residents who have also complained about noise and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggregate's owner, Sam Chew, did not return phone calls from The Times. 
However, city records indicate that the firm did take several steps to address 
the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city records, the initial complaint about excessive dirt and 
debris was received on May 26. Aggregate's management responded shortly 
thereafter by sending crews to clean the street every Sunday, but subsequent 
city inspections found that dirt and debris accumulation was such that more 
frequent cleanups may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspection by the South Coast Air Quality Management District also found 
that Aggregate was attempting to mitigate excessive dust by frequently 
compacting and watering the large piles of debris on its property. In addition, 
trucks carrying debris pass under sprinklers to further minimize dust. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramirez said those efforts are not enough. "There is still dirt on the 
street and dust in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Planning Commission, Director of Community Development Jack 
Wong recommended that Aggregate Recycling should be required to install a 
12-foot dust screen and 17 trees on the street, water its stored and piled 
materials more frequently, and prohibit use of earth-moving machinery within 
100 feet of its east property line along Cottage Street from 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is scheduled to discuss the matter further at its 
meeting Wednesday. SIMON ROMERO

 In an effort to curtail what it called "ongoing violations of the public 
peace," the City Administrator's office last week suspended the entertainment 
license of Michael's, a popular dance club and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The license suspension effectively prohibits dancing, live music and disc 
jockeys at the restaurant, City Administrator Louis Shephard said.Violation of 
the suspension is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 The city cited several disruptions at the restaurant in its suspension notice 
mailed to Michael's, 6309 E. Washington Blvd. Among the incidents cited was a 
Sept. 24 fracas involving 40 people in the restaurant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of Michael's, which has a capacity of 750, considered the suspension 
unfair, said Frank Perez, a manager at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's just fabricating these accusations -- there haven't been any big 
problems around here," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kay, one of the owners ofMichael's, said the club plans to appeal the 
suspension. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; UCLA PROGRAM AIDS ASPIRING TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Elisa Castaneda left her teaching job in Guatemala five years ago, she 
knew she would have to take a step back in order to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she and her family arrived in Los Angeles, she swallowed her pride, 
tucked her college degree away among her other keepsakes and went to work 
cleaning houses. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years, Castaneda landed a job as a teaching assistant in a church's 
bilingual child-care center, then worked her way up to teaching toddlers in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But because her English was still not good enough to allow her to take 
state-mandated education courses and apply for a teaching license, she found 
her career options severely limited, even for Spanish-only jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in April, 1993, Castaneda and more than 100 Pico-Union residents 
discovered a UCLA Extension program offering subsidized basic core classes in 
early childhood education -- exclusively in Spanish -- for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded through a grant, the pilot program -- which began a year ago and held 
its first graduation ceremony at Angelica Lutheran Church last weekend -- is 
identical to the school's English-language course of study, but with a tuition 
discounted to $35 from regular fees of as much as $225. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent graduates now meet state requirements for becoming child-care 
center teachers, and they may apply for the license that will allow them to 
teach at bilingual centers throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has helped me so much," said a beaming Castaneda in Spanish, 
exchanging hugs with proud relatives after the ceremony. "Before this, without 
English, I couldn't accomplish anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she has cleared the first hurdle in furthering her teaching career, 
she said she plans to continue honing her English skills so that she can 
validate her Guatemalan college courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA Extension program was developed in response to a survey conducted by 
the city after the 1992 riots, which identified a need for child-care centers 
with bilingual and bicultural personnel in the Pico-Union area and training for 
residents so that they could qualify for those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the riots broke out, Robert Lapiner, dean of continuing education at 
UCLA, was devising a strategy for community development. His staff heard about 
the Pico-Union survey and decided to incorporate a program that would target 
the needs identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shifted our emphasis a bit and asked the college to prepare a program we 
could shape to the cultural and language background of students who had the 
intellectual ability," Lapiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 After mapping out a planned course of study, the extension's department of 
education held an open house in April, 1993, at Angelica Lutheran to gauge 
community interest in the idea. More than 100 aspiring students showed up, 
informed solely through the church and by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few months, Lapiner was able to secure a $35,000 grant from 
the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation to subsidize the program, as department staff 
worked to translate course material and hire two Spanish-speaking instructors. 
Forty applicants were selected, and classes began in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the only real prerequisite was that they live in the Pico-Union area, 
the applicants selected came from diverse backgrounds and levels of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least five of them were housewives," said Chris Peralta, one of the 
instructors who teaches early childhood education at East Los Angeles College. 
"Some cleaned houses. Others were teachers in their own countries, but were 
working as teaching assistants here because they could not take the classes 
that would enable them to step up to teacher status, since their English skills 
were not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 For one year, the students -- most of whom have families -- would rise early 
each Saturday and spend the day in class in a back room of the church, leaving 
their children in the care of spouses, relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 6-year-old daughter was crying so hard one day, my husband ended up having 
to bring her to me in class," said Rebeca Pineda, a homemaker who hopes to 
become a teacher. "It was really difficult sometimes. It was a sacrifice."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; LANDLORD CONVICTED OF SLUM CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A landlord was recently convicted of slum violations for the third time in 
eight years after pleading no contest to 12 violations of fire, health, and 
building and safety codes at 840 S. Hobart Blvd., an aging 103-unit apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Tabello, 62, of La Habra was fined $15,136, ordered to perform 50 hours 
of community service and placed on three years' probation. He was last 
prosecuted in April for failure to provide sufficient lighting in the complex, 
and was convicted in 1988 of slum violations in that building and one at 826 S. 
Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
 The 840 S. Hobart property had broken fire doors, tangled fire hoses, 10 
missing fire extinguishers, faulty electrical wiring, broken fire sprinklers, 
damaged walls, leaky plumbing and cockroach infestation, according to the city 
attorney's staff report. Repairs must be completed by Nov. 1 or Tabello could 
face additional punishment, including jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fifth time an inner-city landlord has been convicted of repeated 
slum violations this year. One of those, a Westlake landlord, was sentenced to 
six months in jail after failing to complete ordered repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bobb, a supervisor of housing enforcement for the city attorney's 
office, said he believes it is necessary to push for stiff sentences for 
convicted repeat offenders such as Tabello because fines can too easily be 
dismissed as an operating expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see our cases become (another) cost of doing business," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, the fine becomes a license to run slums. We want judges to see 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Remo Tabello, an attorney who represented his brother Joseph in court, said 
that close to 90% of the necessary repairs have been completed. Although he 
accepted some fault on behalf of his brother, Tabello blamed most of the 
problems in the building on its low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came under attack for violations way back," Tabello said, referring to his 
brother's 1988 conviction for 25 slum violations in the two Hobart Avenue 
buildings, for which he was fined $18,174. "But the building was fixed. The 
tenants just played havoc with it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a common excuse, said Bobb, especially when the tenants in question 
are immigrants who have difficulty with English and little confidence in the 
authorities. According to inspectors, many residents of 840 S. Hobart are 
immigrants from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landlords are quick to blame their tenants," he said. "The problem is that 
you're dealing with tenants who are afraid to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest number of slum violations in Los Angeles, Bobb said, take place 
in the Westlake area, which is densely populated with Latinos. Hollywood and 
Koreatown -- both magnets for immigrants -- also have their share of 
violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bobb, the building fell into disrepair again in the years 
following the 1988 conviction. Although Tabello received warnings, inspectors 
from the Department of Building and Safety's Slum Housing Task Force concluded 
in April that repair efforts were insufficient and filed a criminal case.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw-based Founders National Bank has opened a new branch office in 
University Village just north of the USC campus, an area where banks are 
outnumbered by check-cashing stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Founders office, acquired Sept. 9, is in the building formerly 
occupied by Western Federal Savings Bank, 3301 S. Hoover Ave. The office opened 
the next business day to continue serving Western Federal's customers and 
ensure them that Founders is a sound banking institution, said Carlton Jenkins, 
president and CEO of Founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders, one of the few local African American-owned financial institutions, 
now has five branches in the inner city and plans additional ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USC office represents a significant opportunity that will benefit the 
bank in that we are a minority-owned institution concerned about serving a 
community that has historically been underserved," Jenkins said. "As a 
practical matter, it would afford us a gateway to East Los Angeles and 
Pico-Union, a traditionally Hispanic area."  
</P>
<P>
 Founders agreed to pay the Resolution Trust Corp. $888,000 for the $22.5 
million in deposits at the University Village branch. Last year regulators 
seized Western Federal Savings & Loan, which was owned by an investment group, 
after it suffered millions of dollars in loan losses. The thrift was renamed 
Western Federal Savings Bank and had been operated by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening is Founders' third in a year. In September, 1993, it opened two 
banks in the Crenshaw district after buying two branches from Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same logic that we employed in preserving this bank," Jenkins said 
from his temporary office at Crenshaw Plaza. "It's another effort on our part 
that the inner city does not lose bank branches." 
</P>
<P>
 The new branch is equipped with a 24-hour automated teller machine, and area 
customers can use the bank's customer service telephone number to access 
account information.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; DONATIONS BAIL OUT HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to donations ranging from a couple of bucks to thousands of dollars, a 
transitional shelter for homeless families has relocated after a shaky month 
that left it on the brink of shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Services Center was out of cash and facing overdue bills in August 
when the owner of its rented building at 250 W. 120th St. decided to sell the 
property and gave the shelter one month to vacate. Sarah Smith, who founded the 
shelter 1 1/2 years ago, feared that the dozen or so families living there 
while seeking permanent housing would be pushed back to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But a plea from Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) and some media 
attention about Smith's plight helped bring in donations ranging from $5 to a 
$5,000 check from an anonymous donor. Smith has now resettled her facility in a 
collection of motel-style apartments at 122nd Street and Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like someone up there is smiling down on me," said Smith, 49, who also 
serves as director of the facility, which helps find permanent shelter for 
homeless families. "I think someone was really looking out for these families 
because they really didn't have (anywhere) else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 A week before her scheduled Sept. 7 eviction from 250 W. 120th St., Smith 
struck a deal to lease the Avalon Boulevard apartments. Over the subsequent 
four days, Smith and volunteer helpers worked on crude renovations on the 
buildings, all of which had broken windows, filthy carpeting, dingy walls and 
lacked heaters. Smith's brother and a friend helped with the maintenance, and 
some tenants cleaned and painted their own rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first looked at the place, I got real worried 'cause it looked bad and 
I didn't think we could live here," said Xavier Seals, 27, who moved his wife 
and six children from the old building into the new shelter. "But Miss Sarah 
said to have faith and do a little bit of cleaning, and now it looks pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine separate bungalow-like apartments, seven house families who double 
or triple-up depending on space. Seals shares the two-bedroom apartment with a 
single woman and her baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she is looking into buying the building. All she needs now is to 
raise the $360,000 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a hurdle," Smith said of the fund-raising task ahead of her. 
"I got over the biggest one getting into this place. So raising a few more 
dollars shouldn't be too bad -- I hope." LUCILLE RENWICK

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; FIRST NOTES SOUNDED FOR ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With pomp and pageantry, the African American Unity Center recently celebrated 
the groundbreaking for an arts center on a site where an earthquake-damaged 
church now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the groove with Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," the 
Washington High School band marked the Sept. 22 ceremony by marching across 
53rd Street to the south corner of Vermont Avenue, where the Unity Center's 
performing arts center is scheduled to open its doors in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to see a lot of activity in this corner," said Bette Braxton, 
the program coordinator for the Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Motown Music Co. founder Berry Gordy, Mann Theatres and federal agencies 
chipped in $3 million to the Unity Center to help convert a former Presbyterian 
church into a theater, offering a stage for live performances and a retractable 
screen for exhibiting first-run films. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unity Center's two social service organizations, Unity House and the 
Community Unity Center for Human Growth and Development, already occupy two 
buildings in the same complex as the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents one additional arm of the programs we want to offer here," 
said Curtis Owens, executive director of the Unity Center. Owens said his 
organization also intends to offer classes on aspects of film, stage and music 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was launched with a $500,000 grant from Gordy and a matching grant 
from the city of Los Angeles. The group also received money from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration, Hughes 
Aircraft, Lockheed and Jo-Bete Music. Owens said it will cost about $5 million 
for the building to be fully functional, including monies set aside for new 
arts programs. The center will have a seating capacity of about 450.  
</P>
<P>
 "At least 85% of the money that Gordy and (Councilwoman) Rita Walters gave is 
for facility renovation and (earthquake) retrofitting to meet city building and 
safety codes," Owens said. The church building, which was built near the turn 
of the century, was recently declared unsafe by the city, Owens said.  
</P>
<P>
 While construction is in progress, Braxton will work on arts projects that 
will come to fruition by next month.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will be offering dance, drama and vocal programs very soon," said Braxton, 
who has worked as a project coordinator and assistant for such artists as David 
Carradine and Roberta Flack. "People from the community are already asking me 
when the programs are going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Braxton said the dance program should start by the end of November. It will be 
an extension of an existing Unity Center program for adults and children.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BOYLE HEIGHTS; GROUPS JOIN FORCES TO COMBAT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to crime in the area, neighbors and business owners have formed 
groups to combat burglaries, vandalism and other crime in the neighborhood 
surrounding Olympic Boulevard, where bustling traffic, businesses, apartment 
buildings and subsidized housing projects crowd the southern end of Boyle 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Watch, which includes 40 business owners, has pooled resources to 
hire a security company to patrol their properties at night to cut down on 
burglaries and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime "goes in spurts depending on the visibility of the officers in the 
Los Angeles Police Department, which is shorthanded," said Business Watch 
member Hector Hernandez, president of the Boyle Heights Chamber of Commerce and 
owner of Paramount Mattress Co. on East Olympic Boulevard. "That is why we took 
the initiative to hire our own security company." 
</P>
<P>
 The business owners, who pay a total of $1,800 per month for the security 
patrols, also receive help from the city with graffiti paintouts done by 
convicted criminals ordered by the courts to do community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had seen the crime, if not increase, remain at the same level. Even our 
police substation had been defaced with graffiti," Hernandez said. "After we 
initiated the security patrol, we have noticed an improvement not only in 
graffiti, but in crimes at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic neighborhood and other neighborhoods on the Eastside also are 
planning to participate in the LAPD's Operation Sparkle, an effort planned for 
Oct. 22 by the Hollenbeck Division to clean up trash and graffiti in different 
areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Trevis,president of the Neighborhood Watch Council, said the groups 
are trying to counteract what a study of San Diego urban problems called the 
"broken window effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned that if people do not maintain or upgrade their neighborhood, 
there is an increase in crime," Trevis said. "The vacant properties attract the 
drug dealers and then the gang members. We have learned that if we clean our 
community we can decrease the crime." MARY ANNE PEREZ

GHOST TOWN; BATTERED, NEARLY ABANDONED, A NEIGHBORHOOD IN WEST ADAMS STRUGGLES 
TO PIECE ITSELF BACK TOGETHER EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherlene Taylor surveys her home of 20 years and the once-bustling block of 
Harcourt Street in West Adams with heavy sighs and an air of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 She points to the lopsided houses and empty plots of dirt and rocks -- the 
remains of the thrashing this street and the neighborhood took in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of her own house, Taylor carefully steps over bricks, old lumber and 
trash strewn throughout the front and back yards. She peeks through a gaping 
hole to view what was once her living room, now a hollow shell of wooden beams 
and floors. Her driveway is a mass of gravel, dust and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the middle of a weekday afternoon in an area dominated by retired senior 
citizens, but Harcourt Street is strangely quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's depressing to see your house like this, all broken down," Taylor, 55, 
says in a low voice. "And the neighborhood, too. Old friends gone, their houses 
just sitting there with no one in them. You don't know if they'll move back. 
It's all changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered along this block-long stretch of Harcourt -- and two adjacent 
streets -- between Adams Boulevard and Hickory Street are the quake's vivid 
scars: vacant houses, empty lots where homes once stood, skeletons constructed 
for new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after the temblor shook Los Angeles, the city is still plagued 
with single blocks and neighborhoods of vacant, wrecked buildings, dubbed ghost 
towns by the Los Angeles housing department because of the physical devastation 
and the increase of vandalism, theft and vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the 15 ghost towns in Los Angeles are in the San Fernando 
Valley, West Adams is the site of an often-overlooked designated area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bordered by Adams and Rimpau boulevards, Palm Grove Avenue and Hickory Street, 
this cluster of mostly single-family homes and duplexes was hard hit. Several 
dozen chimneys toppled. Hairline cracks created what looked like replicas of 
freeway maps on walls. About 10% of the area's 1930s-era houses were knocked 
off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood boards now cover windows and padlocks block the doors, while grass 
grows into tall weeds at some houses. On the corner of Palm Grove Avenue and 
Hickory Street, the shell of a duplex that burned during the earthquake stood 
precariously on one side while the other side started to buckle under its own 
weight. The building was recently demolished.  
</P>
<P>
 There are also reconstructed houses on these streets -- sans the brick 
chimneys, but with new driveways, foundations and the same homeowners who 
retain some hope along with large loans to repay.  
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, these streets initially seem to have few problem houses. The 
four-block section can hardly compare to the devastation that remains in parts 
of the Valley, where crushed frames of quake-ravaged apartment buildings sit 
dormant, further wrecked by looters, prostitutes and transients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other ghost towns are more compact. You may have a cul-de-sac totally 
obliterated. (In West Adams), the earthquake left a scattered trail of damage 
over many, many blocks," said Bob Moncrief, director of major projects for the 
city's housing department. "So, it doesn't look like a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there remains significant quake damage in West Adams. It is the 
only designated ghost town made up predominantly of single-family homes. 
According to city statistics, of 2,159 buildings still vacant from the 
earthquake, 263 are in ghost towns. West Adams accounts for 53 of those 
buildings and its ghost town has a 30% vacancy rate. City figures also show 
that the West Adams area suffered an estimated $1.2 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, while several quake-damaged areas of the Valley are financially 
stable, West Adams is a neighborhood with low- to moderate-income households. 
Many residents are senior citizens living on fixed incomes who have been in 
these neighborhoods for 20 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a transient group of people. They've had considerable structural 
loss, which has led to lots of emotional and psychological pain for them," said 
Cheryl N. Grills, an associate professor of psychology at Loyola Marymount 
University who conducted a survey of earthquake damage in South Los Angeles for 
the Community Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Grills, like several residents, community activists and political leaders who 
represent this area, blamed the media's lack of coverage of quake-damaged South 
Los Angeles for the lack of attention and resources for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Nate Holden, whose district was the hardest hit in South Los 
Angeles, said the media "displaced the core of the damage from the earthquake. 
Yes, it was in Northridge. But it's down here, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor and her husband have been living with their son while their house is 
being repaired. Taylor complained that stories like hers have been ignored by 
media and officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody talks about the Valley this and the Valley that, but look here, 
right here around Crenshaw, there's damage all around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some earthquake recovery officials assisting residents in the West 
Adams-Crenshaw area say labeling a small section a "ghost town" takes away from 
the other significant damage in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more damage in Crenshaw than people know about," said Dennis 
Sylvester, a hazardous mitigation specialist for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester, who works in the Crenshaw Earthquake Service Center, sneers at the 
ghost town label, saying that it draws attention away from other local 
neighborhoods that are still recovering from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear about the (repair of the Santa Monica) freeway so much, but there 
are so many houses around Jefferson and Adams that have been damaged . . . so 
you can't talk only about the (Valley) ghost towns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Walker's home of 27 years on La Brea Avenue is one of those buildings 
Sylvester is talking about. Just south of the Santa Monica Freeway and five 
blocks west of the designated ghost town, the house sits on stilts awaiting 
repairs that could lag into next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The building has been burglarized about six times since the quake, Walker 
said. "Bicycles, tools, even the dog was taken." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Walker, 58, is living in a matchbox-sized, two-room apartment 
in Leimert Park that she moved into in February while she tries to figure out 
what to do about her home. Most of the cost of the repairs will have to come 
out of her own pocket, she said. With help from the Crenshaw Earthquake Service 
Center, Walker has received a $17,000 loan from a special homeowner program. 
Repairs, however, could cost as much as $80,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "My house is not a thing I want to talk about because I'm still sore," Walker 
said, pointing to her chest to signify the emotional pain she has suffered 
since the earthquake. "It's been a real adjustment to deal with. I don't know 
when I'm going to get back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an estimated 40% of the West Adams residents whose homes were damaged 
had earthquake insurance or were able to repair their homes through assistance 
from FEMA or the Small Business Administration, others were rejected for SBA 
loans or have run into roadblocks in getting repairs made or houses rebuilt, 
said Capri Wiggins, project manager of the West Adams ghost town for the city's 
housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychological toll from the earthquake and the frustration among residents 
who feel they are the last to receive financial and technical assistance is 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep thinking it'll get better next week, but it takes months, and each 
month gets harder so it makes you feel like you want to give up," said 
homeowner Salvador Sarabia, whose house on Palm Grove Avenue was damaged so 
badly that it had to be demolished. Sarabia is rebuilding from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're last on the totem pole," said a frustrated Sherlene Taylor, 
pointing to the open space between her back yard and her neighbor's. A 
five-foot-high cinder block wall that once stood there collapsed during the 
quake. A pile of cinder blocks now sits on the side of Taylor's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor, Jose Alvarez of Rimpau Boulevard, complains that his back yard 
has now become a shortcut for pedestrians since the wall fell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Crenshaw Earthquake Service Center, which includes 
representatives from a variety of government agencies, 42,242 people had 
applied for some kind of assistance from their office as of late September, the 
largest number of applicants in the 10 government-sponsored earthquake service 
centers. Applicants have come from as far as the South Bay and Hollywood, but 
the majority are from the Crenshaw area, said Lorraine Harrell, a spokeswoman 
for the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city is pouring several million dollars into repairing 
and protecting these disaster-stricken ghost town zones in the hopes of a quick 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the city designated the ghost towns from the worst devastated census 
tract areas. In July, it established a task force to broker deals between 
lenders and ghost town landlords, hoping to help get financially strapped 
owners a break on mortgage payments while they rebuild. If a bank is willing, 
the city will provide zero- or low-interest repair loans up to $50,000 to 
single-family homeowners from a pool of federal disaster aid and local housing 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also launched a two-month plan to clean up and secure the 15 
ghost towns with $2.8 million in FEMA funds. The work includes boarding up and 
fencing off abandoned or vacant buildings, and providing 24-hour roving 
security to ward off the transients, vandals and drug addicts who have rummaged 
through vacant buildings and back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the SBA announced in June that it would give top priority to loan 
requests from ghost town property owners. By late September, the SBA had 
approved 179 loans totaling nearly $55.5 million to ghost town property owners. 
The agency rejected 91 of the 325 requests received. Seventeen loan requests 
totaling $660,000 from the West Adams ghost town were approved by late 
September. Fourteen of the 42 requests were rejected and three applications are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokesman Rick Jenkins said applicants are denied usually because of 
inability to repay the loan. However, applicants are able to reapply for 
reconsideration rights from two weeks to two months after they are first 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarabia, 29, and Michael LaChapelle were two of the rejected applicants. 
Neither earned enough money to repay the loans. Sarabia, who owned his house 
for only five months before the temblor, had earthquake insurance that has 
covered most of the costs of demolishing and completely rebuilding his home. 
</P>
<P>
 But LaChapelle has had little luck with the Harcourt Street home, where he has 
lived all of his 36 years. His earthquake insurance expired in November. The 
house shifted eight inches off its foundation during the quake and was 
immediately red tagged, designating it uninhabitable. Two weeks after the 
quake, LaChapelle was laid off from his job as an auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle said building and safety inspectors have been urging him to either 
tear down the house and rebuild from scratch or work with what's there now, a 
dangerously unsteady building with myriad structural problems. LaChapelle said 
he is thinking of starting anew or moving away, possibly as far as Lancaster or 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much damage for me to try and put this house back together 
again," LaChapelle said of the house, which had been in his family for nearly 
40 years. He is currently living in a two-bedroom apartment on Burnside Avenue 
with his wife and their two daughters with the help of federal housing 
assistance for quake victims, which in their case lasts until September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, LaChapelle has complied with city requests to secure his 
house with a six-foot-high chain-link fence and large padlock that the city's 
housing department provided for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarabia, on the other hand, has been living in a trailer in the back yard of 
his property with his wife, Maria, and their 3-year-old son.  
</P>
<P>
 The couple received $3,200 in housing assistance from FEMA, which allowed them 
to buy the trailer instead of trying to find an apartment for more money. There 
is a shower, but no kitchen or running water. The couple strings a hose from a 
spigot into the shower stall to bathe and cooks with camping stoves under a 
blue tarp attached to the outside of the trailer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not very pretty, but if it rains we won't get wet and we're able to lock 
the door and get a good night's sleep," Sarabia said. The family had spent 
nearly two months living in his cousin's dank garage before getting the 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sarabias' new home is scheduled to be completed by the end of the month, 
said the contractor, Lou Stanley of J&L Construction in Long Beach. Sarabia 
helps with the construction to keep the costs down and has used the lumber from 
his demolished house to build a fence separating the trailer from the house 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he and his family are grateful that they have enough money to rebuild 
and know it will happen soon, Sarabia is still impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get a certificate of occupancy I don't care if the house is not 
pretty," he said, sifting through a briefcase filled with file folders and 
documents relating to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," he said. "All I want is a house where I can stay, so things 
can get more back to normal." RESIDENTIAL MITIGATION MEASURES: 
</P>
<P>
 These measures are recommended to further strengthen and protect homes against 
earthquakes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Install reinforced concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove damaged chimney and install a metal chimney, metal framing and metal 
studs to house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bolt house or mobile home to existing foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strengthen "cripple walls" -- a short supporting wall between the foundation 
and the floor beams -- with plywood and sill bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reconstruct or strengthen chimney with ties and bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark utility shut-off valves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anchor water heater to wall and floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install cabinet and drawer latches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secure picture frames and mirrors to walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizen and disabled homeowners with low to moderate incomes are 
eligible for free or low-cost minor repairs through the Los Angeles Housing 
Department's "Handyworker" program. Eligible repairs are limited to work that 
does not require a city building permit and are subject to a standard 
limitation of $500 in material costs. Emergencies that directly affect the 
occupants' health and safety are also provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: 213-389-2373 extension 256, or 213-751-8573. HOME EQUITY FRAUD 
PREVENTION: 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in immediate need of earthquake damage repair can become targets 
for scam artists, officials said. To prevent home improvement fraud when 
rebuilding, officials suggest that residents use the following measures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not hire a contractor who has solicited you by telephone or at your door. 
Find a licensed contractor in the yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not sign a work order with the first contractor you contact. Get bids 
from several contractors and compare prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the contractor's license before signing a contract. Ask for the 
license number and check with the Contractors State License Board at 
1-800-321-2752. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure any promises made by the contractor are included in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sure to thoroughly read and understand the contract before signing it. 
Never sign a contract that says "Security Interest" or "Deed of Trust" anywhere 
on the document. Signing such a document means that you are using your house as 
collateral and could lose it if you miss any payments to the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a down payment is required, do not pay a contractor more than $1,000 or 
10% of the contract price, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep all papers relating to any work done to your house and all phone 
numbers of people you've contacted. 
</P>

8 LOYOLA STUDENTS NAMED NATIONAL MERIT SEMIFINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loyola tops the list of local high schools with eight semifinalists named to 
the National Merit Scholarship Corp.'s 1995 scholarship program. About one-half 
of 1% of each state's high school graduating class is represented in the 
nationwide pool of 15,000 semifinalists announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Named from Loyola High were Brendan Beer, Christopher Byrnes, Michael Cano, 
Robert Cuza, Carlos Estrada, James Householder, Joseph Mauch and Anthony 
McDevitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Chung, Elizabeth Grausam, Julianna Mather, Irene Park, Susan Ryan and 
Kristin Woolley were named from Marlborough. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local schools had three semifinalists. Phillip Cooper, John Green and Ann 
Van were named from Marshall High and Margaret Gilman, Jona-Rose Jaffe and 
Valerie Levitt from the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named were Dong Hong from Bravo Medical Magnet High and Jim Cheng from 
Lincoln High. 
</P>
<P>
 These students have an opportunity to continue in the competition for about 
6,700 scholarships, worth more than $26 million, to be awarded next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million juniors in about 19,000 high schools entered the 1995 
program by taking the 1993 preliminary qualifying test. The highest scores in 
each state were designated semifinalists in numbers based on each state's 
percentage of the national total of graduating seniors.

BUILDER SCALES DOWN PLAN TO BUILD HOMES ON HILLSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer has agreed to scale back his plan to build homes atop a scenic 
hillside in Echo Park, ending a three-year dispute with local residents who 
have fought to preserve the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an effort to avoid further fights and delays, I think it was an incentive 
for us to compromise and reach some consensus," said Benjamin M. Reznik, an 
attorney for West Los Angeles developer Mark Kaufman."We can move forward now 
and just concentrate on the project itself," Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise calls for Kaufman, general partner of Avon Terrace Homes Ltd., 
to construct four duplexes or five houses on 10,000 square feet of space about 
100 feet below the top of Kite Hill at 1450 Avon Place, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman had proposed cutting off the top of the hill to make room for seven 
houses on 45,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A compromise approved Sept. 14 by the City Council limits the buildings' size 
and requires the developer to donate the rest of the property -- 54,000 square 
feet -- to the city for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Borden, a member of a committee organized to protect Kite Hill, was 
pleased with the outcome. "Chopping up hills is something I think finally 
officials have recognized is a real shame," Borden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new construction site, she said, "will be less intrusive. . . . we feel 
that it's a good compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznik, who declined to elaborate on the project's cost, said groundbreaking 
could begin within a year of public hearings on dividing the lots.

GROUP OPENS THIRD FACILITY FOR MENTALLY DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several years, a Wilshire-based group of nonprofit developers called A 
Company of Friends has dedicated itself to providing the mentally disabled with 
a chance to live on their own. Last week, the developers opened their newest 
affordable housing facility in the renovated Parker Hotel at 725 S. Witmer St. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third facility opened by A Company of Friends, which was recently 
named "developer of the year" by the Southern California Assn. of Nonprofit 
Housing. Two of their facilities are in Hollywood, and four more are scheduled 
to open before December throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're investing in areas outside of Skid Row, because mental illness knows no 
neighborhood boundaries" said Robert Sanborn, executive director of the group. 
Most services catering to impoverished mentally disabled people have 
traditionally been located in the Skid Row area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Parker Hotel is a three-story brick structure, about 50 years old, that 
the developers acquired 2 1/2 years ago from an owner accused of slum 
violations. It will house 32 people who can take advantage of on-site 
counseling and social services as well as job training, employment referrals 
and a meal program. 
</P>
<P>
 A Company of Friends spent about $1.7 million in public and private funds 
renovating the rooms, which will each have a private bathroom. A community room 
and kitchen is located on each floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the facility is targeted for mentally disabled people capable of 
living on their own, six units will be reserved for low-income residents 
infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people with mental illnesses tend to have a compounding addiction, 
Sanborn said, such as alcohol or drug abuse. Sanborn said that since the 
group's first Hollywood facility opened in 1991, he has seen a steady stream of 
former drug users with mental disabilities who acquired the virus that causes 
AIDS by injecting drugs intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of poverty," he said, noting that many of the mentally disabled 
residents were once homeless. "They became infected sharing paraphernalia." 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who wish to live in the six units reserved for HIV-positive 
residents need not be mentally disabled, however. The only requirement is that 
they be physically well enough to live on their own, Sanborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Parker Hotel's mentally disabled residents will be living on their 
own for the first time. Sanborn believes that by allowing them that 
opportunity, his group will help them break the cycle of dependency that often 
keeps the mentally disabled -- particularly those who are homeless -- from 
moving beyond transitional shelter programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Community of Friends is in the process of screening applicants for the 
Parker Hotel. Information: Craig Fenner, director of residential services, 
(213) 480-0809.

HUNT GIVES HERSELF AND HER TEAM A TALL ORDER TO FILL; ROOSEVELT HIGH STAR 
SHOOTS FOR CITY VOLLEYBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2 1/2 inches, Zenobia Tyson Hunt is easy to spot in a crowd. It's 
been a familiar feeling for the Roosevelt High senior, who was already 
6-feet-tall by eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always stand out and people can spot me anywhere," Hunt said. "In the 
eighth grade, a lot of people thought I should play basketball or be a model." 
</P>
<P>
 Modeling was appealing, but lessons were too expensive. Basketball has proven 
a good alternative for Hunt, who has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA, 
Long Beach State, Idaho and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, known as Tyson to friends, has also started to make a name in 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 She took up the sport last year at the urging of sisters Lisa and Leona 
Jacobs, former classmates at Hollenbeck Junior High who went on to the 
volleyball and basketball teams at Roosevelt. Lisa now attends Cal State 
Stanislaus, and Leona is at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kind of recruited me," Hunt said of the Jacobs sisters. "I went to watch 
some of their (volleyball) games and decided to give it a try. I just wanted to 
see how it went. I felt like a beginner. I was scared and nervous and my timing 
felt really funny. I thought 'This ain't for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But at the urging of Roosevelt volleyball Coach Ken Maki, Hunt decided to 
stick with the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 She proved to be a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt earned All-City Section 4-A Division honors and was named the Eastern 
League's most valuable player last year, averaging 10 kills and four blocks at 
middle blocker to help Roosevelt (18-2) to the Southeastern Conference title 
and reach the City final for the eighth time in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zenobia is blessed with physical ability and talent, but she's never played 
in any organized leagues in volleyball," said Maki, who has coached the 
Roughriders to five City titles. "She's really become an aggressive player in 
two years, but there are so many fine points you have to learn through 
experience. I'll always wonder, 'What if I had had her since her ninth grade 
year?' " 
</P>
<P>
 This year, hopes of another City final appearance for the Roughriders will 
rest on Hunt, the tallest player at Roosevelt in Maki's 15 seasons, and 5-6 
senior setter Minnie Alatriste, the only returners from last year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders will be strengthened by the addition of middle blocker Dawn 
Pellerin, a 5-8 junior transfer from Huntington Park High. But Hunt will often 
be flanked by a pair of 5-6 freshman outside hitters, Anabel Tovar and Rose 
Zuniga. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of ninth-graders," Hunt said. "We will be much better once we 
get to know each other. For all the seniors, the goal is to make it back to the 
City championship." 
</P>
<P>
 She has the same goal in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, whose father stands 6-5 and whose mother is 5-9, did not join the 
Roosevelt basketball team until midway through her sophomore year, but she 
established herself as one of the City's premier post players last season to 
lead Roosevelt (21-2) to the school's first City 4-A final appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt scored 23 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a double-overtime loss to 
Crenshaw in the longest girls game in City championship history. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times All-Central City first-team selection, Hunt averaged 16 points, 15 
rebounds and four blocks for the Southeastern Conference champion Roughriders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volleyball and basketball go hand in hand," Maki said. "Going up for a block 
and a rebound are basically the same thing. When I tell them to get low on 
defense, it's just like playing one-on-one. I told her, 'Don't look at just one 
sport. Go for both.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, whose brother Paul Jr. was an All-City basketball player at Wilson High 
as a senior in 1993, said conditioning from volleyball has increased her 
vertical leap in basketball. Hunt, however, said she is leaning toward playing 
only volleyball in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm playing basketball I like the sport more, but overall I prefer 
volleyball," Hunt said. "My passing has improved, but I need to work on my 
blocking. At the (NCAA) Division I level, the competition looks good and it 
would be difficult to hang in two sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt opponents are voicing similar concerns about playing against Hunt.

PARTICIPANTS HIT THE BEACH FOR CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a busy morning for fund raising on Ventura's beaches Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from one direction, nearly 500 people were walking to raise money for 
Ventura County's AIDS support groups. Coming from the other direction: more 
than 200 participants in an American Heart Assn. pledge walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidentally scheduled for the same time, the two groups converged briefly at 
San Buenaventura State Beach -- red ribbons brushing against T-shirts 
silk-screened with cheerfully pulsing hearts -- then went their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual Walk for Life, benefiting Christopher House and AIDS Care, 
was the most successful pledge walk in the group's history, raising $50,502, 
organizers said. Christopher House is a hospice for people living with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and HIV. AIDS Care is a nonprofit organization that 
provides support services for people with the disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Heart Walk brought in about $15,000 for research on heart disease, an increase 
from last year's $12,000. Organizer Bart Bleuel said he had hoped for greater 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little disappointed in the number of walkers," said Bleuel, adding 
that he thought Walk for Life's gain may have been the heart association's 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking to the same people about the walks, and obviously, they 
couldn't go to both," he said. "But the AIDS foundation looked like they were 
doing great and we're happy for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Walk for Life organizer and AIDS Care Executive Director Doug Green credited 
much of the group's success to strong participation from corporations, schools 
and groups of friends. Thirty-eight teams took part, ranging from families of 
three to a group of 58 from the Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology firm Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really focused this year on team building," Green said. "We're getting 
them to walk with their families, their friends, their co-workers. It's been 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen alone raised $4,248, while 27 students from Buena High School, wearing 
blue T-shirts that spelled out Buena Bulldogs, brought in $1,500 for the cause. 
Senior class members Ari Bloom, 17, Tammy Federman, 16, and Jay Gupta, 16, 
organized the school's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did really well," Bloom said. "We were impressed. It says a lot for Buena, 
gives us a more positive image." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rich said his colleagues at Amgen were motivated to turn out for the 
event by both personal experience with the AIDS epidemic and by the 
pharmaceutical company's active role in medical research. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has affected most people I know in some way," Rich said. "And what most 
of us do for a living is work with products that might someday help people with 
AIDS. So we want to help increase understanding and awareness about the 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen clinical researcher Wade Lovelace said he extended his fund raising 
across the nation, lining up pledges for the 10-kilometer walk on business 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I was at a hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, and I got my doctor to 
pledge," Lovelace said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lovelace and the rest of the Amgen team were lining up at the start 
line, the first of the Heart Walk participants began trickling by, on their way 
to a turnaround at Marina Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle and Bruce Olson of Ventura were led by Tanka, a strapping Rottweiler 
with a blue American Heart Assn. balloon bobbing from its collar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olsons are regular participants in Heart Walk. Bruce, a podiatrist, said 
he sees many recovering heart patients in his practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them develop foot problems, shin splints and the like because they 
have to walk during their recovery stage," Olson said. "And many of them aren't 
used to walking." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the participants, the events were more than just a way to raise 
money for a good cause. They were a chance to show support, and to remember 
friends, family and colleagues they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Dekel brought her two sons, Jordan, 1, and Zachary, 4, from Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father died of AIDS," she said, pushing her children along the bike path 
in a carriage built for two. "I like to come in memory of him." 
</P>
<P>
 She handed Zachary a pretzel. "He knows about it," she said. "I like to make 
sure he knows what is going on."

LOCAL TALENT DIVES IN AT POINT MUGU; AVIATION: ATTENDANCE DROPS AT ANNUAL AIR 
SHOW AS BIG MILITARY FLIGHT ACTS ARE MISSING FROM LINEUP. BUT NAVY SQUADRONS 
SEE IT AS THEIR 'MOMENT TO SHINE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of aviation fans turned out for some old-fashioned, 
seat-of-your-pants aerobatics Saturday at the 32nd annual presentation of the 
Point Mugu Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the absence this year of the big military flight-demonstration teams such 
as the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds, the air show's 
producers relied on a mix of local Navy squadrons and nationally known civilian 
aerobatic acts to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Navy Point Mugu aviators said they relished their moment out from under 
the wings of the big acts, even though attendance -- estimated at 30,000 by 
air-show organizers -- was down dramatically from last year's first-day crowd 
of about 100,000 people. The show at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station 
continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our moment to shine," said Capt. Daniel R. McCourt, commander of the 
VX-9 Detachment at Point Mugu, a Navy unit that flies and tests F-14D Tomcats 
and their weapons systems. "It's kind of nice to be able to show the local 
folks and our families what we do when we come to work." 
</P>
<P>
 During their performance, squadron members wowed the crowd while demonstrating 
classic Navy-style dog-fighting, strafing and bombing runs that shocked the 
audience with loud, percussive explosions and sent fireballs into the skies 
over the infield on the base's main runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Max Duggan, one of the squadron's pilots who flew Saturday, said 
demonstrating his F/A-18 Hornet's capabilities before a hometown crowd was a 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of like being the center of attention," said the 31-year-old Duggan, 
a Camarillo resident. "Not only do our friends and family get to see us fly, so 
do our maintenance crews -- they're the ones that do all hard work that make us 
look good out there." 
</P>
<P>
 On the squadron's last bombing run, a pair of F-14 Tomcats simulated the 
release of four 1,000-pound bombs over the infield. Immediately after the 
explosion, ground crews intentionally set a portion of the field on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 That provided a perfect entree for a C-130E Hercules from the Channel Islands 
Air National Guard, which swooped in moments later and extinguished the blaze. 
The big green military transport demonstrated the guard's most recent 
high-profile mission: fighting forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The show formally started at noon with World War II-era fighters from the 
Southern California Wing of the Confederate Air Force, which performed the 
famed "missing man" flyby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo-based squadron was followed by the presentation of a 
1,200-square-foot American flag by a member of the all-female Misty Blues 
Parachute Team, who unfurled the banner as she jumped from a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the modern Navy squadrons took to the skies, a rare Grumman F8-F2 
Bearcat fighter, which saw service at the close of World War II, joined up for 
a wingtip-to-wingtip flyby with its modern-day counterpart, a Grumman F-14D 
Tomcat -- showing off more than 50 years of Navy fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also highlighted the skills of several civilian aerobatic 
specialists, who flipped, rolled, dived and twisted through the skies over the 
sprawling base. 
</P>
<P>
 One pilot brought an international flair to the show with his Russian-made 
Sukhoi-29 high-performance monoplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut Creek-based pilot John Piggott waited two years and paid $175,000 for 
the specialized Russian plane -- designed with high-tech composite materials 
specifically for the Russian National Aerobatic Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They designed and built this aircraft specifically to beat Western pilots in 
air shows," Piggott said. "It has no military history to it and it wasn't a 
trainer. They built it to win medals." 
</P>
<P>
 During his performance, Piggott maneuvered the gleaming plane from horizontal 
to vertical, so that it glided nose-up across the sky, a stunt that caused the 
crowd to roar in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole thing is to try and get the audience to say, 'Airplanes aren't 
suppose to do that,' " Piggott said. "That's the kind of act I'm trying to 
develop."

POLICE STOREFRONT GRAND OPENING CAPS OFF ANNUAL MOORPARK PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by 20 freshly minted volunteers dressed in white polo shirts, Ventura 
County Sheriff Larry Carpenter and Mayor Paul Lawrason helped cut a ribbon 
Saturday morning to open a downtown police storefront in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening capped the 24th annual Moorpark Country Days Parade, which 
attracted more than 5,000 people, parade organizers said. There were more than 
75 parade entries, including the Moorpark and Simi Valley high school bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty good parade this year," said David Cruz, 78, who has lived in 
the city for 40 years. "They had a lot more bands than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on the back of a pickup truck parked off of Moorpark Avenue, Cruz had 
a front-row seat for the parade, and planned to check out the new police 
storefront when the last float went by.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people volunteered to work there," he said. "That's real nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade route snaked through town on a mile-long route that passed in front 
of the new station at the corner of Moorpark Avenue and High Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Carpenter -- in boots, a cowboy hat, a vest 
and a holstered gun -- welcomed the crowd of about 100 residents to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (station) does not represent your government, it represents your 
community," he said. "A community that cares about their quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will keep the station open 25 hours per week, answering questions 
about law enforcement and passing out crime prevention information.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Sheriff's Department's Moorpark Enforcement Division plan to 
periodically use the small office to file police reports and interview suspects 
and witnesses to crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city-owned building, which was vacant for more than three years, 
will be used by a private company under contract with the city to do building 
and safety inspections. The station will be open from noon to 5 p.m. Monday 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers at the ceremony were eager to start their crime-stopping 
duties, but a few were a little nervous. Jonas Casas, 26, is scheduled for the 
first shift on Monday, along with two other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to wing it," he said. "I haven't read the manual yet. I'm 
afraid someone's going to ask me something and I'm not going to know what to 
tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers were trained during a three-hour session on crime-prevention 
techniques and dealing with the public on police matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Ed Tumbleson, who along with Deputy Jody Keller is helping to 
organize the station, said he did not expect a rush of people to use the 
station. Moorpark has the lowest crime rate of any Ventura County city, 
Tumbleson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling (the volunteers) to bring a book," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is encouraging the volunteers to walk through the downtown and meet people 
while in their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really about making contact with people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Jane Lavalle, who drives a school bus, said the contact with the 
people is what attracted her to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm good at that," she said. "I'm comfortable talking with people, and I 
think this is a positive thing. Being there to talk with people and help them 
out tells people that not all policemen are bad."

AUTHORITIES BRACE FOR POSSIBLE INFESTATION AFTER MEDFLIES FOUND; FRUIT: 
OFFICIALS LAY TRAPS AND TREAT TREES BUT REFUSE TO SPECULATE ON AERIAL SPRAYING 
OF MALATHION. THE INSECTS COULD COST COUNTY MILLIONS.

<P>
 A day after confirming the frightening discovery of a pair of fertile Medflies 
in a Camarillo orchard, federal, state and local authorities descended upon the 
area Saturday -- laying traps, inspecting fruit and hosing down trees with the 
powerful chemical malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as they braced for the possibility that thousands of other Medflies 
may already have infested the area, entomologists refused to speculate on 
whether they will have to resort to aerial spraying of malathion -- a 
controversial way of eradicating the destructive pests before they establish 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly discovery is significant because it could set off a brutal assault 
on the most profitable sector of the county's $848-million agriculture industry 
-- fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture officials and entomologists did not report any additional 
discoveries of Medflies on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting traps, they hoped to determine how many other Medflies are in the 
area. For every fertile fly trapped, officials said, there might be 1,000 other 
fertile flies nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take several days before they size up the extent of the problem and 
make decisions on how to contend with it, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What type of treatment strategy that ultimately will be put in place, it's 
too early to make that decision," project spokesman Douglas L. Hendrix of the 
federal Department of Food and Agriculture said when asked about aerial 
spraying or other Medfly-fighting measures. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged the devastating impact the Medfly could wreak on the 
county's agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have any fruit fly introduction into a production region, it is always 
a concern, because they have the ability to exponentially increase," Hendrix 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabeth Brokaw, a leader of the Ventura County Fruitfly Action Cooperation 
Task Force, said professional and back-yard growers within about a 4 1/2-mile 
radius of the discovery site should not move fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports from members of the county's Medfly task force incorrectly 
said that a quarantine had already been ordered on all fruit within that 
radius. That has not happened, officials said Saturday, but an announcement is 
expected Monday on whether one will be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine decision will be made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
with state and local officials, said Rex Laird, executive director of the 
Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and farmers near the Medfly discovery site -- northeast of Upland 
and Lewis roads at the campus of St. John's Seminary -- were trying to figure 
out the real meaning of the find. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, whose entire livelihood is at stake, were doing the most guessing, 
trying to get accurate readings of the impact of the discovery itself and of 
the damage a full-scale Medfly infestation could cause. For example about 30% 
of the county's lemons are shipped to Japan, bringing in more than $50 million, 
but Japan could embargo those shipments if an infestation has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 What would happen if there are indeed thousands of Medflies in the area? The 
idea of a possible quarantine frightens some farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worse than an earthquake or flood or anything you can think of," said 
rancher John Grether, whose citrus and avocado groves are less than four miles 
from where the two flies were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Laird agreed. "The fact of the matter is, with the economy and the times we 
are in now, we can ill afford to be in the situation we are in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to hurt a lot of people," he said. "There are going to be a lot of 
people out of work, if in fact it turns out to be an infestation. It's going to 
be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah House, who owns property less than a mile from the discovery site, 
worries for those neighbors who make their living off the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is big agriculture country. A lot of this stuff just isn't back-yard 
fruit. It's income. Groves." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Saturday morning, workers from the Cooperative Medfly Project in Los 
Angeles County arrived on the 200-acre St. John's campus armed with bug-killing 
devices and other specialized equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying heavy backpacks loaded with high-powered hand-spraying units that 
looked like those used to sandblast parking lots, the workers spent two hours 
blowing a blend of poison and bait on the foliage within a 200-meter radius of 
the tree where the flies were trapped, on the crest of a hill near student 
dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
 The molasses-like spray is 10% malathion solution and 90% corn-syrup bait. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, another team of workers laid hundreds of Medfly traps, most 
of them in the square-mile area around the discovery site. 
</P>
<P>
 A third team snatched pieces of oranges from the trees around the site, 
slicing them up in an attempt to determine whether they had been infested with 
Medfly larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a circle on empty white buckets turned upside down, Rogelio Rodarte 
and two co-workers from the state Department of Food and Agriculture sliced off 
thin pieces of the fruit and placed them under a microscope to detect any 
larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 They found some harmless larvae from vinegar flies, Rodarte said, but no 
Medfly larvae. He would know if the larvae were Medfly, Rodarte said, because 
they would have two brown dots on the tail. "With the naked eye, they all look 
the same," he said, lifting his magnifying glass to an orange slice. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile away, Linda Charpied said she has gotten used to insects around 
her house in the middle of miles of orchards on Seminary Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of allergies from just regular spraying that they do on the 
regular trees," said Charpied, a nurse and part-time actress whose husband, 
Michael, operates the boilers for St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not concerned about the Medflies, you have to be an idiot," 
Charpied said. "But if you live here, you have to expect this."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; VOLUNTEERS JOIN TO CLEAN UP VENTURA HIGH

<P>
 About 450 students, parents and community members converged Saturday on 
Ventura High School for the campus' fourth annual cleanup day. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to spiff up the school was part of a program called Students 
Earning Revenue for Ventura High School Enrichment, or SERVE. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at 8 a.m., about 350 students and 100 parents and other volunteers 
used brooms, sponges, mops and heavier equipment to attack the dirt and grime 
that have built up at the school over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A few spent hours digging trenches for a new sprinkling system. The crew of 
volunteers finished at about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great day and got a ton of stuff done," said Assistant Principal 
Larry Emrich. "It was just super." 
</P>
<P>
 Many local businesses chipped in by donating goods and services, Emrich said. 
The students collected pledges for each hour of work they put in, raising about 
$7,500, Emrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money will go back to various school organizations, based on the 
designations of the student volunteers, officials said. About 4% of the 
proceeds will go toward administrative costs. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JUDGE ORDERS RELEASE OF JURY POOL SURVEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ordered the release of questionnaires used to poll the attitudes 
of prospective jurors in the murder case of Mark Scott Thornton of Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is accused of killing Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, 34, during a 
carjacking last year.Because O'Sullivan's 12-day disappearance and slaying drew 
substantial media coverage, the court is trying to discover how much the 125 
members of the jury pool know about the case by having them complete an 
84-question, 27-page survey.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath said he will make the 
questionnaires public after each person is interviewed by lawyers. He will 
strike the juror's name, Social Security number and other identifying 
information from the forms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, McGrath denied several Ventura County media outlets access to the 
questionnaires. He decided to allow them to be inspected during a hearing on a 
motion filed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 40 of the 125 prospective jurors have either been interviewed by 
attorneys about their responses or excluded from the case because their answers 
reflected bias.The trial is expected to start after a jury is seated, possibly 
in about three weeks, attorneys said. DWAYNE BRAY

 A 26-year-old Moorpark man died Saturday from head injuries he sustained last 
weekend after falling into a concrete drainage ditch in Moorpark, Ventura 
County coroner's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Soto hit his head when he slipped and fell Sept. 25 while trying to 
climb out of the concrete-lined Arroyo Simi Flood Control Channel that cuts 
through the city, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said.  
</P>

 Soto, who was conscious when officers first arrived at the scene, later fell 
into unconsciousness, a Simi Valley Hospital spokeswoman said. SCOTT HADLY

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN PILEUP IN OXNARD

<P>
 A motorcyclist was killed early Saturday evening in a pileup on the Pacific 
Coast Highway at Pleasant Valley Road in Oxnard, a California Highway Patrol 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident at about 7:15 closed PCH in both directions from Pleasant Valley 
Road to Hueneme Road for several hours, forcing the CHP to route traffic 
through city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other people were injured in the accident, when the black BMW they were 
riding in rolled over several times, the spokesman said. Two of the passengers 
were trapped in the vehicle for nearly half an hour, and rescue personnel had 
to cut them free of the wreckage. One person in the car was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were taken to St. Johns Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. One was 
treated and released. The other two were still being treated by doctors as of 
late Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims and details of the crash were unavailable late 
Saturday, the CHP spokesman said. SCOTT HADLY

POSSIBLE AERIAL SPRAYING DRAWS CENSURE, SUPPORT; MALATHION: THOUGH OFFICIALS 
HAVE NOT EVEN SPECULATED ON WHETHER THE PESTICIDE WILL BE USED AGAINST 
MEDFLIES, DEBATE ON ITS MERITS AND DRAWBACKS HAS ALREADY BEGUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From two dead flies, the nightmares spring: helicopters spewing brownish-pink 
poison, demonstrators massing in protest, politicians shouting to stop the 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes have been played out, to one degree or another, in Riverside, 
Orange and Los Angeles counties -- in almost every agricultural region where 
the dreaded Mediterranean fruit fly lurks. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of two fertile female Medflies in Camarillo -- the pests' first 
known incursion into Ventura County -- has raised fears of a repeat performance 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials emphasize that they're still far from a decision 
on whether to begin aerial spraying of malathion, a pesticide that kills adult 
Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 They must first figure out whether the two female Medflies, found drowned in 
the bottom of a glass-bottle trap, represent the vanguard of a major incursion 
or simply a pair of unlucky wanderers. Even if they determine that the 
fruit-devouring insects have invaded Ventura County, they might decide on 
other, more subtle, means of control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Aerial spraying would definitely be a last resort," said Elisabeth Brokaw, a 
leader of the county's Medfly task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a last resort, however, aerial spraying remains hugely controversial. 
Anticipating a battle, local farmers, environmentalists and scientists are 
already preparing their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, historically, has been fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-spraying factions emphasize that malathion is a garden-variety 
insecticide, used in countless back yards to zap aphids, mealy bugs and other 
common pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wide-scope insecticide," said Max Waggoner, manager of the Mound 
Garden Center in Ventura. For home gardeners battling bugs, he routinely 
recommends malathion. It's effective, he said, and relatively inexpensive -- a 
pint sells for $8.99. 
</P>
<P>
 But few people complain when a neighbor sprays the stuff on back-yard roses. 
When helicopters buzz overhead after bedtime, sprinkling the pesticide over 
chimneys and jungle-gyms, organized protests erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 To monitor citizen concerns, officials have set up malathion hot lines after 
previous aerial sprays. Callers have complained of nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, 
rashes and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion spraying is not safe," concludes Corey Deetzer, a member of the 
Conejo Valley Organic Gardening Club who has researched the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the California Department of Health Services, however, have 
repeatedly announced that spraying in urban areas poses no significant health 
hazard. They point out that many of the symptoms reported after malathion 
spraying can stem from the flu or even the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the population are sensitive, especially the elderly and 
people with allergies," Brokaw said. "But most people in the community won't 
even notice it at all."  
</P>
<P>
 While malathion kills insects, state officials say the pesticide breaks down 
easily and harmlessly in people, because the human body contains enzymes 
capable of handling the chemicals. Still, in a 1993 fact sheet on malathion, 
state health officials recommended that people stay indoors during aerial 
spraying, rinse down outdoor play areas, wash skin and clothing that comes in 
contact with the pesticide, and scrub home-grown produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a long list of precautions alarms malathion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foes also object, in principle, to widespread spraying of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how many millions of tons of poisons are dumped on this planet by 
accident," said Cassandra Auerbach of the Conejo Valley Sierra Club. "We don't 
need any more. And that's what pesticides are -- poison. They kill life." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers readily admit that they have trouble countering the visceral emotional 
reaction against pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aerial spraying really upsets people a lot, psychologically if nothing else," 
Brokaw said. "But if you step back and take a look at it logically, you'll see 
that spraying can make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The growers' best arguments rest on dispassionate calculations. They explain 
that a Medfly invasion could destroy the agricultural industry. Ventura 
County's crops alone were valued at $848 million last year -- but the 
agricultural economy stretches way beyond the fields to touch packing houses, 
trucking firms, irrigation consultants and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to prepare the public because this is a very serious 
situation for agriculture in Ventura County," citrus and avocado rancher John 
Grether said. "It has such an impact on so many jobs, and on the whole way we 
do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his groves lie just four miles from the Medfly discovery site, 
Grether believes that aerial spraying should be only a last resort. "I hope it 
wouldn't come to that," he said. "It really tends to polarize the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although pest experts have battled the Medfly for more than a decade, they 
have not yet determined which method of attack works best. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensive spraying campaign that started in 1989 sprinkled malathion across 
536 miles in four Southern California counties, at a cost of $52 million. But 
just one year after that effort ended, trappers found 25 flies in Koreatown in 
Los Angeles. And by late 1992, several hundred Medflies had been spotted -- 
many popping up in areas that had recently been sprayed with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got tons of literature here that proves that malathion spraying is not 
safe, is not effective, and is very expensive," Deetzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a more low-tech way of controlling the Medflies, officials have been 
releasing 780 million sterile male insects a week into the Los Angeles Basin. 
They hope the sterile Medflies will mate with the females -- a coupling that 
would yield no offspring and therefore thin the ranks of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have also imposed a quarantine on a 1,500-square-mile stretch that 
reaches into Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. The quarantine 
bans people from transporting fruit grown in that region. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet trappers keep finding Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last winter, the discovery of several Medflies in the Riverside County 
cities of Corona and Norco prompted officials to spray 18 square miles with 
malathion, provoking a furious citizen uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion opponents in Ventura County hope to avoid such a clash by addressing 
the subject of spraying early and often. Deetzer plans to rally a group of 
anti-spraying activists and begin lobbying politicians soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than re-create the same health risks and ineffective programs here in 
Ventura County, we need to formulate an intelligent pest-management plan," she 
said. "It is possible."

TROUBLES ABOUND AT PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL; MEDICINE: PATIENT'S FAMILY IS SUING 
THE COUNTY OVER A DEATH FROM A HEART ATTACK. IN ALL, TWO HAVE DIED FROM DRUGS 
AND TWO COMMITTED SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time nurses saw Carol Ann Gonzales alive, she was vomiting and 
screaming from a painful headache. When they checked in on her three hours 
later, she had suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 None of her nurses at the county mental hospital in Ventura knew that the 
medication they gave her for schizophrenia could cause headaches, vomiting and 
cardiac arrest, state investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the inpatient psychiatric unit lacked the proper equipment -- a 
face mask, suction machine and defibrillator -- to revive the 43-year-old 
woman, a state report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's family is suing the county and its psychiatric unit over the death 
in September, 1993. But the case is just one of many incidents that have 
plagued the troubled psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Department of Health Services: 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, two patients have died from drugs they received 
there. Two have escaped from the open-air hospital near Ventura County Medical 
Center and killed themselves. One suicidal patient slashed her wrist with a 
razor blade. Another was left with a cigarette lighter and burned her arm. A 
third swallowed a bed spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a former patient filed suit charging nurses strapped her down, failed 
to check on her for four hours and left her to urinate on herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In all these cases, state health department licensing inspectors and lawyers 
representing former patients have raised questions about the training and 
procedures the county unit is using. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at all of these reports, the common theme is, nobody is trained 
and nobody knows what is expected of them," said Andrew Koenig, an attorney 
representing Rhonda Murrieta, the woman restrained for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials defend the facility, saying state inspectors hold the staff 
responsible for an overwhelming maze of rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have four books of policies and procedures for the inpatient unit," said 
Penny Matthews, who directs the county's acute care services for the mentally 
ill. "There is no way every employee can know every policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating their task, she said, is the layout of the inpatient unit -- 
built in the 1960s and never intended for the seriously mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big open space for them to wander in," Matthews said. "The staff just 
really suffers with trying to keep up with them." 
</P>
<P>
 That is little comfort to Sally Hubbard, whose 28-year-old daughter, Murrieta, 
charges that she was strapped down an entire afternoon without food, water or 
toilet facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment Murrieta received at the hands of the mental health providers, 
Hubbard argued, is really no different from what society has shown her since 
she was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at age 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that stigma of mental illness," Hubbard said. "If professional people 
can treat them that way, can you imagine how people who aren't educated react? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that we have to sue in order to change things?"  
</P>
<P>
 The building on Hillmont Avenue looks more like a school or a courtyard hotel 
than a psychiatric unit. Built in the 1960s, when the most seriously ill 
patients were locked away at Camarillo State Hospital, the inpatient unit 
features the open-campus setting in vogue among psychiatrists at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, evolving theory and declining state finances have released the 
mentally ill from state hospitals. Many live in the community, receiving 
medication and counseling from county mental health workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in need of acute care because of psychotic episodes or suicidal 
tendencies often end up in one of the 35 beds at the inpatient unit.  
</P>
<P>
 The building was never designed for this purpose. The rooms have waist-high 
windows and doors that cannot be locked from the outside because of fire 
regulations. The patients, then, are free to wander at all hours in the large, 
grassy courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The center erected a five-foot fence after a January, 1992, incident, in which 
a mentally ill patient stabbed a 90-year-old woman in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kolodziej, the patient, had actually escaped from the nearby Ventura 
County Medical Center, not the inpatient psychiatric unit. But the incident 
raised residents' fears about their mentally ill neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health officials assured Ventura residents they were taking all 
precautions necessary to keep their patients in the psychiatric hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, two months later, 28-year-old Michael Merriman walked away from the 
center. He was found days later at the Ventura River bottom, where police 
believe he hanged himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, it happened again. A suicidal patient was seen climbing out 
his window and returned to the unit 15 minutes later. The next night, staff 
members noticed at about 2:30 a.m. that he was gone again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably outside" read the notation in his file, according to state reports. 
At 3 a.m. the file reported that he was not in bed or on the grounds. At 3:30, 
staff members called the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too late. The patient was killed by a train at 3:25. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two weeks later, state inspectors found that the inpatient unit was 
still using sliding glass windows with screens that could be easily removed. 
The center secured the windows in the weeks that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems go beyond the patients who escape. Many of those who remain 
complain of neglect or mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, state licensing inspectors agree. They have substantiated five 
of 15 complaints in the past 18 months and have three pending, according to 
state records. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them involve deaths -- that of Gonzalez and of a man who died in April 
after being administered drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're watching that facility very carefully," said Lana Pembley, director of 
the licensing and certification office of the state Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problems, she said, have never risen to the level where she considered 
shutting down the inpatient unit. But she has asked two teams of inspectors to 
work together in monitoring it.  
</P>
<P>
 In case after case, investigators have cited the hospital for violating its 
own policies. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the regulations require staff members to set up a psychiatric 
and medical care plan for every patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet inspectors found no evidence of such a plan for Gonzalez, despite the 
decision to use a drug with potentially dangerous side effects. Indeed, nurses 
said that they did not even know the side effects and that the information was 
not readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 The state report also found nothing to show that a registered nurse or 
physician had been informed about the severe headaches and vomiting that 
Gonzales experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Another policy requires more intensive staffing for the high-risk patients. 
Yet state inspectors say records showed that Murrieta did not receive the 
attention she required when she was restrained at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews acknowledges that the center has had problems, but said that many of 
the state's citations are for minor glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state reports recommend changes that the facility may already 
have performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pembley agreed that could happen in some cases, but said the problems go 
beyond simple nit-picking. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest weakness, she said, seems to be with the staff's inability to 
assess situations and choose the best way to deal with crises. That incapacity 
could be a function of poor training, inadequate policies or a variety of 
factors, Pembley said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the unit seems to be improving and that many of the recent 
complaints have been disproved. The death in April, she said, seemed to be a 
medical error, rather than a staff policy mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews said administrators have been trying to simplify the myriad policies 
and ensure that subordinates have up-to-date training. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members, though, are waiting for the day the county builds its new 
inpatient unit. 
</P>
<P>
 With funding already approved by the state, the county hopes to break ground 
on the 43-bed center in December and complete it by 1996. It will have doors 
that lock and courtyards insulated from the outdoors.

SUPPORTERS TAKE A STAND FOR A NEW UNIVERSITY; VENTURA: POLITICIANS AND CSUN 
SATELLITE'S STUDENTS, GRADUATES RAISE MONEY AND CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY. 
</P>

 Joining hands to spell out their school's initials in human letters, hundreds 
of supporters of the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge gathered Saturday 
to celebrate the campus's 20th anniversary and press for a new state university 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our turn has come. We have paid our dues, and we want our university soon," 
campus Director Joyce Kennedy told the crowd of students, graduates and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite campus is struggling to accommodate a record number of students 
in an office building on Alessandro Drive off Seaward Avenue. Meanwhile, the 
state is fighting a legal battle to purchase the 260-acre lemon grove west of 
Camarillo chosen as a site for the new campus in 1991 after a five-year search. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event was held at neither the office building nor the lemon grove, 
but in the dusty, sun-drenched carnival lot at the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
There, such participants as County Supervisor Susan Lacy could ponder the irony 
of the posh new "watch and wager center" under construction across the field, 
and hope that work would begin soon on library, laboratory and classroom 
buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 The public spectacle even had some suspense, as supporters worried if enough 
people could be found to spell out CSUN-VC. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers estimated the crowd at 300, including two busloads of high school 
band and drill team members who played music and danced as a warm-up act. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with enough people, however, forming the letters was a challenge for some 
volunteers in the human chain. This, after all, was an unrehearsed crowd, not a 
Big Ten marching band at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Journet, a volunteer captain for the letter "N," acknowledged that she 
had chosen her letter because the lines are straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'S,' however, would probably be difficult," said Journet, 44, a county 
personnel manager from Oxnard who earned her master's degree in public 
administration from CSUN's satellite campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Forming the 20-foot-high letters took a bit of coaching from letter manager 
Judy Nash. "Can we get the hyphen to straighten out and stand up, please?" Nash 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But when crunch time came, the crowd performed like pros. They had some help, 
though. The letters had been marked out with masking tape on the blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a couple of minutes for the letters to fall in line for the photo op. 
Loudspeakers blasted Whitney Houston's song, "One Moment in Time, One Moment in 
History," and a helicopter with a TV crew arrived. Everyone waved, and Nash 
informed the crowd that aerial photographs of their "one moment in time," 
suitable for framing, would be available for sale in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Stand Up for Education" event was a fund-raiser to help subsidize the 
satellite campus, which Kennedy said had been devastated by budget cuts. Each 
participant paid $5 to be part of the human chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is supposed to be like our homecoming," said Shannon Anderson, 24, a 
sociology student and president of the Ventura campus' student government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Hooten, 23, a psychology student, said she hoped the proposed campus in 
Camarillo would be opened by the time her 12-year-old sister Tawny is ready for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," Hooten said, "a lot of students have to travel out of the county 
to go to school."

PUTTING STOCK IN BEANS; TRENDS: HIGH-QUALITY COFFEE IS IN DEMAND, AND 
MICRO-ROASTING OUTLETS ARE PROLIFERATING. THEY EMPHASIZE FRESHNESS AND PREMIUM 
BLENDS.

<P>
 As customers stroll in to buy their morning coffee at Caffe Latte in the 
mid-Wilshire district, they are surrounded by images of Third World coffee 
plantations and European cafe society. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlap sacks of raw, pale-green beans are piled by the door. A few steps from 
the cash register, coffee roaster James Marcotte dumps some beans into the 
funnel of a gleaming, steaming European-style roaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcotte is micro-roasting, the practice of roasting small quantities of 
coffee beans for maximum freshness -- and the hottest trend in the 
coffee-drinking world. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way coffee should be done, say micro-roasters, who believe that 
the flavor of coffee beans dramatically declines -- as much as 60% -- within 
two weeks after roasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Consumers) think that fresh ground is fresh coffee," said Orange County 
micro-roaster Martin Diedrich. "That's like saying the shelf life of bread 
begins when you slice it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently coffee lovers have been waking up to the difference. Coffeehouses 
that specialize in micro-roasted brew have become one of the decade's hottest 
niche businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although coffee drinking has been on the decline for more than 30 years 
throughout the United States, the market for specialty, or gourmet coffees, has 
taken off, particularly on the Westside. Since the late 1970s, such sales have 
grown from a near 0% share of the national market to nearly a third.  
</P>
<P>
 By 2000, forecasters expect half of the estimated 125 million American coffee 
drinkers will be drinking specialty coffees -- decaf, flavored and gourmet, 
said David Dallis, president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America. The 
number of micro-roasters is expected to nearly quadruple in the 1990s, to about 
1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the industry of the '90s," said Diedrich, whose family manufactures 
coffee roasting machines. Sales have gone from a trickle to a flood in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's kind of like a Gold Rush," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers say the micro-roasted coffees taste better, are relatively 
affordable -- between $8.50 to $12 a pound -- and drinking them at coffeehouses 
offers a "bar experience" without the alcohol, Dallis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storefronts with on-site roasters valued between $12,000 and $25,000 have 
sprung up throughout the Westside -- there are several in mid-Wilshire, Beverly 
Hills, Santa Monica and Marina del Rey -- as well as in the west San Fernando 
Valley and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation has been both welcomed and scorned by veteran roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of pretenders and impostors in the business," said Diedrich, 
who has been roasting for about a decade. "You have to know coffee. This is a 
tough business. You're making your money a (cup) at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 When Alan Chemtob opened the Coffee Emporium in Marina del Rey in 1979, he was 
one of the only roaster-retailers in the city. In the past three years, as 
several competitors opened on the Westside, he has begun to worry about the 
quality of the coffee and the motives of those who have jumped into the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of romance that goes with coffee," Chemtob said. "A lot of 
places don't have that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Micro-roasters take pride in their craft. They precisely label the origins of 
their coffee beans, right down to the names of the estates on which they were 
grown. To refine their art, they practice "cupping," an elaborate method of 
testing the brew akin to wine tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Roasting is a subtle craft, where seconds make the difference between a 
moderate "city" roast and a dark espresso.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a world of so much anguish and pain, these are really inexpensive 
pleasures," said Diane Pomerance, a documentary filmmaker and micro-roaster 
devotee who was buying a couple of bags at the Coffee Roaster in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcotte, who co-owns City Bean Coffee in Westwood Village, says the expansion 
of Starbucks Coffee, the Seattle-based chain, educated customers and primed the 
market for micro-roasters: Many customers who didn't know much more about 
coffee than Juan Valdez and Sanka a few years ago can today tell the difference 
between a coffee from Ethiopia and one from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 After Starbucks, many coffee patrons move on to the tiny shops of the 
micro-roasters, said Richard M. Healy of the Coffee Roaster. Healy, a former 
corporate banker, opened his shop eight years ago. In those days, he was a 
pioneer -- the city inspectors didn't know what to make of his Diedrich 
roaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first two years, virtually no one but a few Europeans came. Then, 
after a regional magazine did an article on Healy's business, sales took off. 
Today, his clientele runs the gamut -- from plumbers and bus drivers to movie 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Caffe Latte, Marcotte watches the beans spinning in the roaster turn 
from green to beige to deep brown through a tiny circular window. Marcotte 
roasts the beans twice a week, pound after pound for up to five hours each day. 
It can be tedious work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like doing the laundry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first crackling sound, Marcotte pulls a slender trowel out of the drum 
and inspects a few of the beans. He waits another couple of minutes, and then, 
at the second crackling sound, releases the finished roast in a fragrant, 
steaming waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other micro-roasters, Marcotte gladly shares expert tidbits about a 
coffee's origins. A Kenyan grind, for example, might have picked up its tangy 
flavor from the lemon trees ringing the coffee estate. A Costa Rican grind 
might come from an estate that pays its workers well, provides health care and 
helps to preserve rain forest wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, such discussions can be laid on a bit thick. Diedrich recalls 
the competitor who told a customer that he charged $5 more for his Jamaican 
Blue Mountain roast because it grew "higher on the mountain" than Diedrich's. 
</P>
<P>
 With micro-roasting increasing in popularity, can home roasters be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 It's too soon to tell. But Marcotte says that City Bean is getting more 
requests for raw coffee beans, especially since one customer relayed a tip 
about their availability to his friends on the computerized Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 But, judging from the recent lunchtime crowd at Caffe Latte, the finer points 
of roasting still remain way above the taste buds of most coffee drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Baxter sipped a cup while reading a newspaper. He had no idea what 
country, much less which estate, it came from. Nor did he care. He drank the 
coffee because, he explained in his best Maxwell House voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just taking a sip of it and I thought, 'Wow, that's great! That's what 
it's supposed to taste like!' "

FIGHT GROWS OVER MISSING DOG; CUSTODY: OWNERSHIP BATTLE ESCALATES AS POOCH 
DISAPPEARS FROM YARD OF PLANNING OFFICIAL WHO FACES CHARGES FOR REFUSAL TO GIVE 
UP ANIMAL TO LOCAL FAMILY. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time, Cassie -- or maybe it's Lady -- is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 So the search is on again in a dog-custody case that has pitted a Lawndale 
planning commissioner against a local family, Lennox sheriff's detectives, the 
district attorney's office and several members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old unlicensed black dog was last seen Sept. 26 in the back yard of 
Planning Commissioner Edie Warwick's home.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem, officials say, is that Warwick is not the owner of the missing 
dog she calls Lady. Its name is Cassie, they say, and it belongs to Lawndale 
residents Joseph and Vicky French, who claim Warwick has been holding the chow 
mix against its will. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Warwick is facing criminal charges for keeping the dog and dismissal from 
her job as commissioner.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem started Sept. 11 when Cassie disappeared from the Frenches' yard. 
After a futile search, the family placed a lost dog ad in a local paper.  
</P>
<P>
 That same day, Warwick found a black dog wandering several blocks from her 
home. She took it home, named it Lady and took out a "found dog" ad, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Frenches saw Warwick's ad Sept. 16, Joseph French and his two sons, 
ages 11 and 7, went to retrieve their wayward pooch. French produced a photo of 
himself with the dog, but Warwick says the dog failed three times to "bound 
across the floor and leap into his arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Because French produced no vet bills, dog license or a clear photograph, she 
decided he was not the owner and refused to release the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he is not the rightful owner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 French called the sheriff. Warwick called the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 When sheriff's deputies arrived, they demanded the dog be handed over to the 
Frenches. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick refused, saying she feared for the dog's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Harold E. Hofman and Councilman Larry Rudolph asked Warwick to release 
the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Warwick refused.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials assured the Frenches they would get their dog back and 
turned the case over to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detective H. D. Garcia had no luck, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his warnings that she would be charged, Garcia said, Warwick refused 
to give up the dog. On Sept. 23, the district attorney charged Warwick with 
delaying an investigation and misappropriating lost property. She is scheduled 
to be arraigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick said she would only yield to a judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to figure out what you are about and live a life that shows it," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, Cassie -- or Lady -- has disappeared again. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick says she went shopping the evening of Sept. 26 and when she returned 
she found her two white American Eskimo show dogs alone in the back yard with 
no sign of the black chow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frenches blame Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does she really believe we'd believe (the dog) just disappeared?" Vicky 
French asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick said she has no idea where the dog is and denied she has hidden it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in enough trouble already -- why would I do something so stupid?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shaprio said he intends to prosecute Warwick on the 
initial charges and vowed that more charges could be filed if evidence is found 
that Warwick has hidden the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick says her friends have abandoned her, and the City Council is 
discussing her removal from the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought these people were my friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Frenches still have no dog. "I told my boys, 'Don't worry, we've got 
the law on our side, we'll get Cassie back,' " Vicky French said. "Now what do 
I tell them? I can sue, but that doesn't mean we'll get our dog back."

SCHOOLS FIND MOST STUDENTS IN STEP WITH NEW DRESS RULE; LONG BEACH: 
ADMINISTRATORS REPORT 90% TO 98% OF THEIR PUPILS WERE DRESSED IN UNIFORMS FOR 
THE FIRST WEEK OF CLASSES. FEWER SCUFFLES ARE REPORTED.

 Most elementary and middle-school students in Long Beach are complying with 
the district's new voluntary policy to wear uniforms in class, administrators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools reported that 90% to 98% of their students were dressed in uniforms 
during the first week of classes, administrators said. Playgrounds that were 
once full of children in denim jeans and T-shirts are now full of students 
attired in white tops and navy blue skirts and pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say they have already noted an improvement in behavior. For 
example, schoolyard scuffles have declined at Clara Barton Elementary School, 
where all of the 995 students must wear ties as well as uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't fight when you're dressed up," Principal Lue Dean Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach school board's policy requires students from kindergarten 
through eighth grade to be in uniform. Board members claim uniforms help 
students learn and may help protect them from gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who object to uniforms must request an exemption for their children at 
individual schools. But so far, administrators said, few parents have filed 
such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they will not begin enforcing the uniform policy until 
Oct. 14. Enforcement will be left up to officials at individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals at many schools said they favor rewarding students who wear 
uniforms rather than punishing those who don't. Before the deadline, 
administrators plan to speak to students who show up at school without uniforms 
and don't have an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not embarrassing the child in front of anyone. We're just asking them 
if there's a reason they don't have a uniform," said Marnos B. Lelesi, 
principal at Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School. "To me, it isn't a greater 
expectation than we would have for a student who didn't do their homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Lelesi said she and other administrators have found the main reason children 
have not worn uniforms is that parents can't afford them.  
</P>
<P>
 Most schools are still seeking donations of uniforms for needy students, but 
so far demand has far exceeded donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rick Rackers Junior Auxiliary of the Assistance League of Long Beach is 
expected to donate two complete uniforms to 1,200 children this year, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools are using their own money to buy uniforms to lend to students, or 
have approached church organizations, service clubs, thrift stores and 
individuals for contributions.

SOME RIDERS SAY FARE HIKE IS ANYTHING BUT FAIR; TRANSPORTATION: THE PLANNED 
INCREASE COULD HINDER THE ESTIMATED 475,000 PEOPLE WHO RIDE THE BUS DAILY IN 
THE METROPOLITAN AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 By 5:45 a.m., Pearl Daniels is waiting for bus No. 206 at Normandie Avenue and 
6th Street so she can head to work in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniels, 60, the daily routine includes a transfer to another bus at 
Normandie Avenue and Sunset Boulevard so that she can get to her job as a 
telephone operator at the Hyatt Hotel on Sunset by 7 a.m. When she gets off 
work at 3 p.m., Daniels hustles across the boulevard to catch the No. 3 bus and 
begin her hourlong ride back home. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, buses have meant as much to Daniels as do cars to the throngs of 
solo motorists who clog the Southern California freeways each rush hour. But 
these days her reliance on public transit has Daniels so fearful of a proposed 
25-cent bus fare hike and the possible elimination of monthly bus passes that 
she rarely spends money riding a bus for anything other than work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can help it, I don't go out," said Daniels, who lives on Ardmore Avenue 
in Koreatown. "I don't hop on the bus like I used to. " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, remarks from people whose livelihoods depend almost 
entirely on buses show that Daniels is far from alone. Several riders, of whom 
transit officials say there are an estimated 475,000 daily in the metropolitan 
area, said they are on edge because their lives would become significantly more 
difficult under the proposed hike by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
which calls for one-way fares to increase from $1.10 to $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 While the fare hike issue is still in legal limbo, it has raised fears that 
the higher fares may cause some poor residents to miss medical appointments, 
cut back on grocery shopping, jeopardize job opportunities or become reclusive. 
The fears already have manifested themselves in cries of protest at MTA 
meetings from advocates for the poor and even resulted in a hunger strike that 
left two men seriously ill during the summer before it was called off.

 Advocates for riders emphasize that about six in 10 regular riders have 
household incomes of less than $15,000 a year, and therefore any increase would 
prove a financial burden on the majority of riders. Most riders board buses 
more than once each day, resulting in a total of nearly 1.2 million boardings 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials, meanwhile, are trying to convince anyone who will listen that 
the authority's first bus fare hike in six years is essential to combat a 
$126-million operating deficit that if left unaddressed is bound to result in 
service problems down the road. Besides, they say, tokens would remain 
available to bus riders at 90 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides are anxiously awaiting a decision by U.S. District Judge Terry J. 
Hatter Jr. on whether the fare hike would unfairly burden poor and minority 
residents, who make up the vast majority of bus riders. A hearing is scheduled 
Oct. 17 on whether a trial should be held on a lawsuit accusing the MTA of 
discrimination in pushing for the fare hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, many poor and minority residents in Los Angeles already are 
convinced they are being taken advantage of regardless of Hatter's ruling. 
Lawsuits and spreadsheets aside, many riders believe they will bear the brunt 
of whatever decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, waiting for a bus home from work near social hot spots such as The 
Comedy Store and House of Blues, said she thought the impact of the bus fare 
issue would be better understood if officials paid attention to the problems 
riders face each day. Indeed, the faces of those who depend on public 
transportation can be forgettable for those who zip past bus stops in cars. One 
moment, you see people waiting, then the stoplight changes from red to green 
and you are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to forget the tired elderly woman who sits on a bench in 
South-Central surrounded by plastic shopping bags, one or two of them serving 
as pillows for the young boy with her. There is no way to know without asking 
that the young mother who is waiting for a bus with her infant is trying to get 
to a baby-sitter and then to her job as a seamstress Downtown. The serious, 
middle-aged man standing in the shade is heading for a medical appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 And once on a bus, riders can lose virtually all individuality. For many, it 
is the vehicle that people normally focus on from outside, not the riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bus riders attributed what they say is second-class treatment of 
riders to the notion that individual car ownership is an ingrained part of the 
Los Angeles culture. In other words, there must be something wrong with you if 
you do not own your own car and must ride a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Daniels said, there are probably many riders who feel worried or 
trapped and are saving every quarter for their most important rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I feel. You can't get out when you want to," Daniels said. 
"They isolated me a lot already." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who decried the filth of some buses and the criminal activity that 
sometimes occurs on buses, said nonetheless that she normally feels comfortable 
riding them. But lately, stops at the market for milk, shopping trips, weekend 
rides to the park and visits to friends or family have been scaled back 
drastically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The upkeep of a car is too expensive," said Daniels, who makes about $17,000 
a year at the Hyatt. "The bus is the only way I can go because the old car I 
had was always going down and I was on the bus anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 To some bus riders the issue has become needlessly complicated by the 
excessive involvement of lawyers, a judge, transit officials and even some 
community activists. Several riders said the fare hike proposal exists simply 
because many decision makers are out of touch with the struggles of the poor 
and are unwilling to seek other measures for raising funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ameer Rashid, who was waiting for a bus recently on Jefferson Boulevard off 
Crenshaw Boulevard, said he does not own a car and that those seeking a fare 
hike should be more concerned with improving mass transit services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who ride the bus think it's high enough already," said Rashid, 
56, who relies on buses about three times a week to get to medical appointments 
or to do research for a local developer. "The fare would be OK if the buses ran 
more often. Right now they don't run that frequent in this neighborhood. To 
talk about a fare hike is ridiculous. They ain't had better service in six 
years. You've got to get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was echoed by Kim Hyun Kyung, 18, who was among about a dozen 
people waiting for a bus at Western Avenue off Olympic Boulevard one day last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too hard for the citizens," she said, referring to higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The reliance many residents have on the system is most obvious at bus stops 
like the one at Spring and Temple streets by City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, as buses came and went, the number of people waiting for their 
rides never seemed to get below a dozen or so. The flow was steady as buses 
headed for different parts of the county pulled up, loaded passengers, and 
pulled away every few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Gonzalez, 22, stood holding her 3-month-old daughter, Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the proposed fare hike is frightening to her and her husband 
because they are struggling to make ends meet. Both earn low wages mending 
clothes, and their daughter requires a baby-sitter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worries me a lot," Gonzalez said in Spanish. "It is a big problem because 
salaries are low, especially for us Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Greene, a spokeswoman for the MTA, said officials sympathize with 
residents who may face hardship if the fare hike goes through, but options such 
as buying 90-cent tokens in packets of 10 are designed to ease the impact on 
the poor. A balanced MTA budget is mandatory by law, and although the proposed 
fare hike has drawn the most public attention, plans involve other cost-cutting 
measures such as reducing services on lines carrying few passengers and cutting 
administrative positions within the agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people are afraid of the unknown," Greene said. "Our 
passengers would be saving money by buying tokens. All we can do is keep on 
talking to community groups and spreading the word at schools and at public 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Some riders, however, fear that using tokens would become too expensive if 
frequent stops and transfers are necessary -- a common occurrence for the 
thousands of riders who make one or more connections to get across the city. 
Bus riders who make frequent transfers tend to rely on the $42 monthly pass, 
which allows for an unlimited number of rides and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the basic fare increase, the MTA proposal includes the elimination of 
regular monthly passes and increasing the fares on special monthly passes -- 
from $10 to $12 for monthly passes for senior citizens and the disabled, 
including blind passengers who formerly traveled at no charge; from $25 to $30 
for college and vocational school students, and from $18 to $20 for 
schoolchildren. Zone charges of 50 cents would apply on express bus lines and 
the Blue Line trolley. Transfers would remain at 25 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly understand. Just the sound of a fare raise is scary to 
people," Greene said. "But we are in line with what is happening across the 
country. What else can you buy now at 1988 prices?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, selling the plan to those who sit waiting for buses when they are dead 
tired, sick, late for a job interview or just eager to visit a friend is tough. 
It is not as though all riders want the same thing. For example, some 
vehemently oppose the higher fares while others are more interested in making 
sure the regular $42 monthly passes are not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't begrudge them an increase, but keep the passes," said Michael Pell, 
44, a senior clerk typist for the Los Angeles Police Department who rides buses 
regularly from Melrose and La Brea avenues to Downtown and back. "It's good for 
the rider and it's good for the system. It's good for keeping buses on time." 
</P>
<P>
 After a Sept. 12 hearing on the case in U.S. District Court, about 30 people 
gathered outside to oppose the fair hike and criticize authorities for their 
financial support of a new, expensive regional rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bus riders and community activists are convinced that racial bias is a 
key factor influencing the call for higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Various activists and riders insist the transportation authority has funded 
rail projects that largely benefit affluent white commuters, rather than poor 
or minority riders. MTA officials dispute that accusation and now it appears 
that the discrimination will be decided in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, MTA figures show that nearly 47% of all bus riders are 
Latino, about 23% are black, about 19% are white, close to 9% are Asian and the 
remainder are of other ethnic backgrounds. In addition, more than 61% of all 
riders have household incomes under $15,000 a year; about 23% earn between 
$15,000 and $30,000, and a little more than 10% have household incomes between 
$31,000 and $50,000. Less than 5% bring home more than $50,000, the figures 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Llorente, who earns a total of about $9,000 a year and shares an 
apartment in Hollywood with his brother, travels from bus to bus in order to 
work two jobs and remain an active community volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Llorente, 22, works helping develop housing, business and youth services, and 
each day travels first to one local organization in Inglewood for a few hours 
and then to another local group in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Easygoing and quick with a smile, Llorente said any increase in bus fares 
could jeopardize one of his part-time jobs and would undoubtedly reduce the 
amount of volunteer work he could do to help youths in troubled neighborhoods. 
Tokens may be an option, he said, if the MTA comes through with its plan to 
create more purchase sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Llorente said he believes he could land higher-paying work, but for now is 
willing to sacrifice better wages for the satisfaction of working at improving 
urban conditions at the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to struggle a lot but I'm working for the community right now," he 
said. "My thoughts are that the people of the MTA should understand that there 
are a lot of people like me who cannot travel at these higher prices.

IS HE THE INVISIBLE (HEIS)MAN?; MCNAIR MUST IMPRESS VOTERS WHO WILL NEVER SEE 
HIM PLAY 
</P>

 They say if you want to know what size crowd they'll have at Mississippi 
Veterans Memorial Stadium, then look down West Avenue until you reach the 
bridge that bows its back about half a mile away. If there are cars parked 
beside its concrete pillars, then something special is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Steve (Air II) McNair do? 
</P>
<P>
 McNair, the biggest thing to hit the state of Mississippi since Faulkner 
discovered commas, is the reason Saturday night's game was here in the first 
place. The Alcorn State quarterback is so special that he causes statisticians 
to triple-check their totals, opposing coaches to develop facial tics, pro 
scouts to drool, governors to write "Dear Media" letters on his behalf and 
Heisman Trophy voters to think twice about their ballots and a Division I-AA 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I voted, I'd vote for myself," McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair also draws a crowd, which is why Mississippi Valley State officials 
agreed to move the game from their itty-bitty 10,500-seat campus in Itta Bena 
to the state capital and the 62,000-seat Memorial. Home-field advantage is 
nice, figured Mississippi Valley, but so are gate receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to McNair, the cars were two deep at the bridge and 34,982 fans were in 
the seats. They saw the usual stuff from the 6-foot-3, 218-pound McNair, which 
is to say, they saw the unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite nursing a deep shoulder bruise (he was in a sling for two days and 
wasn't able to lift his right arm earlier in the week), McNair completed 17 of 
25 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. He rushed eight times for 108 yards 
and another touchdown. He passed for a two-point conversion. And he was back in 
street clothes before the end of the game, the result of an easy 49-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't so much what he did as it was how he did it. His downfield 
passes left contrails. His swing passes were as gentle as the night's breeze 
and as soft as a Southern accent. When he scrambled, it was only at the last 
moment and never the result of panic. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a dozen times McNair saw the pocket collapse around him, 
Mississippi Valley players lunging forward, their fingertips grabbing at his 
jersey. And then he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like a running back with an arm," said former Alcorn star linebacker 
John Thierry, a first-round pick this year with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, McNair had accounted for 274 total yards, including a 22-yard 
scoring run in which he somehow squirmed past four would-be tacklers, made his 
way to the two-yard line, got hit again and then, with his back to the end zone 
and his arms outstretched with the ball, pile-drove his way for the touchdown. 
It was on that play that McNair moved into second place on the NCAA's career 
yardage list (13,531 total), replacing Portland State's Neil Lomax, and within 
1,134 yards of Brigham Young's Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the season, McNair has thrown for 19 touchdowns, run for four, accounted 
for 1,989 passing yards and 517 rushing yards. Even the modest McNair said the 
statistics can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I saw them I'd be amazed," he said. "The numbers speak for themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 They speak, but are they loud enough? If you didn't have a ticket you couldn't 
see the game or McNair, who has been selected the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference player of the year in each of his first three seasons. A few of the 
highlights might be picked up from the Jackson stations, but that's about it 
for TV exposure. Instead, McNair has become a word-of-mouth Heisman nominee, 
the first Division I-AA player to seriously challenge for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the cause, Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice sent letters to each of the 
Heisman voters and did what knows best: he politicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any young man with such heart and determination, Steve McNair does not 
want a handout, he wants an opportunity," Fordice wrote. "I ask that you give 
him the opportunity to exhibit his athletic gifts and receive the same 
consideration as any of our country's other great college football players." 
</P>
<P>
 Fordice is no dummy. Football and goodwill go far in this state, especially 
with a re-election campaign on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fordice can do only so much. McNair suffers from a lack of TV time. He 
plays in Division I-AA and in the SWAC. Ask Joe Fan to name three teams from 
the conference and you'll probably get a dull, numb look. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Florida quarterback Terry Dean all but has his own weekly highlight 
show. Washington tailback Napoleon Kaufman keeps piling up some impressive 
numbers of his own. Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam is making his own 
Heisman charge. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the other factor. The one nobody talks about -- except 
Alabama State Coach Houston Markham. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Markham, McNair won't win the Heisman Trophy because he is a 
black player at a predominantly black Division I-AA school in a predominantly 
black conference. 
</P>
<P>
 There . . . he said it. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Heisman voters and media) got a stigma to small black schools and that ain't 
right . . . and it's about right and wrong," said Markham, an Alcorn alumnus 
from the Class of '65 who roomed with Alcorn Coach Cardell Jones and later 
coached with him in high school, then at Jackson State. "It makes you think 
that the distance between the black and white today is wider than it was when 
Rosa said she wasn't going to get off the bus. That's all it is -- right and 
wrong, black and white. That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham doesn't say such things without reason. He saw Walter Payton's career 
at Jackson State dismissed with a wave of the hand by Heisman voters. The same 
thing happened to Doug Williams at Grambling. And Jerry Rice at Mississippi 
Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair hasn't been ignored. Sports Illustrated splashed him on the cover and, 
with only a month gone in the season, exclaimed, "Hand Him The Heisman." It was 
a bold thought, but not unprecedented. A few years ago the same magazine pushed 
the campaign for Plymouth State's Joe Dudek. Even had a catchy campaign slogan: 
"What the heck, vote for Dudek." 
</P>
<P>
 Dudek finished ninth in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers and TV crews aplenty have made the pilgrimage to the modest Lorman, 
Miss., campus. Some even have visited Mt. Olive, where McNair and his four 
brothers and sisters were raised by his single mother. It made for a 
heartwarming story, but the question persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity piece or actual Heisman contender? Statistical freak show or Steve 
Young clone to Nth degree, but with a Division I-AA twist? 
</P>
<P>
 As for his gaudy statistics, Markham offers the same explanation. If McNair 
were white. . . . "You all would take his numbers -- am I right? -- and be 
satisfied," he said. "I mean, this is America and I'm not bitter, because 
bitterness don't do anything for you in this kind of situation. You just got to 
hope it gets better in time." 
</P>
<P>
 McNair tiptoes around the subject. Recruited by nearly every Division I-A 
program in the region -- but as a defensive back, not a quarterback -- McNair 
said he has never regretted his decision to sign with Alcorn. And voting bias? 
If McNair thinks it exists, he isn't saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to keep that far from my mind," he said. "Things change." 
</P>
<P>
 Markham isn't so sure. A few days before Alcorn's Sept. 17 game against 
Alabama State, a reporter from a Montgomery, Ala., newspaper asked Markham if 
McNair could read defenses. Markham was so flabbergasted by the question that 
he was rendered speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question ain't whether he can read defenses or not," Markham told the 
reporter. "The question is whether you can read numbers. Because if he accounts 
for 600-plus yards, whether he reads defenses or not it really doesn't matter. 
And if he didn't read any that week, then don't read none." 
</P>
<P>
 So respectful was the Alabama State coaching staff of McNair, that an almost 
unheard-of defensive formation was concocted. Depending on the down and 
distance, Alabama State sometimes rushed only one lineman and dropped the 
remaining 10 players into pass coverage. At times you could see a beefy nose 
tackle backpedaling his way into the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn still won as McNair passed for 344 yards and two touchdowns and rushed 
for 116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what I can do," McNair said. "I know they knock the caliber of 
(Division I-AA) competition. But if they see me they would know better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi Valley State knows. So did everyone else who witnessed McNair, bum 
shoulder and all, toy with the Delta Devils Saturday evening. After all, 
greatness isn't always defined by how many capital A's follow your Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad the rest of America couldn't see the same thing.

BRUINS CHOOSE, GET CONFUSED, THEN LOSE, 37-10; UCLA: MESSED-UP PLAY IN FOURTH 
QUARTER IS THE KEY AGAINST WASHINGTON. KAUFMAN RUSHES FOR 227 YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA chose Door No. 1, but that was shut. Then the Bruins tried No. 2, which 
revolved, letting in noise and sending Sharmon Shah back out.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the sound of the crowd Saturday in the horseshoe end of Husky 
Stadium, there was only confusion with 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The right answer was Door No. 3, a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA failed to call it, and the decision cost dearly in a 37-10 loss to 
Washington, which was led by Napoleon Kaufman's 227 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had scored their first touchdown in six quarters, cutting their 
deficit to 20-10 on a 13-yard pass from Wayne Cook to Derek Ayers. UCLA held 
Washington on downs to start the fourth quarter, then got a break when punter 
Geoff Prince was ruled down on his 18-yard line after dropping to one knee to 
field a low snap. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of momentum, still in doubt even though the Bruins had frittered 
away opportunity after opportunity, they moved to the Washington nine, facing 
fourth and inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the quiz show. 
</P>
<P>
 The first option was the "freeze play," called with the idea that Washington's 
defense would jump off-side and give UCLA first and goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huskies froze in place, leaving Cook to option No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 He called for a handoff to Shah, but the crowd of 71,851 was going wild, and 
nobody was sure what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Flanagan snapped the ball, Cook handed it to Shah and the Huskies' Richie 
Chambers came around the left side of UCLA's line, unblocked and able to tackle 
Shah for a loss of three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage time then began, with Washington scoring 17 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had checked to a play that was OK," Cook said. "We ran the play, 
but the only problem was that my backs thought I said something different and 
they were moving. The line was yelling their calls. So I was basically thinking 
I did the right thing and was running the right play, but everyone else didn't 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were rushed and it just didn't work out right. Now that I look back on it, 
if I'm going to be the superhero and save the day, I'm going to call time out. 
As soon as I felt rushed, I should have called time out." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have called time out," said offensive coordinator Bob Toledo, who 
had signaled the freeze play that began the series of events. "We, the coaches 
or Wayne or somebody, should have called time out. Don't put the blame on him. 
We should have called it." 
</P>
<P>
 How important was the play? 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had made it, I think the game would have been decided in the final 
minutes," Coach Terry Donahue said.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Washington turned a close game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 That was made easier through the play of Kaufman, whose Heisman Trophy 
campaign postcard, mailed out Saturday night, included his 34 carries for 227 
yards, best in his career; a 79-yard run, longest in his career, and a 
four-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the difference in the game was Napoleon Kaufman and the kicker" John 
Wales, said Donahue, who called Wales "Welsh" but had no trouble getting his 
idea across. "(Wales) was a major, major difference. (Washington quarterback 
Damon) Huard threw the ball well and played well, but more than anything the 
two things in the game that were a huge difference were Wales and Kaufman." 
</P>
<P>
 Wales, who kicked three field goals, stood out even more in Donahue's mind 
because his kicker, Bjorn Merten, continued to struggle. Merten missed three of 
four attempts, connecting from 44 yards in the second quarter to tie the score, 
3-3, but missing twice earlier, from 40 and 46 yards on UCLA's first two 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 His 46-yard try to end the first half hit the right upright. "It's the kind of 
luck I've been having," Merten said. "No luck at all." 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a factor, Donahue said, in his electing to go for a first 
down instead of a field goal at quiz time. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Kaufman's work, UCLA's defense held Washington in check for most of 
two quarters and Shah was matching him yard for yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies took a 10-3 lead on Huard's 10-yard touchdown pass to Dave Janoski 
with 48 seconds to play in the half, but UCLA came back on two runs by Shah and 
a 25-yard pass from Cook to Josh Eby to the Washington 29 with five seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Merten hit the upright on his 47-yard field-goal try as time ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington came back with a 71-yard drive to begin the second half, Huard 
completing a 32-yard pass to Eric Bjornson on the way and finishing things by 
handing the ball to Kaufman for the final four yards and a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-yard field goal by Wales made the score 20-3, ending a drive on which 
Kaufman carried from his 20 to the UCLA one before being hauled down by Teddy 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to stiff-arm the guy at the last minute, but he just grabbed on and 
pulled me down," Kaufman said. "It's kind of disappointing, running all that 
way and not getting into the end zone, but it happens like that sometimes, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman's previous longest run was 70 yards against Arizona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He even got the requisite shoulder injury that seems necessary to be a Heisman 
Trophy candidate this season, joining Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley and Alcorn 
State's Steve McNair with such ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman had banged it in a victory over Miami a week ago, then banged it again 
near the end of the half when he hit safety Abdul McCullough while blocking on 
a blitz. A halftime rubdown helped, and so did the 79-yard run, but "it still 
hurts," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA hurts more. The Bruins (2-3, 0-2 in the Pacific 10) have lost three in a 
row, with a game at California next Saturday. Still, "believe it or not, I 
thought we made some progress as a team," Donahue said. "I know that's hard for 
people on the outside to understand or realize, but I thought we made some 
progress, despite the fact that we got whipped up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But Washington Coach Jim Lambright has a better lot in life. Without a 
bowl to shoot for because of Pac-10 and NCAA sanctions, Lambright declared the 
Huskies' first four games their "bowl," and set out to make a name for 
Washington and Kaufman against USC, Ohio State, Miami and UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 At 3-1, with three victories in a row, and with Kaufman running for 670 yards 
in the four games, all on the network that so loves to show the Heisman winner 
in September, Lambright has exactly what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a hard road through four games, and to come out of these last three 
games the way we have, I couldn't be happier," he said. Napoleon's Numbers

MIKE DOWNEY: WITH THIS TEAM, HE'D BETTER HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Fitch begins spinning yarns almost immediately. He slides into a booth on 
the patio of a restaurant near the basketball arena, wearing rose-tinted 
glasses and a shirt with "L.A. Clippers" on the pocket. (Perfect.) The new 
coach of the Clippers is the old coach of practically everybody else, so as a 
storyteller his only real challenge is where to start.  
</P>
<P>
 Like, there was the time he worked in Cleveland, oh, 24 years ago, erecting an 
expansion pro basketball franchise out of little more than old jocks in new 
socks. Around town in those days strutted a combination self-made millionaire 
and crackpot named Ted Stepien, a sporting impresario with lots and lots of 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softball was all the rage back then, so they started up a new league with 
teams in eight cities. And Ted owned six of them," Fitch says, just getting 
rolling. "And none of the six won the championship, which was typical Ted luck. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, Ted gets a brainstorm where he's going to go to the roof of the 
tallest building he can find in Cleveland and have somebody drop a softball. 
You know, and if the guy down below on the street catches it, he wins a prize.  
</P>
<P>
 "So, they drop the first softball and down it goes, down, down, down, picking 
up speed, and what happens? Some poor woman is standing there watching it and 
it hits her right in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, they help this poor woman regain her senses or whatever, and then Ted 
says, 'Let's try it again,' only this time Ted will drop the softball himself. 
You know, so it'll be done right. And Ted takes the softball and down it goes, 
down, down, down, and it crashes right on top of a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, Bill Fitch has seen it, done it, been there. He has built basketball 
mountains out of molehills. Or sometimes they simply stayed molehills, because 
there were only so many ways to get all the moles to cooperate. For nobody has 
been a champion of more lost causes than Fitch, who now has a real beauty on 
his hands with the Clippers.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitch squints through those shades above a crooked grin and says, "Hey, nobody 
knows more about losing than me. I lead the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He does. He has lost more NBA games than any other coach. He could become the 
only one to lose 1,000 games.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some guy draws a cartoon of me in the paper and some kid clips it out and 
sends it to me," Fitch says. "The cartoon's all about me losing and going after 
a thousand, and the kid says he knows this really isn't a compliment but would 
I please autograph it for him anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my reality." 
</P>
<P>
 So, oh, what will become of him with the Clippers? We have here a team that, 
over one slap-happy summer, was abandoned by both its best forward and its best 
guard, traded its other starting guard and canned its coach. The backcourt of 
Ron Harper and Mark Jackson is gone, and as for that All-Star forward, well, 
the best way Fitch can assess the damage is, "You can't count Danny Manning and 
Dominique Wilkins as two separate players. One came for the other." OK.  
</P>
<P>
 But if you think this discourages Bill Fitch, then you do not know Bill Fitch, 
because if you want to know about discouraging, then you should have been 
around when he was trying to assemble something out of nothing back in 
Cleveland, or when he took over a Boston Celtic team that had lost 103 of its 
previous 164 games, or when he inherited some Houston Rockets who had just gone 
14-68 under Del Harris, or when the New Jersey Nets asked him to take command 
after winning 45 games in two seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitch's phone number is the 911 of coaching. You call him in an emergency, 
like a Ghostbuster. He puts out oil fires, like that Red Adair guy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I know Red pretty well," Fitch says.  
</P>
<P>
 Naturally. He has gotten to know pretty much everybody. Fitch can remember 
being the only pair of headlights on a lonesome stretch of North Dakota road, 
out recruiting a gangling high schooler named Phil Jackson. He can remember 
coaching at Minnesota when the youngster Dave Winfield was an up-and-comer. He 
can remember when Richie Guerin was coaching in St. Louis and tried to snooker 
him in the expansion draft by activating and then not protecting none other 
than himself, Richie Guerin.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a ring on Fitch's finger the size of a Volkswagen, symbolic of a 
championship he won with the Celtics, not long after fleecing a gentleman from 
the Detroit Pistons out of a couple of No. 1 draft choices.  
</P>
<P>
 "I owe this ring to the wisdom of Dick Vitale," Fitch says.  
</P>
<P>
 And to what does he owe the pleasure of coaching the Clippers, who open 
training camp this week? Oh, what's the difference? Fitch always did enjoy a 
dare. He still has so many things to iron out, like why the roster has so many 
men who play the same position that his team has become Small Forwards R Us, or 
why center Stanley Roberts evidently has mushroomed back to his previous shape. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But he also has some sharp young kids eager for a shot at playing, and a 
lovely new training facility in beautiful downtown Carson, and, of course, that 
bottomless well of anecdotes and jokes that he has accumulated over the years, 
the ones the Clipper coach can relate to any situation, including his current 
one.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was this guy who went to Las Vegas with a quarter in his pocket, and he 
ran it up to $500,000," the set-up goes. "Everybody urged him to quit, but he 
didn't, and he lost every penny.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's all depressed. He goes to the washroom, but when he gets there he 
finds that it'll cost him a quarter to use it. The washroom attendant takes 
pity on the guy and gives him a quarter. Then the guy goes to use the facility, 
only to find the door's unlocked.  
</P>
<P>
 "He takes the quarter back to the casino, makes a bet and starts winning. He 
runs the quarter all the way back up to $500,000. Everybody begs him to quit, 
and this time he does. And somebody says, 'Boy, I'll bet you're eager to find 
that washroom attendant to pay him back.' And the guy says, 'Not really, but if 
I ever find that guy who left that door open . . . "' 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, who leads the world in losses, is back in action.

OREGON SUBSTITUTES FOR VICTORY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GRAZIANI, A SOPHOMORE, TAKES 
OVER AT QUARTERBACK AND LEADS THE DUCKS PAST SLOPPY USC, 22-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 No one could see him, but if you closed your eyes, you could almost feel his 
presence in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the crowd of 44,232 might almost have heard Harvey Winn laughing in 
the closing minutes of Oregon's 22-7 victory over USC on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Winn was the 5-foot-8 substitute quarterback who last guided Oregon to 
victory over USC at the Coliseum, in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three seasons later, it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, USC was 15-1-1 over Oregon in the last 17 meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 This time it was Tony Graziani, a left-handed sophomore from Modesto 
heretofore unheard of and unfeared in West Coast college football. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Winn, filling in for injured Dan Fouts, led the Ducks to a 28-23 
victory over USC at the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Graziani had a far easier time than Winn. Taking over for 
starter Danny O'Neil -- sidelined after finger surgery -- he led an Oregon 
offense that took advantage of poor USC tackling and pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better for Graziani: He caught USC on a night when its offense looked as 
if it was still in training camp.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (3-2) and USC (2-2) have played football since 1915. Not since 1958, 
when Oregon beat the Trojans, 25-0, has a USC been beaten so soundly by Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC Coach John Robinson, who was on that 1971 Oregon staff that last beat 
USC here: "They played a great game; they came down here and overwhelmed us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their quarterback played just about a perfect game. Their defense came after 
us, and we were out of sync the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 That comment was echoed by USC offensive tackle Tony Boselli, who said 
Oregon's blitzing defense was more active than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got after us and played a great game," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They brought a lot of people after (quarterback Rob Johnson) on blitzes, and 
we didn't pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oregon Coach Rich Brooks: "I'm very, very proud of this group of young 
men. A lot of guys were playing hurt. I think we disrupted their offense. 
Seventeen of our top 22 on offense are freshmen or sophomores. . . . They 
showed a lot of poise." 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC center Jeremy Hogue: "They stunted a lot and they really have some 
good people up front. They had a great game plan. And we came out flat too." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, USC tailback Shawn Walters had carried 31 times for 207 yards 
against Baylor.  
</P>
<P>
 Not Saturday night. He had only 17 carries and gained 85 yards. Against 
Oregon, USC seemed intent on short-yardage pass plays on first down, and in 
fact passed 18 times on first down.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to run," offensive coordinator Mike Riley said. "But they made a 
lot of good plays off their blitzes and we couldn't sustain anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters ran for 26 yards on the game's first play. It would be his only long 
run this night. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson completed 20 of 30 passes for 237 yards and the Trojans' only 
touchdown. He finished the game on the sideline because of a sprained right 
ankle suffered late in the third quarter. He said later he didn't think his 
sprain was serious and said he told Robinson late in the third quarter he could 
pass, but not run well.  
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me he didn't want me to be a sitting duck back there," Johnson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Brad Otton finished up. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "Oregon played really well. I kept feeling we'd start to make 
big plays, but it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen in part because USC receivers dropped about a half-dozen of 
his passes. Ken Grace dropped two.  
</P>
<P>
 Graziani, who completed 16 of 31 passes for 287 yards and a touchdown, led his 
offense to a 478-yard night. USC totaled 347. Johnson showed an exasperating 
inability or unwillingness to throw the ball away under pressure and was sacked 
seven times. Oregon had nine sacks for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But for USC, the worst of it was in the secondary, where the inexperienced 
Graziani had a field day with Trojan regulars John Herpin, Quincy Harrison, 
Sammy Knight, Micah Phillips and Scott Fields all taking turns missing 
assignments, tackles, or coverages.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our secondary has not played well . . . heck, my dog and my wife could tell 
you that," defensive coordinator Don Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Trojan coaches, it was downright embarrassing. A couple of dozen recruits 
were on hand and were brought into the locker room afterward. Cornerback coach 
Dennis Thurman said to two of them: "Please, don't judge us by this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the poor tackling, Lindsey didn't have a ready answer. "You're either a 
good, natural tackler or you're not," he said. "You can improve as a tackler, 
but to do that you have to scrimmage, and that's how guys get hurt. That's how 
we lost (tight end) John Allred to a broken leg the other day." 
</P>
<P>
 This one was pretty much over at halftime, when the Trojans were booed off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's four first-half sacks continued to frustrate not only USC fans, but 
the coaching staff as well.  
</P>
<P>
 All that was bad enough.  
</P>
<P>
 But when USC, trailing by 16-7 and at midfield in the final seconds of the 
half, allowed the clock to run down without Johnson throwing a ball into the 
end zone, the boos grew as the teams walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Six plays after Walters' carry on the game's first play, Oregon's Ken Wheaton 
took a pass out of the hands of Grace and returned it 34 yards. That led to 
Matt Belden's 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was 10-0 on a 49-yard run by Dino Philyaw. He was aided by muffed 
tackles by Phillips and Herpin in the final five yards. Earlier in the play, 
Fields missed Philyaw.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson took USC 66 yards in nine plays on the next series to make the score 
10-7, but with 7:20 to go before intermission, Cristin McLemore beat both 
Harrison and Herpin in the end zone and scored on a 19-yard pass from Graziani. 
The conversion was wide and Oregon had a 16-7 halftime lead.  
</P>
<P>
 An hour after it ended, Oregon's players began emerging from their locker 
room. A few of them walked down the dark tunnel one more time, toward the field 
where they had won a game they will long remember.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS REALLY IS THE NO WAY TO PLAY THE GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Gagliardi, football coach at St. John's of Collegeville, Minn., has an 
unorthodox style of coaching, a "Winning With No's" philosophy. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 No play book -- only a single page listing assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 No players cut. 
</P>
<P>
 No one considered too small. 
</P>
<P>
 No grading of game films. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs in the dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 No laps. 
</P>
<P>
 No blocking sleds or tackling dummies. 
</P>
<P>
 No tackling in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 No use of the words hit, kill , etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Add coach: His teams are very successful. St. John's has made it to the 
semifinals of the NCAA Division III playoffs twice in the last three years and 
was national champion in 1963, '65 and '76. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most touchdowns rushing in a game?  
</P>
<P>
 Time to panic?Denver Bronco Coach Wade Phillips on his team's 0-4 record: 
"We're out of it right now. But that doesn't mean it's the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Could be. 
</P>
<P>
 So there: Broderick Thompson, a Philadelphia Eagle offensive lineman, had to 
take a pay cut of $200,000 this year -- and he isn't happy.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither is his fiancee. She refuses to eat any of the concession food at 
Veterans Stadium because team owner Jeffrey Lurie reportedly gets a cut of the 
concession money. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass the hat: Michael Jordan is continuing his baseball education in the 
Arizona Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope no one's asking any strike questions," Jordan said. "I'm not getting 
paid enough to worry about that. Come to think about it, I'm not getting paid, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Michael, he'll have to get by on his meager endorsement checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequel?Russ Francis, former San Francisco 49er tight end, commenting on his 
television show in Eugene, Ore.:  
</P>
<P>
 "The hit movie of the summer was 'Forrest Gump,' the heartwarming tale of a 
simple-minded Southern boy who leads a fantasy sports life.  
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of wish they had stuck with the original title, though: 'The Terry 
Bradshaw Story.' "

<P>
 Brat attack: Jim Courier responding to criticism of today's tennis players by 
Jimmy Connors in the October issue of Tennis magazine:

TWO ARMS NOT ENOUGH FOR MCGIRT; BOXING: AFTER SAYING HE LOST TO WHITAKER IN 
THEIR FIRST FIGHT BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER INJURY, HE LOSES AGAIN WITH NO EXCUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD FINN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker silenced James (Buddy) McGirt Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months ago, McGirt lost the 147-pound World Boxing Council 
welterweight crown to Whitaker by 12-round unanimous decision at Madison Square 
Garden, a loss the New Yorker contended was due to an injury to his left 
shoulder that turned him into a one-armed fighter through the final six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, before a hometown crowd of 9,158 at the Scope, the champion turned 
up the volume of his punching against a two-fisted McGirt for a runaway 
12-round decision despite being knocked down in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the better man, he did what he had to do," McGirt said. "My arm was 
OK, he was definitely the better man." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker (34-1-1) had gone in as a 6-1 favorite and he proved the oddsmakers 
right with his third title defense. He connected on 40% of the 816 punches he 
threw according to HBO statistics; McGirt connected on 31% of the 504 he threw. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of his best performances," trainer George Benton said of 
Whitaker. "He followed the game plan to a 'T.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Chuck Giampa scored it 117-113, Rudy Ortega had it 118-112 and Steve 
Weisfeld scored it 117-110. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he was in his best shape and that's why they call me the best pound 
for pound," Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McGirt, sporting a nasty bruise under his left eye after only his fourth 
loss in 69 fights: "I had no problem with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 McGirt's manager/trainer, Al Certo, praised the 30-year-old champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitaker fought a better fight than I thought he would and you have to give 
him his due," he said. "He's a great fighter. He's tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 McGirt had offered a promise of a real fight in the early going, pressing his 
attack with left jabs and strong rights. It was a right hand to the side of the 
head midway in the second period that put Whitaker on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker quickly got up, flashing a faint smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a flash knockdown," Whitaker said. "He caught me off-balance and 
it didn't bother me at all. It made me more aware of what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 What Whitaker chose to do was stand and hit McGirt, and he did so repeatedly 
from there until the final bell. 
</P>
<P>
 McGirt wobbled to his corner at the end of the eighth after Whitaker had 
landed a left hook flush on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker had snapped back McGirt's head with a stiff straight right late in 
the sixth round. Earlier in the round, the left-hander had landed a couple of 
crisp uppercuts. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker's purse was $2.5 million, James McGirt's $600,000. . . . Will 
there be a Whitaker-Julio Cesar Chavez rematch soon? Whitaker's promoter, Dan 
Duva, doesn't think so. "Zero chance," he said. "(Chavez isn't) man enough." . 
. . Fight officials confirmed that a threat that a bomb would go off at 10:30 
p.m. in the arena had been phoned in to the Norfolk police earlier.

 The lasers didn't shine in Dallas' Reunion Arena Saturday. Smoke didn't billow 
out of the huge shark's mouth in the San Jose Arena. It wasn't hockey night in 
Canada.

 Twelve NHL arenas, which were to echo Saturday night with the joyful noise of 
opening-night ceremonies, instead were silent while owners and players 
reassessed their strategy for the two-week negotiating period ordered Friday by 
Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 If a labor agreement is reached by Oct. 15 -- or if Bettman is satisfied that 
"good faith" negotiations are taking place -- 75 games will have to be squeezed 
into the current schedule or added on in April. If owners and players are still 
feuding, games will be canceled and the start of the season put off 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 players met in Toronto on Saturday with Bob Goodenow, executive 
director of the NHL Players Assn., for what Goodenow called an informational 
session. The attendance list included Patrick Roy, Eric Lindros, Steve Yzerman, 
Cam Neely, Ray Bourque, Trevor Linden, Paul Coffey, Mike Gartner, Dale 
Hawerchuk and Vincent Damphousse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players that were here all wanted to be on the ice (Saturday)," Goodenow 
said after the six-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he intends to call Bettman today to arrange additional talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to promote its image as the innocent party in this dispute, the 
union took out an ad in 29 Sunday newspapers across North America with an open 
letter to fans signed by "The 700 members of the NHL Players Association." 
</P>
<P>
 It reads: "When we showed up to play last night, the doors were locked and the 
lights were out. Yesterday, the NHL slammed the door shut on 700 hockey players 
and millions of fans around the world. It is difficult to understand the logic 
behind this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow remains uncertain whether the union and the NHL can reach an 
agreement before Bettman's new deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some real differences between us," Goodenow said. "I don't think we 
should minimize them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Maple Leaf defenseman Todd Gill: "We had 16 months to get something down 
and nothing happened. We tried everything in our powers and couldn't make a 
deal. I'm sure if you asked them, they'd say the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have made practice facilities available to players, but none apparently 
will accept the offer. Some planned to use the unexpected time off to visit 
relatives, while others rented ice time on their own and conducted informal 
workouts to stay in shape. Goodenow said Friday that players would not 
participate in formal practices as long as they are not being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Roenick, the Chicago Blackhawks' union representative, arranged for 
teammates to skate Monday at a suburban Chicago arena he co-owns. "We'll have 
it at my rink," he said. "We don't need their ice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks, who were to open the new United Center today, issued a 
statement to rebut rumors that owner Bill Wirtz opposed Bettman's decision to 
delay the start of the season because Wirtz is eager to open the $175-million 
arena and begin repaying money he borrowed to build it. Should the season start 
Oct. 15, the Blackhawks would make their United Center debut on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Kiel Center in St. Louis, set for Oct. 11, will also be put 
off until Oct. 16 under the reconfigured schedule.

RAMS WILL TRY TO KEEP THE MAGIC ALIVE; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER UPSETTING THE CHIEFS 
LAST WEEK, THEY WILL SEEK A RARE SECOND CONSECUTIVE VICTORY IN REMATCH AGAINST 
THE FALCONS AT ANAHEIM STADIUM TODAY. 
</P>

<P>
 It is the fifth week of the season and time for a pop quiz to determine if 
Chuck Knox was the right man hired three years ago to rejuvenate the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox's Rams shocked the football world with a 27-23 victory over the Cowboys 
at Dallas in 1992. The Cowboys went to the Super Bowl, the Rams went 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Rams were two-touchdown underdogs at Houston, and Knox directed 
his team to a 28-13 victory. Houston advanced to the playoffs; the Rams 
finished 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a week after a 16-0 upset of the Chiefs and Joe Montana, Knox's Rams 
stand 2-2 and poised to make a run for respectability with a victory over the 
Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Knox's rebuilding plan provided a foundation for success, or are the Rams 
destined to be grouped with Tampa Bay, Indianapolis and Cincinnati? 
</P>
<P>
 In Knox's three years, the Rams have yet to win consecutive games in the same 
season. One show-stopping victory per season isn't going to save the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Rams began the fifth week of the season 2-2 after their 
shining moment in Houston and were matched at home against New Orleans. They 
lost, 37-6, went on to lose the next four games, and after two seasons, Knox's 
Rams were a combined 11-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a better football team right now than a year ago," said Chick Harris, 
Knox's offensive coordinator. "We're going to be a better team, too, although 
we're a long ways away from where we've got to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams began this season believing they were better than NFC West rivals 
Atlanta and New Orleans and figured a strong second-place showing to San 
Francisco would be good for a wild-card playoff berth at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening victory over Arizona had the Rams moving forward, then a loss to 
Atlanta had them looking like the same old Rams and another defeat by San 
Francisco was hardly unexpected. The upset of Kansas City was shocking, and 
now? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can call it a make-or-break situation," defensive end Fred Stokes said. 
"We have a chance to go ahead of the .500 mark, and that's something with this 
organization we haven't seen very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Do the Rams turn the corner? Do they beat Atlanta, a team they are supposed to 
beat if they are to be considered legitimate playoff contenders? Do they have 
the right man in charge? 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game," Knox said, as if he were saying it for the first time, "is a big 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 This game had the chance of being a really big game. Safety Anthony Newman, 
caught up in the fever of sudden success, challenged Atlanta wide receiver 
Andre Rison, which generated excitement among his teammates after Rison fired 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The locker room was abuzz, the media shifted its attention to the Rams as the 
Raiders took a bye and Knox put a stop to it. "That's not our style, Rams' 
style," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis has rushed for more than 100 yards in the last 
three games, and the Rams will try once again to keep the ball away from 
Atlanta quarterback Jeff George. Chris Chandler is at quarterback, and like 
Dave Krieg who worked for Knox in Seattle, Chandler's forte is playing 
efficient football: avoid the sack; don't throw the interception; make the big 
play when afforded the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense, which features a strong pass rush, allows the offense to play 
ball control without getting into a wide-open scoring battle. The special 
teams, which were sensational in Seattle, now have one of the game's best 
special teams coaches in Wayne Sevier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons present an immediate credibility check. Like the Rams, they have 
struggled in recent years. They are now being directed by June Jones, a rookie 
NFL head coach, and are looking to top the .500 mark for the first time since 
1991. In the Falcons' last 42 games on the road, they have won eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only the fifth game and I don't know if this game is any more important 
than any other game," said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only the fifth game of the year, but it's been the turning point for the 
Rams the last two years under Knox. After opening each of the last two seasons 
with a 2-2 record, Knox's Rams have gone on to a 7-17 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are 2-2 once again, and Knox is on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure anybody in coaching ever, ever thinks that way," Erkenbeck said. 
"I think maybe management, reporters, etc. would. But coaches can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every play presents different circumstances and you just have to win more 
plays than you lose overall. Yes, this is an important game. Is it the end of 
the world if we lose? No. Is it a harbinger of bad things to come? Absolutely 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 A loss today would drop the Rams to 2-3 with a road assignment in Green Bay 
next week and leave the question open: Is Knox really the coach to turn around 
the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big game," Knox said. "There isn't any question of that."

 In the searching-for-something positive department, Miami's 24-3 defeat of 
Rutgers was the Hurricanes' 67th consecutive victory against an unranked 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a week ago, football fans were talking about Miami's 58-game home winning 
streak, which was ended by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we beat (Rutgers), 100-0, it's not going to take away last week's loss," 
said Warren Sapp, a defensive tackle who Saturday set up a 14-yard touchdown 
run by Michael Stewart with a fumble recovery and 19-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the whole weekend to think, 'Why, why, why, why?' I saw the film and 
still can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 We can. The Huskies scored more points. HOME ALONE 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of home-winning streaks, Miami returned the favor by beating the 
Scarlet Knights at Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Coach Doug Graber, Rutgers coach since 1990, lost at 
Rutgers Stadium. His streak ended at 12 victories. IT HAD TO END 
</P>
<P>
 Texas' 34-31 loss to Colorado ended a 251-game streak for the Longhorns, who 
lost for the first time in their 102-year history when scoring 25 points or 
more at home. LUNAR LAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joe Tiller of Wyoming knew his Cowboys were in trouble when he heard 
this week that Nebraska planned to step up its play to compensate for the loss 
of quarterback Tommie Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are they stepping it to, the moon?" Tiller asked about the No. 2-ranked 
Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not have to go that far in a 42-32 victory over Wyoming at Lincoln, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Phillips, who scored three touchdowns, gained 168 yards in 27 
carries. A FUTURE KRZYZEWSKI? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows about Mike Krzyzewski's basketball program at Duke, but how 
many realize first-year coach Fred Goldsmith has the football team off to a 5-0 
start? 
</P>
<P>
 An easy schedule has helped. Duke defeated Maryland (2-3), East Carolina 
(2-2), Army (1-3), Georgia Tech (1-3) and Navy (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in this situation and be 5-0 is just a tremendous blessing," Goldsmith 
said. "We can't be anything else but ecstatic." SMALL STEPS 
</P>
<P>
 Western Kentucky scored a 31-22 victory over soon-to-be Division I-A Alabama 
Birmingham, which was a big improvement for UAB. The Blazers lost, 72-0, to 
Kansas last week. BIG IN BIG WEST 
</P>
<P>
 David Barr, California's quarterback, was urging his charges not to overlook 
the Big West's San Jose State after losses to San Diego State and Hawaii of the 
Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I think we're in first place in the Pac-10 and last place in the 
WAC," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears passed Barr's challenge, 55-0. SIZING UP 
</P>
<P>
 To those who think Washington's Napoleon Kaufman (a career-high 227 yards in 
34 carries against UCLA) is too small to make it big at a listed 5 feet 9, 180 
pounds, the NFL's two best backs are Emmitt Smith at 5-9, 209, and Barry 
Sanders at 5-8, 203. GIVEN THE BOOT 
</P>
<P>
 Before playing Colorado, Texas safety Tre Thomas said: "If that Hail Mary 
shows up, I promise I'll break up the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, quarterback Kordell Stewart's tipped pass to Michael Westbrook with 
no time left gave the Buffaloes a 27-26 victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was no factor Saturday when Neil Voskeritchian's last-second field goal 
did in No. 16 Texas, 34-31. EARLY EXIT 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Ki-Jana Carter of Penn State dislocated his right thumb late in the 
second quarter of the Nittany Lions' 48-21 victory over Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was replaced after catching a nine-yard pass with 25 seconds left in 
the first half. No. 4 Penn State led, 21-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State officials were not sure if Carter would be ready for the Lions' 
next game, a Big Ten showdown against Michigan on Oct. 15 in Ann Arbor., Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joe Paterno said: "We'll try to put it back together without an 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter gained 61 yards in nine carries, caught three passes for 49 yards and 
had 68 yards in kick returns at the time of his injury. He is averaging 8.1 
yards per carry and has scored nine touchdowns. CRYSTAL BALL CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 With Rose Bowl and national championship implications, Paterno was asked about 
his chances against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not clairvoyant," he said. "I don't mean that to be smart-alecky. I just 
don't know." BEST SELLER 
</P>
<P>
 How much mileage can they get out of the book, "Rough Magic," in which Bill 
Walsh talks before he thinks in insulting many of his coaching rivals? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the book's seminal moments comes when Walsh calls Notre Dame's Lou 
Holtz a "spoiled little brat." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Notre Dame trounced Stanford, 34-15, at South Bend, Ind., Holtz was 
quoted on national television: "I don't know about being a spoiled brat, but I 
like to get my own way." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh characterized the treatise, written by the San Francisco Chronicle's 
Lowell Cohn as a "book I'm not party to." 
</P>
<P>
 All Walsh did was give the columnist free reign to cover the team for a 
season. WORST TALKER 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Price, Washington State's coach, inadvertently supported Walsh's take 
when he said, "I don't want to sound like Lou Holtz, but Tennessee has to be 
the best 1-3 team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Notre Dame, which routinely routs the opponents Holtz tries to 
build up, Washington State proved Price right. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into game, the Cougars had given up only 108 yards in 94 carries, an 
average of 36 yards rushing per game. But Nilo Silvan went untouched 62 yards 
on a reverse and the Cougars gave up 149 rushing yards in the Volunteers' 10-9 
victory at Knoxville. POURING IT ON 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia, which entered the game with one of the country's worst scoring 
offenses -- averaging 9.4 points per game -- defeated Larry Smith's Missouri 
Tigers, 34-10, in Columbus, Mo. FOILED AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Dilger, Illinois' 6-foot-5 tight end, was stopped on the one-yard line by 
Purdue's 5-7 John Jackson as time expired in the Boilermakers' 22-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 His explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught the ball. I hesitated a little bit. I saw an opening but a couple of 
guys hit me at the one. I just didn't make it. It's probably the worst feeling 
in my life. I was the only guy open and I just didn't make it across the goal 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the feeling, though. In 1991, Dilger dropped a pass in the end zone 
with 1:49 left as Missouri held on for a 23-19 victory at Columbia. POISON IVY 
</P>
<P>
 The Ivy League had a banner day going 7-0 (Penn was idle) against 
nonconference opponents. A couple of victories were notable: 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's 28-13 victory over Lafayette was the Lions' first over the Leopards 
since 1980. Brown won consecutive games for the first time in seven years and 
defeated Colgate for the first time since 1968, 26-7. ON TARGET 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom was 37-for-59 for 360 yards in a 34-15 
loss to Notre Dame. Stenstrom increased his career passing yardage to 9,349 to 
tie former Stanford great John Elway for second place on the Pac-10 list. He is 
44 yards shy of the conference record set by Oregon State's Erik Wilhelm 
(1985-88). 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been successful against the Fighting Irish, completing 100 of 147 
passes for 1,020 yards in four games. ALMOST ON TARGET 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia's Eric Zeier became the top passer in Southeastern Conference history, 
but he could not make the passes when the Bulldogs' needed them most in a 29-28 
loss to No. 11 Alabama at Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier eclipsed the career record of 9,287 yards held by Florida's Shane 
Matthews. He finished with 263 yards and has 9,287 for his career. But in a 
last-minute effort to get his team in field-goal position, Zeier had two 
incompletions to give up possession. ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho's 70-21 Big Sky victory over rival Idaho State recalls another 
unceremonious moment in the Bengals' football history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70 points were the most given up by Idaho State since a 137-0 loss to the 
Utah Aggies in 1919. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam of Colorado gained 317 yards in 35 carries in the Buffaloes' 
34-31 victory over Texas. . . . After losing its first four games by a combined 
score of 236-53, Northeast Louisiana defeated Weber State, 62-37. . . . 
Indiana's Alex Smith, who started Saturday as the country's second-leading 
rusher at 157.3 yards per game, was held to 22 yards in 16 carries by 
Minnesota. . . . Brent Moss gained 173 yards in 27 carries and became 
Wisconsin's third 3,000-yard rusher. Moss, with 3,125 yards, joined former 
Heisman Trophy winner Alan Ameche and Billy Marek. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first quarter, I could see the goal posts falling down and Philly 
going crazy." -- Henry Burris, the Temple quarterback who led the Owls on two 
early drives against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanford scares me running the ball as they do passing." -- Lou Holtz, before 
the Irish defeated the Cardinal, 34-15.

THIS PERSONNEL SWITCH WELL RECEIVED; HUSKIES: BJORNSON GOES FROM PASSING TO 
CATCHING, GIVING HUARD A TARGET WHO CAN SENSE TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After alternating between quarterback and wide receiver during his first three 
seasons at Washington, Eric Bjornson went to Husky Coach Don Lambright last 
spring and asked to be moved to wide receiver this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson, who started the final three games at quarterback last season after 
starter Damon Huard suffered a shoulder injury, thought he could be more 
effective at wide receiver and that settling on one quarterback would stabilize 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bjornson didn't think Lambright would agree to the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in with the intention of convincing him to play (me at) wide receiver, 
and I was surprised when he had wanted that all along," Bjornson said. "I was 
pretty tentative about bringing it up. I thought he'd be totally against it. We 
sat there jabbering for 15 minutes about my role and I came to the conclusion 
that he wanted me to play receiver, but I think he was a little tentative about 
bringing it up because he thought it would insult me as far as my abilities as 
a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 "So I finally said, 'Coach, let me get this straight. You want me to play 
receiver?' And he said it was a great idea. I was just blown away." 
</P>
<P>
 The move has paid off for the 12th-ranked Huskies. Huard and Bjornson have 
flourished in helping Washington win three consecutive games after a 
season-opening loss to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Huard completed 10 of 21 passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns as Washington 
beat UCLA, 37-10, Saturday. Bjornson caught five passes for a career-high 89 
yards, including a 32-yard reception on the opening drive of the second half 
that kept Washington's touchdown drive alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an ex-quarterback, he kind of knows what I'm seeing back there," Huard 
said. "He's a real smart guy. He's seen every movie and read every book. He's 
brilliant. He really out-thinks people. He could be calling our plays. It's 
nice to have two quarterbacks on the field at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson said being a former quarterback makes him a better wide receiver 
because he is able to anticipate how Huard will react to defensive coverages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon and I have always had good timing," Bjornson said. "Sometimes I can 
relate to the thought process that Damon is going through on a play. There are 
times when I cut a (pass) route a little bit shorter because I know he has to 
get rid of the ball. I still have that little clock running in my head as to 
when he has to get rid of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bjornson miss playing quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," he said. "We're winning games and I'm playing. Why would I miss 
it? I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 With UCLA intent on trying to shut down tailback Napoleon Kaufman, who ran for 
a career-high 227 yards and one touchdown, the Huskies might have caught the 
Bruins off guard by going to the air at the start of the game as Huard 
completed seven of 14 passes for 85 yards and one touchdown. Washington took a 
10-3 first-half lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what having Napoleon in the backfield does for our passing 
game," Huard said. "They were taking Napoleon away a little bit in the first 
half. Our receivers are a big part of our team and they have to be if they're 
going to beat quality teams like UCLA because the pass sets up the run and the 
run sets up the pass. It was nice to get some big plays with the receivers 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kaufman is Washington's best player, Bjornson might be the Huskies' 
best leader. "You can see his talent, but his number one talent is his 
leadership," Lambright said of Bjornson. "He gives us stability outside and 
that leadership has certainly helped us through this three-game period."

TROJANS FORGET TO DUCK AGAINST SUBSTITUTE QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear Oregon tell it, quarterback Tony Graziani was an upset artist waiting 
to happen, not some scrub-faced, substitute sophomore making his first 
collegiate start. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Duck Coach Rich Brooks would offer later, the kid had turned in a 
"sensational performance running things in spring practice." 
</P>
<P>
 USC was supposed to be a tad tougher than spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this Graziani traipsed around the Coliseum on Saturday as if it was April 
in Eugene, zigzagging past Trojan pylons in guiding the Ducks to a 22-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani was not rocky, as might have been expected. He obviously held no 
regard for history, ignoring that Oregon had not defeated USC at the Coliseum 
since Oct. 9, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani knew less about the legend of Harvey Winn, who came off the bench 
that day in place of the injured Dan Fouts to lead the Ducks to an upset over 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks related the story to the team on Monday, when the coach announced 
Graziani was starting in place of injured senior Danny O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said we were going to have to make history repeat itself," Graziani said 
of Brooks' history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 To a Duck, no one seemed shocked that Graziani could step in and one-two punch 
the nation's 19th-ranked team at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He isn't fazed by too much," Brooks said. "He's kind of loosey-goosey. He 
didn't get uptight. It didn't bother him. If it did, he sure didn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani, a left-hander from Modesto, completed 16 of 31 passes for 287 yards 
and a touchdown. He rushed for 33 yards in four carries and ran the team like a 
seasoned veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been preparing for this, really, all my life," he said. "I wanted to 
step up and do the best I could."  
</P>
<P>
 He calmly came out slinging and built a 16-7 halftime lead. His mistakes -- 
two third-quarter interceptions -- did not seem to rankle him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ask for more," said Oregon receiver Cristin McLemore, who caught a 
19-yard scoring pass from Graziani. "He walked with confidence. Even after he 
made those mistakes, those picks, he left it on the field. On the sideline he'd 
look at me and say, 'Am I OK?' and I'd say 'You're fine, you're doing fine.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, it was 'How Tony goes is how we go.' He did it for us. I hope he 
remembers this for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good chance of that. Before Saturday, Graziani had thrown 24 passes 
in four games in relief of O'Neil, who will end up owning most of Oregon's 
career passing marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani, a third-year sophomore, played like a fifth-year senior. More than 
his numbers, he kept the Ducks' offense on the field in the second half and 
essentially ran out the clock on the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of his day were two fourth-quarter moments: 
</P>
<P>
 On third and seven from his 32, he scrambled 17 yards around left end to keep 
the drive alive. Later in the series, on second down at the USC 46, he dumped a 
screen pass to tailback Dino Philyaw, who ran 38 yards to the 16, setting up an 
insurance field goal with 6:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had confidence in him since he's been here," said Philyaw, who 
rushed for 123 yards in 27 carries. "Me and Tony, we ran the second team in 
spring. All Tony needed to do was to get in and show people he can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Johnson, who had three catches for 50 yards, also had no doubt 
Graziani was the man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he could do it," Johnson said. "At practice, it's just like Danny, 
not like a substitute. He's good, man, he's good." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil, sidelined because of an infected finger on his throwing hand, is 
expected to return in two weeks, at which time Graziani will dutifully return 
to the bench and wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the best for Danny," Graziani said. "I hope he recovers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans might not. Any designs they had on ransacking a young quarterback 
were dashed early. 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani was not easily rattled. His stomach, to his surprise, was not tied in 
knots before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like I was scared, or nervous," he said. "Just some jitters. I had 
a good night's sleep, not a great night's sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Graziani might sleep through the alarm this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming into the Coliseum, against a ranked team, what more can you ask for?"

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; O'GRADY SAYS ALL DALY NEEDS IS A SOLID DOSE OF TALK SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK

<P>
 It hasn't been the greatest of years for John Daly, golf's bad boy. So look 
who has sprung to Daly's defense 
</P>
<P>
 Mac O'Grady. 
</P>
<P>
 In his days on the PGA Tour, O'Grady had his share of controversy, too, and 
his feud with then-Commissioner Deane Beman was legendary. Perhaps that is why 
O'Grady is sympathetic to Daly, who recently withdrew from official PGA Tour 
events for the rest of the year after a series of conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, when I look at John Daly, I see a modern-day George Herman Ruth," 
O'Grady said. "Too bad this isn't the Roaring '20s because he would fit in 
perfectly. Everybody on the tour has high levels of intelligence and 
immaturity. John Daly isn't any different than anybody else if you open up the 
skeletons in his closet, only he does it in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll grow up," O'Grady said. "Look at me. I love to watch 'Oprah,' 
'Geraldo,' all the shows about dysfunctionals. That's my psychoanalysis. I 
realized I wasn't as bad as I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should be Daly's penance. He has to watch all the shows about 
dysfunctional people for the next four months and take notes. Then I'm sure the 
new commissioner will ask him to give a thesis on dysfunctional people he 
studied and how they relate to the PGA Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly last played Aug. 28 at the World Series of Golf. At that event, he was 
involved in an altercation with 62-year-old Bob Roth, father of golfer Jeff 
Roth, after the elder Roth accused Daly of hitting into his son's group. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Daly was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard at the 
Greater Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Daly was quoted in a British newspaper just before the British Open 
that other PGA Tour players were substance abusers and called for drug testing. 
PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem had a meeting with Daly right afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Daly withdrew after the first round of the New England Classic, 
citing exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beman suspended Daly for four months last November after Daly had picked up 
his ball during a tournament in Hawaii. It was the second time Beman had 
suspended Daly. The first was when Daly underwent alcohol rehabilitation 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly is eligible to return to the tour for the Mercedes Championship at La 
Costa, the first week of January. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a history of having some difficulties," Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 tournaments this season, Daly missed the cut in seven, withdrew from 
one, was disqualified in another and won in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, 28, won the 1991 PGA Championship as a virtual unknown. In June, he 
signed a 10-year, $30-million endorsement deal with Wilson. Another principal 
sponsor, Reebok, suspended its endorsement deal with Daly until he returns to 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The company released this statement from Daly: "I am looking forward to 
returning to the PGA Tour in '95, when I expect to represent Reebok and myself 
in a professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady said Daly will be fine in time. Until then, and to get Daly smiling 
again, O'Grady suggested that Daly would benefit by playing with a new partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack Nicholson," O'Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Irwin isn't surprised by Daly's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "John still has to get his life together," Irwin told Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin also said Daly may be adversely affected by the makeup of his gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "His following is not the sophisticate," Irwin said. "His following seems to 
be the rough journeyman. The good old boys. I have seen it. They don't know 
anything about golf. They want to see him hit it a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady has been keeping a very low profile since the Masters, when he made 
Finchem angry by saying some golfers were using beta blockers to enhance their 
performances. When O'Grady traveled and worked with Seve Ballesteros this 
summer, he did not want to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 This earned him a nickname from Vijay Singh: "Resident PGA Tour Mystic." 
</P>
<P>
 There is more, O'Grady said, breaking his self-imposed silence: "Resident PGA 
Tour Mystic, nonconformist and researcher." 
</P>
<P>
 He is serious about golf mechanics. O'Grady is busy putting on a series of 
symposiums on the golf swing, based on his studies. There is one scheduled this 
week at Foothills Golf Club in Phoenix.

 Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, Tom Watson and Payne Stewart will play the Skins 
Game, Nov. 26-27 at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert. Stewart is the only 
golfer to have won three consecutive Skins Game championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart wound up No. 5 on the money list last season, but has banked only 
$134,259 this year, missed the cut at the Masters, the U.S. Open and the 
British Open and tied for 66th at the PGA Championship.

ANALYSIS; THEIR TIME ALREADY IS RUNNING OUT; RAIDERS: THROUGH FOUR GAMES, THE 
TEAM HAS RUSHED FOR 294 YARDS IN 84 CARRIES, FOR AN AVERAGE OF ONLY 73.5 PER 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep into the frustration of another loss a couple of weeks ago, Raider 
assistant coach Bill Meyers stared across the press box at offensive 
coordinator Tom Walsh, narrowed his eyes and yelled, "Run the damn ball!" 
</P>
<P>
 If only they could. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are supposed to be enjoying this, their only weekend off this 
season, but they can't really enjoy it. Not if they start thinking about how 
far off course they were on three of the four weekends they played. 
</P>
<P>
 Thought to be Super Bowl-bound by some, the Raiders now seem bound for 
oblivion, their 1-3 record leaving them ahead of only the 0-4 Denver Broncos in 
the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of places to point the finger: The inconsistency caused by 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler's throwing problems in the first two games, the 
distraction caused by defensive end Scott Davis' absence, the failure to 
generate a strong pass rush, dropped passes, unnecessary penalties and 
questionable play calling. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget all of that. The Raiders can solve all of those problems, and 
indeed already have done so with some of them, and they still won't go anywhere 
in 1994. Not without a running game. 
</P>
<P>
 So where have all the runners gone? 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson is an Angel, Marcus Allen is a Kansas City Chief, Eric Dickerson is 
in retirement, Greg Robinson is trying to regain full use of his left knee and 
Napoleon McCallum is trying to regain full use of his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders certainly haven't had much luck with the position. In the last 
four years, they have lost one of the most explosive runners in pro football 
history, the biggest single-season ground gainer, one of the league's most 
productive touchdown scorers ever, their leading rusher last season and their 
leading scorer on the ground among their running backs. Allen is the only one 
they could have done anything about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders finished 26th in the 28-team league in rushing last year. You know 
it's bad when your leading scorer on the ground, who is the leading holdover 
from last year's rushing corps, is your quarterback. Hostetler rushed for five 
touchdowns and 202 yards. Those numbers say as much about the running game as 
they do about Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders didn't merely sit around and agonize over all of this in the 
off-season. With two solid offensive linemen already in place on the left side, 
the team shored up the right by signing Kevin Gogan, the imposing veteran from 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 They let fullback Steve Smith go, but seemed to have not only maintained their 
strength at that position, but perhaps improved on it by signing San Francisco 
49er veteran Tom Rathman. With Robinson not expected back until midseason at 
the earliest, the Raiders signed veteran Harvey Williams and drafted Calvin 
Jones of Nebraska. When McCallum suffered a season-ending injury in this 
season's opener, the Raiders signed former New York Giant Jerrod Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the result of all this? 
</P>
<P>
 Through four games, the Raiders have rushed for 294 yards in 84 carries for an 
average of 73.5 yards per game. Projected over a 16-game season, that comes out 
to 1,176 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That would leave them 249 yards short of their total last season, when they 
averaged 89.1 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is the Raider rushing leader. But he has yet to reach 100 yards total 
. He has gained 90 and has a 2.7-yard average. Ty Montgomery is next with 73 
yards and a 2.8-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances have had something to do with that. The Raiders were never ahead 
in either of their first two games, forcing Coach Art Shell to scrap any 
thoughts of establishing a ground game. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some point, he is going to have to do so if he is to salvage this 
season. How? Shell could: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make Williams the starting tailback and stick with him. Williams is a 
natural tailback; Montgomery is not. Williams was signed to see what he could 
do. It's still difficult to tell because the Raiders insist on running by 
committee. Give Williams the ball 20 times per game and find out whether he can 
realize his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use Rathman more, especially in short-yardage and goal-line situations. He 
has only 10 carries in the four games, only four more than Hostetler, who might 
still be the best runner on the team. Rathman has gained as many as 427 yards 
in a season. Over a two-year period, he scored 13 touchdowns rushing. Even two 
years ago, the last time he was injury free, Rathman rushed for five 
touchdowns. Yet when the Raiders had a crucial fourth and three last week 
against the San Diego Chargers, they went off left tackle with Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- See what Bunch can do. Two years ago, the last time he wasn't slowed by 
injury, Bunch averaged 4.8 yards per carry, second highest in the league that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Jones a chance. He was the second-leading rusher in Nebraska history 
with 3,153 yards and 40 touchdowns. Will his style work in the NFL? This might 
be a good time to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use Rocket Ismail more. The Raiders are understandably cautious about 
risking injury to the 5-foot-11, 180-pounder by using him regularly in the 
backfield. He is too valuable as a kick returner and pass receiver to take 
chances. But as a change of pace, Ismail, on a reverse or merely an occasional 
carry, can throw defenses off stride. He wasn't named Rocket because of a 
plodding style. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has said he is using this respite to explore all his options. Whatever 
the Raiders decide to do when their season resumes next Sunday on the road 
against the New England Patriots, their best option can be summed up in four 
words: Run the damn ball.

PROPOSAL MAY LAND O.C. AIRPORT MORE CARRIERS; TRANSPORTATION: DISCOUNT AIRLINES 
COULD USE JOHN WAYNE BY AFFILIATING WITH ESTABLISHED CARRIERS. SUPERVISORS VOTE 
TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a crucial vote that could help determine the future of air travel in Orange 
County, the Board of Supervisors will decide Tuesday on a proposal that would 
allow discount carriers such as Reno Air to begin service at John Wayne Airport 
right away by making connections with airlines already established there. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has strong support from carriers who feel they have been shut out by 
existing airport policy. It has also won praise from some airport officials and 
from Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, in whose district the airport is located. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the changes will enhance competition and provide more operating 
flexibility," Riley said Friday. "As the airline industry changes, the county 
will have to accept the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal could also give John Wayne more of an international flavor. 
Airlines like Northwest Airlines, for example, which operates jointly with KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines on overseas flights, would be able to put up signs 
promoting the connection, even though KLM itself does not operate at John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 But the so-called affiliate plan is bitterly opposed by a group of carriers 
already serving Orange County. Led by United Airlines, that group maintains 
that the proposal could lead to less, rather than more, competition. At the 
very least, said United lobbyist Alan B. Wayne, it would shut off the airport 
to additional flights by low-fare Southwest Airlines, which began serving John 
Wayne in May, or United's new low-cost subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is virtually closing the door to any Shuttle by United 
operation in the future and to any significant expansion by Southwest," Wayne 
said. "Orange County residents are going to be penalized and continue to pay 
higher fares than at other airports." 
</P>
<P>
 Strict noise restrictions in a 1985 agreement between the county and Newport 
Beach limit the number of flights at John Wayne. Carriers that already have 
landing slots, or approvals for a certain number of arrivals and departures a 
day, rarely surrender them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of daily flights is thus capped, Orange County has become 
an increasingly popular destination among the traveling public. That, in turn, 
has allowed airlines serving John Wayne to charge premium prices for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest managed to get landing slots at the airport by purchasing Morris Air 
Service, which was already operating there with service to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that has resulted in a long waiting list for carriers wishing to start 
Orange County service. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air would still be in a holding pattern if not for an agreement with 
American Airlines. American had been flying between John Wayne and San Jose, a 
popular business destination that also served as an important junction for 
flights headed east and farther north. It was a profitable run until newcomer 
Southwest began offering a $69 one-way fare -- about half what American was 
charging. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than cut fares and lose money, American proposed turning over the 
flights over to Reno Air, which has much lower overhead costs and could compete 
profitably against Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air had hoped to start Orange County service during the summer but was 
blocked when the federal Department of Transportation insisted on reviewing the 
matter. Regulators have since cleared the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Board of Supervisors approves the affiliate plan, Reno Air officials 
say, they might be able to begin flying from Orange County as soon as this 
month with five daily fights to San Jose and one daily flight to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "United has waged a vigorous campaign to keep Reno Air out of Orange County," 
said Robert M. Rowen, Reno Air's vice president and general counsel. United's 
objections, he said, stem from the fact that it doesn't want competition for 
its Shuttle by United, which on Saturday began flights between John Wayne and 
Los Angeles International. 
</P>
<P>
 United, for its part, vows to keep fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the county is . . . in effect, interfering with normal, free-market 
forces and encouraging the formation of cartels," lobbyist Wayne said. "We 
think that is the wrong way to go, and it will prevent Orange County residents 
from benefiting" from interstate air fare discounting wars among major 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier concedes, though, that it expects the Board of Supervisors to vote 
for a change of policy, especially with Riley having given it his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they see only benefits in encouraging more competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The affiliate proposal "makes regulation more flexible," said airport 
spokeswoman Courtney C. Wiercioch. "The carriers may choose to be part of an 
operating group or not part of an operating group." 
</P>
<P>
 She stopped short of predicting how Tuesday's vote will go. "At this point," 
Wiercioch said, "we don't know."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; GENETIC TESTING: CAN WE KNOW TOO MUCH?; UC IRVINE PROFESSOR 
FORESEES ETHICAL DILEMMAS AS IT BECOMES EASIER TO PREDICT BIRTH DEFECTS, 
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To UC Irvine Prof. John J. Wasmuth, it is not speculation. It is a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years from now a woman who suspects she is pregnant will go to her 
physician for tests. The physician will scrape a few cells from the 10-week-old 
fetus and send them off for genetic analysis. It will be routine; the results 
will come back in only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby will be male. He will not have any of the more common, catastrophic 
birth defects. So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be prone to colon cancer in midlife. That's good to know. We can watch 
for that and treat it. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will be 20 times more likely to be severely schizophrenic or psychotic 
before he's 20 years old. We can't say it will happen, only that it is much 
more likely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the woman abort? 
</P>
<P>
 This is social dynamite, and the fuse is already burning. Though genes that 
cause disease are being discovered, on average, about once a month, that rate 
will accelerate rapidly, Wasmuth says. Yet measures to prevent or treat these 
disorders will lag many years behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wasmuth, a professor of biological chemistry, has worked more than a 
decade to discover or help discover these genetic defects and the simple tests 
to diagnose them, he says he knows that gene testing can lead -- will lead -- 
parents into agonizing dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aborting a child certain to die within a few months of birth may not seem a 
difficult decision to some, but what about a child with a 50-50 chance of a 
life made miserable by incurable disease? 
</P>
<P>
 * What about a healthy, mentally intact child who will suffer from society's 
prejudice? Dwarfism can be detected now in fetuses, and some researchers 
speculate that detecting the tendency toward homosexuality may be in store. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than diseases will be discerned from gene analysis. The genes 
controlling intelligence and body size will be discovered sooner or later. Will 
some parents abort children too small for football or too dim for college? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth says he has seen the effects of such discoveries on others and on his 
own family. 
</P>
<P>
 After locating the gene that causes the most common form of dwarfism, he 
discovered a case in which a dwarf wanted his pregnant wife to be tested. If 
the child was not going to be a dwarf, the father wanted an abortion.  
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted a 'normal' child, and to him, a dwarf is normal," Wasmuth says. 
"This is just the other side of the coin. These are not simple issues." 
</P>
<P>
 And they are very emotional, too, as Wasmuth discovered when his daughter 
became pregnant last year. Early ultrasound tests showed something in the fetus 
that might indicate a mind-destroying defect. Gene tests would settle the 
question, and Wasmuth's daughter sought his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth, to his surprise, advised against testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To anyone else, I'd have said: 'It's the smart thing to do. Have the test. 
You can rule out the disease, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was my daughter, and it was very scary," Wasmuth says. "I'd been 
doing this research for 15 or 20 years, and now it was like it brought my 
daughter down into my world. It was right in my face. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first inclination was, 'The chances of this happening are so slim, don't 
worry about it. Forget about it.' I admit, it was a backwards reaction on my 
part, but this was my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 But his 28-year-old daughter, Michele Bones, a computer programming 
instructor, came from her home in San Diego to UCI for the gene tests, "and we 
had to wait for two weeks. She handled it better than I did; I was a basket 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 The tests proved negative, and Wasmuth's perfectly normal grandson was born in 
November. But he concedes that "this influenced me more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Wasmuth says, he's worried about how the discoveries he and other 
genetics researchers are making might be misused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you find the mutation that causes the genetic disorder and you put the 
information out there, people can use it any way they want, and I guess that's 
what bothers me. You hope it will be used to the benefit of everyone, but you 
know that certainly is not always going to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been very good at long-range planning, have we? We had no idea of 
the implications of splitting the atom. Now we can have the information that 
would allow us to substitute our personal selection for natural selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "What should be tested for, and should we test everybody? If we test 
everybody, what disease do you eliminate through abortion and what disease do 
you sort of just let alone and say let natural evolution take its course? We 
may be really changing the evolution of the entire species in some way we don't 
understand. That's a little far-fetched in some cases, but I think in a lot of 
cases it's not out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
 Cystic fibrosis is a powerful example, Wasmuth says. The disease, produced 
when a child gets a defective gene from each parent, affects the lungs and is 
invariably fatal, usually before age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural selection always has, and probably always will, select out such a 
catastrophic defect. If it did nothing good, you'd expect it to be gone forever 
by now. But it's not; it's amazingly common. One in every 20 Caucasians carries 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So there's a good possibility that this gene is involved in something 
beneficial that we don't know about. Personally, I believe the disease is a 
side effect of something else, something important, that we haven't found out 
about yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems obvious at first -- just get rid of this horrible defective gene -- 
but I'm worried that we won't have the insight to manage such things wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 For the power to reach into human genes and change them "is not that far off," 
Wasmuth says. "It can be done in mice right now. If it can be done in mice, it 
won't be too long before it can be done in humans. Ethically and legally it's 
not going to happen for a long time, but technically it could be done fairly 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 These are relatively new worries for Wasmuth, he concedes. "When I first 
started, I hadn't even considered it." 
</P>
<P>
 He started in Greenville, a small farming community in southern Illinois. Born 
in 1946 to a grocer and a registered nurse, he developed a passion in high 
school for sports and science. They turned out to have more in common than he 
thought.  
</P>
<P>
 "In science, being competitive makes a lot of difference," he says. "It's a 
competitive world, more than most. No one ever remembers who made a discovery 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Wasmuth's family had ever earned a college degree. "The people I 
knew there either didn't go to college and stayed in town or they went to 
college and didn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth joined the latter group and set off for Southern Illinois University 
with medical school in mind. The path led through Purdue University and the 
Baylor College of Medicine, where a genetics professor took Wasmuth under his 
wing. Not surprisingly, medical school was eclipsed by an increasing interest 
in the clinical aspects of genetics, Wasmuth says. 
</P>
<P>
 By then he had married Judy Schwierjohn, "a real, bona fide German. Her 
parents were farmers in Illinois, and we had been high school sweethearts." 
They have been married 30 years and now live in a large house overlooking Lake 
Mission Viejo. His wife works for a firm that auctions real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 His introduction to genetics at Baylor changed his life, Wasmuth says. Until 
then he had envisioned a teaching career "at some reasonably sized college. It 
would be a nice, sedate way to make a living, I thought. But the more I got 
into genetics, the more I liked research, and that means a high-powered 
university." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Wasmuth was hired at UC Irvine to teach biochemistry to first-year 
medical students and to conduct the research of his choosing. "I'm really not 
sure how I wound up here, but once I got here, everything really sort of fell 
into place. UCI was a good career move. There was not much genetics being done 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth began basic genetics research, shifting in the 1980s to intensive 
research into gene defects that cause disease. In 1993, he established UCI as 
one of the 16 universities with a Human Genome Center, a part of the National 
Institutes of Health's long-term effort to map the location and purpose of 
every human gene. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a monumental task, Wasmuth says, "probably the most difficult yet most 
interesting thing in biology." It appeals to him, he says, for the same reason 
mystery stories appeal to him. "You have clues all along the way, and you 
really have to think about them. To me, this is just the biggest mystery of 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene-mapping is literally code-breaking, for the string of molecules in a gene 
is eerily like computer code. No one knows the method this genetic code uses to 
instruct its cell in how to form and what to do, but the code itself can be 
read. Laboratory equipment can take sections of genes and print out their 
sequences as a string of letters. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic alphabet has only four letters -- A, C, G and T -- each 
representing one of the four kinds of coding molecules. The sequence carries 
the meaning. Just as ..- means U but -.. means D in Morse code, A-T-G means 
this is the beginning of a gene sequence but T-A-A means this is the end. What 
lies between may be a string of 1,000 molecules, but it may also be as many as 
1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 3 billion coding molecules in a complete set of human genes, and 
just one misplaced molecule can cause immense changes in human development. 
Researchers like Wasmuth search for that molecule by meticulously comparing the 
genes of afflicted people with the genes of normal people. Find the sequence in 
all the afflicted that is never seen in the normal, and you've solved the 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 You have also laid a foundation for future research, for if your gene causes, 
say, dwarfism, it must be in a gene that affects bone growth. Those seeking the 
genes for other genetically induced bone disorders are sure to search that 
region once your results are published. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the reason the pace of discoveries is accelerating, Wasmuth says. 
Disease-causing genes are being discovered about once a month now, but the rate 
could easily reach once a week by 1999. The pace will probably slow as the 
causes of more complex, multi-gene disorders are sought, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, every aspect of human physical development could eventually be 
determined by examining the genes of a person born or unborn. But practically, 
how much do people want to know? 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, people with a family history of Huntington's disease, a disorder 
that sets in at midlife and slowly drags its victim toward dementia and death, 
were asked if they would like to be tested for the disease if a test were 
available. About three in four said yes, Wasmuth says. Yet when a test became 
available, enthusiasm waned. About half said they did not want to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it is sort of a theoretical thing, people say, 'Sure, I'd do it, "' 
Wasmuth says. "But when it's time to sit down and do it -- you're 35 and we're 
going to test you to see whether you have 10 instead of maybe 40 good years 
left -- well, you just don't know what you'll say until you're there. Is 
ignorance bliss?" 
</P>
<P>
 And knowledge will be even more painful when it is not certain, Wasmuth says. 
Most reports will not be yes or no with 100% certainty. They will be 
probabilities, like odds in a casino -- one chance in five that your baby will 
be a lifetime burden rather than a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think uncertain answers will cause more anxiety than no answers at all. 
Having an uncertain answer and the option to abort? Right now people say no, I 
don't want to know. It happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people who had a prenatal diagnosis where the child clearly 
was going to have Down's syndrome and they go ahead. They wanted the child, and 
they have the child. Others abort. Neither one can understand the other one. 
It's a very personal decision, and no one can make the decision for anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth was raised a Catholic, a religion dead set against abortion, but he 
says he has modified his thinking and is no longer a practicing Catholic. "But 
it's something you don't get rid of, and so I think about all this in that 
context also. But for me, this is apart from religion or anything else. It's 
sort of like how I view things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine someone who grew up in a teeny, tiny town in southern Illinois who 
can actually find something abnormal in genes and develop a test for it. In 
some ways it's a little bit frightening, because you don't exactly know 10 
years from now how the information will be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the long run, it does much more good than harm. Finding the defective 
gene is the first step to preventing or curing the disease. I'm not going to 
quit what I do. It's too important, and I love doing it." John Jacob Wasmuth 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Born in Greenville, Ill., now lives in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married 30 years to Judy Schwierjohn, with whom he has a 28-year-old 
daughter, Michele Bones of San Diego, and a grandson, Connor, 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Mystery stories, any sport and breaking genetic codes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the simplicity of genetic testing: "The test for achondroplasia (a form of 
dwarfism) can be done by a high school biology lab with one piece of equipment 
and $100 worth of chemicals. Four reasonably intelligent high school students 
could do 100 tests in a month. Tests aren't all that simple, but a lot of them 
are, and they're getting simpler all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 On the future of genetic repair: "For the most part we're still playing with 
Tinkertoys, but for the last five or six years people have been able to stick 
genes into mouse embryos and correct genetic defects. If you can do it in mice, 
you can do it in people. It's just a matter of not being efficient enough at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 On genetic discoveries: "Once you get familiar with the playing field, with 
human genes, a lot is intuition. You see something, but it may not hit you that 
day. Maybe two weeks later you're thinking, 'Something about that bothers me.' 
But sometimes it's a genuine, all-out aha!"

CITIZENS OF THE WORLD; HE RESOLVES CORPORATE DISPUTES. SHE FIGHTS FOR SOCIAL 
JUSTICE. THE ONLY THING MISSING INRON AND JANE OLSON'S MARRIAGE IS A CAUSE TO 
TAKE ON TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTUANE LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Ron Olson to talk about himself and he defers: "My wife, Jane, is the 
interesting one." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Jane, and she demurs: "There's not much to say. Shouldn't you focus just 
on Ron?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's the Olson charm. After 30 years of marriage and three kids, the 
attorney and the activist still seem more interested in each other than in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a marriage made in heaven, this is it," Jane says with a smile. 
"It's grown in romance (since) the empty nest." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ron: "I sometimes wonder how we were lucky enough to choose each other 
when we were so very young." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Wednesday, 9 a.m., in Pasadena, and the Olsons are back from their 
early outings: Jane from a 7 o'clock meeting at Polytechnic School, where she 
is president of the board of trustees; Ron from his daily 90-minute workout at 
the Ritz-Carlton gym around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 They're drinking coffee together in the handsomely remodeled kitchen that, 
Jane says, almost wrecked their wedded bliss. The construction took months and 
Ron "can't stand domestic chaos." This is the only major marital conflict she 
can recall -- or at least that she cares to divulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron is not amused. "That's not it," he says, brows furrowed. "We lost the 
ritual of coming together as a family in here. We couldn't sit around the 
dinner table and share, as we always have. That has been a very steadying 
influence for me, the glue in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Corny? Well, the Olsons are from Iowa. The portrait of Ron in the elegant 
Downtown law offices of Munger, Tolles & Olson depicts him on his farm, astride 
a manure spreader, wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a cornstalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how the legendary sharp-tongued antitrust lawyer Maxwell Blecher felt 
in 1988 when he came up against Olson's earnest, heartland style in an L.A. 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake was control over the technology and marketing of immuno-diagnostics, 
a technique for detecting such diseases as AIDS by testing for antigens in body 
fluids. Blecher's La Jolla-based client, Hybritech, accused Olson's 
Chicago-based client, Abbott Labs, of monopolizing the field. Hybritech wanted 
$60 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six-week federal jury trial, Olson reportedly drew upon his small-town 
Iowa youth, quoting his football coach, his farmer friends and his father's 
homilies. Olson declines to discuss the case, or his oratorical style, but 
Blecher remembers it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only good things to say about Olson," he says. "But to tell the truth, 
if I had to hear any more corn pone about what his daddy taught him, I was 
going to throw up. Of course Olson won, and who can quibble with success?" 
</P>
<P>
 The word success doesn't amply describe Olson's accomplishments since arriving 
here from Manilla, Iowa (population 800), 25 years ago. His name now appears on 
just about every law journal list of the nation's 50 or 100 most respected and 
powerful corporate litigators. When big business gets into trouble, it's often 
his phone that rings. In fact, Olson has attracted so many blue-chip clients 
with watershed cases to his elite firm that he has been dubbed the best 
rainmaker in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson hates this kind of talk. His lip curls and his Robert Redford-blue eyes 
flash. "People don't hire me, they hire the firm. We're a team," he says 
steamily. 
</P>
<P>
 He's right, of course. Two years ago, when investor Warren Buffet temporarily 
took the helm of Salomon Bros., the Wall Street firm accused of securities 
fraud, a cadre of Munger, Tolles & Olson lawyers flew to New York to untangle 
the mess. Buffet, chairman of the multibillion-dollar Berkshire Hathaway 
investment conglomerate and a major Salomon shareholder, named Olson as lead 
lawyer on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was severe and complex," Buffet says. "It involved coordinating a 
solution satisfactory to five different (regulatory) authorities -- all of whom 
had their own agenda and each of whom had been offended in a different way. 
Ron's accomplishment in (settling that) was masterful. He's not just a terrific 
lawyer, but a first-class human being. That comes through, even to his 
adversaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Says the head of another corporate client, MCA President Sid Sheinberg: "Ron 
is a real counselor -- a man of wisdom whose judgment I trust way beyond the 
four corners of any legal issue. He's the kind of lawyer I'd have wanted to be 
if I'd stayed in the field. That is my highest compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense of huge corporations might seem like dry, boring work. But Olson 
makes it sound positively sexy. With each client he enters a different world, 
he says, immersing himself in a fascinating new arena. From the passion in his 
voice, you know he means it. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the Valdez oil spill, he jumps up and points to a large, detailed 
and well-worn map in his office of the Alaska disaster site, obviously pleased 
to explain how the Exxon tanker came to spill its load. 
</P>
<P>
 As litigator for Alyeska Pipeline Services Inc., a consortium of oil companies 
enmeshed in legal claims stemming from its allegedly abysmal cleanup efforts, 
Olson shaped a "positively brilliant" settlement, says Frank McCormack, 
Atlantic Richfield's vice president and general counsel. While Exxon was hit 
with $5 billion in punitive damages, Alyeska's member companies, including 
Atlantic Richfield and Mobil, agreed to a $98 million total settlement.

 Olson's litigation skills will have lasting effects, his peers say. He 
pioneered the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and the mini-trial, 
earning a place in legal history, says Margaret Morrow, president of the State 
Bar of California. The concepts aim to reduce court time and expenses by 
presenting streamlined cases to decision-making panels composed of the 
principals for the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big corporations began using ADR and became trendsetters, helping make it 
acceptable for small businesses and individuals to also settle their 
differences without lengthy, expensive courtroom battles," she says. Thanks 
largely to Olson, ADR has become increasingly popular in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 His ability to find inventive solutions for legal problems is not gleaned from 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can learn law," Olson says. But judgment is what a lawyer sells. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's putting the pieces together, judging how to shape a presentation and 
what to advise the client -- that's what law is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes good judgment is based on unimpeachable ethics and a wide range of 
interests well beyond the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson skis, swims, hunts, fishes, runs and plays tennis. He serves as a 
director, board member or trustee for more than a dozen institutions, including 
the Asia/Pacific Center for the Resolution of International Business Disputes, 
the Skid Row Housing Trust, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. And he 
chaired the American Bar Assn. committee that reviewed Clarence Thomas' 
qualifications for a U.S. Supreme Court seat. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a schedule, where does he find time for family? 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's eyes widen in disbelief. His wife and children are the most important, 
the best part of his life, he replies. They come first, he says, and they know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the kids, now in their 20s, were young, he would pack a sack lunch and 
surprise them with a noontime visit at school. Weekends were spent together -- 
no guests and no TV -- at their little ranch near the entrance to Sequoia 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And his wife, Janie? Well, words momentarily fail him here. "She has a lot of 
grace in her life," he finally begins. "I mean incredible sensitivity for me 
and the children and even people she's just met. I mean, I don't know how you 
become graceful, but that's what she is to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of time together," he says, "but not enough." 
</P>

 Jane Tenhulzen married Ron Olson exactly two weeks after graduating from the 
University of Nebraska. She was 21 and he was a year older and a law student at 
the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 They had grown up 10 miles apart. She knew of his high school football heroics 
and had watched him "cruise through town," she says. But they didn't date until 
their college years, after her older sister "handed him down." The wedding 
reception in her parents' back yard segued into a one-night honeymoon in a 
place Ron describes as "pretty fancy for us back then: the Holiday Inn in Des 
Moines." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Olson's geographic path has followed her husband's, but her spiritual 
journey has been her own, she says. Nowadays, she frequently jets off on her 
own business trips, leaving Ron to fend for himself in the airy, U-shaped house 
set among lawn and trees. This week, she is representing the Commission for 
Refugee Women and Children at a United Nations conference in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping displaced people in such places as Serbia, Croatia, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan has become her passion, she says, "because few people know what is 
going on over there -- and fewer seem to care." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane had been a Young Republican until marrying Ron and moving to the Ann 
Arbor campus. "Enlightenment happened there," she says, recalling long evenings 
of drinking wine and debating liberal politics and philosophy. Later in 
England, during Ron's Oxford University fellowship, she got an advanced 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd walk the pram into town, sneak into the back of a classroom, and listen 
to lectures until the baby fussed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mother of toddlers in Pasadena, she worked on Project Head Start. And in 
the '70s she helped start a children's art workshop that evolved into the 
Armory Center for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the turning point in her worldview, she says, came after she joined All 
Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena and met its leader, the Rev. George Regas. 
His social activism gave momentum to her own leanings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Regas took her to lunch with Rabbi Leonard Beerman of Leo Baeck 
Temple on the Westside. They asked her to set up a conference called "Reversing 
the Arms Race." Its success led to an entire organization, the Interfaith 
Center to Reverse the Arms Race, which operated for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid '80s, then-ACLU Board Chairman Stanley Sheinbaum asked Jane to 
establish a California branch of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, for 
which she traveled to the Soviet Union many times. Then, a few years ago, a 
friend asked her to take a trip to the former Yugoslavia with the Women's 
Commission for Refugee Women and Children, a branch of the International Rescue 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 She has since been lecturing, writing and advocating for refugees and such 
displaced people as the Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have no homes, can never go back to where they used to live, but 
can't leave the country," says Jane, who recently visited that region. "They 
are packed into all the public buildings. There's no school, for example, 
because every classroom has about five families living in it. The burden is 
enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee commission is trying to address the special needs of women and 
children. "Most of the mandates for relief organizations are written by men for 
men," she explains.  
</P>
<P>
 "For example, we recommended they put feminine hygiene products into the 
monthly food relief packages. They'd never thought of it. But one of the most 
awful things for women in these camps is the lack of privacy combined with no 
sanitation or laundry facilities," she says. "And no change of clothes. Just 
think what that means to have only what's on your back." 
</P>
<P>
 Beerman, who has known Jane for 15 years, says her sensitivity to injustice 
takes her everywhere. "(She) acts out in life the moral values that come from 
her sense of herself as a Christian, an American and a citizen of the world. 
That means there are very few boundaries to her conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 For all her humanitarian work, Jane laughingly labels herself "a housewife" 
because that's the job she held the longest and loved the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women's movement would hate me," she says. "I'm a crazy woman who loved 
everything about parenting," from packing lunches to playing Girl Scout leader 
and "soccer team mom." She also loves cooking, baking bread and pies, 
gardening, entertaining and writing letters. "I even knit," she says with a 
laugh, pointing to a basket of wool and needles in the infamous kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to be home to raise the children," she says of her decision not 
to work even in the couple's early lean years, "to make sure we could all sit 
down together every night when Ron came home." 
</P>
<P>
 She was insistent about that. If he worked late, she would give the kids a 
healthy snack, bathe them and help them with their homework, she says. When Dad 
arrived, dinner was served and never interrupted by TV or ringing phones. 
</P>
<P>
 That world survives in the happy, wholesome photos of the Olson Five, 
appearing on Christmas cards each year. Amy, 23, is a University of Michigan 
graduate who works for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C.; 
Steven, 26, is a law student at Michigan, and Kristin, 28, is a Harvard 
graduate who works for a private foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very close to each other, and they're our best friends," Jane says. 
"We just made plans with them for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They've chosen to 
spend time with us. I think it's because when they were little, we chose to 
spend time with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy agrees. Asked what makes her parents so exceptional, she says: "It's the 
Iowa in them." 
</P>
<P>
 If only life here were as uncomplicated as it was there. 
</P>
<P>
 If she has one frustration, Jane says, bursting into tears, it's that "there's 
so much competition for our time. We try to get away alone as much as possible 
. . . but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron picks up where she leaves off: "It's hard for either of us to decline 
meaningful, rewarding work. I mean, doing something beneficial in the world. . 
. . But it crowds our lives, so we have to struggle to find time for each other 
and for reflection." 
</P>
<P>
 The Olsons have a goal: to find an important project they can share. With 
Jane's international peace work and Ron's expertise in dispute resolution, he 
says, "we keep thinking we could bring those two areas together in a way that 
can be meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron: "A great issue like population control, for example, that we could get 
excited about and learn about and continue to grow together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "And all the kids would want to get involved, because that fits their 
interests too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron: "Wouldn't that be a really nice way to round out our lives?" Jane and Ron 
Olson 
</P>
<P>
 Ages: Jane, 52; Ron, 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives?: No; born in Iowa, living in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Community work, sports, friendships, each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane on Pasadena: "We moved here because it seemed more like the Midwest to 
us. An established community where the churches and schools were really 
community centers, where families tended to stay for generations and children 
always come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron on pro bono work: "There's a trusteeship individuals assume when they 
become lawyers. That is to help make the justice system work. Unless more 
people get adequate legal help, it's not going to work. Pro bono is part of the 
responsibility you incur when you take on your license to practice law." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane on Ron: "He's not involved in satisfying his own ego. He's absolutely 
without ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron on Jane: "I find her even more exciting today than when I first met and 
married her.";

DESTINATION: COLORADO; A MILE HIGH, AND RISING; AS DENVER REINVENTS ITSELF, 
IT'S NOT ONLY THE CITY'S SKYLINE THAT'S CHANGING. NEW ATTRACTIONS ARE VYING 
WITH THE MOUNTAINS FOR VISITORS' ATTENTION.

<P>
 It's a symphony night. The lights of the downtown skyline twinkle, the 
snow-blanketed Rockies stagger in the distance and subterranean metallic groans 
rise from the innards of the U.S. Mint in the heart of downtown. I sit a few 
blocks away in Boettcher Concert Hall, surrounded by the modern geometry of the 
Denver Performing Arts Complex, waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 On the west edge of The Plex -- that's the local language -- Cherry Creek 
trickles in darkness and the city's foremost bicycle path, beside it, lies idle 
for a change. Two long blocks to the northeast, Denverites are settling down to 
dinner in restaurants along the pedestrian 16th Street Mall, spine of downtown. 
Down in LoDo -- that's Lower Downtown -- the skeleton of a new baseball stadium 
is casting moon shadows on the surrounding scruffy neighborhood, and young 
folks are likely raising a din in a handful of brew pubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the hall, members of the Denver Brass and the Colorado Symphony Brass 
have finished with their Strauss and Gabrieli; the Mussorgsky is yet to come. 
But hold on. They've announced an addition to the program. Here comes a man 
named Lou Malandra to the microphone. With a poem. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his poem, and it's about . . . the new airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natives and Nomads," he intones. "You who build these great white 
pyramid-like tents for the travelers of the world to gather/ A paradise for 
people and planes/ Carved by your mighty arm from out of the dust/ Sweat and 
toil, your constant companions . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It continues for more than 100 lines, and Malandra, the poet laureate of 
Denver International Airport, delivers them all in a clear, loud voice. There's 
applause, and intermission, and Mussorgsky. Finally we all file out into the 
cold night, and I wander toward my hotel through downtown Denver and its 
various improvements-in-progress, trying to superimpose this experience on 
another American big city. 
</P>
<P>
 A paean to JFK airport at New York's Carnegie Hall? Variations on a theme of 
public library renovation at the Los Angeles Music Center? A BART overture at 
the San Francisco Opera House? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the difference is that those other cities have irretrievably settled 
into their identities, while Denver remains raw-boned and unfinished, 
self-conscious, boosterish, still a sort of frontier town after 135 years. Or 
maybe I just wandered into Boettcher Concert Hall on an odd night when I 
visited last April. 
</P>
<P>
 This much, anyway, is true: Denver is revising itself, amid large and 
unexpected obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most obviously, there is that enormous -- and enormously late -- new airport 
on the edge of town. (See accompanying box, right.) There is the city's 
recently arrived baseball franchise, the Rockies, which inspired spectacular 
fan support last year in its first season, then tested fans' patience by 
falling into strike idleness this year along with the rest of the major 
leagues. In 1995, 50,000-seat Coors Field is scheduled to open in Lower 
Downtown, setting in motion a scramble toward gentrification in a neighborhood 
with more than a few homeless in its alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the relocation of Elitch Gardens, an amusement park that next year 
will move its gardens, fountains and rides from a 104-year-old, 29-acre site in 
northwest Denver to a 58-acre space on the edge of downtown. City officials 
have also thrown their weight behind a $116 million cross-town light rail 
system, scheduled to open Oct. 7, despite public opinion that is divided, at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's blocking the ski slopes, anyway. Within a short westward drive or 
commuter flight (more feasible in winter) stand some of the world's most 
popular ski resorts, which become a major Denver preoccupation as fall edges 
toward winter. Vail, 119 miles west of the new airport, drew more than 1.5 
million skiers during the 1993-94 season. Breckenridge, 101 miles out, drew 1.2 
million. Keystone (91 miles), Steamboat Springs (173 miles) and Winter Park (99 
miles), each drew more than a million. Snow willing, the skiing can be relied 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, any traveler who lands here these days is bound to be surprised one way 
or another, and probably none will be more surprised than those who thought 
they already knew the place.  
</P>
<P>
 Denver began in 1859, after a few glinting flakes of gold turned up at the 
confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Enduring the usual 
challenges of fortune-hunting settlers in the West -- floods, fires, battles 
with the natives -- Denver's pioneers assembled a boom town. By the turn of the 
century, it was full of Victorian architecture and acclaimed a sophisticated 
city. These days the city's population is about 470,000, with another 1.4 
million in surrounding counties, and the boom-and-bust cycles continue: After 
exploding with development a decade ago, the city slumped severely in the late 
1980s, and began another recovery a few years ago, accompanied by the 
now-predictable arrival of fleeing Angelenos and attendant worries about 
inflated real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived on the last day of March and stayed four nights at the Brown Palace 
Hotel, an 1892 stone Victorian triangle of a building at Broadway and Tremont 
Place. It has fancy stonework, a pricey restaurant and elaborate cast-iron 
railings surrounding an atrium nine stories high. My room -- $95 a night under 
a spring weekend special -- overlooked another reminder of turn-of-the-century 
Denver, the Navarre Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Over its first 90 years, the three-story building held a boarding house, a 
gambling den, a bordello and a restaurant. Since 1983, it has held the Museum 
of Western Art and a collection of bronzes and landscapes by Albert Bierstadt, 
Charles Russell, Frederic Remington, Georgia O'Keeffe, Norman Rockwell and 
others. But step down to the basement level, and you're transported to bordello 
days: You see the remnants of a passage that ran under the street 100 years 
ago, which was purportedly used by prosperous hotel guests seeking secret 
egress and entrance into the brothel. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're downtown and have time to see only one museum in town, however, that 
one should be the Denver Art Museum. The building itself is a 10-story shell 
that resembles a medieval castle redesigned by George Jetson. Inside, it houses 
one of the world's finest collections of Native American artwork and artifacts, 
and displays it boldly and provocatively. 
</P>
<P>
 After wandering through hundreds of pre-Columbian sculptures there, and then 
scores of woodwork samples from the 19th Century, and then various 20th-Century 
displays, I found myself facing a brightly colored Warholesque image of John 
Wayne's face next to a quotation. The work, part of a temporary exhibit since 
dismantled, was titled "Wayne's World" and was made in 1992 by a Tlingit named 
Jesse Cooday. The image was fairly striking, but the artist's point lay in the 
accompanying quotation attributed to Wayne: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel we did them wrong in taking this great country from them. There 
were great numbers of people who needed new land and the Indians were selfishly 
trying to keep it for themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Two long blocks from the art museum stands Colorado's state Capitol building. 
The golden-domed structure dominates downtown, its halls full of marble and 
murals and, on the day I looked in, time-killing legislators. Though Colorado's 
legislature is in session only 120 days a year, these lawmakers were between 
meetings, and several of them had gathered around a piano in a corner of the 
paperwork-strewn meeting room to sing "Sentimental Journey" and "Has Anybody 
Seen My Gal?" Upstairs, there was a free observation deck with broad views. 
Outside, a plaque set into the Capitol steps indicated which step was precisely 
5,280 feet above sea level -- that is, a mile high. 
</P>
<P>
 (State politics, at least on the subject of sexual orientation, are more 
tranquil now than they were a year ago. Amendment 2, the ballot measure 
blocking city and state officials from making laws to protect homosexuals from 
discrimination, was approved by voters statewide in late 1992. But in December 
of last year, it was declared unconstitutional by a Denver District Court 
judge, effectively ending a nationwide campaign to boycott Colorado as a 
vacation destination.) 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Mint, at 320 W. Colfax Ave. and Delaware Street, presses out more 
than 5 billion coins yearly, stores gold bullion, stocks rare coins in its gift 
shop and issues those strange subterranean groans. (Free tours are available 
from 8 a.m.-2:45 p.m. on weekdays. Local tel. 844-3582.) 
</P>
<P>
 For shoppers, there's Larimer Square, a dolled-up historic preservation 
project with restaurants, nightclubs, art galleries and boutiques in handsome, 
12-year-old buildings of two and three stories. A block away, on 16th Street, 
stands The Shops at Tabor Center, a glass-enclosed mall with 80 resident stores 
and restaurants. The city's biggest and most upscale mall, the 140-store Cherry 
Creek Shopping Center, is in an affluent and very walkable neighborhood a few 
miles southwest of downtown and is neighbored by The Tattered Cover, one of the 
largest independent bookstores in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 For students of history, the Molly Brown House at 1340 Pennsylvania on Capitol 
Hill, shows off its 1889 stonework and exhibits inside tell the tale of the 
Denver woman whose "unsinkability" in the Titanic disaster inspired a Broadway 
musical and a film (tel. 832-4092). Across town in the down-at-the-heels Five 
Points area, the Black American West Museum at 3091 California St. is open 
Wednesday through Sunday and devoted to the story of the African American 
cowboy (tel. 292-2566). 
</P>
<P>
 For cyclists, the most prominent among scores of paths are the five-mile-long 
Cherry Creek Bike Path and the 12-mile-long Platte River Greenway, which 
intersect at Confluence Park near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 One place to rent a bike is The Bike Broker at 1440 Market St., where Ken 
Whelpdale at the counter quoted me rates of $15 for a half-day, $20 for a full 
day and $25 for a 24-hour period. Should anyone need to consult Whelpdale 
directly, he gives his official title as "head road-bike geek." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has always been an ardent sports town, heartily backing the Broncos 
and the Nuggets, and patronizing a sporting goods store -- Gart Bros., at 10th 
and Broadway, downtown -- said to be the largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later a Denver visitor runs into the original Rockies, jagged with 
boulders and white with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Climb the 93 steps to the Capitol building observation deck, look to the west 
and there they lie, beyond the ambitious columns of City Hall and the 
sharp-angled walls of the Denver Museum of Art -- and on the other side, it 
must be said, of some serious big-city smog. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 peaks in Colorado rise above 14,000 feet, and at least three are 
visible from the Capitol. (There's another broad view from the hilltop grass 
rectangle of Cranmer Park at First Avenue and Bel Aire Street, where a horizon 
map labels the most notable peaks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many Denverites say they enjoy the place most not for itself, but for the 
access it gives them to the mountains for skiing, hiking, camping, 
mountain-biking. 
</P>
<P>
 For those so inclined, there is also drinking (The Coors brewery, which offers 
free tours, is in Golden, 12 miles to the west) and casino gambling in the old 
mining towns of Central City and Blackhawk (35 miles west of Denver). 
</P>
<P>
 There's even prospecting. One morning on an aimless drive near Golden, I 
pulled off the highway at a riverside view point, and saw below an 
expressionless man with a pan, silently sifting dirt from the stream. If he was 
having any luck, he wasn't saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my mountain experience came from an afternoon and evening around 
Boulder, 30 miles northwest of downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 There the air is cleaner, the real estate costlier, the panhandlers rarer. The 
University of Colorado dominates town, and the local population is young, 
tanned and heavily equipped with in-line skates, bicycles and other implements 
of outdoor sport. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way to a late lunch, I was button-holed by a young man pushing a 
petition to legalize marijuana, and even he looked clean-cut and athletic 
enough to pass for an Air Force cadet on holiday from Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 From lunch, a friend and I zoomed out of town along Boulder Creek and into 
Roosevelt National Forest, with evergreen slopes and stone-walled cabins 
flashing by, a barn decorated with antlers and then a half-frozen reservoir, 
which a single fisherman had to himself. All this about an hour from downtown 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the worst of times, Colorado's not a bad place to be. You've got the 
mountains, and they're free," Tom Smart, a 51-year-old Denver native, told me 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably go every other weekend to bike, hike or climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, Smart said, he and his wife, Suzy Thevenet, have 
together climbed more than a dozen of the state's 14,000-foot mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, he said, there are more than 50 of them in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him I'd heard that. When we finished chatting, Smart and Thevenet 
strapped on their helmets, climbed back onto their bicycles and pedaled out of 
Larimer Square for the home stretch of the day's casual 20-mile ride. A proper 
Denver exit. GUIDEBOOK: Up to Denver

TRAVEL INSIDER: A DOOR BETWEEN YOU AND THE CHILDREN: THAT'S A SUITE; LODGING: 
BUT SOME HOTELIERS WILL CALL A STANDARD ROOM A 'MINI-SUITE' OR OTHER VARIANT ON 
THE TERM, AS LONG AS IT SELLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Silly you. You thought a hotel suite was a spacious setup with one room for 
sleeping in, another for entertaining or watching television. Between those 
rooms, there would stand a wall and a door, the better to provide refuge for 
families that want to put children in a separate room, or for business 
travelers who want to hold meetings without a bed in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers need to remember that suite is a slippery word in the hotel 
business, especially when preceded by a modifying word. Though my dictionary 
also defines a suite as "a group of connected rooms," there are many hoteliers 
out there using more liberal definitions. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe a single room as a "studio suite" or "junior suite" just because 
it has a floor plan or furniture that in some way separates the bed from the 
sitting area. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking that kind of liberty with language, a hotelier can lure even the most 
wary traveler. In the course of preparing a story on all-suites hotels last 
year, a Consumer Reports correspondent found himself in a hotel near Disney 
World, looking at a low dividing wall that separated his bed from a small area 
with a couch. Except for the low wall, the room was a standard hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we call a suite," the hotel manager told him when he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stoller, investigative editor for Conde Nast Traveler magazine, reports 
that he has been similarly "surprised and annoyed." Sometimes when he calls to 
book a suite, Stoller says, "I've had reservations people say to me, 'It's a 
small suite.' And I wonder, what does that mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, Stoller follows up with several questions about the 
lodging's dimensions. If the answers are unsatisfactory, Stoller bails out and 
finds a place elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 His example is worth following. More often than not, a junior suite is one 
room, perhaps a large room, perhaps not. An executive suite is almost 
invariably two rooms with a door that shuts between them. But then there are 
family suites and specialty suites and parlor suites and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 If a true suite is what you want, you need to ask a reservation clerk some 
specific questions about the size and shape of the space you're renting. If the 
reservation clerk doesn't know, talk to someone at the hotel's front desk, or 
find another hotel and repeat the interrogation process. Expect a broad range 
of responses from hotel to hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 At Comfort Suites hotels, for instance, a reservationist acknowledges that 
most rooms are actually "semi-suites" -- one room with a divider between the 
couch and the bed. (Rates vary depending on season and hotel location.) 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Hilton empire, director of communications Jeanne Datz says "each 
hotel kind of creates its own categories (for rooms) because every hotel is not 
built the same way." Thus rates and accommodations vary substantially, and when 
your Hilton reservationist offers a "specialty suite," that doesn't necessarily 
mean there's more than one room involved. A pleasant surprise is possible, Datz 
says. One of the "specialty suites" at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, she 
recalls, has no wall between living and sleeping area, but features two 
balconies and two bathrooms, a king bed, a dining area, a sofa-and-chairs 
living room area and a wet bar. (Standard rates: $290 nightly.) 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, the new Hotel Milano opened earlier this year offering 
"junior suites" that were essentially one large room. After measuring 
"confusion" among guests, the management backed off and reclassified those 
rooms as "deluxe." 
</P>
<P>
 James Carper, editor in chief of the trade publication Hotels magazine, takes 
an optimistic view. He suggests that the rise of all-suites properties will 
force hoteliers into a universally accepted definition of what a suite is: "two 
rooms separated by a door and not a partial wall. When you check into a 
conventional hotel and you hear the words parlor suite or junior suite , that's 
the trigger. The traveler has to ask what that means." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, says he isn't 
holding his breath. "As long as somebody sees a benefit to using the word 
'suite,' we're going to see that word misused," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel companies began developing all-suite properties 10 years ago, and more 
than a dozen brand names now compete within that specialty, usually charging 
about $100 nightly and providing such amenities as mini-kitchens with microwave 
ovens, coffee makers, glasses and dishes. Though many travelers view all-suites 
properties as business-oriented places, a spokeswoman estimates that 30%-40% of 
Embassy Suites customers are leisure travelers, often families. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest all-suite chain, with 107 hotels and 27,000 suites in North 
America, is Embassy Suites. (A spokeswoman reports that all of that chain's 
suites have separated rooms, with advertised rates running $99-$219.) Other big 
names include Homewood Suites (bedrooms and living rooms always separate; most 
rates $89-$109); Marriott's Residence Inns (usually separate rooms or loft 
layouts; rates vary widely), Guest Quarters (separate rooms; rates vary widely) 
and Crown Sterling Suites (separate rooms; rates vary widely). In July, 
respondents to a Consumer Reports satisfaction survey ranked Homewood Suites 
highest among all-suite hotels.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; A FACE LIFT FOR CHAMPS-ELYSEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Champs-Elysees was once the most celebrated avenue in Paris, the artery 
where victorious armies marched and high society shopped and dined. In recent 
years, though, the avenue changed, collecting fast-food restaurants, movie 
theaters, car showrooms and petty criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city has given a 2 1/2-year, $45-million face lift to the leafy 
1.1-mile avenue, which stretches from the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de 
Triomphe. The make-over was unveiled last week, with Mayor Jacques Chirac 
throwing the switch on 1,000 emerald green floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirac proudly claimed that the Champs-Elysees "has recovered all its prestige 
(and) the magical character which it had in the subconscious of the French and 
of foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 That verdict, ultimately, will be rendered by the rest of France and the 
world. But the street has, without doubt, undergone quite a transformation, 
with more than 227 new trees, 51 benches of tropical wood (costing more than 
$4,000 each), new bus shelters, and newspaper kiosks and street lamps designed 
in turn-of-the-century style. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest plus for the millions of French and tourists who clog the avenue 
every day are the new wide granite sidewalks. The narrow streets on either side 
of the avenue, where hapless motorists once hunted for parking spaces, are 
gone. Now, the sidewalks are 65 feet wide and parking can be found in a new lot 
built underground. SCOTT KRAFT

JUST THE FACTS; STOP THIEF! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pickpockets are using a number of ruses to distract travelers in airports, 
train stations, hotel lobbies and elevators. Here are some current favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dangerous Drunk -- A seemingly inebriated tippler staggers into a crowd 
and starts to fall.As passers-by jump to his aid, the "drunk" -- or an 
accomplice -- picks pockets and purses. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Fake Fight -- A "fight" breaks out, and while you watch, an accomplice 
lifts your wallet or your baggage. Fake "accidents" also have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Coin Con -- Bad guy No. 1 "spills" a large amount of change and as the 
traveler puts down his luggage to help pick it up, Bad Guy No. 2 snatches the 
suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Spiller -- Bad guy No. 1 "spills" coffee, ketchup, mustard, hot 
chocolate or anything that is messy all over you. Then, as he or she apologizes 
and helps you clean up the mess (and possibly picks your pockets), Bad Guy No. 
2 makes off with your untended valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bumper -- Someone bumps into you and a "helpful passerby" steadies you 
-- and cleans out your valuables. The Defense * Don't take more luggage than 
you can comfortably carry and don't accept help carrying it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't set your belongings down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be wary of all distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider wearing a money belt or carrying your valuables in a bag around 
your neck and under your clothes.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SAN FRANCISCO; THE OPERA HOUSE NEIGHBORHOOD IS JUST THE SET IN 
WHICH TO PURSUE LIFE, LIBRETTO AND HAPPINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Mott is a regular contributor to The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heading south on Sunday afternoon, 26,000 feet over San Luis Obispo and 
listening to Brahms trickling out of the airline headphones, I decided there is 
only one requirement for building a weekend trip around the San Francisco 
Opera: You have to be certifiably nuts about classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't get away from it, not if you spend your time hovering in the 
neighborhood around the opera house. It floats out of windows, seeps out of 
elevator ceilings, appears in live form suddenly in restaurants and stores, and 
on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 It animates conversation in neighborhood bars and restaurants, where the guy 
at the next table may be carrying a violin case and the majestic-looking woman 
in the lounge might be a diva. It crowds everything else off the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at this time of year particularly, when the opera season is still fairly 
fresh, it's a way of life in what is often called the Civic Center district of 
the city. There, within a radius of about four blocks, is contained not only 
the War Memorial Opera House but Davies Symphony Hall, the Herbst Theater, the 
Civic Auditorium and the headquarters of the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, the absolute imperative: Get a ticket. The opera season in San 
Francisco this year runs through Dec. 11, and several of the performances are 
already sold out. The good news is that tickets now can be charged by phone 
(call 415-864-3330).  
</P>
<P>
 There can be bad news too. I wrote early and asked for a $45 seat for the 
Saturday night opening performance of Verdi's "Il Trovatore." A letter came 
back a few days later: Sorry, sold out. I called and asked for a similarly 
priced seat for the Friday performance of Verdi's "Macbeth." Sorry, said the 
friendly ticket person on the other end. The cheapest ticket was a side 
orchestra seat at $100. I took it, a little disappointed and a few bucks 
poorer.  
</P>
<P>
 Imperative No. 2: Book a room at the Inn at the Opera. This is not the only 
place to stay within walking distance of the opera house by any means, but if 
you want to feel thoroughly plugged in to the local musical universe, it is a 
quietly elegant clearinghouse. The staff has played host to such lights as 
Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and many other operatic, symphonic and jazz 
heavyweights, and they can tell you exactly what's on and who's where on any 
particular night. They know music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived at the Inn at the Opera late Friday morning after a 9 a.m. flight 
from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, and was struck once again at the near 
perfection of the location. The Inn is a small (48 rooms, seven stories) 
European-style hotel on the south side of Fulton Street just west of Franklin, 
which means it is almost directly behind the opera house. The walk to the opera 
house lobby takes all of two minutes. The canned music in the inn's lobby is 
chamber music -- Mozart, when I arrived -- and my single room was beautifully 
decorated in light colors, with a white tile bathroom, a spacious armoire and a 
little basket filled with Braeburn apples. The clock radio on the end table was 
on when I walked in -- tuned to the local classical station. 
</P>
<P>
 I went out and headed south for Hayes Street, two blocks away. In 1983 and 
'84, when I lived in the city and sang with the San Francisco Symphony Chorus, 
I spent part of nearly every Tuesday evening at Zellerbach rehearsal hall (it's 
attached to Davies Symphony Hall) at the corner of Hayes and Franklin streets, 
and I often stopped after rehearsal for a glass of wine at the adjacent Hayes 
Street Grill. But I hadn't known that Hayes Street, and a couple of the streets 
off it, are filled with little art galleries, bookstores and, mostly, small 
restaurants of all stripes, from Caribbean (one served a curried goat dish) to 
Russian (Mad Magda's Russian Tea Room) to New York deli-style (Moishe's 
Pippic). 
</P>
<P>
 For lunch I settled in at a cozy place on Gough Street called the Blue Muse 
and ordered the first of a series of wonderful meals: the somewhat fiery pasta 
jambalaya.  
</P>
<P>
 A hike seemed in order, but I didn't get far. Just around the corner on Hayes 
is the Star Classics record, tape and compact disc store, and still more 
chamber music was wafting out of the door. At first I thought it was just a 
very good stereo system, but a sign outside indicated that it was one in a 
series of weekly Friday noontime recitals in one of the store's side rooms. A 
pair of local violists were playing duets and trios with a pianist. All were 
dressed in formal concert wear.  
</P>
<P>
 After a short nap, it was dinner time, and I had reservations at the Inn at 
the Opera's Act IV restaurant, a small, serene, deep-green-carpeted and 
dark-wood-paneled room that fills with before-and-after-opera diners. I was 
seated next to a couple who were going to the symphony that night and the opera 
the next, and we happily talked music, opera and good food. I ordered the 
chicken breast in Dijon sauce, which was nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the opera. Just mingling with the crowd -- from black tie to Levi's, 
and neither considered to be incorrectly dressed -- was electrifying, 
particularly in the high-vaulted lobby among the champagne vendors. Downstairs, 
in a large tiled buffet area, salads and desserts were for sale. Upstairs on 
the mezzanine, patrons crammed the Opera Shop, snapping up compact discs, 
printed scores, librettos and T-shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth" was unfamiliar (to me), but enjoyable, and a couple of funny 
technical gaffes by the stage crew provided some good conversation fodder for 
later at Stars restaurant up Van Ness Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars -- bustling, noisy, bright and expensive -- appears to be a favorite of 
trendier opera and symphony fans. It serves food late after the opera (as do 
several other area restaurants such as Max's Opera Cafe, also on Van Ness). I 
had one drink amid the din and fled back to the hotel and the Act IV bar and 
spent an enjoyable half an hour over a port listening to the bartender tell 
opera stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Saturday was spent tending to my take-home Italian deli needs in North 
Beach (the bus can get you there in 20 minutes for a buck) and devouring a 
plate of some of the best pasta I've had in the city at Caffe Delle Stelle in 
the opera neighborhood on Gough Street just south of Hayes. I considered 
attending a Q&A presentation at the Herbst Theater with cellist Yo Yo Ma, who 
was appearing that night at Davies Hall, but I decided to stroll and enjoy the 
perfect weather instead. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, while two friends were at Davies Hall listening to the San 
Francisco Symphony (Ma was the soloist, and the concert was a sellout), I sat 
in a deserted Ivy's restaurant on Hayes and marveled at the ghost town 
atmosphere of the neighborhood during evening performances. Tim Hunt, the owner 
and an opera news clearinghouse in his own right, told me still more opera 
stories and said he'd heard that soprano Aprile Millo, who was to sing the lead 
in "Trovatore" that night and who was staying at the Inn at the Opera, had been 
replaced at the last minute by a local singer. It turned out to be true. And 
later, at dinner with my friends, Ivy's venison was as tasty as Hunt's source 
was accurate. Budget for One

DESTINATION: FLORIDA; NEAR DISNEY WORLD, OCALA NATIONAL FOREST OFTEN CAUSES 
VISITORS TO WONDER HOW ANY PLACE SO BIG AND SO BEAUTIFUL REMAINS SO LITTLE 
KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT MACKLE, Mackle is dining critic of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are out of the motel and moving before 7 a.m., driving east in November fog 
-- out to where Silver Springs Boulevard becomes simply Florida State Road 40. 
Swooping up across the big steel bridge over the Oklawaha River, we turn left 
on Highway 314, skirting the vapor-tinged villages of Turkey Landing and 
Grahamsville, running along the edge of the Ocala National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses on patches of private land -- some of them shacks, others trim enough 
-- lurk far back from the road, their wide, deep, mostly unmowed front yards 
marked by azalea bushes, bass and gator boats, house trailers, rusty Jeeps and 
rough signs advertising fishing bait and truck repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost imperceptibly, we enter the forest preserve itself -- 430,000 acres of 
prime, north-central Florida real estate dotted with springs, trails, all-year 
campgrounds, sinkholes and the largest stand of sand pines in the world. 
Established by order of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, it's the oldest 
national forest east of the Mississippi River, the southernmost in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among guidebook-packing travelers on the Yankeeland-to-Disney World funnel 
down Interstates 75 and 95, the forest is scandalously -- nature connoisseurs 
might say fortunately -- overlooked. With not a chain motel, factory outlet 
store nor fast-food stand to boast of, it's a haven for conservationists, 
backpackers and lumberjacks alike. 
</P>
<P>
 On our way from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale for a wedding, we have but a single 
day to spend in the park. So we hurry along -- past family and youth camps at 
Fore Lake and Lake Eaton, using a full-color U.S. Forest Service map I had 
ordered by mail, searching for unpaved forest road 86. We find it after 
doubling back twice -- because the cutoff is marked NE 172 Av. Rd, following 
Marion County, not national forest, nomenclature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We get deep in the woods fast. Rows of tall, managed sand pines on each side 
of the car grow right to the edge of the scraped, yellow-sand track. After a 
mile or so, we wave at a trio of camo-clad hunters with their truck of caged, 
long-eared dogs. They wave back, friendly-like. 
</P>
<P>
 We turn onto another scraped road, then halt at signs announcing the Lake 
Eaton Sinkhole Trail. Inside two minutes, we plunge into the forest on foot, 
down a clearly marked but unfussy half-mile path, passing oaks, deer moss, 
cawing scrub jays and woodpeckers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry sinkhole -- like other sinks, lakes and springs dotting Central 
Florida -- is a result of water erosion in subterranean limestone caverns. The 
ceilings of compromised caves eventually collapse -- so we read on one of the 
markers. But most soon fill with water. At 450 feet across and located in high 
ridge country, the Lake Eaton dry hole is a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 A boardwalk and stairs lead down into the 80-foot-deep sink with its 
deep-forest ecosystem of broadleaf magnolias, live oak, pignut hickory, 
loblolly pine and sabal palm. 
</P>
<P>
 Insects are also part of the system, even in late November. Returning to the 
car on another half-mile trail -- through a managed stand of pines planted in 
1983 -- we slap gnats and mosquitoes, regretting that the repellent spray 
stayed in Atlanta. This is what natives call "Old Florida" . . . with a 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 After sand pines, the most notable feature of Ocala National Forest is its 
numerous natural springs. Salt Springs Recreation Area, 10 miles northeast of 
the Lake Eaton Sinkhole -- like the privately managed Silver Springs outside 
the national forest -- has operated as a tourist attraction for more than a 
century. A resort hotel once flourished there (the building stands just to the 
south of the parking lot). Author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings ("The Yearling," 
"Cross Creek") used to spend time in a juke joint nearby. In fact, business was 
so good that the 10,000-acre Salt Springs tract wasn't added to the national 
forest until the 1960s -- at a cost over $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name, the water is fresh. And the place is a magnet still. In late 
morning, we watch an extended family emerge from a three-axle camper and a 
battered Camaro. As we slip our $2.25 day-use fees through a slot at the 
shuttered gatehouse, we overhear the elders loudly convincing each other that 
payment is unnecessary in winter -- though a sign clearly states otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring is worth whatever it takes. A concrete path leads to a 
walled-at-one-end semi-tropical pool surrounded by live oaks and palmettos. 
From the edge -- through water transparent as cellophane -- we gaze down past 
hovering largemouth bass, bream and mullet into deep, rock-lined holes. Clear, 
clean water flows up from what are called boils at a rate of 52 million gallons 
a day. The temperature is a constant 72 degrees. The "salts" in this lightly 
mineralized water include sodium, potassium, silica and magnesium. 
</P>
<P>
 There is camping and, in season, swimming. At the open end of the spring-fed 
pool, paths skirt a fishing area and marina. Beyond is the run, or open creek, 
to Lake George. 
</P>
<P>
 Though craving to stay, we quickly snap pictures and move on to Salt Springs 
visitors center, one of three in the forest. Maps, brochures, books and 
interpretive displays (the P.C. term for stuffed wildlife) are standard, as are 
crusty rangers, many of them female, and volunteer interpreters, most elderly 
natives of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 While buying raw honey and dark cane syrup as edible souvenirs, we chat with 
the staff and pore over maps and pamphlets, planning the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to choose. The Florida National Scenic Trail passes nearby -- 67 
marked miles, about 50 ponds, numerous stands of forest and plenty of campsites 
that are part of what's intended as a 1,000-mile scenic path running from the 
state's Panhandle to the Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 We've done our mile. Nor can we partake of horseback rides, rental boats, 
nature lectures or rec-vee electrical hookups. 
</P>
<P>
 At the nearby Salt Spring Seafood Restaurant, we check out fried catfish, 
broiled snapper, hush puppies, sweet tea and slaw. Catering to hunters and 
outdoors folks, the restaurant's menu offers local fare such as frog legs, 
turtle and alligator. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning south again, we pass former town sites such as Pat's Island. Author 
Rawlings used one local family's experiences as the basis of "The Yearling," 
her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that subsequently became two movies. Pat's 
Island was later leveled when the U.S. Department of Agriculture took over the 
land. Today, the Forest Service provides public recreation and timber in what 
seems like equal measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the recommendation of forest ranger Patricia Draheim, we check out 
Silver Glen Springs, a spot she described, with a catch in her throat, as "one 
of the prettiest places on this planet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Make it two planets. Silver Glen, ringed by cedars, Spanish-moss-infested oaks 
and tall palmetto trees, is archetypal, picture-postcard stuff. A two-acre 
circular pond opens out onto its larger mate. Near the bank, turtles sun 
themselves on fallen tree trunks. Coots hoot. A young blue heron finds lunch 
among the water plants. And -- just beneath the surface of the water under 
clear gray skies -- bass and fat mullet cruise atop a series of big blue boils 
that open down, down into rich, slightly sinister, unseen springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other couple is there -- the equivalent, in today's overpopulated 
Sunshine State -- of desert island life. 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting the map in a happy haze of overstimulation, we pick out Alexander 
Springs as the next destination on blind impulse. Heading south again, then 
east, then south -- on surprisingly good blacktopped roads -- I yammer that 
nothing, nowhere can top Silver Glen as the earth's prettiest spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander Springs beats the whole solar system. This relatively small, 
dark pool lies hidden in dense forest, tightly ringed with towering oaks, 
cypress, cedar, sweet gum and palmetto. Near a modest beach, old people and 
young swim and splash (scuba and snorkeling are possible) in what amounts to a 
flashback of Ponce de Leon's dreamy Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the changing rooms and concession stand, a series of paths and 
boardwalks parallels a run through deep forest. Signs along the way explain and 
identify forest products that sustained native Americans, including wild 
grapes, coontie (Indian arrowroot), hickory nuts and fine, blue-gray clay that 
was used to make ceramic cooking pots. 
</P>
<P>
 My camera's light meter reminds us of Pat Draheim's warning: that no visitor 
can begin to see the national forest in a day. So we compromise: We'll hit the 
park early the next morning, move fast and arrive in Lauderdale on the late 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 We decide not to chance the return to the motel over a long dirt road through 
the famous Big Scrub area. Safely skirting the forest instead pays off like 
Lotto when we pass a flock of five sandhill cranes cavorting in a new-mown hay 
field on the southern edge of the blacktop. We spend the night in a Holiday Inn 
smack across the road from Silver Springs -- the latter costs $20 per person, 
per well-scripted, heavily promoted visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Next morning at 8 a.m. -- more fog and gray sky -- we greet the ranger at the 
gate to Juniper Springs Recreation Area. Having visited the site a year 
earlier, we look forward to a second stop at the millhouse, waterwheel and 
spring-fed swimming hole constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 But we're hardly out of the car when Eden is invaded by a vandal with a 
machine. A young girl -- perhaps 12, with no parents or guardians in sight -- 
destroys the misty stillness by riding a mini-motorbike through the hovering 
oaks and onto the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we become suddenly aware of a grown man putting his kayak into the 
Juniper Springs Run. In the cool drizzle, he's making pained, overheated "Uh, 
uh, uh" sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ranger station the day before, we had learned that volunteer clean-up 
crews often find mounds of family garbage tossed out in nature's face -- 
including old steel bed frames and large car parts. Earlier, at the bottom of 
the dry Lake Eaton Sinkhole, we ourselves spotted a used condom and its wrapper 
alongside empty beer bottles and other picnic leavings. 
</P>
<P>
 The adolescent snake on the mini-motorbike -- faced with our fierce, 
peace-loving stares -- turns back. The man in the kayak departs without 
suffering a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 We tramp out to the exquisite, pocket-size Fern Hammock Springs tucked in the 
woods down Juniper Creek. A Conservation Corps-style covered fire pit lies 
hidden in trees there and a rustic wood bridge rises directly above the 
"boiling" -- though contradictorily tranquil -- water. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bridge, we look down through liquid crystal to hovering fish, 
polished rocks and grains of white sand.  
</P>
<P>
 In the springs's smoothly rushing current, the gently rising and falling sand 
seems to puff, to float, to breathe almost. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a long while we stand silently, gazing down into the clean center of 
the living earth. GUIDEBOOK

AIRPORT TO OPEN FEB. 28, MAYBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Its debut was to have been Oct. 31, 1993. That day, workers were scheduled to 
open the doors, runways and first-of-its-kind automated baggage delivery system 
of the sprawling, state-of-the-art Denver International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. Mostly because of snafus in that automated baggage delivery 
system, the airport's opening date has been delayed again and again. Each delay 
prolonged the working life of Stapleton Airport (on the other side of town), 
cost the city either $500,000 or $1 million per day (depending on how you 
counted lost revenues and bond interest payments) and inspired many jokes about 
the project's tardiness, inefficiency and what the letters D.I.A. might stand 
for (one favorite: Done In Awhile ). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, city officials decided to start work on a back-up baggage delivery 
system (one that uses traditional technology) while BAE Automated Systems Inc., 
continued its efforts to get the new automated system working right. (The 
automated baggage system, plagued by both computer software and mechanical 
problems, relies on 3,500 "telecars" circulating on 21 miles of track, along 
with another 10 miles of conveyor belts.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new target date for the airport opening: Feb. 28, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 By that day, says DIA spokesman Steve Klodt, city contracts call for the 
automated luggage delivery system (cost so far: $193 million) to be up and 
running.  
</P>
<P>
 If it isn't, the city has a contract with another firm to have the back-up 
baggage delivery system (which could run as much as $50 million) fully 
operational by Dec. 31, 1994. Thus, if the automated system falters again, the 
back-up system operators would have had two months of testing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Total estimated cost of the new airport: $3.2 billion ($501 million to be 
covered by federal funds).  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one of the facility's principal users, Continental Airlines, has 
been substantially reducing its Denver presence. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline in the last year has cut its number of Denver departures from 
about 200 daily to an anticipated 23 daily beginning in November. CHRISTOPHER

DESTINATION: PENNSYLVANIA; JUST WONDER-FALL; FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S FALLINGWATER 
STILL LOOKS LIKE A HOME, NOT THE MUSEUM IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN FORGEY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fallingwater, the quintessential house in the woods, never ceases to astonish 
and delight. Nestled just so in the dappled light of the forest, extended 
breathtakingly over the fall of a backwoods creek, it is a wonder full of 
wonders, a weekend retreat that is as thrilling in its way as any great 
cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived in 1935 by Frank Lloyd Wright, America's indubitable architectural 
genius, it was enjoyed for nearly three decades by the adventurous Pittsburgh 
family for whom it was built. Then, in 1963, it began its second career as a 
public trust -- becoming, in the words of one Wright scholar, "perhaps the 
best-known private home for someone not of royal blood in the history of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Well might the keepers of Washington's Mount Vernon and Jefferson's Monticello 
dispute this tentative assertion, but it's true Fallingwater is unique. We 
honor this southwestern Pennsylvania home not because of who lived there or who 
visited but because Wright designed it at the very peak of his creativity. The 
house he created is comfortable and ingenious and, in ways small and large, 
elevating. 
</P>
<P>
 This by no means is to deny the importance of Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann, 
whose house it was. Design-conscious owners of Pittsburgh department stores, 
they deserve everlasting thanks for commissioning Wright as architect, for 
paying to get the house built -- it cost more than $120,000, nearly four times 
the initial estimate -- and simply for getting through with humor intact the 
oft-tiresome trial of dealing with the great artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their son and only child, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., likewise deserves enormous 
credit. As a young man he apprenticed briefly at Wright's famous studio, 
Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wis., and therefore was able to introduce his 
parents to the architect. 
</P>
<P>
 He donated the house and surrounding land to a trust in 1963, together with an 
endowment for upkeep. And he oversaw the property with a sympathetic eye until 
his death in 1989, insisting always that it be kept as accessible as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the Kaufmanns' occupancy abound in the house turned museum. Artworks 
the couple bought for the house -- including African wood carvings, Chinese 
lacquers, American ceramics, a drawing by Diego Rivera, a bronze by Jacques 
Lipchitz -- remain in their preferred places. A large oil portrait of a robust 
Edgar Sr. still commands a view of the dining area. The rustic Italian chairs 
that Liliane Kaufmann liked -- and Wright didn't -- still surround the dining 
table. Guides on the 45-minute tours don't fail to point out that the three 
wooden legs make the chairs more stable on the rough stone floor than 
four-legged chairs would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the fact that hundreds of visitors trudge through each day, 
the house retains a lived-in charm, as if awaiting the momentary return of its 
original owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though today's guests are forbidden to sit on them, the cushions of Wright's 
built-in sofas are covered with the same kind of richly woven beige material as 
always, and the stone floors of the spacious living-dining room are decorated 
with the same kind of warm-toned Berber rugs. This naturalness was what Edgar 
Jr. wanted, explains chief curator Lynda Waggoner: "It's supposed to look like 
a house, not a state museum." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If one were to make a list of things to remember about Fallingwater, it might 
start with the floors, if only to prove the point that every aspect of the 
design is interconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of irregularly shaped slabs of "Pottsville" sandstone -- the stone used 
throughout the house, and quarried on the property -- the floors are appealing 
to the eye and touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had the stones waxed to look as if they were under a shallow, rippling 
current of clear water, an apt reference to currents of the stream running 
under the house and a subtle metaphor for the philosophy behind the entire 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallingwater is perhaps the most compelling manifestation of Wright's belief 
that architecture is not opposed to nature but, rather, is another facet or 
expression of nature and its processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he sensed the potential of the site when the Kaufmanns first took 
him to their picturesque corner of the woods: They liked to stand on a rock 
ledge and look at the waterfall and they thought, conventionally, that a house 
should do the same. Wright, by contrast, seized the opportunity to make the 
house part of the waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The forces that hold Fallingwater up, that make possible its stupendous 
cantilevered balconies, are but natural forces properly understood and 
correctly built with reinforced concrete.  
</P>
<P>
 The persistent doubts that Wright's imagination outstripped his command of 
structural engineering have recently been put to rest, Waggoner reports, by 
exhaustive engineering studies that confirm the house is structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean there aren't problems. For one thing, Fallingwater leaks. 
Water -- melting snow and rain -- reportedly gets in through the roof, the 
walls, sometimes even the floor under which the stream known as Bear Run flows. 
</P>
<P>
 This keeps workers busy year-round shoveling snow off the roof, mopping, 
patching leaks and making more substantive repairs. But given the fact that 
Fallingwater is a 60-year-old house with a flat roof, built to nestle in close 
communion with nature, many achitects seem to feel that it has actually held up 
quite well.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Wright, cantilevering was a philosophy as well as a structural system. He 
used it here wherever he could. Fallingwater's bookshelves and display shelves 
and even the metal arm holding the great round pot above the fire are 
cantilevered too. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably no great house has ever had such an inconspicuous entryway as that at 
Fallingwater. The doorway is hidden away, as if by accident of nature, and it 
is dark and narrow, as if the house were a cave. Wright was known for his 
sheltered entryways, and this is the most sheltered of them all. It is the 
beginning of a spatial flow of surprise and discovery that is the most wondrous 
of Fallingwater's wonders. One moves constantly from closed to open, inside to 
outside, dark to light and back again. It's refreshing and spirit-lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way there are opportunities to pause in such marvels as the corner 
niche that Edgar Jr. used as his study. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the third floor of the vertical part of the house -- a strong 
counterbalance to a composition of sweeping horizontals -- the little room is 
in itself a study of shadows and lights. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a built-in desk with a quarter-circle cut in its top to accommodate an 
inward-opening casement window. Right next to that, there's a corner made 
top-to-bottom of casement windows that open outward so that, when they're 
opened, the corner seems to disappear before your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tours are pleasantly paced, the guides friendly and knowledgeable. The 
thing they do best is make you want to come back soon. GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Falling for Fallingwater 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Fallingwater is about two hours' driving time from Pittsburgh 
via Interstate 70/76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike), then south on Pennsylvania Route 
381. The house is halfway between the villages of Mill Run and Ohiopyle.  
</P>
<P>
 Dates, hours, rules: Fallingwater is open six days a week to mid-November, 10 
a.m.-4 p.m. Closed Mondays. Weekend tours are available from mid-November 
through March, weather permitting (weekday winter tours only by special 
arrangement). Weekday admission is $6 per person, weekends $10. Two-hour 
"in-depth" tours are offered at 8:30 a.m., by advance reservation only, at $25 
per person. Still photography inside the house is permitted only on these 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since considerable walking and numerous steps are involved," says the 
Fallingwater brochure, "some elderly people and those with medical problems may 
find the tour too strenuous." The first floor of the house is 
wheelchair-accessible, and there is a video showing the upper floors. Children 
under 9 years old are not permitted on the house tours. There is a child-care 
center on the property, available at $2 per child per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations: Do not go without them. Wright's popularity continues to climb, 
and with it, attendance at Fallingwater. Tours are running near capacity 
year-round, and October is a BIG month. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The Nemacolin Woodlands Resort (412-329-8555) in Farmington is, 
as the name implies, a complete package. An 800-acre estate, it offers golf (18 
holes), tennis, swimming, croquet and hiking, in addition to rooms in the inn 
and condominium units. Rates range $195-$395 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mount Summit Inn (412-438-8594), on a mountaintop near Farmington, is a 
resort destination offering a similar range of activities, including a 
nine-hole golf course. Dating to 1907, the inn has rates of $69-$131 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Failinger's Gunter Hotel (301-689-6511), in Frostburg, Md., is a find and a 
bargain. A mid-town hotel dating to 1897, it has been restored to (almost) 
former glory by Kermit and Thelma Failinger, known to all of Frostburg as Jake 
and Beanie. The lobby's sweeping oak staircase is a step back in time. Rates 
are $45-$55 per night.

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; THE GLORY DAYS HAVE PASSED. 
WHAT DO INVESTORS DO NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not quite 11 years old, the Wayne Hummer Growth stock mutual fund has never 
had a losing year. But with three months left to go in 1994, portfolio manager 
Tom Rowland knows his winning streak is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The $94-million fund closed the third quarter off about 1% for the third 
quarter off about 1% for the year to date. Like many U.S. fund managers, 
Rowland has found it difficult to make much headway for his shareholders in a 
U.S. stock market beset by rising interest rates, inflation jitters and 
increasing competition from other types of investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse for Hummer investors, this is the second consecutive year of 
disappointing results. Last year, the Chicago-based fund eked out a mere 3.6% 
rise, barely above the rate of inflation and far below the double-digit returns 
that fund owners have come to expect since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland is struggling through a market phase that Wall Street has long been 
anticipating -- and fearing. After the wild bull market of the 1980s, wringing 
big gains out of U.S. stocks now is a tough order. 
</P>
<P>
 What ails the market is not so straightforward as to merely be labeled a bear 
cycle, experts say. Academics call it something else: "regression to the mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, because investors enjoyed such huge returns on U.S. stocks from 
1975-1989, it's logical to assume that a lengthy period of overall weak 
performance -- encompassing both bull and bear markets -- may ensue in the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 That would ensure that the average annual return on stocks over, say, the 
1970-to-2000 period would be in line with the longer-term mean -- which, 
theoretically, is the best return you can reasonably expect from the market 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regression to the mean is a statistical inevitability," says Robert Markman, 
whose Markman Capital in Minneapolis directs $265 million in client assets in 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't make it easier for investors to swallow. Indeed, the 
possibility of sub-par returns for an extended period on U.S. stocks -- perhaps 
5% to 8% annually, compared to 17% a year during the 1980s -- poses a 
monumental challenge for the $2-trillion mutual fund industry, which has 
attracted an unprecedented number of individual investors since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most fund owners profess to be "long-term" holders, the industry's fear 
is that investors may not easily tolerate poor returns -- let alone the 20% to 
50% losses that a traditional, drawn-out bear market could bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally worrisome is the response of portfolio managers to the forces of 
regression. As competition to attract and retain dollars grows more intense, 
many U.S. fund managers are already looking to potentially higher-risk 
securities to beef up returns and gain an edge over rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 While some may succeed, the strategy threatens to place more fund managers -- 
and their shareholders -- at greater risk of severe volatility and loss than 
either party may fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock fund managers "are going to be pushing out the envelope in terms of 
acceptable behavior," predicts Don Phillips, publisher of fund tracker 
Morningstar. It's Real, All Right 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the contraction of U.S. stock returns so far in the '90s has 
hardly been disastrous for most funds or their investors, even though the 
average U.S. general stock fund is down 0.5% year to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, key market measures show that regression of returns is real: 
</P>
<P>
 * An index of 30 major growth stock funds tracked by Lipper Analytical 
Services has risen 56.7% since Dec. 31, 1989, a period encompassing nearly five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market holds basically steady for the next three months, the growth 
fund index's gain for the first half of the '90s will be the smallest for any 
half-decade period in 30 years, except for the severe bear market period 
1970-74. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using a broader measure of fund performance -- Lipper's general stock fund 
average -- three of the last five calendar years (including 1994, to date) have 
produced returns below the 10.3% average annualized total return on the 
blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since 1925, as calculated by 
Ibbotson Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The total return on the S&P index itself since Dec. 31, 1989, is about 54%, 
compared to 152% for 1985-89 and 99% for 1980-84 and also for 1975-79. 
</P>
<P>
 Although measuring the market over calendar-year periods is naturally 
arbitrary, it's worth noting that in each of the aforementioned five-year 
periods (including the latest) the market experienced both bull and bear 
phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it isn't fair to view stocks' returns in a vacuum. Earning 57% 
since 1989 has still beaten inflation and bank CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, for the first time since the late 1980s, other investments are 
providing real competition for stocks. Money market funds, for example, now 
yield 4.3% on average, and that yield is rising at the fastest pace since 1988. 
One-year Treasury bills pay 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities, including gold, are attracting increasing attention from 
investors as prices rise with the global economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 As these rival investments gain altitude, they may challenge the preeminent 
position that U.S. stocks have held in the public's mind for the past decade. 
At the very least, better returns on other investments will act like an 
unwanted magnifying glass on U.S. stock funds' shrinking returns. An 
Explanation 
</P>
<P>
 If regression to the mean is happening in the U.S. market, there should be a 
fundamental explanation. It's not enough to say that stock returns should be 
lower in the '90s just because.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most logical explanation is that the phenomenal '80s bull market, 
and its successor in the early '90s, were so powerful that they have pushed 
U.S. stocks to levels that reflect much or all of the good earnings news on the 
horizon for most U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the United States' competitive position in the world is again 
top-rung, the market's job is to anticipate, Wall Street pros note. That may 
mean that stock prices, on average, now fairly reflect the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the principal force behind stocks' huge returns since 1980 wasn't 
corporate earnings growth, but the worldwide plunge in interest rates, which 
drove many investors into stocks for lack of better income alternatives. U.S. 
money market rates declined from 20% to 2.5% between 1980 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Now interest rates are climbing again as the world economy revs up. Higher 
rates raise the cost of doing business (thereby cutting into corporate 
earnings) and provide new competition for stocks in the form of more lucrative 
returns on bonds and CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some experts aren't convinced that lower U.S. stock gains are a fait 
accompli in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 John Markese, executive director of the American Assn. of Individual Investors 
in Chicago, argues that while returns should indeed regress over time, the 
question is what the true historical mean return on stocks really is. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69-year average annual return of 10.3% on the S&P index would be a fine 
benchmark "if the financial structure of the economy has stayed the same," 
Markese says. "But it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, U.S. companies are vastly more global in scope today than even 
20 years ago; if foreign economies grow faster than the U.S. in the future, as 
expected, U.S. firms that sell worldwide may reap bigger profit gains than the 
market now anticipates, and stocks' returns could be larger accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have enough data (from the modern economy) to say there's any 
kind of pattern in stock returns," Markese argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the relatively low returns on U.S. stock benchmarks so far in the 
'90s have persuaded many investors to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scrambling to find investments with higher rates of return," says 
Budge Collins, whose Collins Associates in Newport Beach specializes in 
"alternative" investments for big clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common route that U.S. stock funds have followed so far is to add 
shares of foreign-based companies, whose growth prospects may be greater than 
that of their U.S. counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the extent of U.S. fund managers' international diversification 
efforts may surprise investors who thought they owned fairly plain-vanilla 
American securities, Robert Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.2-billion Twentieth Century Growth fund, for example, while 
historically a U.S. stock investor, now has nearly a quarter of its assets in 
foreign stocks. That's up from 4% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our charter is still to be a domestic growth fund, but we now have the 
capability to screen the entire globe (for stocks) the way we would the United 
States," says fund co-manager Chris Boyd.  
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting, of course, that many individuals have been rushing directly 
into foreign stocks via international stock funds this year, making the same 
judgment that U.S. fund managers have made: that richer opportunities lie 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search for bigger returns, other U.S. fund managers have skewed their 
portfolios more heavily toward smaller-company stocks. Tom Rowland's Hummer 
Growth fund, for example, is about 35%-invested in smaller stocks now, 
"probably double what it was four or five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But where higher returns are expected, by definition the risk is also higher.  
</P>
<P>
 Money market funds offer a sobering example of what can go wrong when managers 
reach for return. Dozens of the funds have suffered sharp losses this year on 
so-called derivative securities, most of which were purchased to augment the 
low yields that prevailed in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 For stock funds, the often painful reality is that the more obscure the 
security -- whether foreign or American -- the greater the chance that no other 
buyer will be found if bad news hits. That can lead to abrupt and deep price 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
 A Greater Burden 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar's Don Phillips views the decision of some U.S. fund managers to 
chase higher returns as "neither good nor bad by itself." The issue is whether 
shareholders of a particular fund understand what the manager is doing -- and 
are comfortable with it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have to realize as a shareholder is that you may now have a 
different product from the old blue-chip stock fund," Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, all of this puts a much greater burden on individuals to monitor 
their stock funds more closely. Regardless of how your fund has performed 
recently, ask yourself a few basic questions to determine whether it is still 
right for you: 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the manager have a clear strategy -- and is he or she sticking with it? 
Perhaps more simply, do you have faith that you have invested with a good 
stock-picker who can excel in a market where opportunities may be fewer? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you know what kinds of stocks the fund can own and whether its parameters 
have changed much since you bought? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are the fund's management fees reasonable for the performance you get? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are you diversified among different U.S. stock funds -- i.e., some 
higher-risk, some lower-risk? Or are all of your funds too similar in risk 
characteristics? 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, if the idea of regressing U.S. stock returns causes you Angst, are 
you diversified enough among other investments (foreign stocks, bonds, real 
estate, gold, CDs) to assure that your portfolio will usually have something 
going for it? How Returns Have Fallen 
</P>

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; JUMPING SHIP; 
UNDER-PERFORMANCE ANGST ? A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Will stock mutual fund investors sit still for sub-par returns? Should they? 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of many growth funds that target big-name consumer stocks, many 
of which have stagnated since 1991, is that the majority of investors stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 Assets of Vanguard's U.S. Growth Fund, for example, are near a record high 
even though the fund has barely advanced since '91. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, many fund owners have invested for retirement and know that stocks 
perform better than any other major investment long-term. So holding on through 
bad times seems logical enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But inertia also plays a big role, experts say. "It's psychological," says Avi 
Nachmany, analyst at fund research firm Strategic Insight in New York. "Nobody 
wants to tell their spouse: 'I made a mistake. Let's sell.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Nachmany says, fund performance so far in the 1990s has been 
mediocre at worst. There has yet to be a drawn-out, deep bear market that 
leaves stock funds far in the red. That will be a much greater test for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some investors have already lost patience. Assets of the Twentieth 
Century Growth fund, for example, peaked at $5 billion in February, 1993. 
Today, after three dull years, the fund holds $4.2 billion, and only a small 
part of that decline is market depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Boyd, co-manager of the fund, says that despite a "sobering" few years 
for growth-stock investors, "eventually stock prices will follow earnings" 
higher. Noting the fund's superior returns over its 36-year history, Boyd says, 
"I have every confidence that we can outperform (the market average) over any 
long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't be disappointed if you have a few mediocre years," says Don 
Phillips at fund research firm Morningstar Inc. Various investing styles, such 
as growth-stock investing, periodically wane, then roar back, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The important question is whether your fund consistently under-performs its 
peers in both bull and bear market phases. If that has been the case for five 
or six years, then the decision to sell and find a better fund should be much 
easier, Phillips says. TOM PETRUNO

 Some of the mutual fund industry's major growth-stock funds produced 
relatively low returns in 1992 and '93 and so far this year are in negative 
territory or up only slightly. But at most of these funds, assets haven't 
declined much, indicating that most shareholders have stayed put.

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; STOCK FUNDS; SUMMER LEFT THEM 
TANNED AND RESTED, BUT NOW WHAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street's surprise summer rally pulled most stock fund owners' feet out of 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The average general stock fund jumped 5.7% in the third quarter ended Friday, 
after tumbling 5.8% in the first half of the year, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the typical U.S. stock fund is down just 0.5% year to date -- 
hardly the bear market casualty that some investment pros had expected to see 
by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign stock funds that target emerging markets also saw a big comeback in 
the quarter, rising 18.5% on average after a 12.6% dive in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 General international funds, meanwhile, gained 3.4% in the quarter and are up 
3.2% for the year. That means they're well on their way to a second consecutive 
year of beating the average U.S. stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other fund categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold funds rebounded 15.3% in the quarter on average, after slumping 11.4% 
in the first half. Economic growth has fanned inflation worries, always good 
for gold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small-company funds were up 8.6% for the quarter, leading the market up just 
as they led it down in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care funds soared 14.0% on average, responding in part to Congress' 
inability to enact health care reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Japanese stock funds were the only big losers in the quarter, down 6.5% in 
profit taking after a 28.6% first-half gain. 
</P>
<P>
 While surging interest rates had knocked the U.S. stock market to its knees in 
winter and spring, buyers took control again in summer. The market rallied even 
as rates rose further. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock fund investors themselves were greatly responsible for the summer 
comeback: Despite wild market swings this year, investors have continued to 
pump cash into funds at a strong pace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many on Wall Street contend that stocks are defying gravity. Long- and 
short-term interest rates are two full percentage points higher today than at 
their 20- to 30-year lows 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, at 462.69 on Friday, is only 
marginally below its year-ago level. Historically, rising interest rates often 
prompt investors to significantly cut the prices they're willing to pay for 
stocks. Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "the stock market is way ahead of itself in valuation," says 
Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street bulls have another view: that investors are responding to rising 
corporate earnings as the economy grows. Though stock prices are roughly even 
with those of a year ago, higher earnings this year mean prices are lower 
versus earnings, thereby offsetting some of the effect of rising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the optimists say that if the latest surge in interest rates does 
not reverse soon, stocks could be headed for new trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tension between the bond market and the equity market has yet to be 
resolved," said Stephen Doyle, head of Montgomery Asset Management in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 If rates go higher from here, of course, stocks could tumble again. If rates 
fall, stocks may rally -- unless investors fear a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 One big bull is Ron Elijah, whose San Francisco-based Robertson Stephens Value 
Plus fund is up 16.3% this year thanks to well-timed investments in health care 
and technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He compares this year's overall flat market to 1984, when worries about 
inflation and rising interest rates gripped investors and stocks stalled after 
rocketing in 1982 and '83. But as economic growth moderated in 1985, rates came 
down again and the bull market resumed, Elijah notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper has a different forecast. He sees a good chance that the market won't 
accommodate the bulls or the bears anytime soon. Imagine, for example, if 
interest rates rise slowly with the expanding world economy in 1995 while 
corporate earnings also advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic function of the market is to create humility," Lipper said. If 
the market careens through periodic rallies and selloffs but in the end makes 
little progress, "it will frustrate the hell out of the bulls and the bears." 
Such a prolonged comeuppance for both camps may be overdue, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For fund investors looking for new opportunities, the way to play that kind of 
environment would probably be to continue to buy on the selloffs -- a strategy 
that worked well in the third quarter with emerging-market, small-stock and 
gold funds in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if U.S. stocks on average can't get their motors revving, 
long-term investors will increasingly look for alternative stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Gregory, editor of the No Load Fund Analyst newsletter, says he is 
advising clients with a two- to three-year time horizon to focus new investment 
in funds that target emerging markets, international small stocks and real 
estate issues -- all areas that he believes should outperform U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors in general U.S. stock funds, this is one period when looking to 
recent fund standouts may not be a bad strategy. Managers who do well in this 
push me-pull you market are either very smart or very lucky or both.

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; BOND FUNDS; FOR THE 
DISILLUSIONED INVESTOR, FEW PLACES TO HIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bond mutual fund owners got no respite in the third quarter: Market interest 
rates kept rising with the growing economy, and the result is that most bond 
funds are deeper in the hole for 1994 than most stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper Analytical Services' calculation of the average total return on 
fixed-income funds this year is a negative 3%. That means that even after 
counting interest earned for the last nine months, the typical bond fund 
owner's $100 investment on Jan. 1 is worth $97 now. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the average general stock fund is down 0.5% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for bond investors this year has been a lack of places to hide. In 
the stock market, some categories of equities are usually rising while others 
are falling. But for bonds, when market interest rates rise, all bonds tend to 
depreciate, though at different speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who have stuck with long-term bond funds this year have seen their 
principal hammered hardest, because prices of those bonds crumble fastest as 
market yields rise. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because no one wants to buy, say, a 6% bond that matures in 20 years 
when new 20-year bonds are paying 7%. The market slashes the price of the 6% 
bond to artificially make the yield competitive with new bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 For shorter-term securities, however, depreciation isn't as severe, even when 
interest rates rise as rapidly as on longer-term bonds. The faster a bond 
matures, the less fearful investors are of holding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Fidelity Short-Term Bond fund is down just 2.0% so far this year in 
total return, while the Fidelity Government Securities bond fund, which owns 
longer-term issues, has dropped 5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem is that certain so-called derivative securities in 
some bond funds have blown up, deepening losses. Often, derivatives were used 
to make leveraged bets on interest rate trends; fund managers who guessed wrong 
paid a heavy price. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, their shareholders did. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question any suffering bond investor cares about now is: Will 
interest rates stop rising soon? 
</P>
<P>
 There are still optimists, though it's worth noting that many of them also 
thought rates were finished rising in June.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the 30-year Treasury bond yield is at a 27-month high of 7.81% now 
compared to 7.61% at the end of June and 6.35% on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond bulls' classic error this year has been to underestimate both the 
economy's strength and the Federal Reserve Board's resolve to rein in that 
strength by driving rates up. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some point, bond yields should reach levels that prove irresistible to 
investors, bringing buyers in and starting the process of pushing rates down, 
or at least stabilizing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Grannis, economist at $12-billion Western Asset Management in Pasadena, 
believes long-term yields are indeed in the process of peaking after one of the 
most dramatic bond selloffs in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say this is the absolute top, but we think it has gone about far 
enough," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond market bears say such arguments are nonsensical. Interest rates are 
nowhere near their peaks, the bears say, because the global economy is nowhere 
near its peak of growth in this cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Brouwer, whose firm Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco directs mutual 
fund investments for individuals, believes that U.S. interest rates are in a 
new rising cycle, after a 13-year declining cycle. This is no time to own very 
long-term bonds, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the jump in short-term yields this year, Brouwer notes, "There are plenty 
of things you can do now if you need your money producing at least a 5% 
return." One-year Treasury bills, for example, yield 5.9%; a two-year T-note 
pays 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that level of virtually risk-free return, it's just not worth the 
principal risk of buying longer-term issues for an extra point or two in 
interest, Brouwer says.

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; EXPENSE RATIOS; THE UPKEEP 
CAN BE COSTLY 
</P>

<P>
 Every bit counts during tough times, which explains why mutual fund expenses 
are taking on added meaning in the current flat investment climate.  
</P>
<P>
 At times like these, the size of a fund's expenses can mean the difference 
between winding up in the plus or minus column, because expenses directly 
reduce a fund's performance numbers. All funds are required to report their 
expenses in a standard manner, which makes for quick and easy comparisons. 
Expenses are most commonly represented as a percentage of total assets -- the 
so-called expense ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find this number in the fund's prospectus or disclosure documents, as 
well as in research publications. The Times is including expense ratios in 
today's quarterly mutual fund tables.  
</P>
<P>
 The expense ratio summarizes the costs for professional management, 
diversification, record-keeping, asset safekeeping, fund-switching privileges 
and an assortment of other services. The annual cost is often less than a penny 
for every $1 invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a fund will waive expenses in a bad year to help the fund's overall 
performance, or because expenses were low and the fund decides to pass the 
savings to investors. For example, the Franklin Equity Income Fund described on 
T-4 charged 0.79% in its last fiscal year, though it could have charged 1.12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, expense ratios have not been going down despite increases in fund 
assets. Generally, critics charge, it doesn't cost twice as much to manage $80 
million in assets as $40 million in assets -- but a 1% expense charge yields 
twice as much money on the larger fund than the smaller.  
</P>
<P>
 Differences among funds remain as wide as ever. Some bond or index funds 
charge shareholders less than 0.5% a year, while a few charge over 3%.  
</P>
<P>
 Extremely high or low expenses clearly can make a difference. But there's some 
debate as to how important expense ratios are for more common portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Johnstone, a managing director at Fidelity Investments, notes that 
expenses have already been subtracted from the performance numbers, so 
investors should be sure not to count them twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Berliner, chairman of Westmount Asset Management in Los Angeles, says 
he compares a fund's expense ratio to group averages, but he doesn't make it an 
overriding consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the same classes of bonds, the difference in performance is almost 
always due to a difference in expenses," Berliner says.  
</P>
<P>
 Expense ratios do not include brokerage commissions and other trading costs -- 
though such costs are reflected in overall performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Expenses do include 12b-1 fees, often used in broker-sold funds as a kind of 
long-term commission or to pay for marketing.

MUTUAL FUNDS: THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW FOR INVESTORS; FIVE WAYS TO FIGHT FLAT 
RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you are frustrated by the stock market's lackluster performance, you 
don't have to throw in the towel. You can earn respectable returns on mutual 
funds in flat or bad markets, experts say, and you needn't give up 
diversification to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many fund managers are looking to overseas markets and investments 
shunned in better times -- namely, commodities such as gold, oil, paper and 
industrial metals. Others are making money by betting against stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the approaches of five successful fund managers. T. ROWE 
PRICE SPECTRUM GROWTH 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Van Dyke, president of the T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth Fund, doesn't 
have to search far to scan his universe of potential holdings. Instead of 
investing in particular stocks and bonds, Van Dyke invests his fund's assets in 
seven other T. Rowe Price funds. These seven funds specialize in everything 
from foreign equities and domestic growth stocks to income-producing stocks and 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of managing a fund that invests in other funds is diversification, 
Van Dyke says. Diversification limits stomach-churning market swings and, over 
the long haul, should provide a healthy return to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Dyke is currently promoting three "themes" with Spectrum's investments: 
International, growth stocks and natural resource companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices reflect Van Dyke's conviction that many parts of the U.S. stock 
market have become overheated, but that stock markets in other parts of the 
world are another story. Many foreign economies are still battling their way 
through economic downturns. Some are just beginning to recover. Their stock 
markets haven't fully accounted for the coming recoveries, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "By going to the international markets, you can pick up some equity returns 
that beat U.S. returns," Van Dyke says. And you can reduce the overall 
volatility of your portfolio, because domestic and foreign markets are 
functioning on different economic cycles, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum Fund is limited to investing no more than 20% of its assets 
overseas. Van Dyke has been staying close to that limit for two years. If he 
could invest more of the fund's assets internationally, he would, he says. 
</P>

that beat U.S. returns," Van Dyke says. And you can reduce the overall

overseas. Van Dyke has been staying close to that limit for two years. If he 
could invest more of the fund's assets internationally, he would, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the domestic market, Spectrum is most heavily invested in T. Rowe Price 
funds that target fast-growing small companies, because Van Dyke thinks small 
firms' prospects are better than those of bigger firms. He is also hot on funds 
holding natural resource companies that tend to do well toward the end of 
economic cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, Van Dyke's fund has done only slightly better than the 
market as a whole. Some experts say that's nonetheless impressive -- mainly 
because the fund has proved to be less volatile, and thus safer, than similar 
stock investments.

</P>
<P>
 When domestic interest rates ticked up this year, Jean-Marie Eveillard, 
manager of SoGen International Fund, bought fixed-income securities. Now 11% of 
SoGen International's assets are in U.S. corporate bonds and dollar-denominated 
South American notes that pay double-digit yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, returns in the stock and bond markets have averaged between 9% 
and 10%, he explains. "So, if I can get a five-year piece of paper with a 10% 
yield, I'm going to just sit and clip coupons." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the fund's assets are in cash (22%), foreign stocks (35%) and 
gold-related securities (10%). Only 22% of SoGen International's assets are 
invested in the domestic stock market. Why? There are few bargains in the U.S. 
stock market today, Eveillard says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign markets look better, but today's "synchronized worldwide economic 
recovery" is sure to spur some inflation. And, as far as stock and bond markets 
go, inflation spells n-e-r-v-o-u-s in all languages. The few stocks Eveillard 
is still buying are in businesses that do well when inflation is rising: base 
metals, forest products and real estate. And because he considers himself 
cautious, he is maintaining a healthy cash cushion to soften market blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always been on the side of caution," Eveillard says. "When the 
markets are strong, that was not so good. But we hold up well in a difficult 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Eveillard's strategy proved so attractive to skittish investors that they were 
pouring roughly $2 million a day into SoGen International earlier this year. 
Given the lack of opportunities in today's market, Eveillard says, he couldn't 
invest the money fast enough. He closed the fund to new investments and plans 
to keep it closed until investment opportunities improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise we would begin to look like a money market fund, with 40% to 50% of 
our assets in cash," he explains.

</P>
<P>
 If you think other experts sound negative about the market, you should talk to 
Robert K. Jermain, who manages Dreyfus Corp.'s Strategic Growth Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are calling for a real live bear market -- not an 8% to 10% correction 
like we had earlier this year," Jermain says. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: U.S. stock prices should fall 25% to 35% from their current 
levels before trending back up, he says. "There are signs out there that things 
are getting a little choppy. In our opinion, the next move of any significance 
will probably be down." 
</P>
<P>
 How does a stock fund manager handle such a bleak scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 A whopping 63% of Strategic Growth's assets are now in cash; about 25% is bet 
against the market in so-called "short" positions. The remainder is invested in 
the shares of commodity-producing companies -- oil, gas, paper, lumber, gold 
and other metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Jermain so sure the market is on its way down? 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, market meltdowns come when stock prices become overvalued as 
measured by a plethora of gauges, such as price-to-book values, 
price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow and dividend yield, Jermain says. All 
those gauges indicate that U.S. stock prices are currently at pre-crash levels. 
Stock prices are more overvalued than they were before the 1987 crash; more 
overvalued than before the corrections in 1969, 1972, and 1990. They're even 
more overvalued now than they were before the crash in 1929, Jermain says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also ominous are rising interest rates. That's bad for the market simply 
because it gives investors other viable investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, Jermain is most negative about small, fast-growing companies and 
health care concerns that have rocketed in price over the past several months. 
He's "short-selling" these issues. That means he agrees to sell borrowed shares 
and repay those shares later. If the share price goes up, he loses. If it goes 
down, he collects a handy profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of his short positions, Jermain's fund was the top-performing 
"flexible portfolio" fund during the market's midyear slide. But when stock 
prices rose strongly in August, Dreyfus Strategic Growth took it on the chin. 
For the first nine months of 1994, the fund is up only 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assets: $97.9 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Objective: Long-term growth by investing in domestic companies, foreign 
companies and governments, as well as speculative techniques such as short 
selling, leverage and options. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Sales charge: 3% 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual expenses: 1.62% 
</P>
<P>
 * Performance: +5.9% YTD 
</P>
<P>
 * Phone: (800) 896-2649 FRANKLIN EQUITY INCOME FUND 
</P>
<P>
 Find an industry in trouble and Frank Felicelli is there. Whether it's health 
care concerns threatened by reform or utility stocks that have fallen 30% from 
their highs, the manager of Franklin Management's Equity Income Fund is willing 
to boldly go where others have fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a fairly conservative strategy," Felicelli says. "We invest in large 
companies. But we buy them when they are out of favor and we can get them at a 
very attractive dividend yield." 
</P>
<P>
 Dividend yields on the Equity Income Fund's shares average 5.4%, compared with 
an average yield of 2.7% for the S&P 500, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund does shy away from companies and industries that appear unlikely to 
recover. But industries that have simply taken hits because political or 
economic tides have turned against them are standard fare. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he separate the underdogs from the underachievers? 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at a number of measurements -- price-to-book, price-to-cash flow, 
price- to- normalized earnings," Felicelli says. "If we do it right, we buy 
companies when they are so depressed that all they can do is go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Health care stocks -- particularly pharmaceuticals -- are now among 
Felicelli's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that stocks move from extreme favor to extreme disfavor in a 
three-year cycle. Health stocks peaked in the fourth quarter of 1991 and are 
now approaching their three-year anniversary of being out of favor," he notes. 
"Fundamentally, we think the companies have performed better than market 
expectations. Profit margins have stabilized and improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Felicelli also likes many of the major oil companies and numerous utilities, 
including Pacific Telesis and Dominion Resources. Utilities tend to get hit in 
times of rising interest rates, Felicelli notes. But utility stock prices have 
already plunged dramatically from their 1993 peak. It will take some time 
before the stock prices begin to come back, he adds, but in the meantime, 
investors can pick up some healthy dividend yields.

</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ubben has been managing the Fidelity Value Fund since late 1992. In that 
time, the fund's assets have doubled and it has handily outpaced the Standard & 
Poor's 500 market average. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, while many other fund managers were twisting in the wind, Ubben 
produced a healthy 9.3% return for the Value Fund's investors through Sept. 30. 
His secret?: World commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ubben believes that the financial markets have drastically underestimated the 
effects of a rising standard of living in underdeveloped countries such as 
China and India. And those improving standards are igniting an industrial and 
infrastructure buildup in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many people appreciate the industrialization that we could go 
through in Third World countries," Ubben says. "You always make money in 
commodities when demand surprises you." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Ubben has invested heavily in companies that produce oil, 
chemicals, aluminum and other industrial products. He's also weighted heavily 
in Japanese exporters, who are suffering now but are likely to reap substantial 
rewards if the dollar gains ground, as Ubben is sure it will. He is convinced 
that currency markets have battered the dollar down further than any likely 
economic scenario would warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ubben has a significant amount of his money in foreign markets -- 9% in Japan, 
7% in Canada and 5% to 6% in Europe. These investments are mainly in companies 
that are producers of commodities such as oil, paper and aluminum. And many of 
them sell their products in U.S. dollars, reducing currency risk. Still, the 
dollar's recent pummeling "isn't helping me at all," Ubben complains. 
Nonetheless, he's sure the dollar will come back, and his fund may benefit when 
it does. 
</P>
<P>
 He stresses that in tough markets, you've got to be light on your feet. Once 
the stocks in his fund hit particular targets, "I'm gone," he says. "I always 
sell early."

 Some of the mutual fund industry's major growth-stock funds produced 
relatively low returns in 1992 and '93 and so far this year are in negative 
territory or up only slightly. But at most of these funds, assets haven't 
declined much, indicating that most shareholders have stayed put.
