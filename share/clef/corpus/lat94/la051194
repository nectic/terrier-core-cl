ROBIN ABCARIAN: IN THE PAULA JONES AFFAIR, THE BURDEN IS SQUARELY ON THE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have just read the text of Paula Corbin Jones' complaint of sexual 
harassment against President Clinton and can honestly say that if it's true, 
the man is a beast. This is not the tale of a minor indiscretion. The 
accusations read like a recipe for the sleazy souffle of the year: 
</P>
<P>
 Take one young, low-level female state employee. Add one randy governor who 
asks her up to his hotel room. Mix with the flattered and hopeful way she feels 
because he has picked her out of the crowd. Spice with a suggestion from him 
that she perform oral sex, stir in her horrified reaction, and voila ! 
</P>
<P>
 Garnish with his head on a platter. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So how come Jones waited three years? As she explains it, the time-lapse makes 
sense. Jones did not come forward, she says, until a story in the January issue 
of American Spectator magazine gave her no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 That story quoted an Arkansas state trooper as having approached a woman named 
"Paula" on Clinton's behalf at a May, 1991, state-sponsored conference at a 
Little Rock hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula," the trooper said, met privately with the governor in a hotel room as 
the trooper waited outside. Then, the trooper said, when "Paula" left the hotel 
room, she told him that she was willing to be Clinton's "girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 In the federal lawsuit she filed last week, Jones says that the American 
Spectator piece implied that she had "a consummated and satisfying sexual 
encounter with Clinton," and that "she feared that the statements in the 
magazine would damage her relationship with her husband, her family and her 
friends and acquaintances, some of whom might have believed that she had agreed 
to be Clinton's girlfriend at a time when she was engaged to (her future 
husband)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although one of Jones' lawyers has admitted that Jones unsuccessfully tried to 
extract money from Clinton in exchange for her silence, Jones now says any 
money she receives from her lawsuit will be donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior may stain her motives, but it doesn't mean she fabricated the 
charges. It is possible for a woman to be sexually harassed and demand money in 
exchange for silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Jones' motives are not the important issue; Clinton's behavior is. 
</P>
<P>
 If he and Jones were ever in that Little Rock hotel room in May, 1991, they 
were in there alone. She can't prove he dropped his pants; he can't prove he 
kept them zipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as we would like to rush to judgment based on what we think or feel or 
wish, we may never know what really happened. All we will know is what a jury 
decides. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case ever makes it to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the controversy spawned by Jones' lawsuit is a salacious 
godsend for Clinton's political enemies and a disturbing issue for his 
supporters. It is being cynically exploited by the right in order to bludgeon 
feminists who have supported Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Opinion Page essay in The Times on Monday, attorney Alan Dershowitz 
wrote that feminists -- who supported Anita Hill when she accused Clarence 
Thomas of sexual harassment -- are at risk of hypocrisy and inconsistency if 
they don't support Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the world awaits Clinton's response," he wrote, "it also awaits the 
response of the feminists who did not accord Thomas any presumption of 
innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz conveniently ignored the fact that the world was indeed treated to 
a feminist response a full three days before his essay appeared in print. Last 
Friday, National Organization for Women President Patricia Ireland issued a 
two-page statement on Jones' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual harassment," Ireland said, "is a serious allegation, and we think both 
Paula Jones and President Clinton deserve their day in court. We will continue 
to monitor this case, but we will not take the right wing's bait by heralding 
or attacking either person." 
</P>
<P>
 It's repulsive that Dershowitz plays into the hands of the right-wingers 
trying to rewrite history. Women's groups rallied behind Hill because the 
Senate Judiciary Committee failed to fully investigate her allegations. Her 
charges needed to be heard. Only after both Hill and Thomas testified did NOW 
add harassment of Hill to the list of reasons it opposed Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The burden is not on feminists to demonstrate support of Paula Jones. 
Feminists have been struggling for decades for the rights of women such as 
Jones. It is thanks to the atmospheric changes wrought by feminists that Jones 
even came forward. It is thanks to feminists that Jones' allegations even have 
a name . 
</P>
<P>
 No, the burden is on the forces of the right -- Randall Terry, Pat Robertson 
and all the others who have gleefully rallied behind Jones. Let them explain 
why, after years of trying to keep women down, they are suddenly so concerned 
about women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Their anti-woman agendas speak for themselves.

LAUGH LINES; TEENS' HANG-UPS DON'T INCLUDE THE PHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY ZEZIMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES * Jerry Zezima is a columnist for the 
Stamford (Conn.) Advocate. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell made what was, in effect, the first 
telephone call. Everyone knows, of course, that Bell was trying to reach his 
assistant, Thomas Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 What most people don't know is that when Bell spoke into his new invention and 
said, "Mr. Watson, come here, I need you," he heard the voice of Watson's 
teen-age daughter, who replied: "Can I have my dad call you back, Mr. Bell? I'm 
on with my friend Jennifer. Thanks. Bye!" 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Watson never again got another phone call that was for him. Now, more 
than 115 years later, my wife and I find ourselves in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Our two daughters -- Katie, 13, and Lauren, 11 -- spend about 98% of their 
non-school waking hours talking on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 I am now convinced that, through a fluke of nature (a subsidiary of AT&T), the 
phone has evolved into a vital organ. 
</P>
<P>
 This has given me a great idea for a new telephone feature: Caller IV, which 
would enable young people to have tiny phones surgically attached to their 
heads so they could receive calls intravenously without having to get up from 
in front of the television. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on those rare occasions (2 a.m., for example) when they are not on the 
phone, it doesn't pay to answer it. That's because it's never for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally when the phone rings, I have this fantasy that it is Ed McMahon 
or Publishers Clearinghouse or the state lottery or someone representing some 
fantastic giveaway contest that I can win only if I answer the phone now!  
</P>
<P>
 So, every once in a while, in a fit of giddy anticipation, I answer it, only 
to hear a chirpy voice say: "Hi! Is Katie there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, even if I am sitting or standing right next to the phone 
when it rings, I won't pick it up -- not just because it's never for me, but 
because my daughters, who ordinarily exhibit all the speed and agility of 
wounded sloths, have been known to answer the phone a mere nanosecond after it 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
 And it does. Incessantly. Sometimes one of my daughters will talk on the phone 
eight times a day with the same person!  
</P>
<P>
 Which raises an interesting question: What the hell do they talk about? 
</P>
<P>
 When I posed this question to my daughters recently, Lauren, whose primary 
phone partner is a very nice girl named Farha, said: "Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie, who is keeping the telecommunications industry alive with the help of 
her good friends Katalin and Jennifer, was more forthcoming. She said: "Stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can tell, there are three main topics of telephone conversation 
among teen-age and preteen girls: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
 2. School. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 And from the snippets of conversation I have been able to pick up, especially 
on those impressive occasions when one of my daughters has been talking on the 
phone and watching TV at the same time, I have concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Jagger is dying on "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 2. All teachers are nerds. 
</P>
<P>
 3. It's a good thing for Aikman that my daughters and their friends don't have 
his home phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, I have been told that teen-age and preteen boys talk on the phone 
just as much as girls do. This is a new one on me, because when I was a boy, 
the lengthiest telephone conversation I had went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 (My friend Frankie) "Wanna go outside and throw rocks at cars?" 
</P>
<P>
 (Me) "Sure! Bye!" 
</P>
<P>
 Today, I live in fear that teen-agers and preteens will become EMS 
dispatchers, meaning that when I call 911 to report that I am, God forbid, 
having a heart attack, I will invariably hear a chirpy voice on the other end 
say: "I'm on with my friend Katie. Can you call back?"

 On the first of a week's worth of Late Shows from L.A., David Letterman 
previewed the program: 
</P>
<P>
 "In a couple of minutes, Chuck Woolery will come out and the audience will 
vote whether President Clinton and Paula Jones get a second date."

 Missing from ceremonies marking new South African President Nelson Mandela's 
election was the usual phalanx of Hollywood stars. Tony Peyser says the 
glitterati weren't able to go because UCLA bought 4,000 tickets and sold them 
to scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peyser on the eight-hour Stephen King miniseries, "The Stand," airing this 
week on ABC: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most terrifying thing for me wasn't the apocalyptic battle between good 
and evil. It was the fact that the book was 1,141 pages long."

 Club Watch: Comedian Diana Jordan on that lovable, roly-poly commentator Rush 
Limbaugh: "His new fiancee says she still loves him even after finding out how 
he got the name 'Rush.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Michael Green observes that attitude is everywhere in L.A.: "Even 
homeless people have attitude. They're pushing their shopping carts and one 
sneers to the other, 'I see you're still driving that Alpha Beta.' The other 
says, 'Yeah, but my other cart is a Vons.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Comedian Dom Irrera gets a little peeved when overweight people justify their 
condition: "They say, 'I'm just big-boned.' I say, 'Yeah, that's a pretty big 
bone you have hanging over your belt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Jim Edwards on that evergreen comedy topic, serial killers: "When they 
catch a serial killer who's killed 27 victims, they always find someone who 
says he was a loner. Well, of course -- he killed all his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The honorary doctorate that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton received from 
George Washington University is disastrous, according to comic Argus Hamilton: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that she's a doctor, she's opposed to health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton on Ted Kennedy's health care plan, which would give every American 
insurance coverage identical to U.S. senators': 
</P>
<P>
 "So apparently the plan doesn't cover treatment for alcoholism or sex 
addiction."

 Reader Henry Sakaida says his family has quite a menagerie -- a parrot, four 
rats, a chinchilla, two finches, a cat and a guinea pig -- in the living room: 
</P>
<P>
 My dad would come around and tease my kids by saying "Whew! It sure stinks in 
here!"  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, my 7-year-old daughter, Allison, had had enough. "Look Grandpa, it's 
not really that bad," she said. "You should have smelled our house BEFORE we 
got the pets."

RSVP; 'S WONDERFUL; SOCIETY OF SINGERS AND FRIENDS GALORE SALUTE JAZZY PEGGY 
LEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's still got it. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the overwhelming consensus of the 800 people who heard Peggy 
</P>
<P>
 Lee sing at her tribute from Society of Singers on Monday night at the Beverly 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 A wheelchair-bound Lee sang two songs, " 'S Wonderful" and "Here's to You" for 
an appreciative crowd that gave her two enthusiastic standing ovations. With a 
little help, she stood to acknowledge them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've felt more heart here in this room tonight, and I know that is 
the shining truth," said Lee, dressed in white satin and marabou. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was the fourth singer to receive the society's "Ella" Lifetime Achievement 
award, named for Ella Fitzgerald, the first recipient. (Frank Sinatra and Tony 
Martin also have won.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Society of Singers was founded in 1984 to aid singers in need, since there 
is no union solely for singers, giving them benefits and insurance. The tally 
on this event was expected to be $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During a photo session earlier in the evening, when friends came by in droves 
to say hello, Lee said of the award: "This is incredible. It's like a movie of 
my life. This is wonderful because it's for my career, and it's absolutely the 
highest and the best because it's from my peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's two numbers capped off a two-hour show featuring her songs interpreted 
by Joe Williams, k.d. lang, the Manhattan Transfer, Jack Jones, Ruth Brown, 
Rosemary Clooney, Cleo Laine and John Dankworth, and Natalie Cole. They were 
backed by the Frank Capp and Juggernaut orchestra and the Society of Singers 
Choir, directed by Earl Brown. Gary Owens emceed and George Schlatter produced 
the show with Jack Haley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Some performers reminisced about Lee's influence on their lives and careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Williams heard Lee's voice on a record, he said, "I went into a 
puddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Mathis said when he was young, his father brought home one of Lee's 
records. "He said I might as well learn from the best." 
</P>
<P>
 And lang said she would listen to Lee's songs over and over, "trying to copy 
her phrasing." She also hung around the lobby of a Canadian theater for two 
weeks to hear Lee in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally just let me in -- I was broke," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee represents "the perfect marriage of talent and material," said Ginny 
Mancini, one of the society's founders and its current president. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips from Lee's appearances on film and television showed the breadth of her 
work, from "Pete Kelly's Blues," for which she received an Academy Award 
nomination, to her repertoire of jazz numbers, torch songs and ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among those who came to pay tribute to Lee were Bob and Delores Hope, 
Tony Martin and Cyd Charisse, Chaka Khan, Hugh and Kimberley Hefner, Polly 
Bergen, Bea Arthur, Frances Bergen, and Helen Forrest. Chairing the event were 
Mancini and Jeanne Hazard.

 The Scene: Monday's industry screening of Showtime's "Lush Life" at the 
Directors Guild. The film about the lives of jazz musicians airs May 20. A 
party followed at the Roxbury club's top floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: From the film came co-star Kathy Baker (Jeff Goldblum and 
Forrest Whitaker were off filming). Also on hand were 400 agents and production 
execs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Locale: One club-goer took a look around Roxbury and remarked: 
"Gee, it's nice to be here and not be tripping over Shannen Doherty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Self-Deprecating Remark by a Film Exec: Showtime's Steve Hewitt described 
his first meeting with "Lush Life" writer-director Michael Elias about making 
the movie: "Michael looked at me like he was thinking, 'Here's this kid 
executive who probably thinks Ornette Coleman has something to do with camping 
equipment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Showtime: Long the Avis to HBO's Hertz in the cable-TV world, Hewitt 
described their relative positions as: "We're the scrappy kid on the block. 
They're into Little League, we play stick ball in the street. It gives us more 
freedom -- we don't need to have uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, This Must Be L.A.: It was an eight-block walk from the theater to 
Roxbury. There was about as much chance as the National Anthem being switched 
to a jazz tune as there was of anyone heading for the party on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: An excellent jazz band with Chuck Findley, Mike Lang, Dave 
Carpenter, Gene Estes, Vince Trombetta, Charlie Loper and Ernie Andrews 
playing. This might have been the first time a grand piano has somehow been 
hauled to Roxbury's top floor. There was probably more good music played at 
Roxbury on this one night than in its entire history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: While introducing the film, executive producer Jana Sue Memel said: 
"To all the filmmakers out there, I'd like to say, there's no better place to 
make a movie than Showtime. Which is the speech I'd like to give this year at 
the Oscars."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: As part of an abstract art exhibit, there was a pair of eerie, 
headless, seated figures in the DGA lobby. Whether they signify the ill effects 
of screenings, or what happens to over-budget directors, the DGA would be 
better off with a popcorn machine.

BOOK REVIEW; HOW A REAL 'INFORMATION REVOLUTION' DOOMED THE USSR; DISMANTLING 
UTOPIA: HOW INFORMATION ENDED THE SOVIET UNION BY SCOTT SHANE ; IVAN R. DEE, 
$25, 325 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From where we sat in the West back in 1989, the Soviet Union appeared as a 
massive fortress that suddenly and almost miraculously collapsed under its own 
dismal weight. 
</P>
<P>
 What we did not see -- and what we discover in Scott Shane's "Dismantling 
Utopia" -- is that the Soviet Union had been undermined by a steady trickle of 
free thought that eroded the very foundations of one of the history's most 
sophisticated and entrenched police states. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, when Mikhail Gorbachev embraced glasnost as a tool of reform, the 
structures of repression were washed away by a flood tide of something that had 
always been in short supply in the Soviet Union: information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gorbachev seized upon information as reality therapy," Shane writes. "The 
protean power of information loosed by Gorbachev would quickly take on an 
independent life, reproducing and spreading at a pace and on a scale and with 
consequences that he neither anticipated nor desired." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane, a former Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, opens his book on 
the eve of the Soviet collapse, and he shows us an information-starved society 
where possessing a banned book was a political crime, a government so fearful 
that its tourist maps were intentionally distorted and falsified lest enemies 
of the state use them for invasion or subversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinary people's maps were useless," Shane writes, "because they were 
designed to be useless." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane delves deeply into Russian history to explain the roots of Soviet 
mind-control. Like the "Potemkin villages" of the tsarist era, Soviet 
propaganda erected a cheerful but utterly phony facade of "socialist realism" 
to conceal the failures of communism while exhorting the people to ever greater 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truth is good," goes an old Russian proverb that Shane quotes, "but happiness 
is better." 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest stirrings of free thought were nurtured on the radio broadcasts 
of Voice of America and the crude, self-published books and tape recordings of 
the Samizdat and Magnitizdat movements. By the end, of course, it was CNN and 
cellular phones that finally defeated the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exploding arsenal of electronics -- cellular telephones, fax machines, 
VCRs, satellite dishes, computers with modems -- demonstrated a trend for 
technology to become more compact, portable, versatile and inexpensive," Shane 
explains. "As such, the new machines seemed to be weapons the citizen could 
wield against the state as readily as the state could use them on the citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 As Shane points out, the phrase "information revolution" takes on an entirely 
new meaning in this context. And he helps us understand how stirring but also 
how bizarre it must have been for a Soviet citizen to turn on his television 
set and see the top brass of the KGB on a call-in show: "Tonight they will be 
answering the questions," the host announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane, to his credit, does not overstate the case for the mass media as a 
catalyst for liberation. What Russians are offered in place of tedious Soviet 
propaganda films, he points out, is the detritus of Western pop culture -- 
"Swedish Wife-Swappers Club," for example. More troubling still, Shane argues, 
is the prospect that electronic media will be harnessed by new and dangerous 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The void that resulted from the shattering of Leninist faith and Stalinist 
control," writes Shane, "could, and did, accommodate not only productive 
markets but brazen crime, not only democratic politics but violent 
nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
 And Shane concedes that the disintegration of Soviet authoritarianism has 
uncapped an upwelling of ethnic and nationalist passions so volcanic that they 
threaten to sweep away electronic media and high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tribal warfare, unleashed in part by information's destruction of the old 
regime," Shane warns, "has been shown capable of turning a modern city into a 
wasteland where faxes and television do not function and even the water supply 
and the medical system fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 So Shane intends his book to be regarded as a caution as well as an 
explanation. But Shane's greatest accomplishment is the sense he makes of 
Soviet history and Russian destiny. Indeed, he writes with such bracing 
authority, such startling insight, that "Dismantling Utopia" must be regarded 
as one of the essential works on the fall of the Soviet Union.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE CROW' FLIES WITH GRIM GLEE; IN THE DOOM-AND-GLOOM COMIC BOOK 
FANTASY, THE LATE BRANDON LEE PLAYS A ROCK GUITARIST WHO RETURNS FROM THE DEAD 
TO AVENGE HIS MURDER AND THAT OF HIS FIANCEE.

 "The Crow," starring the late Brandon Lee, is like one long fright night. Even 
though it was photographed in color, the edge-of-darkness atmosphere descends 
on the audience like a shroud. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Batman" movies were probably the first to transfer the new style in 
doom-and-gloom comic book fantasias to the screen, but "The Crow" makes those 
films seem happy-go-lucky. On its own terms it's highly effective but that 
doesn't mean you have to accept its terms. It's almost unremittingly grungy and 
overwrought -- "Blade Runner" with a hangover -- with an eardrum-blasting 
industrial rock score to go with its eyeball-popping industrial rock look. 
</P>
<P>
 Tortured male adolescents will probably connect with the film's agonizing, 
horrific, masochistic pageantry of ghoulish tortures and high-style garrotings 
rhythmed to resemble a berserk rock video. The director Alex Proyas is an 
award-winning TV commercial and rock video director, and, along with 
screenwriters David J. Schow and John Shirley, he puts across this adaptation 
of the J. O'Barr "Crow" cult comic books with grim glee. He's selling pop 
pubescent nihilism with a stroboscopic, rock-hero kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who was accidentally shot dead on the set of "The Crow" with eight days 
of filming left, plays a Detroit rock guitarist, Eric Draven, who returns from 
the dead on Halloween eve, guided by a mysterious crow, to avenge his own 
gangland murder and that of his fiancee. Draven is, at least in his post-dead 
incarnation, a feral harlequin with a mime-white face and blood-red lipstick. 
He goes after each member of the gang responsible for the slaughter with a 
hyperbolic vengeance; we're encouraged to relish the killings, "Death 
Wish"-style. But "The Crow" is so far removed from any social agenda that, 
unlike the "Death Wish" films, its squashings and torchings are pure theater. 
It's a reactionary movie without anything to react against.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the few recent films where the bad guys are, literally, 
overshadowed by the hero. This overshadowing is an achievement, since a few of 
the nasties, including Top Dollar (Michael Wincott) and T-Bird (David Patrick 
Kelly), are scenery-chomping world-class scum. With his dirty lanky hair and 
noxious killer smiles, Top Dollar, who couples with his half-sister Myca (Bai 
Ling), is the gangland crime lord as polymorphous perverse Capone. The 
pointy-chinned T-Bird is like an atrocious imp -- a self-winding mayhem 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Draven overwhelms their awfulness by flaunting his fire-and-brimstone 
invulnerability. Protected by the crow, which functions as a kind of aviary 
spirit guide, he wades into the fray and boggles his victims. There's something 
unreasonably satisfying about seeing bullies this bad get drubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason for a grown person to check out "The Crow" is for Lee -- and 
not for sentimental reasons, either. What gives the movie its mite of "heart" 
is that, as Lee plays him, Draven's fury comes out of an almost operatic pain. 
Lee has phenomenal presence, and his movements are so balletically powerful 
that his rampages seem like waking nightmares. Lee keeps you watching "The 
Crow" when you'd rather look away. His death means there won't be a sequel to 
"The Crow" -- no loss -- but his star presence was the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong violence and language, and for drug use and some 
sexuality. Times guidelines: It includes all sorts of graphic violence, extreme 
tension and mayhem, and some drug usage.

 L.A. Trip Pays Off: Los Angeles ratings for Monday night's "Late Show" 
broadcast, which began David Letterman's week-long run here, were up 86%, 
increasing from an average 215,275 viewing households to 400,512. Meanwhile, 
rival Jay Leno's "Tonight Show" L.A. ratings fell 20%, reaching 165,211 homes 
instead of the usual 205,262. That helped boost Letterman 14% in overnight 
ratings for the nation's top 31 markets, while Leno dropped 6%. . . . Letterman 
didn't cite ratings in his "Top 10 Reasons We're Doing 'Late Show' in Los 
Angeles," however. Among those that did make the list: 9) Wanted to be closer 
to my nephews Lyle and Erik; 7) We're hoping to see Jack Nicholson go nuts on 
the freeway with a nine iron; 6) Madonna is in New York; 3) I had to come clean 
Johnny Carson's pool; 2) Wanted to be first to get speeding ticket on newly 
reopened Santa Monica Freeway; and 1) Three words: It's bitchin', dude. STAGE

 Dunaway's Debut Set: Faye Dunaway and Rex Smith will begin performing their

Glenn Close and Alan Campbell leave the show on June 26; the interim week will 
feature standby Karen Mason as Norma and understudy Amick Byram as Joe. The 
week's delay is caused by Dunaway's work on the film "Don Juan de Marco and the

 Passion for 'Passion': Critics liked "Passion," the new Stephen Sondheim/James 
Lapine musical that opened on Broadway Monday, but some stopped short of a full 
embrace. It's "easily the worthiest" original musical of the season, wrote 
David Richards of the New York Times, "but its adult ambitions, more than its 
achievements, are what command admiration." Linda Winer-Bernheimer of Newsday 
praised Sondheim's "ravishing" and "gorgeously knit" score but labeled Lapine's 
book "overripe foolishness." Clive Barnes of the New York Post dubbed the 
musical "the most thrilling piece of theater on Broadway," while Howard Kissel 
of the Daily News wrote that "with a great cast, (the show) suffers only when 
the music stops." . . . "Passion" is already ahead in New York's Drama Desk 
Award competition, winning 11 nominations, more than any other show. "Beauty 
and the Beast" got 10. PEOPLE WATCH

and professional respect for Emilio. I know that we'll continue to be 
supportive of each other in the future and that our friendship will go on."

 Disappointing 'Fanfest': The country-music "Fanfest '94" at Pomona's Fairplex 
facility sold an estimated 20,000 tickets for its four-day run last week, fewer 
than half the 50,000 that organizers hoped for. But Fanfest Inc. President Bob 
Alexander, blaming the low turnout in part on inclement weather, said Monday 
that the organization plans to stage the event again next spring. "We intend to 
learn from our mistakes," Alexander said, referring to long lines at autograph 
booths and performances that ran behind schedule. QUICK TAKES

SINGERS SALUTE PEGGY LEE IN SONG AND CELLULOID; JAZZ REVIEW

 Because tribute concerts are so often bogged down by windy speeches and 
self-promoting performances, Monday's salute to Peggy Lee at the Beverly Hilton 
was a triumphant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was marked by sheer quality and music. Produced by George 
Schlatter and staged by the Society of Singers, it was climaxed by the 
presentation to Lee of the "Ella" Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the artists sang more than one number, yet each captured the crowd 
immediately: Natalie Cole with her stunning rendition of "I'm a Woman"; Ruth 
Brown bringing "Fever" up to 100 degrees centigrade; the Society of Singers 
Choir in a superb arrangement by Earl Brown of "The Folks Who Live on the 
Hill," introduced as Lee's favorite song. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Williams, Rosemary Clooney, Jack Jones and the Manhattan Transfer added to 
the luster. Frank Capp's Juggernaut band did a flawless job of playing for the 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
 A fascinating sequence, co-produced by Jack Haley Jr., was the series of film 
clips that showed Lee at every stage of her 50-year career, singing with 
everyone from Crosby and Sinatra to Bob Hope, Dinah Shore and Lena Horne. 
</P>
<P>
 No less intriguing was a segment devoted to "Lady and the Tramp," in which 
Walt Disney, on camera, told the story of Lee's involvement in such detail that 
he inadvertently explained her David-and-Goliath victory in her lawsuit against 
Disney. Yet another film clip showed her in the "Pete Kelly's Blues" role that 
won her an Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The live music episode concluded with two nonpareil acts. Singing "I Am in 
Love," k.d. lang brought firepower to the impassioned lyrics, following up with 
a Lee-recorded classic, "Black Coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody would want to follow lang, yet Cleo Laine did with consummate ease. 
Backed by a John Dankworth arrangement, she offered her poignant version of the 
exquisite ballad "When the World Was Young." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening ended with Society of Singers co-chair Ginny Mancini paying homage 
to Lee and walking to a table in the back to present the award. Lee, after a 
brief speech that was both touching and amusing, remained seated (she is still 
essentially wheelchair-bound) and sang " 'S Wonderful" followed by a charming 
tune she wrote with Dick Hazard, "Here's to You."

DANCE REVIEW; 'TROY' TOUGH GOING FOR BALLOFFET TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working in the tradition of epic dance drama, choreographer Grace Dent 
Balloffet has launched a new company, Dance Aiyetoro, with "Survivors: Women of 
Troy," based on Euripides' "Trojan Women." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunday afternoon performance at the Cal State Los Angeles State 
Playhouse, a small cast of dancers and actors struggled valiantly to embody the 
physical and emotional depth required for the giant-size grief of Greek 
tragedy, but it remained as tough a job as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, "Trojan Women" has had versions that echo colonial horrors 
and genocide in Algeria, Vietnam and Hiroshima. With a background in modern and 
African dance, Balloffet wanted to fuse movement styles to restate the 
tragedies of war (her company name is Yoruba for "peace on Earth"), but an 
uneasy mix of media hinders the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Survivors," women prisoners of war deal with death and enslavement. The 
dance portions were largely inspired by static poses of Greek vases and 
bas-relief, featuring side-views of bodies in procession, one arm curved ahead, 
the other trailing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 A chorus of three women often walked circular patterns, arms in bereaved 
caresses or stretching upward in pleading gestures all too familiar from 
19th-Century melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Balloffet, as Cassandra, turned elegant Afrocentric sweeps of 
the arms and head and rhythmical stamping into a poignant lament. Other 
dancers, asked most often to stretch and fold dramatically, did not have her 
technique or presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially disconcerting were transitions from mimed and danced mourning to 
scenes with wailed spoken text. 
</P>
<P>
 A protean score by Jeffrey Silverman and John Bergamo was the heartbeat of the 
piece, using what sounded like gongs, flutes and drums plus synthesizer to 
create the kind of seamless, vital fusion the company needs to find in terms of 
movement and text.

TV REVIEW; A WOMAN'S 'WAR' A BIT OF A VIEWER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took six years and many scholarly historical advisers to make "Mary 
Silliman's War," tonight's fact-based saga on Lifetime about a Connecticut 
woman's trials and tribulations during the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort for authenticity shows in gorgeous misty shots (in Nova Scotia) of 
the town, riverside and country, and in portrait-come-to-life images of 
townspeople, posed and lit with a milky glow.It shows in the faithful 
re-creation of 18th Century buildings, costumes, furniture and music. 
</P>
<P>
 And it shows, regrettably, in an overly reverential treatment of a text that, 
for the most part, infuses what is intended as a very human and timely story 
about politically inspired, neighbor-against-neighbor hatreds with the 
impersonal remove of a distant history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, conceived by Steven Schecter and written by Schecter and Louisa 
Burns-Bisogno, Nancy Palk plays the dutiful wife and mother who goes beyond the 
expectations of her sex in those exceedingly patriarchal times to win the 
release of her husband, State Atty. Selleck Silliman (Richard Donat), who is 
held for ransom by the British. 
</P>
<P>
 Palk conveys Mary's strength of purpose, matched by Donat's dignified 
presence, but both carry a hint of historical monument about them, as do other 
characters in the film -- so much so that when violence occurs, it has a sense 
of unreality about it, not the strived-for shock of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on "The Way of Duty: A Woman and Her Family in Revolutionary America," 
by Richard and Joy Day Buel, the film uses Mary's diary entries and letters as 
Palk's voice-over narrative, but even the tenor of the memoirs, written with 
ladylike restraint, holds viewers at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mary Silliman's War" airs at 9 tonight on cable's Lifetime channel.

TV RATINGS; STEPHEN KING'S FILM MAKES A 'STAND' FOR ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MARGULIES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans mostly yukked it up with their favorite comedies last week, but 
enough of them took time out to watch the opening chapter of Stephen King's 
"The Stand" to make it the week's second-highest rated program, the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. With Ruby Dee in a key role, the miniseries 
helped ABC win the weekly network battle. 
</P>
<P>
 There were eight sitcoms in the Top 10, but only "Home Improvement" 
outperformed "The Stand," which attracted 32% of the available audience Sunday 
night--representing nearly 19 million homes. That was much better than the 
theatrical films with which it was competing: CBS' telecast of "Robin Hood: 
Prince of Thieves," starring Kevin Costner, was seen in about 11.7 million 
homes, while "Thelma & Louise" on NBC was viewed in about 11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, meanwhile, had mixed results with its country-music specials. The Academy 
of Country Music Awards on Tuesday drew 21% of the audience and ranked 17th 
among the week's 87 prime-time network programs. But Friday's "This Is Garth 
Brooks, Too" ran third in its time slot and placed 58th overall. Southland

2 KILLED, 3 HURT AS COPTER CRASHES ON POMONA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A private helicopter plummeted onto the Pomona Freeway and burst into flames 
on Tuesday night, killing the occupants of the chopper and injuring at least 
three motorists, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, which occurred about 9:50 p.m. just west of the Azusa Avenue exit 
in Hacienda Heights, lit up the westbound side of the freeway and tied up 
traffic for five miles in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Robinson F-22 helicopter that apparently hit some power lines and 
then hit a car on the freeway, demolishing it, and then struck another car," 
said Tommy Aina, regional duty officer for the Federal Aviation Administration 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aina said the plane was registered to an aviation service firm based at Chino 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the dead and injured were not immediately available. Nor could 
law enforcement sources confirm the ownership of the aircraft, which sources 
said is owned by Skyline Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Tingley, president of Skyline, said the firm owns a Robinson F-22 that 
was flying Tuesday night but would not say whether it was Skyline's chopper 
that had crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the aircraft had been flying unusually low and apparently 
became entangled in transformer wires. The crash plunged the Pomona Freeway 
into pandemonium as lashing power lines sparked wildly and panicked motorists 
slammed on their brakes, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, they said, the copter crashed just a few car-lengths from a 
California Highway Patrol car in the area. The CHP officer took control of the 
scene within minutes of the explosion.

 "It was like daylight," said Margarita Estrada, 26, a candy store clerk who 
was driving home from work when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you could see was something coming down out of the sky, hitting the 
freeway and then everything lit up," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one big explosion -- pieces of helicopter were lying everywhere, 
and everything smelled like burnt rubber," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said that as she gingerly pulled her pickup truck to the shoulder of 
the road, she saw the wreckage of two cars, one of which appeared totaled. The 
helicopter had all but disintegrated, she said.

A BLACK HOLE FOR JPL PROPERTY; REPORT: AUDIT FINDS WIDESPREAD VIOLATIONS OF 
NASA REGULATIONS ON EQUIPMENT LOANS TO EMPLOYEES, WITH HUGE LOSSES. CALTECH 
AGREES RECORD-KEEPING MUST BE IMPROVED AT SPACE LAB. 
</P>

 The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is allowing employees to take home thousands of 
government-owned personal computers, cellular telephones, fax machines, VCRs, 
television sets and other electronic equipment and keep them for years, in 
violation of NASA regulations, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said that JPL also is losing about $1 million in property every year 
-- the worst record of any of the NASA centers the government accountants 
investigated. In 1992 alone, the laboratory lost $3.4 million worth of 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past five years, the Jet Propulsion Lab has spent millions of 
taxpayer dollars on questionable purchase of home computers for employees, 
failed to track millions of dollars of property bought in the government's name 
and written off millions more in lost or stolen government equipment," said 
Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate government management subcommittee 
that commissioned the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no way to run one of our nation's premier research centers," Levin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report is the second in a series of critical reports on JPL's 
management practices. It comes at a time when NASA's inability to balance its 
books or keep track of billions of dollars worth of equipment is under 
increasing scrutiny by Congress and the agency's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials recently testified that the agency could not locate the 
documents that account for more than one-third of NASA's assets -- about $12 
billion worth of property -- and could not reconcile about one-third of its 
annual spending in its books, covering about $4.5 billion in expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other NASA research centers, the $1-billion-a-year Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory is managed by a university, Caltech, which has run the sprawling 
facility for NASA since the agency was chartered in 1958. Caltech recently won 
a new five-year contract to continue operating the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Caltech and JPL agreed Tuesday with most of the report's 
criticism and said they were already trying to correct the problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that substantial improvements are needed," JPL spokesman Franklin 
O'Donnell said. "We are working actively on identifying the specific changes 
and we are committed to implementing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Most NASA centers let employees borrow equipment to work at home, but the 
practice is unusually widespread at JPL, the GAO said.  
</P>
<P>
 NASA and JPL regulations allow government equipment to be loaned temporarily 
to employees to conduct NASA missions or perform official duties. JPL officials 
said Tuesday that the agency gets "thousands of hours in unpaid overtime each 
week" from employees working at home on loaned equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Regulations forbid the actual purchase of equipment solely to lend to 
employees and limit how long such equipment can be kept on loan at home, 
usually about 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But at JPL, more than 4,000 computer-related items worth about $7.6 million 
are on loan to employees, many of whom have kept them for more than two years. 
More than $1 million worth of the equipment was new and had been loaned to 
employees within a month of purchase, the investigators found.  
</P>
<P>
 The practice is "widespread and increasing," the GAO reported.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, the amount of equipment taken home on loan by employees 
increased 40%, according to GAO. The report said that there were "major 
weaknesses" in JPL's efforts to keep track of government-owned equipment and 
that its controls were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 JPL, for example, has no idea how much equipment Caltech has bought with JPL 
purchase orders as part of its work for the space agency. The university may 
have up to $4 million worth of NASA computers and other electronic equipment 
unbeknown to agency managers, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that there is no way for NASA to know that it should reclaim 
the equipment when the contract work is done. "A Caltech property tag is placed 
on the equipment, but no NASA property tag is attached unless Caltech notifies 
JPL of its delivery to Caltech," the investigators said. "Usually, no one was 
notified." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech spokesman Max Benavidez said the problem was an accounting matter. 
"Caltech feels that we do need to make improvements in the way JPL manages its 
property and we are in the process of doing that."

JUDGE FINDS NO PRIVACY INVASION IN CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: COURT ALSO DENIES A 
BID TO REQUIRE PARENTAL PERMISSION BEFORE SCHOOLS CAN GIVE THE STATE EXAMS. IT 
IS THE FIRST MAJOR RULING ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a significant victory for supporters of the embattled California Learning 
Assessment System tests, a Los Angeles judge ruled Tuesday that exam questions 
do not invade students' privacy.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien denied a bid by the United States 
Justice Foundation to require parental permission before schools can administer 
the CLAS tests in reading and writing to students in grades four, eight and 10. 
Brought on behalf of two parents of students in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the lawsuit has been widely watched around the state as the first 
major test of CLAS opponents' contentions that exams violate a state privacy 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS critics based their suit on Section 60650 of the state Education Code, 
enacted in 1968, which states that "no test, questionnaire, survey or 
examination containing any questions about the pupil's personal beliefs or 
practices in sex, family life, morality and religion" or those of his or her 
family, shall be given without first obtaining written parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old system of tests, which also includes math, science and social 
studies, attempts to assess higher-order thinking skills by asking students to 
write about their reactions to literature selections. Last year, 10th-graders 
were asked to read an excerpt from black author Richard Wright's autobiography 
and relate it to their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who reviewed copies of the confidential tests, said the materials 
"are obviously designed to elicit analytical, comprehension and writing 
abilities. . . . The questions are not designed to elicit the prohibited 
information. More importantly, they, in fact, do not call for a revelation of 
the pupil's parents' or guardians' beliefs and practices on the prohibited 
subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he said the state law is vague in its reference to "morality" 
and "family life" and could be challenged on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the confidentiality of the tests, portions of which have fallen 
into opponents' hands, O'Brien ordered court records containing exam questions 
sealed.  
</P>
<P>
 The open-ended, "performance-based" items have brought the new system praise 
from education reformers, testing experts and business leaders but criticism 
from others, including groups of conservatives who say the tests are invasive 
and anti-religion or anti-family. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was a big boost to the state Department of Education, which has 
been under attack for its handling of the test's development and the growing 
controversy over the exams. Department officials, who got court permission to 
enter the case against the Los Angeles district last week, said the ruling 
should offer clear guidance to school boards that are grappling with whether to 
give the tests, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finally seeing some reasoned, careful, independent action here that 
will help sort out the myths," acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson said. "This really should set aside with a great deal of authority those 
concerns about (invasion of privacy.)" 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dawson said the department will continue to allow objecting parents 
to get their children excused from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Los Angeles district, where exams have been completed or 
are under way this week for about half the 170,000 eligible students, said the 
ruling affirms what education officials have been saying all along -- that 
there is nothing to fear from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people will pay attention to it," attorney Howard Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Escondido-based Justice Foundation said it will likely appeal 
O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're disappointed," said Gary Kreep of the foundation, one of two 
groups that have sued about 50 California school districts over the tests. "The 
judge has emasculated parents' rights in California." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, the other group 
bringing lawsuits over the tests, downplayed the significance of the ruling, 
which represents the first time a court has acted after hearing arguments on 
key issues involving the exams. Rutherford spokesman Brad Dacus noted that 
there are several hearings scheduled next week in suits his organization has 
brought seeking to halt the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came the same day that officials of the Redondo Beach Unified 
School District announced that they will stop giving their students the reading 
and writing portions of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse, two-sentence statement, the school board said it supported the 
assessment process but wanted the State Board of Education, the state 
superintendent and legislators to do a "thorough review of the CLAS language 
arts content." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, four other school districts have refused to give at least some of 
the tests, and board members of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District in 
Orange County voted 4 to 2 Tuesday night to require parental permission before 
CLAS tests are given to eighth- and 10th-graders.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEFENSE 
DEMONSTRATES CHOKEHOLD IN KING TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer in the Rodney G. King lawsuit crumpled to the courtroom floor Tuesday 
after a police officer applied a banned chokehold the defense says could have 
spared King his beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you still conscious?" U.S. District Judge John G. Davies asked after 
lawyer Ira Salzman slumped to the floor.Salzman, who represents former police 
Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, said he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman had former police Officer Kenneth Dionne demonstrate the carotid 
chokehold, which was banned -- except for use as deadly force -- by the Los 
Angeles Police Department in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman also called expert witnesses to support positions that the officers 
who beat King believed that he was on the psychedelic drug PCP and that they 
could have avoided the beating if they had been allowed to use the chokehold to 
subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
 But under cross-examination, King's attorney said the chokehold was restricted 
in 1982 because it had resulted in several deaths -- particularly of 
African-American males. King, who is black, has denied being on PCP when he was 
beaten and there has been no evidence presented that he was.POLICE BRUTALITY

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution. It can seek court-imposed fines against polluters of $25 to 
$25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that emissions exceed legal 
limits, potential danger to the public, whether the violation was intentional, 
accidental or caused by negligence and the company's history of violations. 
These are the eight companies that incurred violations resulting in penalties 
of $2,500 or greater in January: COMPANY: Union Pacific Railroad Co., San 
Bernardino, Colton, Devore TYPE OF BUSINESS: Railroad PENALTY: $80,000 
VIOLATION: Excessive smoke emissions from diesel engines. The company will 
spend an additional $215,000 to implement a compliance reporting program that 
outlines maintenance procedures to ensure the company's compliance with air 
pollution control rules. * COMPANY: AT&T Communications, Mission Viejo, Irvine 
TYPE OF BUSINESS: Telephone company PENALTY: $31,000 VIOLATION: Failure to 
submit revised ride-sharing plans, failure to implement ride-sharing incentives 
listed in approved plans. The company also spent an additional $22,567 
conducting an internal audit of the ride-sharing plans for all its facilities 
and on installing a new transportation management team. * COMPANY: 
International Permalite Inc., Ontario TYPE OF BUSINESS: Roofing board maker 
PENALTY: $20,000 VIOLATION: Releasing excessive amounts of dust, violating its 
permit to operate rule. * COMPANY: Unocal Corp., Wilmington TYPE OF BUSINESS:

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BOILING MAD, CREW OF 
WORLD WAR II SHIP SEEKS TO RESUME D-DAY VOYAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crew members aboard a restored World War II cargo ship bound for D-day 
celebrations in France are steamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 9,000-mile voyage was called off Saturday after the ship developed 
engines problems near Acapulco, Mexico. But the Lane Victory's captain said 
Tuesday he was never consulted, and maintains the crew is ready to go. "I feel 
lousy. I think it was doable," Capt. Bill Tilghman said from Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's crew faxed a petition signed by 34 of the 54 crew members stating 
they want to continue the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of the Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, which 
owns the 455-foot boat, voted 4 to 1 Saturday to scrap the trip. However, two 
board members are aboard the ship and said they were excluded from the vote.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have engineers and we're ready to go now," said board member William 
Skinner, 76, from Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief engineer Pete Jacobelly flew home to San Pedro after a dispute with 
Tilghman over whether the ship could continue the trip. Jacobelly told the 
board that the ship needs boiler repairs and a custom-made part for the 
evaporator that turns salt water into fresh water.  
</P>
<P>
 President Joe Vernick said delays caused by mechanical problems make it nearly 
impossible for the crew to arrive in time for the June 6 ceremonies in 
Normandy. But Tilghman said he believes that the ship can still get there for 
at least some ceremonies.  
</P>
<P>
 All told, the ship's 54 volunteer crew members -- former merchant marines 
whose average age is 68 -- needed more than $1 million in fuel, equipment, 
supplies and cash to make the Normandy trip. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous delays and a last-minute contribution of $250,000, the ship 
steamed out of Los Angeles Harbor on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ship developed engine trouble and limped into port in Acapulco on May 
4. Officials said oil had leaked into one of the ship's two boilers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Goard required the ship to cross the Atlantic with another ship. The 
crew planned to steam through the Panama Canal and rendezvous with the Jeremiah 
O'Brien, a ship based in San Francisco that is going to Normandy. The delay has 
made that meeting impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crew is now hoping for a last-minute reprieve from the Navy. Several 
members have asked officials if the Lane Victory could be escorted by one of 14 
Navy ships expected to make the voyage, said Clint Johnson, a member of the 
Merchant Marine veterans board. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilghman said no decision has been made. JAMES BENNING

 Mind if I chew? We're proud to report that Southern California's eaters are 
the target of a full-page ad in Newsweek magazine. "When dining in L.A. 
restaurants where smoking's not allowed," the pitch suggests, "take along 
Wrigley's Spearmint gum." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine. But if this alternative catches on, we hope that restaurateurs will have 
the courtesy to set aside a no-gum-snapping section. The ear damage from 
secondhand popping should not be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 And we assume that diners will follow the old schoolroom dictum that if one 
person brings gum into a restaurant, he or she will also bring gum for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Smokey, bear: Just the other day we were discussing whether the U.S. Forest 
Service's symbol has a middle name -- mainly, "the." After all, a famous song 
refers to him as "Smokey the Bear." But the lyricist appears to be in the 
minority.  
</P>
<P>
 We're siding with Caltrans, which recently re-christened Hungry Valley Road 
near Gorman off Interstate 5 as Smokey Bear Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the agency involved, we consider the name change a reminder to be 
careful in forests as well as on freeways, which are patrolled by CHP officers 
in Smokey the Bear hats. Pardon us, Smokey Bear hats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial Mrs. Smokey: Not that anyone would doubt Caltrans, but we 
are also in receipt of a note from Wiley Barker, who declares: "It is Smokey 
Bear, just as it is Steve Harvey, not Steve THE Harvey." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker speaks as an authority because, he says, it was his uncle, a game 
warden, who bestowed the name upon the burned cub found clinging to a blackened 
tree in New Mexico in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 An icon brought to life, Smokey moved to Washington, D.C., where he died in 
1976 at the age of 26. For a bear (or a rock 'n' roll star), that's about the 
equivalent of 70 in human years. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey, like many celebrities, didn't enjoy a fully satisfying life, sad to 
say. He was mated with a female named Goldie in 1962 but theirs was a cool 
relationship. She even socked him at his public retirement ceremony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, again, when they became a couple, Smokey was 11 and Goldie was 1. Talk 
about robbing the cradle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No sowing: We think of Pasadena as a staid, reserved sort of place. So we 
weren't surprised by the shot of the sign that Edwin Schander sent along. But 
Schander explained that the warning actually refers to a nearby health food 
store called Wild Oats, whose customers were allegedly parking illegally in the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More tributes to the English language: Sherry Gottlieb of Santa Monica found a 
glaring omission from our list of beautiful passages that deserve to be 
included in KLSX radio's coming "Poetry of Rock" exhibit of "handwritten, 
signed lyrics to classic songs." 
</P>
<P>
 In her novel, "Love Bite," Gootlieb recalls this line from the song, "Witch 
Doctor": "Ou-ee, ou-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla bing-bang." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is a good way to sign off. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, this is Steve The Harvey. miscelLAny:

 We spotted a truck owned by one discount chain that said: "Driver carries only 
99 cents." Funny, but we can't remember the name of the chain.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 7TH 
WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT FILED IN APARTMENT COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hyun Sook Lee, whose family met tragedy in the Jan. 17 earthquake, Tuesday 
filed the seventh wrongful death lawsuit against the builder and owner of the 
Northridge Meadows apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other lawsuits, it alleges that construction flaws contributed to the 
collapse of her apartment's walls and ceiling, which killed Lee's husband, Pil, 
and son, Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Families of seven of the 16 people who died at Northridge Meadows have sued, 
and more lawsuits are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a nurse, said her lawsuit "is not about greed. Sometimes people have to 
stand up for their rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyers, William J. Downey III and Myron M. Kim, said the suit seeks 
unspecified monetary damages to provide for the education of Lee's son, Jason, 
12, and to allow the Lees to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been relying on the charity of friends and members of their church 
to scrape by, and that's not something that a proud family like the Lees wants 
to continue," Downey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pil Lee, a Korean-educated engineer, was an RTD mechanic. Howard Lee was a 
student who aspired to be a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Lee searched all day for mementos in the ruins of Apt. 101. She 
was able to retrieve some photographs, and a video and a battered Asian chest. 
But her wedding ring, like many other items, was nowhere to be found.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
EXPANDS BENEFITS FOR UNMARRIED COUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday voted to move ahead with increased 
benefits for unmarried domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, the council in February 
approved health and dental benefits for heterosexual and homosexual partners.On 
Tuesday, the council voted to extend the benefits to include disability 
insurance, the employee assistance program and catastrophic illness leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council directed the city attorney to prepare a charter 
amendment that would enable the city to offer pension benefits to domestic 
partners, which the city defines as couples over age 18 who have lived with 
each other for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, seven employees have applied for the benefits. Officials estimate that 
less than 2% of the city's employees will apply, which could cost the city 
about $1 million. The city now pays about $22 million in spousal benefits.

JURY RETURNS SPLIT VERDICT IN TOXIC SUBSTANCES SUIT; COURTS: HALF OF THE 20 
CHEMICAL FIRMS NAMED BY HUNDREDS OF LOCKHEED WORKERS DID NOT GIVE ADEQUATE 
HEALTH WARNINGS, PANEL FINDS. BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors rendered a split verdict Tuesday in the first phase of a marathon toxic 
exposure trial, ruling that Lockheed workers may proceed with injury claims 
against 10 of 20 chemical firms accused of failing to provide adequate warnings 
on the health risks of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, after three weeks of deliberations in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
sets the stage for a final trial phase in which jurors are to decide if the 
workers were harmed by chemicals supplied by the 10 companies, and if 
inadequate warnings were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-month-old trial stems from claims by more than 600 Lockheed workers and 
involves dozens of chemical products -- including solvents, primers and epoxies 
-- used to build the Stealth fighter and other military aircraft at Lockheed's 
Burbank manufacturing complex during the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, who are seeking unspecified damages, say they suffered injuries 
ranging from eye and skin irritation to cancer because the chemical suppliers 
did not adequately explain the health risks or necessary safety precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who waded through scores of questions on a 47-page verdict form, found 
that 10 of the 20 chemical suppliers, including industry giants DuPont and 
Ashland, were guilty of negligence for failing to provide adequate warnings in 
the material safety data sheets that accompanied shipments of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that two of these companies -- Dexter Corp. and J.T. Baker Inc. 
-- also could be liable for punitive damages because their failures constituted 
"despicable conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on whether punitive damages could be sought against four 
firms. In those cases, at least nine of 12 jurors agreed that the companies 
failed to provide adequate warnings, but fewer than nine could agree if they 
were liable for punitive damages. Lawyers for the workers could seek a retrial 
of the mistrial counts at a separate proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict removed the other 10 defendants from the second phase. Six of this 
group -- including Arco, Shell and Unocal -- were found to have supplied enough 
safety information. Jurors could not agree on the warnings provided by the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the case declared victory. "It's spectacular," said Thomas V. 
Girardi, lead attorney for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful result. After 10 years of litigation, we have a decision 
that half of these chemical companies and oil companies are liable. . . . We're 
very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. McMillan, one of the chemical companies' lawyers, said: "This is a 
very poor showing on the part of the plaintiffs because they certainly threw 
all they had at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The result "confirms our general belief that the cases are without merit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before collecting damages, lawyers for the plaintiffs must persuade jurors 
that the workers were injured by toxic exposure and would have taken adequate 
precautions if properly warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase, to begin Monday, will be confined to the health claims of 14 
"pilot" plaintiffs, although the result probably will guide settlements with 
more of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 After sending the jurors home, Judge Richard C. Hubbell addressed a courtroom 
filled with lawyers, wondering aloud if the removal of many chemical products 
from the case weakens the claims of any of the 14 workers. He asked the lawyers 
to consider before Monday if a settlement is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-stage trial is an attempt at simplification after the fruitless result 
of a previous trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The original trial lasted eight months and ended in a mistrial last year after 
12 weeks of jury deliberations -- the longest deliberations in a civil trial in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the first trial started in mid-1992, Lockheed was dismissed as 
a defendant after agreeing to pay a $33-million settlement. Chemical company 
lawyers have contended that Lockheed is among the world's most sophisticated 
users of chemicals and was responsible for the safety of its workers. However, 
the Lockheed settlement has not been disclosed to jurors to avoid influencing 
them.

WILLIAMS CALLS FOR STREAMLINING OF JAIL SYSTEM; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE CHIEF 
PROPOSES CLOSING FOUR FACILITIES TO FREE MORE OFFICERS FOR STREET DUTY. CRITICS 
SAY IT COULD INCREASE RESPONSE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams has proposed closing four police 
jails -- two of them at San Fernando Valley police stations -- as a way of 
improving the jail system and putting more officers on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have told department officials that the plan could increase the 
time it takes police to respond to calls for help because they would have to 
travel farther to drop off suspects for bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officials said the move, if approved by the Police Commission and 
City Council, would result in better protection overall for the community 
because it would free more officers for street duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was prompted by Williams' concerns that there was no uniform way 
of operating the jails, which has made it necessary for many patrol officers to 
fill in at positions usually filled by non-sworn but specially trained jailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current policy, the captains overseeing most of the Police Department's 
18 divisions manage the jails in their own stations, but officials Downtown 
oversee the much larger jail at Parker Center headquarters and another large 
lockup at the department's Van Nuys-based Valley headquarters. All the 
facilities are used to house arrestees while they are awaiting arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fractured management . . . promotes inconsistency and leaves the door 
open to unfavorable civil judgments," Williams said in a report received May 3 
by the Police Commission. "The extensive amount of patrol officers and 
uniformed sergeants to supplement and supervise custody functions in area jails 
is also unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jail Consolidation Plan proposed by the chief, the department would 
close the North Hollywood, Reseda, West Los Angeles and 77th Street police 
lockups, the last of which is slated to close anyway as part of a plan to build 
a new station. The timeworn North Hollywood station will make way for a new 
station without jail facilities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved by the Police Commission at its May 17 meeting, 
officers from the North Hollywood and West Valley divisions would have to 
transport prisoners to the Van Nuys Division jail, a move that would require 
more commuting time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams said he supports the proposal because of the uniformity of 
running the jails under a central command -- the LAPD's Jail Division -- and 
because of the money saved under the measure. The chief said the closures would 
result in a net decrease of 18 employees assigned to the jails, saving $195,756 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also would save $1 million by not having to build a jail along 
with the new North Hollywood station, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Frank Piersol, whose staff prepared the report, said the 
issues of staffing and response time will be among those studied when the plan 
goes before the Police Commission in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also is studying whether some uniformed officers able to 
perform only light field duty because of injury or disability may be used to 
help ferry arrestees to lockups and process the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some resistance in the department to this proposal," said Capt. 
Michael Melton, commanding officer of the LAPD's Jail Division. But he said the 
advantages outweigh any potential disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question about it. If an officer in West Valley has to drive to 
Van Nuys to book arrestees, there will be some additional time lost to travel," 
he said. "But you are saving some patrol time by not having to assign them to 
the jails. And it improves consistency because these officers are not trained 
as jailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of closing jails," he added, "is not to save money, but to better 
manage the jail operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, each police station jail would not only have entry-level 
jailer positions but highly trained supervisors as well. When a jailer was out 
sick or their position was vacant, Melton said, he would send someone from one 
of the two larger lockup facilities instead of relying on uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
 This would ensure that those handling arrestees are trained to do so, instead 
of the current haphazard system, Melton said. "You can see how that would 
create some problems in continuity, consistency and training," he said. "It 
makes sense that the command be the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Martin H. Pomeroy, who commands all Valley police divisions, said 
the move was prompted in part by budgetary constraints. But he said the travel 
time for officers taking arrestees to be booked would be only a few minutes at 
most, compared with the time-consuming task of actually booking them at the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the new North Hollywood station will be closer to the Van Nuys 
jail, making it less important to have a jail facility in the North Hollywood 
station.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE WATCHDOG WITH SCANT TIME TO WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Grand Jury is supposed to be the people's watchdog, 
exposing corruption and inefficiency in government from the Civic Center to 
small suburban city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone familiar with the process knows, that isn't how it works. Actually, 
the grand jury consists of civic-minded, part-time volunteers whose primary job 
is to decide whether to indict accused criminals. Just a small portion of their 
time is devoted to a second but equally important part of the grand jury's 
assignment -- examining the efficiency and honesty of our officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart politicians have long been aware of the situation. So when reporters 
uncover waste or dirty dealings, the pols immediately turn the matter over to 
the grand jury. They do this knowing the overworked panel will never have time 
to investigate. It's like dumping a potential scandal into a bottomless pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the aura of the grand jury remains. The judges, who appoint the 
jurors, add to this by wrapping the operation in secrecy, insisting that what 
happens in the jury room must remain confidential for the term of the jurors 
and sometimes forever after. A few years ago, several grand jurors were unhappy 
with the support county officials were giving them on an investigation. A few 
wanted to complain to the press. But the presiding judge warned them they faced 
the possibility of prosecution if they talked. Understandably, they remained 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 You can imagine my surprise when I received a call from Richard Mankiewicz, a 
member of the 1992-93 grand jury. He said he and a fellow juror, Don Dodd, 
thought the system stank. They wanted to go public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mankiewicz, a retired management consultant, is liberal. Dodd, a retired Air 
Force contracting administrator, is conservative. "We are exact opposites on 
anything you could imagine," Mankiewicz explained when I met the two of them. 
But they agreed on one thing -- the failings of the grand jury. Together, they 
wrote down their thoughts on two single-spaced pages, which they handed to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grand Jury. That sounds impressive," they said. "After all, the law 
empowers it to investigate, without fear or favor, government operations 
anywhere in the county and to make recommendations for their improvement. . . . 
The law even requires that those who were the subjects of the investigation 
respond to the jury's recommendations in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently, we . . . were given copies of the responses to the recommendations 
we made to the County Board of Supervisors. Reading the flatulently evasive and 
generally unresponsive answers made it plain to us just how ineffectual grand 
juries are. . . . One cannot escape the conclusion that grand juries are merely 
meant to give the appearance of citizen watchdogs but (are) prevented from 
acting as such." 
</P>
<P>
 They said a major weakness is that the jury "is pretty much a flunky of the 
district attorney." A deputy district attorney is assigned as adviser to the 
jury and keeps it busy four days a week on criminal matters, "with precious 
little time left for government oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 When we talked, they expanded on the involvement of county lawyers. Another 
legal arm of the county, the county counsel is the jury adviser on many 
non-criminal matters, such as government malfeasance. Both Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti and County Counsel DeWitt Clinton are powerful members of the county 
government Establishment, a group notably allergic to watchdogs. "They've got a 
conflict of interest," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mankiewicz and Dodd noted that the law permits creation of a second grand 
jury. It could spend all its time investigating government. They recommended 
adequate outside advice to end dependence on county lawyers and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after our meeting, I was invited by a member of the current grand 
jury to have lunch with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 I read portions of the Dodd-Mankiewicz memo to the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of them agreed with the main points. Like Mankiewicz and Dodd, they 
are overwhelmed with criminal cases. They said the county needed a second -- 
watchdog -- grand jury. One said jurors had actually broached the idea to 
judges and the D.A.'s office, but were told there was no room for a second jury 
to meet in the crowded Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror scoffed at that, noting that another court building, just a couple 
of miles away, was two-thirds empty. The fact is, the juror said, the county 
just doesn't want a full-time investigating grand jury poking around. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror had it right. The county judges and lawyers fear tough, inquisitive 
jurors. What's most important to them is protecting their own interests, and 
those of other county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mankiewicz and Dodd wrote, until this changes, "it is our view that it is a 
mistake for anyone to serve on the Los Angeles County Grand Jury."

HUNTINGTON PARK POLICE CHIEF STEPS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Park Police Chief Frank Sullivan has left his post in a move to 
calm the turmoil in his 65-officer department, which has been torn by 
allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the best interest of the city, the chief and the City Council have made 
the decision for the chief to retire in November," Mayor Ric Loya said Tuesday 
in a statement."Because we don't want a lame-duck chief, the chief will go on 
leave now with an interim chief to come on board as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan did not return calls from The Times, but city officials said the City 
Council met in closed session for more than three hours Monday to discuss the 
chief, whose job has been in question in recent months amid various 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is facing a wrongful termination suit by a female former officer that 
names the chief and the city, while a second female officer has filed a sexual 
harassment complaint that names Sullivan and another officer, according to 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the city settled an anti-Semitic harassment suit for $355,000. 
Detective Alan Tavelman, who said he was subjected to religious slurs and 
harassment throughout his nine years on the force, named Sullivan in that suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, 49, turned over his duties to Capt. Daniel A. Leili on Tuesday, 
officials said. A 27-year department veteran, Sullivan will continue to collect 
his $7,714 monthly salary until he becomes eligible for retirement benefits in 
November. Leili will serve as acting chief until an interim chief is hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers said the city was considering a 
retired chief from another city as an interim replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members would not comment directly on the reasons for Sullivan's 
departure.

CLOSED-DOWN LANDMARK GETS FIXTURES BACK; DESIGN: PRESERVATIONISTS HAIL THE 
AGREEMENT BY R. H. MACY TO RETURN DECORATIONS AND FURNISHINGS TO FORMER 
BULLOCKS WILSHIRE SITE. THE BUILDING WILL BE TURNED INTO A LAW LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A standoff over Los Angeles cultural heritage ended Tuesday with the 
announcement that R. H. Macy & Co. has returned nearly all the historically 
significant fixtures and furnishings it removed last year from its closed 
Bullocks Wilshire store. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders and preservationists had campaigned vigorously for the return of 
chandeliers, furniture, clocks, urns, fireplace screens, sconces and other 
fixtures moved out of the landmark 1929 Art Deco building. They warmly greeted 
the transfer back of 166 items and described the agreement as a national 
precedent for historic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sweet ending," said Mary Alice Wollam, a Bullocks Wilshire expert 
with the Los Angeles Conservancy, the local preservationist group. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy executives, she said, came to realize that Bullocks Wilshire "is perhaps 
the most beloved building in Los Angeles and that the people of Los Angeles 
have such wonderful memories of the store, of shopping there, of having lunch 
there, of taking their children there." 
</P>
<P>
 The fixtures are expected to be back on public display after the former 
department store in the once-elegant but now struggling mid-Wilshire 
neighborhood is converted into a law library next year. The five-story store, 
with its signature copper-clad tower, became part of R. H. Macy's I. Magnin 
chain in 1988 and was closed in April, 1993. Currently embroiled in corporate 
bankruptcy reorganization, Macy is selling the lease to the nearby Southwestern 
University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Macy spokeswoman Laura Melillo said the company was pleased to 
announce what she described as the fixtures' transfers from warehouses and I. 
Magnin stores around California. "I think everyone has a very deep appreciation 
for the building," Melillo said. "We are happy we can act in concert with and 
in support of those persons who want to maintain the historic nature of the 
building, and we think we have." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came after a year of delicate negotiations and angry 
protests, highlighted by the conservancy's Christmas season leaflet campaign in 
front of local I. Magnin stores. Also last December, Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan sent a letter to Macy executives, urging the fixtures' return. A Los 
Angeles citizens' task force lobbied as well. 
</P>
<P>
 According to both sides, final agreement was delayed by squabbles over which 
furnishings were original to the store. Matters were said to be further 
complicated by Macy's bankruptcy and by the Jan. 17 earthquake, which damaged 
other Macy-owned stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 166 returned items were all those pieces proved through photographic 
records to be from 1929. The retailer kept 40 or so fixtures, chairs and tables 
that the city and conservancy originally sought, but many of those were not 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 The main sour note Tuesday was that Macy's held on to two 1920s Lalique 
crystal chandeliers that were moved in 1972 from Downtown's Oviatt Building 
into the Bullocks Wilshire store. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists said those chandeliers, now hanging in an I. Magnin store in 
San Francisco, would be important to the ambience of the law library. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was something we had to give up as part of the compromise, but it is not 
something we remain bitter about because we feel happy about the overall 
results," said Rodney Punt, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles 
Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullocks Wilshire is designated as a Los Angeles historic and cultural 
monument and is on the National Register of Historic Places. But municipal and 
federal law protected only the building, not the movable fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's decision is thought to be the first major return of historic fixtures 
by a property owner who was not required by law to do so, said Jack Rubens, an 
attorney who is on the conservancy board and negotiated with the retailer. "We 
believe that it is unprecedented," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Described as a cathedral of commerce when it opened, the building on Wilshire 
Boulevard just east of Vermont Avenue was designed -- down to its radiator 
covers and drinking fountains -- to project an aura of modern luxury. The 
structure's famous rose marble interior walls and Moderne-style murals remain 
intact, as does its granite and copper exterior. But its windows are boarded up 
and most rooms are ghostly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubens and Wollam on Tuesday visited the returned fixtures, which are being 
stored primarily in crates and boxes in Bullocks Wilshire. Like greeting old 
friends, Wollam enthusiastically inspected such items as brass wall lamps 
decorated with sculptures of swans, a brass clock and a companion urn that used 
to grace a mantle in a second-floor French-style salon, and a large brass 
flower-like chandelier that formerly hung in a first-floor sportswear 
department. Groups of Art Deco and Empire-style chairs were locked up in fenced 
storage rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than fun," Wollam said, peering into boxes. Yet she added that 
"the real moment of triumph will come when the people of Los Angeles see this 
all back in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern University, just across a side street from the old store, is 
expected to take over the Bullocks Wilshire building the first week in June, 
said school spokeswoman Leslie Steinberg. The fixtures will remain in storage 
during restoration and construction work that is expected to continue until the 
end of 1995, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly don't want to put things up until we finish the work, so they 
are not damaged," Steinberg said. She described the fixtures and furnishings as 
mainly in excellent condition. The library will be open for public tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech owns the store property and had filed a court motion in Macy's 
bankruptcy case, seeking the fixtures' return under terms of the ground lease. 
That matter was never argued in court and now apparently is moot, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena faced a similar situation in 1985 when a new owner removed about 50 
original light fixtures from the Blacker House, a 1907 Craftsman masterpiece 
designed by local architects Charles and Henry Greene. The fixtures were not 
recovered, but Pasadena then passed an ordinance making it illegal to alter any 
Greene and Greene home without first notifying the city. Pasadena does not ban 
fixture removal but would delay it for negotiations.

DODGERS ESCAPE IN 10TH; BASEBALL: THEY EDGE THE ASTROS FOR THE SECOND NIGHT IN 
A ROW, 5-4, ON A BOTCHED PLAY AT THE PLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the best defenses in the National League faltered Tuesday night, and 
its timing couldn't have been worse. Houston Astro third baseman Ken Caminiti, 
double-clutching a routine grounder with the bases loaded in the 10th inning, 
made a wide throw home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gwynn, running for Mike Piazza, slid into the plate and was called safe 
when catcher Tony Eusebio lunged for the ball, umpire Randy Marsh ruling 
Eusebio's foot had come off the bag, giving the Dodgers a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Dodgers' fourth extra-inning victory, and it came on the heels of a 
9-8 ninth-inning comeback victory Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, hoping to revisit their glory years, showed again how they plan 
to get there as their young nucleus of Eric Karros, Mike Piazza and Raul 
Mondesi combined for seven of the team's 13 hits and also sparkled defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here in 1992 they were going in the direction of younger 
players, but we were more heavily loaded with guys from other teams," said 
Karros, who was three for five with a home run. "But the club made a commitment 
to younger guys and some took advantage of it, and some didn't. So far, it's 
worked out well, but it's still early. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still not at .500. But some guys have stepped up to fill in the holes 
and hopefully the club will produce a winner for a few years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's leadoff grounder to center started the 10th, and a double by Karros, 
who had homered in the second, put Gwynn on third. After an intentional walk to 
Cory Snyder, Carlos Hernandez's grounder off reliever Mitch Williams scored the 
winning run on Eusebio's error. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hit right to Caminiti, so I knew I was out," Gwynn said. "So I was 
just trying to take out (Eusebio) so he can't turn two." 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a turnaround in a game that was full of great defensive plays, 
featuring the new rookie of the year candidate, Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi threw out Craig Biggio by a car length when he tried to stretch a 
single in the sixth. In the 10th, Mondesi ran down a hard-hit liner by 
Caminiti, catching the ball and hitting the right field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know I have an arm, so I don't know why they keep running," said 
Mondesi, rewarded with two standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great to see the fans get behind him," said Piazza, who was two for 
five. "As a player you feed off it and it gets your adrenaline going. This 
ballclub has a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi had a chance to win the game in the ninth, but Brett Butler missed the 
bunt on a squeeze play and Mondesi, trying to score from third, was tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, in the on-deck circle in the 10th, was called back in favor of 
left-handed batter Henry Rodriguez. The Astros, who had lost their leader when 
Manager Terry Collins was ejected during the ninth for arguing a call, had a 
right-handed reliever on the mound, and Manager Tom Lasorda likes to play the 
percentages.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad, but we won, so it's OK," said Mondesi, whose double in the fourth 
inning put the Dodgers ahead, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Astros countered with the left-handed Williams, who gave up three runs 
in the ninth inning Monday to lose the game. Lasorda countered with Hernandez 
with the bases loaded and one out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate losing no matter how we lose, " Williams said. "I'm not responsible 
for calling the play, I never saw (Eusebio's) foot leave the plate, it looked 
to me like he was out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick to death of all this . . . . no one in this league is going to give 
you respect. You have to go out and earn it. I am going to keep going out there 
and doing what I have to do. " 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Ramon Martinez turned in a solid effort, holding the Astros to five 
hits and four runs in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott (4-1) pitched a perfect 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez struggled for most of his first five starts this season, before 
breaking through last Thursday against the San Francisco Giants, when he earned 
his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He struggled through the fourth inning Tuesday, helping the Astros take a 2-1 
lead with two walks. But he retired the final six batters in order, before 
giving way to Mitch Webster, who pinch hit in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 10th inning, the game was worth watching for its defense.

ANGELS CAUGHT IN RAIN; BASEBALL: WEATHER AND CURFEW LEAVE THEM TIED WITH 
RANGERS AFTER EIGHT INNINGS, 5-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez sat in the clubhouse Tuesday night during 
the 2-hour, 48-minute rain delay, and couldn't have cared less if the game was 
going to be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not be playing anyway against the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in 
Arlington, and he will not be playing today when the suspended game resumes in 
the ninth inning with the score tied at 5-5. The game will be played at 4:30 
p.m. PDT, one hour before the scheduled third game of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's game, which resumed at 11:02 p.m., was suspended because of American 
League rules that prohibit any inning starting after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and outfielder Dwight Smith were the only position players not used 
Tuesday, but if Perez's fears are correct, it might be weeks before he plays 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it's senseless continuing this way, Perez expects to be placed on the 
15-day disabled list and replaced by first baseman J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum is scheduled to examine Perez's left wrist today to determine 
if surgery is necessary, but the Angels already have decided he will be placed 
on the disabled list, retroactive to May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing anyone any good right now," Perez said. "I just can't do 
anything with this hand. It hurts to catch the ball. It hurts to hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get healthy again so I don't waste this whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez will undergo an arthrogram today to determine the severity of the 
ligament sprain and cartilage tear in his left wrist, but he fears that he 
could be sidelined the rest of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to getting healthy again," he said, "no matter how 
long it takes. I mean, look at me. I know I'm not a .200 hitter, but I just 
can't do anything about it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Buck Rodgers: "I'm not going to play a guy who indicates he can't 
play. We can always back-date him on the DL, but obviously that doesn't mean 
anything if you have to operate on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is expected to rejoin the Angels on Friday when they open a three-game 
series in Seattle. He is batting .290 at Vancouver this season with a 
club-leading five homers and 22 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the biggest suspense of the evening was whether the Angels and 
Rangers could get the game played, with Angel third baseman Damion Easley 
eventually tying the game in the seventh with a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was stopped in the third inning, with the Angels leading, 2-0. It was 
almost called, but the weather cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it had been more than three hours since Phil Leftwich pitched, he 
insisted he return to the game. He threw three times in the clubhouse, and 
besides, he said, this was nothing compared to his college days when he would 
pitch both games of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich completed his five innings, yielding three hits and one run, and left 
the game with a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, this is where we want the game stopped so no one gets hurt," Angel 
General Manager Bill Bavasi joked in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just about this time when the public-address system began blaring, 
"It's a Beautiful Morning," with the clock striking midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich's hopes for a victory vanished in the sixth inning. Juan Gonzalez 
tied the game with a two-out, two-run single off reliever Joe Grahe. The 
Rangers then took a 5-3 lead when Grahe loaded the bases and Manuel Lee hit a 
two-run single into right field. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had its share of quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who never produced more than four home runs in 
any of his six professional seasons, hit his second homer in five days in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 A fan ran onto the field to retrieve a foul ball, jumped back into the stands, 
and threw the ball back onto the field when security arrived. He normally would 
have been promptly escorted off, but considering that he was among the faithful 
few who endured the delay, he was allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the scene with Angel starter Chuck Finley and infielder Rex Hudler 
borrowing brooms to sweep water out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the crowd that began with 24,054 fans, and ended with less than 
1,000, perhaps wondering why they bothered to stay.

 Russell Prowse, an Australian Rules football player who plays for Cardross in 
the Millawa League, thought a fight was developing during last week's game in 
Melbourne against Bambill. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trading blows, though, Prowse grabbed Scott Cameron of Bambill by 
the cheeks and kissed him on the lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron staggered back in amazement and the potential fight evaporated, but 
umpire Tony Cox banished Prowse from the field for misconduct.

President Keith Leach said.

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE; DAVIS AND DAVIS PICK UP THE PACE AGAINST 
HAWKS, 96-85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Davis put on a show in the third quarter. Dale Davis wasn't quite so 
spectacular but was just as potent. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Davis came off the bench to score 12 of his 15 points in the third 
quarter as Indiana overcame a 12-point, first-half deficit Tuesday night and 
beat Atlanta, 96-85, in Game 1 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Davis, like Antonio Davis a power forward, started and played 41 minutes, 
grabbing 15 rebounds and scoring 14 points on seven-of-11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Davis made seven of nine shots and had six rebounds in 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely tried to come out and play hard and hit the boards in the third 
quarter," said Antonio Davis, who scored three of his baskets after offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana has won 12 consecutive games, including all four it has played in the 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about both Davises," Indiana Coach Larry Brown said. "We 
had to have some people come in off the bench and step up. These two kids have 
done it in every playoff game so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Hawks, who advanced to the second round for the first time 
since 1988 by beating Miami in five games, led during the first quarter, 23-11, 
and, 53-47, at halftime before Antonio Davis keyed a third-quarter surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we just got tired in the third quarter," Atlanta center Jon Koncak 
said. "But they were tough inside, especially the Davis guys. They were 14 for 
20 between them. That broke our backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller led five Pacers in double figures with 18 points. Danny Manning 
led the Hawks with 21.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; SHARKS ONE VICTORY AWAY FROM THE CONFERENCE FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sergei Makarov had two goals and two assists Tuesday night to lead the San 
Jose Sharks to a 5-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs at San Jose. The 
victory gave the Sharks a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Linemate Igor Larionov added three assists for the surprising Sharks, who 
return to Toronto with two chances to finish out the series when it resumes 
Thursday night. The winner will advance to the Western Conference finals 
against the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Makarov, who with Larionov and Johan Garpenlov make up the Sharks' top-scoring 
line, hadn't scored a goal in the series. But the trio was dominating during 
the first period and accounted for the Sharks' first four goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Makarov, a 35-year-old Russian, has eight playoff goals, tying him for the 
league lead, while his countryman, Larionov, has 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shark goaltender Arturs Irbe, rebounding from a disastrous Game 5 outing, 
stopped 27 shots. He stopped all eight during the third period to preserve San 
Jose's 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's Felix Potvin turned back 22 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing Sunday, 8-3, the Sharks got off to a fast start when Makarov 
capitalized on a Toronto turnover in the neutral zone and skated in on Potvin 
for a break-away goal. Makarov's eight-foot wrist shot beat the Toronto goalie 
to the stick side 1:17 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Dallas 2 -- Pavel Bure scored two goals at Vancouver to help the 
Canucks close out the series and advance to the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks won for the seventh time in eight games. They won four of five 
against the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver returned to the conference final for the first time since 1982, when 
the Canucks eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan La Fayette and Bure scored in the first period, Murray Craven in the 
second and Bure again in the third as the Canucks outscored Dallas in the 
series, 18-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellout crowd cheered wildly when Bure scored on a breakaway with less 
than four minutes to play for a three-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Modano and Dave Gagner, both on power plays, were the only Dallas players 
to beat Vancouver goaltender Kirk McLean.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is no coincidence that the Dodgers are at or near the top of the National 
League in most offensive categories and Reggie Smith is in his first season as 
their hitting instructor. . . . "Reggie has played a huge role in what I've 
been able to do," said Tim Wallach after hitting his 10th home run Monday 
night, a two-run blast with two out in the ninth inning that brought the most 
exciting Dodger team in years a 9-8 victory over the Houston Astros. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helped me not only physically, but mentally," Wallach said. "He 
constantly challenges you to get things done. He's a great motivator who has 
been able to make me concentrate better." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How does a hitting coach help resurrect the career of a 36-year-old third 
baseman who seemed washed up after three consecutive sub-par seasons? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a partnership," Smith said. "Tim has shown a lot of trust and 
dedication and a willingness to admit he needed to make adjustments. As for 
technique, I won't go into details, but he's no longer a lunger and he doesn't 
have an up swing or a down swing." . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 49, had been a minor league hitting instructor in the Dodger 
organization since 1989 and is credited with speeding the progress of such 
younger players as Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi, Henry Rodriguez, and 
Jose Offerman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie works very hard," Tom Lasorda said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He is able to gain immediate respect from pupils who realize he was one of the 
best hitters in the major leagues during a 17-year career, batting more than 
.300 seven times and ranking third behind Mickey Mantle and Eddie Murray as a 
switch-hitting home run hitter with 314. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith signed after graduating from Centennial High in 1963, he had a 
pretty fair batting tutor named Ted Williams in the Boston Red Sox minor league 
camp. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ted taught me the importance of looking for the proper pitch to hit and how 
to use my hips to generate bat speed and power," he said. . . . Now Smith is 
passing on those tips and a lot more and it is showing in the box scores. . . .

</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields is off to a slow start with the Dodgers after arriving from 
Montreal for Pedro Martinez, but the second baseman from Villanova remains a 
class act. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Great move, skipper," DeShields told Lasorda after being lifted for 
pinch-hitter Piazza with two out in the ninth Monday and watching him respond 
with a two-run single that brought the Dodgers to within a run of the Astros. . 
. . The night opened on a positive note when Davis Gaines sang the national 
anthem the way it is supposed to be sung. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if the Texas Rangers move in the left-field fence next 
season at The Ballpark, where the power of right-handed hitters Juan Gonzalez 
and Jose Canseco is being wasted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are more pitchers than ever before, but fewer good ones. Remember when 
most teams carried nine or 10 pitchers? Now there are only four teams in the 
major leagues that have fewer than 11. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most underappreciated players is Astro first baseman Jeff Bagwell. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The NBA draft lottery will be held May 22 and the draft June 29. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Mike Krzyzewski for canceling a series of Duke basketball games 
in Australia because his players didn't perform as well in the classroom as on 
the court. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former welterweight contender Armando Muniz is a candidate for supervisor in 
Riverside County. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North is such a dominant force in the handicap division that only 
three or four horses are expected to challenge him in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap 
on Sunday at Hollywood Park. However, Del Mar Dennis could give him a race if 
he continues to show the improvement he displayed in winning the San Bernardino 
Handicap at Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing the Rams might have done on draft day was trade with the San 
Francisco 49ers and allow that NFC West rival to pick Notre Dame defensive 
lineman Bryant Young, who could become an impact player. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings didn't make the playoffs, but TV announcer Bob Miller and radio 
analyst Brian Engblom did. They are working for ESPN2. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the last NHL game has been played at Chicago Stadium, the loudest 
building in hockey is the San Jose Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is mind-boggling that no member of the New York Rangers, who appear to be 
the class of the NHL, is a finalist for any of the league's awards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can tell me there are three better defensemen than Brian Leetch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I felt a little older Tuesday when I found out that Cey hit a home run for 
California against USC -- freshman second baseman Dan Cey, son of Ron.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: LION ATTACKS RARE, BUT STAY PREPARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large cougar rushes a 3-year-old child, crouches into the attack position 
and, just as it is about to leap upon the unsuspecting infant, his father 
drives the animal away by shouting and charging it with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the scenario Sunday afternoon in the San Diego wilderness. An Arizona 
family was hiking in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. The child was fortunate. His 
father acted correctly. The mountain lion, an 83-pound female, was tracked and 
killed early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But with camping season beginning in earnest this month, and encounters 
between cougars and humans making news with alarming regularity, some might be 
having second thoughts about whether to risk venturing into the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent sightings and encounters -- and notably the death late last 
month of a jogger running alone on a remote Northern California trail -- 
experts say the chances of crossing paths with a mountain lion are still slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing a wild lion . . . that's still an unusual event," said Terry 
Mansfield, chief of wildlife management division for the Department of Fish and 
Game. "I've been in woods, either working and hunting or whatever for well over 
35 years, and on only three occasions have I ever seen a lion that I wasn't 
tracking for research purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, wildlife experts acknowledge that there is reason for concern, and the 
DFG offers the following advice for anyone planning a hiking or camping trip 
this summer: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not hike alone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep a close watch on children and stay close to them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not approach a lion and if you encounter one, give it a route to escape. 
Most lions will try to avoid confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not run from a lion as it might stimulate its instinct to chase. That's 
one theory as to why a lion might have attacked 40-year-old Barbara Schoener, 
who was killed while jogging northeast of Sacramento on April 23. Paul Beier of 
the Department of Forestry and Resource Management at UC Berkeley documented 
attacks in Canada and the United States in the last 100 years. Beier's report 
stated that in only one "credible near-attack" did a victim actually appear to 
benefit from running. "A 16-year-old boy fled after encountering a cougar at 25 
feet," the report said. "The cougar was gaining ground rapidly when the boy's 
boot fell off and the cougar attacked and ate the boot." If you have small 
children, pick them up so they don't panic and run. Do not turn your back on 
the lion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not crouch down or bend over. One researcher, basing his studies on 
tigers and leopards, found that people crouching might look more like a cat's 
natural prey than a person standing up.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Do all you can to appear larger and make a lot of noise. Raise your arms, 
open your jacket, throw rocks or sticks, and yell.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, fight back if attacked. The father using a stick to protect his 
son in San Diego wasn't the first to discourage a lion from attacking. Others 
have used stones, garden tools and even bare hands to ward of an attack. And if 
there is an encounter, report it to authorities as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER FISHING -- What a few white seabass won't do for business. The 
popular game fish started showing in sizable schools off Santa Catalina Island 
last Friday, and now overnight boats are carrying full loads. One-fish limits 
are still the rule, but then many feel the chance of catching even one 30-pound 
white seabass is preferable to reeling in listless rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Some reported multiple catches of striped marlin a few miles 
out off Cabo Real, but fishing remains slower than normal for stripers. 
Remarkably, some of the best fishing is taking place on the beaches. Surf 
fishermen are reportedly reeling in sierra mackerel, jack crevalle, amberjack, 
pargo and even small yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Del Cabo: Smooth seas are making for an easy trip to Vinorama, where 
an excellent yellowfin tuna bite is in progress. Anglers have posted double 
figures of fish from football-size to 30 pounds. Marlin fishing is fair. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: The best place for striped marlin, with boats averaging at least 
one per day. Roosterfish action is picking up along the beaches. Most unusual 
catch: a 400-pound sunfish by members of a group from Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: Anglers aboard the Vagabond, fishing at San Benitos, 
returned to Point Loma Sportfishing on Sunday with 141 yellowtail to 31 pounds 
and sacks full of rockfish and calico bass.  
</P>
<P>
 CALENDAR -- Penn Fishing University is holding a free seminar on lingcod, 
halibut and shallow water rockfish tonight from 7-9 p.m. at Sports Chalet in 
West Hills. Ronnie Kovach and Fred Benko are the featured speakers. Details: 
(818) 710-0999. . . . The annual Spring Boat Show at Fairplex Park in Pomona 
will be held May 14-22. Hours are 1-9 p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday 
and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday. . . . Volunteers are needed for the annual Disabled 
Kid's Fishing Day at Santa Ana River Lakes on May 20 from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. 
at Santa Ana River Lakes. Details: (714) 632-7851.

FISHING REPORT: TROUT ARE BIG STORY AS TOURNAMENT NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If fishing remains as good as it has been in recent weeks, this year's May 
Trout Classic, Saturday and Sunday at Big Bear Lake, could be one of the most 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 All the marinas are weighing in limits, but it is the size of the fish that 
has everyone's attention. Al D'Emanuele of Fawnskin, Calif., used a glob of red 
and green Power Bait to lure an eight-pound trout, and Gordon Griffith of 
Lancaster used a Rapala lure to catch a 7-pound 4-ounce fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like we've got the lake primed for the tournament," Griffith said. The 
tournament, limited to 400 entries, is sold out.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; O'NEILL (.471) POWERS YANKEES OVER INDIANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill homered twice and doubled Tuesday night, raising his batting 
average to .471 and helping the New York Yankees to a 5-3 victory over the 
Cleveland Indians at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill leads the majors in hitting and on-base percentage (.578). He had solo 
homers in the second and eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, who have won five in a row, lead the majors with a 21-10 record. 
It's the first time since July of 1987 that they have had the best record in 
baseball this late in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Oakland 2 -- Mickey Tettleton hit a three-run homer during a 
five-run first inning at Detroit, helping send the A's to their 18th loss in 20 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland starter Todd Van Poppel (0-4) left the game in the second inning after 
a line drive off the bat of Tony Phillips struck him on the left thigh. Van 
Poppel gave up four hits and two walks in 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 16, Seattle 2 -- Robin Ventura, Joey Cora and Frank Thomas homered, 
and seldom-used Scott Sanderson pitched seven strong innings at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora had four runs batted in for the White Sox, who had 18 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanderson (3-0), the No. 5 man in Chicago's rotation, was making only his 
fourth start of the season and his first since April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 7, Kansas City 4 -- Shane Mack hit a three-run homer and rookie 
Carlos Pulido recorded his first major league victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, who made his major league debut April 9, went into the game with an 
0-3 record and a 7.36 earned-run average, but he shut out the Royals through 
the first five innings until his error led to a run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 9, Boston 5 -- Two wild pitches by Greg Harris sent home the tying 
and go-ahead runs in a six-run seventh inning that carried the Brewers at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston led, 5-2, before reliever Scott Bankhead got into trouble in the 
seventh. He retired leadoff hitter Jody Reed before giving up a run on singles 
by Jose Valentin and Matt Mieske and a double by Bill Spiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris (1-3) replaced Bankhead and loaded the bases by walking Turner Ward. 
Alex Diaz's single made the score 5-4, and Dave Nilsson then struck out 
swinging at a pitch in the dirt that got past catcher Damon Berryhill. Spiers 
scored on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pitches later, Harris fired the ball past Berryhill again, allowing Ward 
to race home. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Toronto 3 -- Mike Oquist pitched five innings of hitless relief 
at Baltimore for his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken homered and drove in two runs for the Orioles, who have won 10 of 
13. Chris Hoiles and Leo Gomez also had two RBIs.

 Tom Browning of the Cincinnati Reds was released from a San Diego hospital 
Tuesday, one day after suffering a broken left arm and collapsing during a game 
against the Padres Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's trainer said that there is a chance the 34-year-old left-hander 
will pitch again this season. The severity of the break was such that the 
popping sound of Browning's upper left arm could be heard in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds placed Browning, whose last two seasons were ended prematurely by 
injuries, on the 15-day disabled list.

Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I was told not to dive after balls in spring training," Sheffield 
said. "It's instinct."

because of a strained right knee. . . . The Brewers placed third baseman Kevin 
Seitzer on the 15-day disabled list because of a torn left hamstring and placed 
pitcher Bill Wegman on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to May 4, because 
of a lower abdominal strain. Infielder Jeff Cirillo and outfielder Matt Mieske 
were recalled from triple-A New Orleans. . . . Steve Sax was put on the 15-day 
disabled list by the Oakland Athletics because of a sore left heel; infielder 
Fausto Cruz was recalled from triple-A Tacoma.. . . . Left-hander Chris Haney 
was optioned to Kansas City's triple-A Omaha team after lasting only 3 1/3 
innings Monday night. The Royals called up Jeff Granger, a first-round pick in 
the 1993 draft, from double-A Memphis. . . . The Pirates sent struggling 
outfielder Kevin Young to triple-A Buffalo and recalled outfielder Gary Varsho.

</P>

 The Atlanta Braves overcame a seven-run deficit in the ninth inning, then 
defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 9-8, Tuesday night at Atlanta when pitcher 
Mike Stanton bunted over the head of third baseman Tom Quinlan in the 15th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton (1-0), Atlanta's seventh pitcher, went two for two and gave up three 
hits in four scoreless innings, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Braves who didn't play were pitchers Greg Maddux, Steve Avery and 
John Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs in the 15th, Deion Sanders doubled against Andy Carter (0-1), 
who entered to start the inning. Dave Gallagher was intentionally walked and 
Sanders stole third. Stanton then popped a bunt over Quinlan's head, making him 
six for 10 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 With Philadelphia leading, 8-1, behind Pete Incaviglia's sixth career grand 
slam, the Braves scored seven runs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The key hits were a two-run single by Charlie O'Brien and a three-run homer by 
Mike Mordecai, in his second major league at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 1, Pittsburgh 0 -- Chris Hammond gave up two hits in eight innings 
against the Pirates at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond (3-3) gave up singles by Al Martin in the first and Lance Parrish in 
the eighth. Jeremy Hernandez pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, whose 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies last Thursday was 
his first career shutout, retired 13 batters on flyouts, struck out six and 
walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old left-hander lowered his earned-run average to 2.05, 
second-best in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined two-hitter was a franchise best for the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Matias Carrillo, replacing injured right fielder Gary Sheffield, drove in 
Florida's run in the fourth with a one-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, San Diego 0 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his 199th homer and Brian 
Dorsett also homered to back Jose Rijo at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After being razzed by a fan behind first base in the top of the fourth inning, 
Reds third baseman Tony Fernandez threw a warmup throw over first baseman Hal 
Morris' head and into the crowd. After the game, he went over to that section 
and signed autographs for several minutes. Fernandez and manager Davey Johnson 
said the throw was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo (2-2), winning for the first time in four starts, retired 16 consecutive 
batters untilBrad Ausmus singled to deep shortstop with two out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 7, Chicago 6 -- The Cardinals won on Ray Lankford's 11th-inning home 
run againstJose Bautista after squandering a six-run lead at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lankford hit his eighth home run with one out, stopping the Cardinals' 
three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Zeile added a three-run homer in the first for the Cardinals, who broke 
out of an offensive slump and won for only the second time in six games of an 
eight-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous five games, the Cardinals totaled nine runs and 28 hits and 
lost four times. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, Montreal 2 -- Joe Orsulak homered against John Wetteland in the 
10th inning as the Mets rallied at Montreal for their sixth victory in seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Orsulak, who went four for five, connected against John Wetteland (1-2) for 
his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
 New York tied the score in the ninth against Wetteland, who blew a save for 
the fourth time in five chances. David Segui singled, pinch-hitter Jeff 
McKnight walked and John Cangelosi singled off the first-base bag for his 
fourth hit of the game, matching a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Linton (4-0) pitched two innings as the the Mets won their fourth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 4, San Francisco 2 -- Greg Harris gave up three hits in 8 1/3 innings 
and Howard Johnson homered for the Rockies at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, out of the starting lineup the previous two games because of a 
hitting slump, hit a two-out solo homer against John Burkett (3-3) in the first 
inning. It was his fourth of the season.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK RECEIVES A BONUS AT SAN ANTONIO

 Chan Ho Park received an extra bonus in San Antonio, where he is pitching for 
the Dodgers' double-A club. "Nolan Ryan was down there, and Chan Ho went to see 
him and thought it was the greatest thing that had happened to him," said Steve 
Kim, Park's uncle and agent who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim visited Park recently and said his nephew is doing fine, but was a bit 
troubled that he doesn't know when he is going to join the Dodgers again. "His 
pitch count has been increased, but he needs to develop confidence in his 
fastball and that's one of the reasons he was sent down," Kim said.

 The swelling in Pedro Astacio's right hand is down and he is expected to start 
tonight against the Houston Astros. . . . Todd Worrell, sidelined because of a 
pulled muscle in his rib cage, is improving and appears to be on schedule to 
come off the disabled list a week from Friday. MARYANN HUDSON

PREP TENNIS; UNIVERSITY, VAN NUYS WIN TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depth of talent was the difference in the City Section boys team tennis finals 
Tuesday at The Racquet Centre in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys 4-A final, University earned a one-sided victory over Taft, 23-6 
1/2, to capture its second championship in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys (14-1) defeated Bell, 18-11 1/2, for the 3-A title after finishing 
second last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the competition, Van Nuys Coach Jim Buck said he thought the 
championship would be decided in the doubles play. Lucky for him that wasn't 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell (16-1) forced Van Nuys to rely on its singles players by winning seven of 
the nine doubles matches. Led by its No. 1 singles player Steve Park, Van Nuys 
responded by winning 13 of 16 singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference today was the great play we got from our third and fourth 
(singles) players," Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing only two sets in three rounds of playoffs, University (16-0) 
believed it was more talented than Taft (14-1), but never discounted Taft's 
talented sophomore Dylan Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, Taft's No. 1 singles player and considered by many to be the best player 
in the city, earned four of the five singles victories by Taft, including a 
dramatic victory over University's No. 1 singles player Jay Jackson, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Taft had the best player today in Mann," University Coach Tom 
Anderson said. "But we had the best team."

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; BRAZILIAN POSTS 230.403 TO GIVE MERCEDES BENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian Raul Boesel, driving one of Dick Simon's six Indy 500 entries, stole 
the show from the Mercedes-Benz-powered Penske cars Tuesday with the year's 
first lap at 230 m.p.h. Boesel ran 230.403 in a Lola-Ford Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt Raul had that coming after he ran a 226 in the heat of the day," Simon 
said."The way cars were running today, it's a good possibility that (Roberto) 
Guerrero's record may fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero set the record of 232.482 two years ago in a Buick-powered car. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske drivers Paul Tracy, 229.961, and defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi, 
229.264, had led before Boesel's run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr., Penske's third driver, skipped Sunday's first day of practice to 
drive 520 miles in a durability test for the new Mercedes engine at Penske's 
Michigan International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "To fully test an engine, you have to run it harder than you ever expect it to 
be run in a race," Penske said. "With no yellows, and Al running at racing 
speeds, it had to be tough on the engine and it came out with no problems."

RUMOR OF RUN ON U.S. NOTES BOOSTS BONDS; DOW UP 27.37; SECURITIES: YIELDS FALL 
AND STOCKS BREAK THEIR LOSING STREAK. U.S. DOLLAR-SUPPORT EFFORTS APPEAR TO BE 
WORKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury bonds surged in value Tuesday and yields posted their biggest decline 
since early April, as a rally in the dollar and heavy demand at a Treasury note 
sale buoyed Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got a lift as well, and the Dow Jones industrials rose 27.37 points to 
3,656.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that European central banks had joined forces to buy huge amounts of 
Treasury securities swept world financial markets and added momentum to bond, 
stock and dollar gains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the 30-year T-bond gained $13.75 per $1,000 face value, 
and its yield fell to 7.50% from Monday's 18-month-high of 7.63%. The yield's 
decline was the biggest one-day drop since April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar surged to a six-week high against the Japanese 
yen as traders began to sense that the Clinton Administration's plan to shore 
up the dollar, announced last week, might be working. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar climbed to 104.68 yen in New York from 102.68 yen Monday. It 
reached a session's high at 140.80 -- its highest level since April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also soared to 1.675 German marks in New York from 1.653 marks 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar gained as the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan cut 
short-term interest rates overnight. With the Federal Reserve Board expected to 
raise U.S. short-term interest rates again soon, foreign investors may be 
inclined to leave German and Japanese securities for U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a steady dollar means overseas investors can take advantage of the big 
run-up in U.S. bond yields of the past three months, said Peter Hirsch, head 
government bond trader at Salomon Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields were 6.3% when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a stable dollar -- and it seems like we have -- our market is 
incredibly cheap relative to other markets around the world," Hirsch said. "I 
don't think anybody saw anything but buyers all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Treasury sold $17 billion of three-year notes at a yield of 
6.54% -- below the expected 6.55% yield.  
</P>
<P>
 "The three-year went real well," said Andrew Brenner, a senior trader at 
Nomura Securities International. "I got lifted out of a lot of (securities) 
today" by customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury received bids totaling $48.25 billion and accepted $17.10 billion 
for the three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a sign of strong demand from small investors, the Treasury said it 
received $1.45 billion of non-competitive tenders for the notes, up from $846 
million for notes auctioned on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Such offers are usually submitted by small investors who agree to accept the 
average yield on the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market overall, foreigners were thought to be active buyers, led 
by central banks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, shares rallied broadly Tuesday, snapping a four-session 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials' gain of 27.37 points offset some of the 85 points lost in 
the last four sessions amid interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones 1,316 to 
881 in trading of 295.62 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.04 points to 725.00. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market was still uneasy about the prospects for higher 
short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger-than-expected April jobs data, released Friday, led the markets to 
anticipate a quick Fed move to raise rates. The increase did not immediately 
materialize, and that gave rise to worries that the Fed was not acting 
decisively against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expected stocks to remain choppy and defensive until the 
interest rate picture becomes clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major concern is still that we're faced with a series of short-term 
interest rate hikes, beginning with the one that will probably happen next 
Tuesday," said Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest, alluding to 
the next meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: To be followed by how many more?" 
</P>
<P>
 * The gain in blue chips was broad-based. Caterpillar advanced 1 1/8 to 106 
3/4; IBM rose 7/8 to 57 7/8; Sears was up 7/8 to 47 3/8 and JP Morgan rose 5/8 
to 62 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T rose 1 1/8 to 52 7/8 on news that it has won a $4-billion contract to 
modernize telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Florida utility FPL Corp. rebounded 1 1/2 to 29 after shedding 4 3/8 on 
Monday, on news of a cut in its dividend. Other utilities stocks, however, 
extended their recent slump amid concern that their dividends were at risk. 
American Electric Power fell 1 3/8 to 28; Houston Industries dropped 7/8 to 31 
3/4; Oklahoma G & E fell 1 1/4 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boston Chicken rose 1 1/4 to 37 1/2 after reporting earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Strength in stocks overseas was a plus for Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index soared 65.51 points, or 3.05%, to close at 
2,213.09. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average closed up 130.82 points at 
19,917.78. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average gained 38.5 points to close at 
3,136.3. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,235.15, up 16.27 points.

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; AN UNFAIR TEST FOR GIRLS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly three-fifths of the $25 million in National Merit Scholarships awarded 
this spring will go to boys, even though girls earn better grades in high 
school and college. The discrepancy is caused by bias in the test used to 
determine award eligibility, according to the Cambridge, Mass.-based National 
Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest). 
</P>
<P>
 "Reliance on standardized test scores as the sole factor in choosing National 
Merit Semifinalists will again cheat girls out of tuition aid they have earned 
by their superior academic performance," said Bob Schaeffer, FairTest public 
education director. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Detweiler, public information director of the National Merit 
Scholarship Corp. in Evanston, Ill., confirmed that girls don't score as high 
as boys, and said, "This is cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "The test is only reporting differences that exist; the test is 
not the cause." A Quicker Goodby 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic church hopes for speedier marriage annulments following the 
Pope's approval of streamlined rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Court sources say they hope the reforms will mean judges can concentrate less 
on red tape and more on "the good of souls," meaning the church's distinction 
between weddings that are considered valid when celebrated (and therefore not 
eligible for annulment even if they break down) and those that were never valid 
"before God" and may be dissolved. Disadvantaged Day Care 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care providers in low-income neighborhoods face significant obstacles, 
according to a study that finds most lack training and may not earn enough 
money to buy books, toys and equipment to keep the children safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Providers in low-income neighborhoods typically attempt to give the children 
in their care a reprieve from the poverty and stress they face at home," said 
the study by the National Center for Children in Poverty. "But they themselves 
are taking on a responsibility that is demanding, uncertain and poorly paid."

MEDIA MONITOR: '90S FAMILY; FEW DOUBTS ABOUT 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARROLL LACHNIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Media Monitor examines the family issues raised in current films, books and 
television shows. It appears regularly on the '90s Family page.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's Playing: "Mrs. Doubtfire," a PG-13 comedy starring Robin Williams, 
available on video. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family Portrait: Daniel Hillard is an impulsive, slightly irresponsible actor 
married to Miranda, a workaholic interior designer. They have three children: 
Chris, Lydia and Natalie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back story: After 14 years, the Hillards' marriage has finally ended. Daniel 
loves his children, but he's more a buddy than a parent to them. Jobless and 
living in a ratty apartment, he is limited by the court to Saturday-only 
visitation until he gets his life together. Daniel can't stand to be apart from 
his kids. He dons makeup, a wig and buxom bodysuit to become 60ish Mrs. 
Doubtfire and gets the nanny job Miranda has advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defining Moment: As Daniel lives in the Mrs. Doubtfire persona, he becomes a 
more responsible parent who cleans and cooks and insists his kids do their 
homework. Although Miranda is angry when she discovers his ploy, she realizes 
that he has been transformed and she persuades the court to grant liberal 
visitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: "In regards to my behavior, I can only plead insanity," Daniel 
tells a judge after his disguise is revealed. "Ever since my children were 
born, the moment I looked at them, I was crazy about them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: "Mrs. Doubtfire" has a positive message for children, said 
Elaine Rodino, a Santa Monica psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 It tells viewers that "when parents are separated or divorced, they continue 
to love their children passionately," Rodino said. "They will do anything to be 
with them and know that they are happy and healthy."  
</P>
<P>
 It bothered Rodino that Miranda, as a working mother, was shown as rigid and 
humorless. But she noted that Miranda seems to be that way in response to 
Daniel's goofiness, and that's an interaction that happens in many families. 
"When one parent is more uptight, controlling or worrying, the other balances 
it by being more relaxed, more easygoing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, "Mrs. Doubtfire's" good messages are mingled with situations 
and dialogue laden with sexual innuendo, Rodino said, which might make a parent 
think twice about letting a young child see it. CARROLL LACHNIT

BRIDGING THE AGE GAP TO FIND 'GRANDMA MOSES'; Q & A WITH CLORIS LEACHMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cloris Leachman just got back from two months on the road. Not counting Los 
Angeles, she's already played 24 cities as Anna Mary Robertson Moses, the 
legendary farm wife who started painting late in life, then turned out hundreds 
of colorful paintings before dying at 101.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Pouliot's play, "Joy Ride: The True Story of Grandma Moses" is now on 
its third tour, each time starring Leachman as Grandma Moses. Both player and 
play return to Southern California where Leachman and Craig Richard Nelson, who 
plays the many men in Moses' life, open tonight for three weeks at the Westwood 
Playhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Leachman won an Oscar -- for "The Last Picture Show," in 1971 -- and six Emmys 
and is perhaps best known for Phyllis Lindstrom, first on "The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show," then on the spinoff series, "Phyllis." From Broadway in the '40s, 
through "Young Frankenstein" and countless TV movies to last year's "The 
Beverly Hillbillies," she seems always to be working.  
</P>
<P>
 How could Leachman, now 68 and a grandmother herself, turn down the chance to 
play "a genuine self-taught primitive" as a girl, in middle-age and at 100?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been involved with this show now for at least eight years. 
What hooked you in? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The challenge was that (Grandma Moses) is 45 in the first act and 100 
in the second act. She lived an entire life as a farm wife and another as an 
international celebrity. How do you connect them? Trying to bridge that gap was 
like finding the missing 18 minutes of the Watergate tape. You don't want to 
fabricate it. We insisted on being authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 When things are easy, you can get a lovely outcome. When things are difficult 
to impossible, you can come up with something that becomes mighty and marvelous 
because of the digging you have to do, and the extrapolating from the clues, 
the detective work. And the firm resolve to bring that woman to life. Not 
anybody else, not our idea of her, but who that woman was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel you succeeded? 
</P>
<P>
 A: On tour, one woman collapsed in the audience. They ran to call the 
paramedics, but she said "no, no, just let me sit here awhile. I'll be all 
right. I knew Grandma. She was my close friend. I saw Grandma tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who was Grandma Moses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: She would have told people that she was a farm wife. But inside that little 
woman was such fun, such bubbly good humor, such attention to the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was that the secret to her longevity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, yes. Humor. Laughter. Hard work -- but don't take yourself too 
seriously. Industry, thriftiness. Caring for those about you. And a deep 
connection to the land . . . the earth. And to life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see her as a symbol of fruitful old age? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You could say that about her and it has been said of her. But she would 
never say it. She would laugh and say, "Ishkabibble!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Aside from the obvious make-up and such, how do you become 100 onstage? 
What did you draw on? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm playing more the circumstances of a disenfranchised person than 
imitating an old lady. I don't think "how do I walk, what do I do with my 
hands?" It just happens. I think your skin gets thinner, even in your mouth. 
Maybe a little drier. You don't know what's happening with your bodily 
functions.  
</P>
<P>
 Bifocals terribly distort distance and space. The world gets narrower and 
narrower, with only the bottom of the bifocals to magnify something close at 
hand. The wider experience is reduced.  
</P>
<P>
 If you realize the reasons (older people) do these things, you don't imitate 
them. You put yourself in the circumstances. It's how you do any part. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I know this play is constantly evolving; have you played an active role in 
the writing as well? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, very active. But I'm more like Isadora Duncan was to artists of her 
period, like Rodin. She was a great inspirer, I think, more than a great 
dancer. She woke people up. She brought something fresh.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you making an analogy between what she did and your role with 
playwright Pouliot? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The playwright is a much better dancer than he used to be. He's doing 
things he never dreamed possible before (pause for laughter). 
</P>
<P>
 I'd call the playwright after every performance and tell him about how it was 
going; I'd say I need a more specific or more colorful word, or a richer word, 
or a rhythm. I'm a good editor, for one thing. We'd never talk but that 
something didn't get better.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: This show has toured so many places in such a short time, many of them 
places where reviewers even noted such things as your being "by far the biggest 
marquee name" to ever hit town. Why do you keep doing this show? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The language -- I could say these words 10,000 times and never get tired of 
them. They are fresh every single time. They tickle and amaze me every time. I 
can't wait to do it again. I can be past exhaustion, gasping for breath, and 
I'm suddenly new again. We're all so passionate about this play. We convene to 
do it again.  
</P>
<P>
 I will put anything and everything aside -- and have -- to get in her 
high-button shoes again. I will stop my life to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you sense parallels to Grandma Moses in your own life?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are both women. We've been married. We had children. We lost children. 
We survived. We kept the family together. We worked hard. We enjoyed the fruits 
of our labors and the labor itself. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; LIFE AFTER DEATH: A HIT IN THE OFFING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driven by a dark and sensual television trailer that appeals to women and a 
soundtrack geared to the MTV generation, Miramax Films' "The Crow" starring the 
late Brandon Lee is posting remarkably high responses from test audiences only 
days before the movie opens nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 If the test numbers wind up translating into big box-office business, this 
will be a film that truly overcame the odds: Its star died a horrible death 
while filming the movie and every major studio passed on the opportunity to 
rescue the troubled production. 
</P>
<P>
 But, pre-release test results of the movie has studio executives all over 
Hollywood scratching their heads. Total awareness of the film is 67%, according 
to results compiled by National Research Group, which does test marketing for 
the Hollywood studios, while awareness specifically among males is 72%, Miramax 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more startling, however, is that 26% of the males under 25 years of age 
said "The Crow" was their first choice of a movie to watch this coming weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking a 'Batman' quality number," said one executive at a rival 
studio, expressing amazement that the small movie is drawing a response 
reserved for the highest profile big-studio pictures. "If you're lucky, you 
usually get 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 While no one can predict how much money "The Crow" will bring in this weekend 
when it is released in 1,200 theaters nationwide (it opens today at two Los 
Angeles theaters and two New York City theaters), comparisons are in order. For 
example, Columbia Pictures' 1992 movie "A League of Their Own" -- an ensemble 
piece about a women's baseball club starring Geena Davis and Madonna -- opened 
to $14 million and it was the first choice of only 12% of the test audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "So 26% is a whopping number," the film industry source said, adding "The 
Crow" was also the first choice among 12% of young women -- also considered a 
strong number. 
</P>
<P>
 The film originally was going to be released by Paramount Pictures, but the 
studio bowed out after Lee -- the son of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee 
-- was accidentally killed by a gunshot during filming in Wilmington, N.C. The 
movie was screened for all the other major studios, but each passed on picking 
it up.  
</P>
<P>
 Miramax, which has earned a reputation for often being able to successfully 
market small, hard-to-sell films like "The Piano" and "The Crying Game" and 
turn them into profitable hits, finally was willing to gamble on "The Crow." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it had incredible style," said David Dinerstein, vice president of 
marketing for Miramax. "It looked like 'Batman.' It has a dark look, but the 
movie itself is like a 'Dracula.' It's a love story about how a man and woman 
pass away and the man comes back to avenge the death of his fiancee." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinerstein said Miramax has also been pleased that women are responding to the 
movie "more than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 What the major studios were reluctant to deal with was marketing a movie in 
which the lead character actually died. "We wanted to handle this in a 
sensitive manner," Dinerstein said. "So, we took the classy approach to the 
thing. Brandon had an unbelievable career in front of him. The accident was a 
real tragedy. So, the film is almost a legacy to Brandon. . . . He's incredibly 
charismatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax has an "extraordinarily appealing" ad running on television," said one 
studio marketing official. "They've done a brilliant job of making it look 
enticing. Lee looks sensitive and sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 The R-rated film is based on a series of comic strips and graphic novels by 
James O'Barr. In some of the comic books, the author quotes the lyrics of rock 
groups and the movie soundtrack is getting exposure from radio stations across 
the country. The soundtrack includes music by the Stone Temple Pilots, Nine 
Inch Nails and the Cure, which Miramax is hoping will pull audiences in as was 
the case with such films as "The Bodyguard."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE DROPPED BOMBSHELL: TALK TV HITS A NEW LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small Los Angeles production company named Ice Entertainment recently had a 
screening for "Peter," a witty, satirical film about a few pretentious film 
students who gratuitously stomp all over a stranger's privacy just so they can 
make a film about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter" is fiction, a low-budget film ridiculing tabloids and other TV 
predators. Yet there is a beam of truth here. Just ask the real-life "Peters," 
innocents whose personal lives have been invaded cavalierly by media not caring 
about the damage they cause in pursuit of a juicy story. 
</P>
<P>
 Or titillating television. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash back to last Wednesday's episode of Ricki Lake's syndicated talk show on 
KCOP-TV Channel 13. On the stage sits a young couple. The woman is in shock 
after hearing her boyfriend reveal -- for the first time, Lake assured viewers 
-- the truth about the children he has fathered with other women. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake really cares. Oh, boy, she aches. She's tortured, utterly brokenhearted 
about having to embarrass this young woman so callously on national television. 
But what's a host to do? The guest simply has to realize that this is for her 
own good. "We're rootin' for you, aren't we?" Lake says, encouraging the studio 
audience to applaud en route to a commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to bring on the next human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the nastiness of TV's humiliation therapy, though, Ricki Lake 
is peanuts compared with "The Montel Williams Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and his syndicated talk series (also on Channel 13) are defendants in 
a $10-million lawsuit filed by Yvonne Porter, 33, of San Jose, in connection 
with her appearance on a Jan. 12, 1993, taping of that show in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others named in the suit is Porter's older sister, Kimberly Willis, who 
disclosed during the show -- simultaneously to America and to a shaken Porter 
-- that she had been sleeping regularly with Yvonne's boyfriend of 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges the defendants with conspiracy, intentional and negligent 
infliction of emotional distress, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and false 
imprisonment -- all of which, Porter claims, have caused her "humiliation, 
mental anguish and emotional and physical distress." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams show refuses to comment beyond claiming that its actions were 
"appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The way a mugging is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 After being ensnared in a litigious maze for eight months, the suit recently 
was assigned to non-binding arbitration, meaning that a settlement may be 
likelier than a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, yes, you're sick of the legal system getting clogged by get-rich-quick 
lawsuits cooked up by scheming plaintiffs and their shiny-suited lawyers. And, 
after all, blabbing and blubbering are the agenda of such shows. Don't people 
go on them all the time and voluntarily expose the intimate details of their 
lives to the multitudes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Voluntarily" is the key word. A review of the Williams episode indicates that 
Porter was anything but a voluntary victim. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with Willis responding to a query aired by the Williams show: 
"Have you ever had sex with someone because you felt sorry for them? If so, 
call 1-(800) . . . ." According to the suit, after hearing that Willis had 
slept with Porter's boyfriend to "stop him from abusing" her sister, producer 
Halle Sherwin offered to fly both women to New York for an appearance on the 
show but instructed Willis to keep the "surprise" by not telling her sister the 
topic ("Mercy Sex") or that she had slept with the boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that Willis persuaded her sister to take part by promising 
her an "enjoyable" experience that would "help her get on with her life." The 
suit also claims that, on the day of the taping, Porter was kept in seclusion 
until her portion of the program. Producer Sherwin, the suit claims, told 
Porter that her segment concerned an "old boyfriend" and assured her that she 
would not be "embarrassed, humiliated or angered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a videotape of the episode tells all. Willis and Porter show up in the 
third segment. Porter looks merely embarrassed when Willis reveals that her 
sister allegedly has been abused by her boyfriend. Then the stunner, the moment 
that a great humanitarian like Williams waits for, the moment of degradation. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera is tight on Porter's face as she hears her sister say about the 
allegedly abusive boyfriend: "I had sex with him to get him off of her back." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter does a slow double take. Her mouth falls open. She's mortified. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams announces that Porter is hearing this "for the very first time," then 
assures Porter that her sister hasn't done this "to hurt you, but kind of to 
make a public statement for her own self." 
</P>
<P>
 The ungrateful Porter -- not realizing that the compassionate Williams has 
arranged this public humiliation for her own good -- shifts nervously in her 
seat. She lowers her eyes. She purses her lips as if seething inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience turns on Willis, who keeps adding details. Finally Porter speaks: 
"I didn't know about this, OK? I had nothing . . . no idea. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 After a commercial break, Willis explains that she's come clean because it's 
time "I get it out." Porter replies: "On national TV?" 
</P>
<P>
 Time for the obligatory "sex expert." Her face full of concern, psychologist 
Jacqueline Rose Hott leans toward Porter and asks, "How are you doing? Are you 
OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Porter replies. Yet even before the word leaves Porter's mouth, Hott is 
spewing psychobabble ("betrayal and rivalry") about the sisters she's just met 
for the first time. At one point, Hott and Willis argue across a silent, 
squirming, angry-looking Porter as if she were invisible. Then Williams turns 
on Willis, chastising her for doing this to her sister "here on national 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 As if he and his staff hadn't choreographed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't Porter immediately get up and leave instead of subjecting herself 
to this torment? According to the suit, she attempted to do just that during 
the first commercial break, but a staff member refused to disconnect her from a 
microphone that ran down the inside of her clothing and was plugged into an 
outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 So Porter continued to twist like meat on a spit. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had no way of knowing how Porter would take this public disclosure. 
What if she had a heart condition? She could have died from the jolt. What if 
she were emotionally fragile? This could have destroyed her. 
</P>
<P>
 But being reckless is Williams' forte. Only recently, he built a two-parter 
around a man's uncorroborated yarn about raping more than 90 prostitutes during 
a two-year period. Immediately after the taping, the man denied raping anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also had no way of knowing beforehand if Willis herself was being 
truthful. The show certainly wasn't. Three times during the "Mercy Sex" 
episode, it identified Willis as having "slept with her sister's boyfriend 
because she felt sorry for him," even though Willis said repeatedly it was her 
sister she felt sorry for. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, doing good deeds can be a dirty business.

ANGELS LEFT IN HOLDING PATTERN; BASEBALL: RAIN-DELAYED GAME AGAINST RANGERS 
FINALLY SUSPENDED AFTER EIGHT INNINGS. IT WILL RESUME TODAY TIED, 5-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez sat in the clubhouse during the 2-hour 
48-minute rain delay Tuesday night, and frankly, didn't care whether the game 
ever resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not be playing anyway against the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in 
Arlington, nor will he be playing today when the suspended game resumes in the 
ninth inning with the score tied, 5-5. The game will be played at 4:30 p.m. 
(PDT), one hour before the scheduled third game of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's game, which resumed at 11:02 p.m. (CDT) was suspended because of 
American League rules that prohibit any inning starting after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and outfielder Dwight Smith were the only position players not used 
Tuesday, but if Perez's fears are correct, it may be weeks before he plays 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he expects to be placed on the 15-day disabled list and replaced 
with first baseman J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum is scheduled to examine Perez's left wrist today to determine 
if surgery is necessary, but the Angels already have decided that he will be 
placed on the disabled list, retroactive to May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing anyone any good right now," Perez said. "I just can't do 
anything with this hand. It hurts to catch the ball. It hurts to hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get healthy again so I don't waste this whole season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez will undergo an arthrogram today to determine the severity of the 
ligament sprain and cartilage tear in his left wrist, but he fears he could be 
sidelined for at least the rest of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to getting healthy again," he said, "no matter how 
long it takes. I mean, look at me. I know I'm not a .200 hitter, but I just 
can't do anything about it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "I'm not going to play a guy who indicates he 
can't play. We can always back-date him on the DL, but obviously that doesn't 
mean anything if you have to operate on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who said he never should have been demoted to triple-A Vancouver in the 
first place, is expected to rejoin the Angels on Friday when they open a 
three-game series in Seattle. He is batting .290 this season with a 
club-leading five homers and 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the biggest suspense of the evening was whether the game would ever 
be completed. Angel third baseman Damion Easley eventually tied the score in 
the seventh with a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was stopped in the third inning with the Angels leading, 2-0, and it 
nearly was called after a two-hour delay. Umpire Dave Phillips, the crew chief, 
actually decided to postpone the game but no announcement was made while the 
Angels and Rangers were determining the makeup date. They decided the game 
would be played Thursday on the Angels' original travel day, but the Angels 
wanted it played during the day. The Rangers insisted on a night game. 
</P>
<P>
 While they were in the midst of their debate, the weather cleared, and at 
11:02 p.m., the game was under way again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it had been more than three hours since Leftwich hadpitched, he 
insisted he return to the game. He threw three times in the clubhouse, and 
besides, he said, this was nothing compared to his college days, when he would 
pitch both games of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich completed his five innings, yielding three hits and one run, and left 
the game with a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, this is where we want the game stopped so no one gets hurt," Angel 
General Manager Bill Bavasi joked in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about this time when the public address system began blaring, "It's a 
Beautiful Morning," with the clock striking midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich's hopes for a victory vanished in the sixth inning. Juan Gonzalez 
tied the game with a two-out, two-run single off Joe Grahe. The Rangers then 
took a 5-3 lead when Grahe loaded the bases, and Manuel Lee hit a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, however, came right back in the seventh with Easley's homer into 
the left-field seats that tied the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who never produced more than four homers in 
any of his six professional seasons, hit his second homer in five days in the 
third inning.

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK PITCHERS WALK 10, LET CANYON RUN OFF WITH THE 
TITLE

<P>
 The one thing Canyon's baseball team doesn't need is help. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Comanches, who average more than eight runs a game, took what was 
given to them Tuesday in an 11-1 victory over Villa Park at Canyon. The victory 
wrapped up the Century League title for Canyon (19-5, 12-2) and the Spartans 
all but handed it over. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park pitchers walked 10 batters, including six in the sixth inning. That 
sort of generosity did not go unpunished. Canyon, which hits .382 as a team, 
scored eight runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the Comanches' eight hits were doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's their team," Villa Park Coach Scott Wilson said. "They put pressure on 
you and wait for mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunnar Strunz doubled twice in the sixth, knocking in two runs. Darren 
Chandler had a RBI single. Three Spartan pitchers walked in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Brady (6-3), one of the top pitchers in the league, walked six batters 
and gave up seven hits before leaving with one out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking that many batters is dangerous against us," winning pitcher Greg 
Jacobs said. "We have a lot guys who can hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs is one. He had an RBI single and also walked twice to force in runs. 
Casey Wilson and Josh Gutierrez each had two RBIs, one each on walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs (6-0) also pitched five shutout innings, allowing only three hits. The 
Spartans (15-9, 9-5) had chances against Jacobs early but stranded 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Century League game: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 9, Santa Ana Valley 0 -- Sophomore Eric Mendoza pitched a no-hitter, 
striking out five and walking one, for visiting Orange (14-10, 7-7). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Santiago 10, Pacifica 2 -- Ruben Castaneda was perfect for 5 1/3 innings and

to break a 1-1 tie. The Fighting Irish (17-8, 10-3) clinched second place. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 21, Rancho Alamitos 1 -- Joe Linck and Joel London each hit grand 
slams and Jim Livernois added a three-run homer, all in the third inning, for 
visiting La Quinta (22-3, 13-0). 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Fullerton 13, Buena Park 12 -- Keith Ginter hit three home runs, including the 
game-winning two-run shot in the seventh, for host Fullerton (19-5, 11-3),

</P>
<P>
 Estancia 7, Laguna Beach 1 -- Pedro Arceyut hit two home runs and drove in six 
runs to lead visiting Estancia (12-12, 8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 19, Costa Mesa 1 -- Matt Rechner had five hits and four RBIs, 
Justin Poe had two hits and four RBIs for host Trabuco Hills (18-6, 13-1). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Tustin 4, Woodbridge 2 -- Ryan Windmill hit a three-run home run in the sixth 
to give host Tustin (20-5, 12-1) a 4-2 lead.

<P>
 In the South Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 1, Mater Dei 0 -- Brandon Hendrikx (8-2) gave up two hits and struck 
out eight to beat the second-ranked Monarchs. Ryan Fullerton had an RBI double 
in the fourth for host El Toro (16-9, 8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 9, Ocean View 6 -- Luke Fox had two hits and three RBIs as No. 
1 Fountain Valley (22-2-1, 10-2-1) clinched its second consecutive Sunset 
League title.

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; LAGUNA HILLS CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cary Crouch told his Laguna Hills softball players to leave their Southern 
Section championship paraphernalia at home. No more reminders of the past 
because the future was slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, because we won last year, we would win this year without 
performing," Crouch said Tuesday. "This team needed to develop its own identity 
and stop living off the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills continued that development with a 3-2 eight-inning victory over 
second-place Trabuco Hills (11-10, 7-2), clinching a share of the Pacific Coast 
League title for the fifth time in six years, including four in a row. The 
victory also avenged a 1-0 loss in which Trabuco Hills stopped the Hawks' 
31-game PCL winning streak despite Therese Lee's no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That loss showed us we had to focus on the present," said Alycia Stevens, who 
had three hits. "We were thinking that this league wasn't (very good), that we 
could be mediocre and still win. That loss to Trabuco Hills opened our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee (8-5) again bridled the Mustangs. She was perfect through five innings, 
then a walk and a two-out single by Theresa Summa tied the game in the sixth. 
She finished with a one-hitter and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (13-9-1, 8-1) scored twice in the top of the eighth, on catcher 
Kim Yankie's three-base throwing error, an infield single, a fielder's choice 
scoring Kristy Klein, and Misty Thompson's RBI grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks took a 1-0 lead in the third on Amber Journell's RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Pacific Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 4, Laguna Beach 3 (8) -- Jennifer Long's two-out double scored 
Tabby Cleveland with the winning run in the eighth for host Costa Mesa (11-9, 
6-3). Long had two hits, and Niki Montgomery (9-6) pitched a three-hitter, 
striking out three.

 Ocean View committed two errors with two outs in the bottom of the seventh and 
Lynea Backlund drove in Paula Schoonover to give Fountain Valley the 2-1 
victory over the ninth-ranked Seahawks in Sunset League action at Fountain 
Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons have sole possession of second place and Ocean View (16-6, 9-4) 
fell into fourth behind Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, Schoonover replaced Kelley Santa Cruz, who had injured 
her knee sliding into second. Schoonover got on base in the seventh on 
shortstop Angela Burke's error, then an Janee Sansone's error put Molly 
Sinclair aboard. Backlund hit a grounder up the third-base line past Mookie 
Hatcher, giving Fountain Valley (14-8-1, 9-3) the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks took the early lead on their only two hits in the third when Lisa 
Messick scored on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley tied the score, 1-1, in the next inning. Lindsey Collins led 
off with a double up the middle. Lisa Layton laid down a sacrifice bunt to 
advance Collins to third and Laurie Gillis hit a pop fly to left field allowing 
Collins to tag and score. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron pitcher Debbie Harrelson (10-6) allowed only two hits and two walks. 
Ocean View pitcher Kathy Ponce (15-5) struck out six and gave up four hits.

PREP GOLF / SOUTHERN SECTION TEAM PRELIMINARIES; UNRANKED DANA HILLS QUIETLY 
MOVES TO THE TOP

<P>
 Dana Hills, off the high school golf charts the last several years, shot to 
No. 1 with a bullet at the Southern Section Southern Regional Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get a lot of attention this year," Dana Hills Coach Phil Wilburton 
said. "Maybe today will help us get some more respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins, unranked in the midseason Orange County coaches' poll, finished 
with 392 on the Orange course at Green River Golf Club, three strokes ahead of 
Huntington Beach. Esperanza and Corona del Mar tied for third at 396, but 
Esperanza won the tiebreaker with a better score by its sixth player. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three advance to the Southern Section team championship Monday at 
Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season with largely the same team, Dana Hills finished 18th at the 
Southern Regional, but this time the Dolphins had plenty of firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Smith shot two-over-par 73 and Matt Johnson shot 76. Nick Clemente shot 
80, Chris Cox 81 and Jeremy Niednagel 82. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a bunch of really solid golfers who are peaking at the right time," 
Wilburton said. "I'm very pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills' strong showing cost Corona del Mar. The Sea Kings, ranked ninth in 
the county, got a 74 from Kevin Walden and a 77 from Billy Sarracino. But 
Esperanza squeaked by because the Aztecs' sixth player, Scott Lucidi, shot 86 
and beat the Sea Kings' Jimmy Keane by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, ranked second in the county, was paced by Chris Berry, who shot 72, 
the second-best round after Western's Tiger Woods (70). 
</P>
<P>
 Berry atoned for the 84 he shot last season in this tournament, a score that 
probably cost the Aztecs a spot in the section final. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita, the defending CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. team 
champion and top-ranked team in the county, finished sixth with 403. Kellee 
Booth shot 76.

THE SCANDAL BROKER; GOSSIP: HAVE ANY RISQUE PHOTOS OF PRINCESS DI? KNOW THE 
SCOOP ON THE LATEST BRITISH UPROAR? MAX CLIFFORD, KING OF KISS AND SELL, MAY BE 
YOUR MAN.

<P>
 When Great Britain's Minister of National Heritage was caught having an 
extramarital affair with aspiring actress Antonia de Sancha two years ago, Max 
Clifford was there to help De Sancha convert her sudden fame into a small 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the owner of a London gym created an international uproar by 
installing a hidden camera and selling pictures of Princess Diana working out, 
Clifford surfaced as the gym's PR man. 
</P>
<P>
 And less than two months ago, when Britain's top military figure, Defense 
Chief Sir Peter Harding, was forced to resign after his former mistress, Lady 
Bienvenida Buck, sold her excruciatingly detailed story to a tabloid newspaper, 
Clifford came forward as the agent who put the lucrative "kiss and tell" deal 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business is to get the best from the media for my clients," says Clifford, 
50, sitting in his small office above a hairdressing salon on London's 
fashionable New Bond Street.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not different from a game of chess where you're sitting in the middle of 
a half-dozen chessboards and you're moving all the time. And sometimes you're 
trying to get things into the papers, and sometimes you're trying to keep 
things out of the papers." 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford makes a living, a very good one, packaging scandal. He is a broker 
whose best-known commodity is revelations so startling and so juicy that 
tabloids and TV shows will pay his clients huge sums to tell all. 
</P>
<P>
 He negotiates media deals on behalf of whistle-blowers, ex-lovers and an 
assortment of loose-lipped connivers. He calls it "directing traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 At Britain's tabloids, the primary market for his stories, Clifford is 
resented for getting to news sources first, but respected for delivering the 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a middleman who we desperately wish wasn't there," says Jan Jacques, a 
feature writer on Britain's biggest-selling paper, the tabloid News of the 
World. "If it wasn't for him, people would come directly to us." 
</P>
<P>
 She is currently dealing with Clifford on a tale involving a pop star in a 
vice scandal. "He's really a sweetie," she says. "But by the nature of what he 
does, he's a pain in the butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday Mirror Editor Paul Connew says that in all his years of dealing with 
Clifford, "I've never known him to produce a totally fabricated story." But he 
says Clifford has a tendency to embellish his tales, so "sometimes you have to 
investigate the story behind the story. The Caesar salad is there, even if the 
fancy dressing is a little too liberally applied." 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford is considered the best at what he does -- which makes him, in some 
people's view, a PR genius, and in others', a rat. Former Heritage Minister 
David Mellor, who resigned after Clifford guided unemployed actress De Sancha 
through a calculated whirl of interviews and PR stunts, calls him "a 
sleazeball's sleazeball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how he is perceived, however, Clifford is very, very busy. The 
phones rarely stop ringing at his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are covered with framed tabloid front pages, mementos of his biggest 
scores. "Chief Of Defense In Sex And Security Scandal," reads the headline on 
the most recent addition to the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Another front page contains a photo of Clifford escorting De Sancha to a 
celebrity-studded movie premiere. And nearby is one of Clifford's handiest bits 
of work: His effort to generate a little publicity for a comedian client about 
to go on tour resulted in one of Britain's most famous tabloid headlines -- the 
compelling "Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 10 years," Clifford says, "I've become more involved with, if 
you like, the controversial stories, the headlines which in turn have made me 
better known. So these days, when people have any kind of a story, whether it's 
to do with a major building society fraud" -- the British equivalent of a 
savings and loan -- "or government departmental wrongdoing or kiss and tell, 
they tend to phone me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he's working on a bit of everything. Besides handling negotiations for 
two separate whistle-blowers, he says: "I'm dealing with someone who had the 
love child of a major rock star 25 years ago and suddenly wants to reveal to 
the world the whole story -- with the blessing of the rock star. The rock star 
is quite happy for it all to come out now." 
</P>
<P>
 (This turns out to be, as the News of the World later reports, Who singer 
Roger Daltrey, whose daughter has a toddler of her own). 
</P>
<P>
 And Clifford is still milking the Lady Buck scandal for all it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dealing," he says, "with the Spanish media, who want Bienvenida, that is 
to say Lady Buck, to do more and more television and newspaper interviews over 
there because, of course, she's Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates that by the time the money-earning power of this scandal is 
exhausted -- Lady Buck demands a fee for all interviews, photos and appearances 
-- she will have earned about $300,000, of which Clifford will get 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although all this scandalmongering might suggest the workings of a man who 
will immerse himself in any amount of sordidness for the right money, Clifford 
insists that is far from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only people I would be interested in exposing are those who, in my 
opinion, deserve to be," he says. In cases where a politician or celebrity is 
only "guilty of being randy," he says, "I don't have a problem with that. If 
they're pedophiles or something, I'll try to expose them to the world. But if 
their only crime is having an affair, or whatever, I'm not interested." 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that in the case of Mellor and De Sancha, the affair was 
uncovered by a tabloid acting on its own. "I got involved two weeks after 
everybody knew about it and she came to me for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Same thing with the photos of Princess Diana. "I didn't get involved until 
after the pictures came out," he says. "The challenge was damage limitation. I 
talked to the TV cameras from all over the world and explained that, yes, what 
(the gym owner) did was wrong, but let's put it into perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Telling reporters that the pictures were glamorous photos of a woman who loves 
to be photographed looking glamorous, he posed the question: "Who did it harm?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But certainly, then, the tale of 30ish Lady Buck and 60-year-old Harding 
should have posed a sticky moral problem for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Their affair transpired while she was married to Sir Antony Buck, a former 
government defense minister. But the Bucks divorced, and the affair had ended 
before Lady Buck approached Clifford with her story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Clifford thought it was a story that needed to be told. 
</P>
<P>
 To strengthen the tale, he helped devise a plan whereby Lady Buck arranged to 
meet Harding for lunch at the Dorchester Hotel in London while a reporter from 
the News of the World sat nearby recording their conversation. And when they 
kissed goodby outside, a photographer was on hand to snap it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, married for 39 years, resigned hours after publication of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I was concerned, the most important thing about the Lady Buck 
situation was that there were breaches of national defense," Clifford explains. 
"He was relaying conversations (to Lady Buck) about matters of defense and 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Defense says it investigated and found no breach of security 
and Harding has made no public comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clifford believes he performed a public service by exposing the affair. 
"The fact is that he was laying himself and her open to any kind of attack," he 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford did not get a medal from the government for his work, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as is usually the case when he comes through with a big story, he was 
soundly criticized by highbrow media commentators, politicians, and nearly 
every other make and model of Establishment figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Misunderstood again. On to the next call.

MOMS AT DISADVANTAGE IN COURT, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As fathers gain ground legally and politically, mothers are often the underdog 
now in custody disputes, some legal observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, mothers receive sole custody two-thirds of the time because 
most cases are undisputed. But when the arrangement is contested -- 
particularly in higher courts -- "women are at a disadvantage," said Mary Ann 
Mason, professor of law and social welfare at UC Berkeley and author of an 
upcoming book on custody, "From Father's Property to Children's Rights." 
</P>
<P>
 In her study of 1990 U.S. appellate court decisions, Mason found that judges 
awarded sole custody slightly more often to fathers than to mothers. "The law 
no longer favors (mothers) and they have less money for lawyers, so they have 
less of an ability to fight," she said. Statistics from the lower courts were 
not available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others contend that gender bias by the legal system has created intolerable 
situations, especially for battered women and their children. "It's reaching 
crisis proportions," said Lomita attorney Patricia Barry, who has filed a 
discrimination lawsuit against the state of California on behalf of 10 battered 
women either fighting for custody or attempting to move out of the area with 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, one judge gave custody to a man who admittedly beat his 
wife in front of their children, citing the fact that she had moved with them 
30 miles away to escape him. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges the state systematically favors men, often fathers who 
"show little interest in their children other than to punish the mother for 
leaving their relationship and to avoid an order of child support." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mason, joint custody "has been imposed as a political solution by 
fathers as a way of sounding fair and equal, but by no means is supported by 
any research that it's good for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no longer any clear-cut legal preference for mothers, 
disputes have become more contentious than ever and custody is a common 
bargaining chip, she said. Often, she said, fathers succeed in obtaining 
concessions such as property rights or not paying spousal support by the mere 
threat of a fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Some mothers, particularly ex-spouses of lawyers and judges, said they have 
been intimidated into unacceptable arrangements by an "old boys' network."  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Alliance for Divorce and Marriage Reform -- a La Jolla-based 
education and support group comprising homemakers formerly married to 
attorneys, judges, doctors or entrepreneurs -- say they have been victims of a 
biased system. Co-founder Ronnie Brown said one mother is now homeless and 
childless after a judge reversed a custody order, giving her son to an abusive 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes the group seeks is an end to policies that allow 
negotiations over custody and property to continue for years after a divorce. 
"Custody battles are so fierce and so damaging to the children," Brown said. 
"The adversarial system has no business trying to deal with family matters."

'90S FAMILY; HOUR OF POWER; A WEEKLY MEETING MIGHT NOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS 
OF FAMILY LIFE. BUT IT MAKES HANDLING THEM MUCH EASIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paula Lynn Parks, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mitchell Williams teaches architecture at the high school and community 
college levels, maintaining a schedule that keeps him away from his family for 
long hours. And although his wife, Sheba, is home with their three children, 
the times when they are all together are hectic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their solution: a weekly appointment on Sundays at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family meetings are essential for the stability of the home," said Williams 
of Cerritos. "It's where the family coalesces as a unit and works through 
problems. . . . It's a sacred time to see each other." 
</P>
<P>
 In simpler days, families spent time communicating over evening meals or 
playing together on leisurely Sunday afternoons. Now, with increasing demands 
on everyone's time, family members who would see each other only in passing 
must schedule in time. 
</P>
<P>
 That weekly one-hour investment, author Amy Lew said, can give children a 
feeling of belonging and importance, and the belief that they can handle what 
life dishes out. These characteristics are the keys to success, said Lew, who 
co-authored "Raising Kids Who Can: Using the Family Meeting to Nurture 
Responsible, Cooperative, Caring and Happy Children" (HarperCollins, 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 To make it work, parents must take the time to encourage their children to 
think and express themselves, Lew said. For some parents, listening, asking 
questions and inviting dialogue will be something new. And perhaps a struggle, 
at first. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army father once told Lew that he'd rather tell his children what to do 
than engage in discussion. Lew asked him: "Do you want your children to grow up 
to be enlisted people or officers? If you want them to be leaders, they have to 
practice decision-making. We live in a society where we can't afford to have 
children who only follow orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Although children's ideas are listened to and respected, it doesn't mean the 
kids run the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children get their say, but it doesn't mean they get their way," said Jeffrey 
Morrow, who teaches Active Parenting Today, a course that includes family 
meetings, at the Center for the Improvement of Child Caring in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 If, after negotiating, a consensus can't be reached, the parent makes a 
decision -- leaving the topic open for later discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are as many variations in meetings as there are families, 
generally family meetings start off on a high note with thank-yous, compliments 
or good news. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Mayotte, a single parent in Irvine, has weekly meetings with her 
12-year-old son. She said the compliments help to build his self-esteem and 
enhance their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good that I've shown appreciation for him and that I value him as a 
person," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children reciprocate, said Lew, who has had family meetings since her two 
daughters were young. "You get to hear all kinds of wonderful things (from your 
children) you would just never hear otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, everyone pulls out their calendars to coordinate schedules: open house 
at nursery school, a doctor's appointment, band rehearsal, a late meeting or 
even next summer's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 By informing each other of upcoming events, everyone feels in control of the 
week. When children can plan ahead for needing a ride, last-minute chaos is 
reduced and children learn to be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues that need addressing can come under old or new business and include a 
child not doing his or her chores, a brother breaking his sister's toys or 
someone feeling picked on at school. Any family member can add items for 
discussion to the agenda posted on the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that we resolve all the issues at family meetings," Lew 
said, "but that we discuss and work on them. And our kids can learn that we can 
keep working on things until we come up with a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Chores have come up frequently in the 26 years the Wallaces of Los Angeles 
have been meeting weekly. With six children living at home, there are plenty of 
chores to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets better," Sherry Wallace said. "Then we have to discuss it again -- 
always in a non-threatening atmosphere. Yelling and screaming doesn't work. 
I've tried that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children need to feel included and should be given an opportunity to make a 
contribution -- no matter the issue. Don't shelter them from the difficult 
issues, said Lew, who has a private practice in Newton Center, Mass. Let them 
know what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Fleming of Irvine said meetings have been instrumental in easing her 
stepfamily through some difficult times. Carol, her husband, Eugene, and their 
daughters from previous marriages often discuss Eugene's inoperable liver 
cancer. Because of medical expenses, the family has filed for bankruptcy and 
will have to sell their home.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are not lightweight," Eugene, 49, said. "My health, moving, but 
also we discuss laundry and the cats. It gives us a forum whether light- or 
heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings always end on a positive note. The Fleming family puts silly 
questions in a hat and everyone picks one and answers it. "It was (12-year-old) 
Jackie's idea and it is the highlight of the meeting," Carol Fleming said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many families end with dessert or a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility for opening and closing the meeting, taking minutes and 
planning the treat rotates among family members and fosters responsibility. 
Children learn that they count. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone fails to prepare, they find out what it's like not to be ready," 
said Sherry Wallace, a mother of nine. "I may pick up the slack, but it doesn't 
take away that uncomfortable feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Some families also use family meetings to instill values, pray or have Bible 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about the values in our family versus the values they see on TV and 
about choosing friends wisely," said Sheba Williams, adding that they've also 
discussed how their young children can respond if approached by a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eugene Fleming: "We talk about issues that are coming up (for his 
12-year-old): sexuality, dating, curfews. It's no-holds-barred with a light, 
humorous touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Although family meetings may not be the solution to everything, parents agree 
that they increase family harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayotte: "All in all, it's definitely helped us to be clear on 
expectations, what's important to me, what's important to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace agreed: "It's kept our family on track. It's not easy living in L.A. 
It's made us a little more solid. . . . It does wonderful things for a family."

'90S FAMILY; HELPING LITTLE BOYS GROW INTO GOOD MEN; REAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 He was such a sweet baby. Then, at 18 months, his mother saw him angrily shove 
another child to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to come from somewhere else," she said years later. "It was hard 
for me. I felt like I was in a different universe because I'm a woman and he 
was different." 
</P>
<P>
 Sex-role differences, under continuing debate by researchers, raise an 
uncomfortable dilemma for many parents trying to raise their sons to be "good 
men" -- men who can take care of themselves yet who are also kind and 
emotionally available to others.  
</P>
<P>
 Many parents -- even those who gave their sons dolls and their girls trucks to 
play with -- now say aggression, or at least high levels of activity, seem 
inborn in their sons. Researchers agree stereotypical sex-role behavior in 
young children can be at least partly attributed to fetal hormones. But many 
also believe parents have unwittingly perpetuated it by going along with 
traditional male role models. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have for generations and generations raised men to be warriors yet women 
are horrified when their sons or husbands are aggressive," said Olga 
Silverstein, a New York therapist whose book, "The Courage to Raise Good Men," 
was published by Viking Penguin in April.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite changes in modern adult gender roles, she said, women "still act as 
though we're waiting for them to go out for the hunt while we (stay home and) 
skin the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We raise little heroes. We elevate them. We don't treat them like fellow 
human beings and we don't intimately connect with them the way we do with our 
daughters. So they grow up with an inability to connect with a woman or 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents want their sons to be tender-hearted and empathetic, but say they 
are afraid they will raise a "mama's boy" or a boy who cannot protect himself 
on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother recalled her distress when her 13-month-old son reached 
determinedly for a pink baseball cap in a store. "He really wanted it. I was 
paralyzed," she said. "I knew when his father saw it, I'd have to take it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 "We get up to the cash register and there was a blue hat on the counter, thank 
God. He dropped the pink hat and we quickly bought the blue one. So I was 
saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, psychologists said, parents' underlying fear is that they will 
turn their sons into homosexuals, even though they know current research is 
showing homosexuality to be largely innate. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein said many mothers have also told her that if their sons do not 
conform to traditional male models, they fear they will not survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, they don't survive (anyway). They go to war. They die early of heart 
attacks. They shoot each other in the playgrounds. They're saying, 'All the 
other kids are rotten so I have to raise a rotten kid.' We have to change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, mothers -- especially those in unhappy relationships -- go 
overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Boy, my husband may be a mess, but I'll fix my son,' " said Los 
Angeles psychologist Shari Kuchenbecker, who is writing a book, "Raising a 
Balanced Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Writers in the November/December issue of Ms. Magazine say some mothers, in 
their zeal to eradicate aggression, have crushed their sons' spirits. Others 
have produced "feminist princes" -- know-it-alls who tell feminists how to run 
their own movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, children see the world in black and white and non-sexist training 
or lectures have little effect on their stereotypes, according to Martin E.P. 
Seligman, psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of 
"What You Can Change and What You Can't."  
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, boys who develop a mature conscience may eventually choose 
non-sexist behavior over blind conformity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As elsewhere, actions speak louder than words, and the greatest successes 
occur when fathers are equally involved in child rearing and housework (not 
just "helping out") and when mothers are unafraid to stay close to their sons, 
the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Silverstein: "You need to have a relationship with your own male child 
that is an authentic relationship so he will be capable of having that 
relationship with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gradually, our notions of what it means to be a man will shift."

GERMANY AND D-DAY REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I write in reply to Ellen Goodman's column of April 29, "Germany Has No 
Place at the D-Day Reunion." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we should always remember those who died in Nazi concentration 
camps and those who died trying to free them. It's important to remember the 
national denial and the international denial that made the Holocaust possible. 
Goodman says that the sins of the grandparents should not be visited on the 
grandchildren. She points out that in 1944 few Germans thought they were 
getting a welcome liberation from Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994. Anyone who was 18 in 1944 is now 68. If we insist that 
Germany must be held apart from the rest of the community forever, then World 
War II will never be over. The Nazis will never die as long as we insist that 
their descendants can never atone for being their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the way, alienated youths who join groups such as the neo-Nazis will 
not feel less alienation and hate by being excluded for their German-ness from 
the world community. 
</P>

 * I was surprised that Goodman lumped Japan teaching its young about the 
bombing of Hiroshima with neo-Nazis in Germany and Holocaust revisionists in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'm prejudiced because I'm of Japanese ancestry, but the bombings of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very important parts of modern Japanese history. 
Actually, it's a very important part of modern history, period. In my school 
textbook, Hiroshima took up one or two paragraphs. In a Japanese textbook, much 
more information is given. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think teaching Japanese children about Hiroshima will create another 
generation of Tojos who will invade Korea and China and all of Asia and try to 
take over the world!

LOS ANGELES RIVER

<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "River Rescue," April 20: 
</P>
<P>
 What will it take to revitalize the Los Angeles River as a place for public 
enjoyment and environmental restoration? Two easy steps. First, stop the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers' expensive Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project 
(LACDA) and replace it with a project that would provide water conservation, 
recreation and river restoration, in addition to flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 The second step is to reorganize the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works and replace it with a watershed management agency as other similar 
counties in the United States have done. The agency would incorporate 
environmental restoration and protection, recreation and community enhancement 
into each flood control project. The agency would be staffed with biologists, 
ecologists, planners and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the corps and the county would stop using 1930s-style (concrete) 
engineering and instead use alternative flood control strategies that will 
enhance communities and the environment, then river revitalization will become 
a reality.

ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Assault Weapons Ban Clears House by Slim Margin," May 6: 
</P>
<P>
 Well, congratulations to the "politically correct" and emotionally hysterical 
comrades of President Clinton, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Charles Schumer. 
You have accomplished absolutely nothing! What good is symbolism if it has no 
substance?  
</P>
<P>
 Three past presidents were even duped into promoting this ban on "assault 
weapons" (May 5) that will do nothing to reduce violent crime. Their letter 
admitted that it will not help: "The 1989 import ban resulted in an impressive 
40% drop in imported assault weapons traced to crime between 1989 and 1991, but 
the killings continue." The very fact that the killings continue just proves 
that this ban will not affect violent crime. The criminals will just use other 
weapons that are available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what you're saying: It's time then, to take all guns out of the hands 
of the public. But that will never happen. First, even an anti-gun Congress and 
President know that they can never take guns from criminals, so they will never 
leave us defenseless. But even more important, the Second Amendment will never 
be repealed. Even if you continue to nibble away at it with meaningless efforts 
to reduce crime, it will never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 My hope is that once you realize the ultimate futility of your efforts, and 
admit they are non-productive, you will turn your enormous energies toward 
solving the crime problem and its causes.

 * I found it nearly schizophrenic of your editorial staff to publicly praise 
the passage of the "assault weapons" bill in the House of Representatives (May 
6) and on the opposite page to print a column by the prime minister of Bosnia 
pleading for weapons to protect his nation from more of the 200,000 deaths and 
400,000 injuries that have been visited upon the Bosnian population by the 
Serbs. I would assume that they don't want these weapons for duck hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to quote the prime minister: "Had we not been deprived of our 
legitimate right of self-defense, we would never have had so many victims. . . 
. Only when we are armed and able to respond to Serbian moves in kind will they 
behave differently." Oh, those nasty assault weapons. They aren't good for 
anything. Just ask any Bosnian.

If criminals carry guns, ignoring the laws, and police admit they can't protect 
us adequately, maybe it would be better for society as a whole for honest, 
law-abiding citizens to arm themselves. Putting some fear into the bad guys for 
a change would be a welcomed improvement.

CHERNOBYL PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ludmilla Thorne's article "No Peace for Chernobyl's Victims" (Commentary, 
April 29) misses an important point. The problem was not the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant and is not the 15 other Chernobyl-type reactors in the former 
Soviet Union, however obsolete they may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Grigori Medvedev's meticulous chronology ("The Truth About Chernobyl") showed 
that the disaster was not due to the reactor but to the damn fool people 
running the plant. The supervisor deliberately pushed the reactor to its limits 
to see what would happen, like a kid playing chicken on a trestle in front of 
an onrushing locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of 20,000 "safety" violations in 1993 shows that the damn fools are 
still in charge.

 * After reading the column on the lasting damage from the Chernobyl disaster, 
I think that we should be especially concerned that our tax dollars do not go 
toward creating another similar disaster. The U.S. Export-Import Bank has 
developed a financing scheme to complete the Temelin nuclear power plant in the 
Czech Republic, using American tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Temelin -- which relies on the same flawed, outdated technology that caused 
the disaster at Chernobyl eight years ago -- will cost around $420 million to 
complete.  
</P>
<P>
 The project has widespread opposition within the Czech Republic, Slovakia and 
Austria. In the U.S., Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House 
subcommittee, along with several other members, has expressed deep concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to write to our congressmen now to urge them to block the funding 
completion of the Temelin reactor with our tax dollars.

TACO BELL MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It's no crime that the management of Taco Bell is dangling tax incentives 
from Texas in front of our elected officials in Sacramento. The real crime is 
in the reasons that motivated them to consider moving in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than attack the source of the problem (the anti-business regulatory and 
tax climate), Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) joins hands with 
Gov. Pete Wilson and conjures up yet another new bag of fiscal tricks in the 
form of "investment tax credits" (April 21). Is everyone asleep at the switch? 
Brown's legislative aide, Leslie Medina, is quoted as saying "the state will 
then use other taxes, like increased sales and income taxes, to help offset the 
tax credits." Now here's a classic reversal (Sacramento style) of Robin Hood -- 
stealing from the poor to help the rich! 
</P>
<P>
 The common-sense solution is for all those tax-and-spend lawmakers to repeal 
wasteful spending programs and regulations and reduce the oppressive personal 
and corporate taxes. Then Taco Bell, along with thousands of other 
California-based businesses and their employees will, once again, flourish in 
the Golden State. Oh, for such a day!

A QUIET U.S. REMINDER TO MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign diplomacy always requires tact. But occasionally the history of 
relations between certain countries is so sensitive that extra caution is 
required. Mexico and the United States are a classic case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now our southern neighbor is going through some tense but hopeful times. 
Mexico is undergoing a largely peaceful, but nonetheless dramatic, revolution. 
Under the leadership of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and other young 
technocrats, a once-underdeveloped nation is making a great leap into the First 
World. In the process, Mexico is shedding many old or discredited practices, 
from protectionism to pervasive corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes have not come easily. Salinas' reforms have met bureaucratic 
and political resistance. And in recent weeks the murder of front-running 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and an Indian uprising in southern 
Mexico have served as scary reminders of the violence that has accompanied past 
revolutions there. During a time of unexpected tension, messages of support and 
concern from Washington must be phrased with special care. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other U.S. officials are 
visiting Mexico City for a regularly scheduled meeting on bilateral relations. 
And while these biannual diplomatic sessions can be routine, the messages 
carried from Washington this year are decidedly not. Christopher is trying to 
convey the deep U.S. concern over Mexico's turmoil without seeming to interfere 
in Mexican affairs. Thus he is being appropriately low-key in expressing the 
U.S. viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be a mistake for Mexican officials to miss the gentle warnings in 
some of Christopher's remarks. For example, when he said in one speech that "to 
sustain trust in democracy, governments must attack the scourges of corruption 
. . ." he was not just talking about political payoffs. He was referring to 
concern that Mexico's upcoming presidential election may not be honestly run. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexicans fear that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
unexpectedly set back by the murder of a genuinely popular candidate in 
Colosio, could turn to the heavy-handed fraud for which it is notorious in 
order to keep control of Mexico's presidency. If that happens it would badly 
undermine Mexico's international image. And that could have negative 
ramifications for implementation of the still-new North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anyone, Salinas was the architect of NAFTA. And Mexico's 
Harvard-educated president is smart enough to know that the closer U.S.-Mexico 
relationship he envisioned under NAFTA meant that Mexicans would have to get 
used to hearing more from their opinionated U.S. neighbors about how things 
should be done. This is just the start. If anything, the Mexicans should be 
appreciative that -- for now, in Warren Christopher -- they are dealing with as 
tactful a diplomat as the United States has ever produced.

SIZING UP THE TRUE AIDS PROBLEM; IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH IN 
TESTING FOR HIV INFECTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No performance standards are required for local governments to qualify for the 
money that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gives out for 
counseling and testing for the virus suspected of causing AIDS. Maybe that's a 
good thing: Los Angeles County does not figure to lose its share of this vital 
funding, despite some criticism that the county program too often appears to 
lumber along. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City, for example, received $4.9 million in CDC monies as compared 
with L.A. County's $4.5 million. But New York officials conducted 46,564 tests 
for the human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV) in 1992. Los Angeles officials 
managed just 25,779 tests that year. And even though New York officials tested 
only about twice as many people as were tested in Los Angeles, they discovered 
nearly nine times as many people who had the virus. In part, this enormous gap 
can be attributed to differences in concentrations of serio-positivity between 
the two cities (studies have shown higher HIV infection rates in New York, 
particularly among its intravenous drug users). But only in part. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, how to explain the experience of Houston, a city which 
geographically is perhaps much like Los Angeles. There, officials performed 25% 
more tests than L.A. and identified three times as many cases of infection, 
with much less CDC money. Closer to home, for the first eight months of last 
year, the city of Long Beach conducted more tests than all of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials had several explanations for the lower numbers. For example, 
the chief of the county program on sexually transmitted diseases noted that the 
Los Angeles testing numbers were generated from a group of people who were not 
likely, as they are in New York, to walk in off the street and take an AIDS 
test. He was referring to folks who go to public, community-based clinics for 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here, however, is that Los Angeles has been struck hard. In fact, 
it has the second-highest number of HIV and AIDS cases in the nation. That 
leads the president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation to refer to the county 
testing program as a "tragedy" for failing to make sure that rates of infection 
are not higher. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials need to re-examine their use of CDC funds, and to question 
whether they should spend more time targeting high-risk groups, such as 
intravenous drug abusers. People who learn that they are infected are people 
who have the knowledge and the power to save lives. Is the county doing its 
best to provide that knowledge? At best, that is an open question at this 
point.

A CASE OF PREMATURE SENILITY; 'HEALTH ALLIANCES' AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL WILL 
DISCOURAGE RESEARCH AND SPECIALISTS, LEAVING US TO THE MERCY OF MEDIOCRITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DOWLING, Katherine Dowling is a family physician at the USC School 
of Medicine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most striking aspects of a young, dynamic biologic system is 
variability. The new little heart in your baby daughter can easily speed up by 
60 beats a minute when she fusses. Watch a 2-year-old play and you know why 
menopause occurs as early as it does. A young planet has a dynamic geology and 
as it ages, geologic processes generally grow more staid. Regularity thus 
becomes the mark of middle age in most systems, physical or biological. As the 
system's life span lengthens, regularity is replaced by chaos: the arrhythmia 
in your old dog's heart, the red giant sun consuming the planets it has 
nurtured for billions of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Political structures, too, have internal dynamic evolutions. In youth a 
society allows for individual and group creativity. National middle age and 
senescence see more and more encrusting regulations, more and more of a 
consensus in the body politic that everything should be identical for all 
members. Somewhere in the process, the will to grow and change is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 We've gotten ourselves a President, middle-aged himself both mentally and 
physically, who epitomizes our society's aging process. But it wasn't very long 
ago that the United States was young and had a determination to make our 
children's lives better, to "boldly go where no man has gone before." Our 
science became the best in the world, and the spinoffs from our young eager 
minds have made life better for all the people of the world. President Kennedy 
gave this country a mandate and a timetable for reaching the moon, and we did 
it, with the help of many scientists whose contributions have never been 
acknowledged. (They'd make far better national heroes than Roseanne Arnold or 
Kurt Cobain.) 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the United States has entered middle age. We don't dream any more of 
new frontiers; we seek only to stay comfortable and not exert ourselves too 
much. Now that the space program and much pure research have been gutted, 
either through taxes and regulations or failure to fund, the politicians are 
out hunting for a new target. In the zeal to "take care of the problems here at 
home," our prematurely gray and potbellied government has decided to meet all 
health-care needs with the fast-food approach. They are playing a shell game 
with choice, in that health alliances will allow you a choice from only a 
limited menu of providers and access to specialists only after you have run the 
requisite obstacle course of overburdened gatekeepers. Waits for such 
"elective" procedures as cardiac surgery will result in predictable deaths, as 
they have in England while people wait for their names to ascend to the top of 
the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most subtle and disastrous effect of systematically dismantling the 
best health-care system in the world will be the loss of our research 
capability. Surgeons, pulmonologists, perinatologists and other specialists 
have spent lifetimes honing their skills. As they are deprived of their 
patients and their ability to use and pass on their thought processes, we will 
have lost an irreplaceable resource.  
</P>
<P>
 Much research effort has been done in the private sector, and profit is 
certainly a powerful motivator here. Yet none will deny that the efforts of 
pharmaceutical (and other) companies have meant better patient care. A new 
class of drugs, for example, has changed the outlook for many heart-failure 
victims, and immunization against a common form of meningitis has dramatically 
reduced this disease. In the process, medical costs for these two diseases have 
been reduced. But now companies are afraid to commit much funding to research, 
since it takes many years to capitalize on advancements. By then, federally 
enforced reduced drug costs may disallow profits, and the ever-present threat 
of litigation means that new vaccines or prostheses may actually lose money for 
the companies developing them.  
</P>
<P>
 Once we destroy specialty practices and medical innovation, we will forgo our 
place in the tremendous progress awaiting us as the chromosomes are mapped and 
substances like local growth factors actually can be manufactured. Government 
control of health research and development may mean that whatever is the 
politically correct disease, be it breast cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's or 
something else, will probably get the lion's share of the research funding.  
</P>
<P>
 America needs leaders of vision to prevent premature national senility, not 
leaders whose main objective is to set the status quo in concrete. As Bernard 
Weatherell, former speaker of the British House of Commons, says: "Virtually 
all civilizations of the world have faded away not from enemy action but 
usually from decay . . . from bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith 
to courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty to abundance, from abundance 
to apathy, from apathy to dependence, from dependence once more to bondage."

RADIO FREE ASIA, NOT TRADE SANCTIONS; CHINA: STUNTING ITS ECONOMY IS BAD FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS -- AND AMERICA'S INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSHUA MURAVCHIK, Joshua Muravchik, a resident scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute, was a member of the Commission on Broadcasting to the 
People's Republic of China. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's China-policy debacle might have been averted had 
the President made good on his campaign pledge to launch Radio Free Asia. When 
the Iron Curtain was lifted, we learned from Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and 
countless citizens of Eastern Europe that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
had been more effective than we knew. By providing listeners with a steady flow 
of independent reports about their countries, these stations weakened rulers, 
heartened dissidents and paved the way for the transition from dictatorship to 
pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a presidential/congressional commission recommended establishing a 
radio service to do the same kind of broadcasting to China and other repressive 
societies in Asia, such as Vietnam and Myanmar. Candidate Clinton endorsed the 
recommendation. Last year, President Clinton repeated his support for Radio 
Free Asia. But so far, the idea has been slowed by bureaucratic and 
congressional wrangling, with only desultory efforts on its behalf from the 
White House. Now, the President's budget threatens to kill it off.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House proposes to spend only $10 million on Radio Free Asia in 1995, 
about a third the amount that the commission estimated would be necessary and 
that Congress authorized (all of which could come from cuts already ordered in 
other foreign broadcasting accounts). The issue will now go to the 
appropriations process, where the Administration could still reverse itself and 
support the full authorized amount. If the appropriation is cut back to $10 
million, it is likely the whole project will never get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 As a means of promoting human rights and democracy in China, Radio Free Asia 
has important advantages over trade sanctions, the threat of which has so 
roiled Sino-American relations. The problem with sanctions is not that they 
make the Chinese government angry, but that China's economic growth and foreign 
commerce are engines of pluralization, so it may be self-defeating to hinder 
them. And by retarding private business development, trade sanctions may weaken 
some of the very elements we wish to strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Free Asia, on the other hand, will make Chinese rulers just as angry, 
but it contains no such self-defeating potential, and it does nothing but 
strengthen those we want to strengthen -- independent-minded folks, both 
dissidents and those inside the system. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a second reason why Radio Free Asia can be more fruitful than trade 
sanctions. With sanctions, some concessions can be exacted, but only up to a 
point. The regime knows that if it gives too much, it will crumble. We can 
scarcely expect the regime to cooperate in its own overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope for China's future is not that its aging Leninist oligarchs will 
change their ways. Rather, it rests in the empowerment of the millions of 
mostly younger Chinese who demonstrated in Tian An Men and elsewhere in 1989 
and the millions more (including numerous party members) who tacitly or 
actively supported them.  
</P>
<P>
 Had Clinton already launched Radio Free Asia, the issue of renewing China's 
most-favored-nation status might have been handled in a low-key manner, without 
a visit by the secretary of state, and we might have settled for some modest 
concessions. Moreover, Beijing might have been less eager to test our mettle 
had we shown the courage to create the radio despite their sharp protests. 
Fastidious readers of power, the men in Beijing were surely emboldened to 
humiliate Secretary of State Warren Christopher by the weakness that has 
characterized the Administration's foreign policy. The President can strengthen 
his hand by pressuring Congress to get Radio Free Asia off the ground.

PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY MARRIED TO LEARNING: A MILLENNIAL WEDDING; 
A CONTROVERSY OVER PROFIT-SHARING WITH UCLA WAS JUST A SMALL GLITCH IN THE 
EXPLORATION OF NEW WAYS OF LEARNING.

 In approaching the millennium, Americans may justifiably argue that millennial 
ideas are in short supply. Faced with a multitude of challenges from within, 
our society is seeking the visionary concepts -- from worlds as diverse as 
economics, multiculturalism and even particle physics -- that will lead us into 
the 21st Century. However, such direction will not be found in financial 
innovation, social service or scientific discovery. Rather, it will come from 
the frontiers of education. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, we shifted from an agrarian to an industrial society. Now, we 
are in an information and knowledge-based age. A country, community or company 
is not its factories, buildings or natural resources but its people. These 
people, well-educated and technologically advanced, are a society's most valued 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow's promise is grounded in the marriage of education and technology, in 
interactive networks that will bring ideas, knowledge and new ways of thinking 
to people young and old, in schools, homes and workplaces. Satellites, data 
compression technology, CD-ROM and speedier computers have all brought new 
worlds of information to ever-larger audiences. The prospects are limitless for 
students of any age, for training, retraining and pure knowledge enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 The widening gap in compensation in this society is, increasingly, a byproduct 
of knowledge. For example, in 1978, an American male in his early 30s with a 
college degree earned 32% more than his counterpart with a high-school degree. 
In less than a decade, this education premium increased to more than 60%. 
Today, in a world where countries compete to produce the best-educated labor 
force, sheer desire is no longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had a unique opportunity in the past 25 years to work with educators at 
the kindergarten through 12th-grade level, with students and professors at 
colleges and universities and with entrepreneurs in fields including the cable, 
communications and entertainment industries. From this, I have developed a 
passion and vision for the concept of educational television. My new company, 
EEN Communications Network, has grown from these experiences; its mission is to 
combine education with entertainment, communications and technology to make 
learning accessible and engaging, via software, videotape, satellite 
broadcasting and whatever fast-evolving technologies the future may offer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the network's many efforts was a pilot project at UCLA. My teaching 
relationship with the university began about a decade ago, when I participated 
in a UCLA summer session with finance professors from historically black 
colleges and universities. In 1993, I was asked to be a guest lecturer at the 
John Anderson Graduate School of Management. The network taped the classes with 
an eye to producing educational programming on corporate finance topics. This 
project was intended to benefit UCLA and allow the university to share in the 
profits from this project. The idea was that 100% of the costs would be borne 
by EEN Communications Network, with 50% of the profits going to educators and 
educational institutions, including a share to UCLA, and 50% to the network. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort was enthusiastically embraced by the UCLA administration and its 
finance faculty. As measured by comments from the students, professors and 
guest lecturers, including executives like Bert Roberts of MCI and public 
officials including Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who is also a UC regent, the 
course was a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the nay-sayers struck, focusing only on UCLA's 5% rather than the 50% 
going to educators and universities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the network is offering to cancel the existing contract with UCLA 
and separate UCLA from its other, for-profit, ventures. If the many hours of 
footage from the UCLA class are eventually edited, the network will donate the 
tapes to the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The network continues to collaborate with education and technology pioneers 
and professors from other colleges and universities across the country. Its 
goal remains to develop software, video and interactive education products to 
be distributed and broadcast to homes, offices and learning centers. While 
networks and entertainment producers have not yet found educational 
broadcasting commercially viable, I believe this will change. Information 
technology holds the greatest promise ever for leveling society's "playing 
field" by providing everyone with access to high-quality informational 
materials. Many people have credited CNN and others with helping to bring down 
the Berlin Wall. I believe this historical event will pale in comparison to the 
ability of education -- combined with the best of technology, communication and 
entertainment -- to bring opportunities to all, whether in South-Central Los 
Angeles or Bel Air, whether young or old. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now estimated that the average person will have five different jobs 
during a working life, each requiring different skills. At the same time, the 
percentage of our population "too big" to go to school continues to increase. 
In 1960, one-third of Americans were under 18 years of age. Today, only 
one-quarter are under 18, even as the overall population continues to grow. 
Without access to training and education, this large, aging segment of our 
society will not be able to compete for jobs that increasingly require new 
skills. Instead of contributing to our country's productivity, these 
hard-working people will continue to be frustrated with rapidly changing 
technology and, in some cases, be forced to leave the assembly line for the 
unemployment line. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at the Milken Family Foundation National Education Conference, 1,500 
educators joined business and technology leaders to discuss partnerships 
between education and the private sector. I was again reminded of the rapidly 
evolving requirements of our job producers and of the determination of our 
educators to provide well-trained, responsive graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of education and technology, made readily available to our 
schoolchildren, teachers and adults at home or in the workplace, represents the 
brightest opportunity for achievement and for the knitting together of an 
America too often divided by economic and cultural differences. Access to 
knowledge is the most lasting millennial idea of them all.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A COUNCILMAN CAN'T BE A LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tourism is big business in Anaheim. So what's a city councilman doing 
accepting a position as executive director of a newly formed hotel and motel 
association? It's not right. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson says he will work part-time as head of the Anaheim 
Area Hotel/Motel Assn., working 20 hours a week on association business, being 
paid $36,000. He says he took the job because the group wanted a stronger 
voice. There was, of course, a suggestion of the underlying problem right 
there. He is useful to such a group precisely because he is a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 And the obvious question came up: What would happen if Simpson in his capacity 
as councilman had to rule on matters affecting Simpson in his capacity as head 
of the hotel and motel group? It could easily happen. While Simpson says he 
wants to be of service, he certainly wouldn't be of much use to his city 
constituents if he took himself out of the voting loop because of conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, City Atty. Jack L. White suggested that Simpson's ability to vote 
on the $3-billion Disneyland Resort -- the Walt Disney Co.'s theme park named 
Westcot and the accompanying hotel project -- might be compromised. This is the 
most important piece of city business in years, and Simpson was prepared to 
render himself unfit to decide the fate of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 What good will Simpson be if he can't evaluate and vote on proposals coming 
before the city? Not much. Clearly, Simpson must figure out whether he is fish 
or fowl, councilman or lobbyist. He can't be both.  
</P>
<P>
 So he must decide whether he wants to represent the people of the city or the 
hotel and motel group. Part-time city council members, who make a nominal 
amount for their labors, obviously need other sources of income, but they must 
do things that do not pose a conflict. For Simpson to remain on the council 
while heading the industry group would be like representing the public with one 
hand tied behind his back. It would cheat the electorate.

VAN NUYS' PARK TAKES A TOLL ON BELL; CITY SECTION TENNIS: JUNIOR LEADS WOLVES 
TO 3-A TITLE; TAFT FALLS TO UNIVERSITY IN 4-A FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Van Nuys High No. 1 singles player Steve Park began playing tennis at age 5 at 
the urging of his parents, who now are steering him toward medical school. 
Because of his studies, Park struggled at the outset of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Park performed surgery of sorts at the Racquet Centre on Tuesday as Van 
Nuys beat Bell, 18-11 1/2, for the City Section 3-A Division championship. Taft 
was routed by University, 23-6 1/2, in the 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, 16, defeated Jose Cardenas, Bell's top singles player, 6-2. He routed 
No. 2 player Anton Chow, 6-2, then blanked both Alfonso Chacon and Juan Ubario, 
6-0, to help the Wolves (14-1) sew up the title against the previously 
undefeated Eagles (16-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't practice last semester because 11th grade is an important year for 
academics," said Park, who had to overcome some adversity. He played at Granada 
Hills in 1993, but his season was cut short by a broken wrist. At the outset of 
1994, Park lost some matches to inferior opponents and temporarily yielded his 
No. 1 spot to senior Peter Nam. 
</P>
<P>
 But Park hit his stride late in the season and he helped turn the Wolves' 
fortunes against Bell. With two-thirds of the match completed, Bell led, 11 
1/2-10, having won seven of the nine doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys needed to win five of eight remaining singles sets to overtake Bell. 
The Wolves won all eight and wound up taking 15 of the 16 singles sets. Park 
was pleased with the victory, but he already has his sights on next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 3-A, but it's still all right," he said. "Next year we're moving up to 
4-A and we want to be the first team in section history to win the 3-A and the 
4-A championships in back-to-back seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4-A final, Taft High's Dylan Mann proved to be the man among singles 
players. But for the second year in a row, Mann's teammates were outmanned. 
Taft (14-1) had reached the 1993 final before losing to Northwest Valley 
Conference rival Chatsworth, 19 1/2-10. That was close compared to Tuesday's 16 
1/2-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we beat Chatsworth twice during the season, then our singles 
ladder didn't produce when we got to the final," Taft Coach Marvin Jones said. 
"This year we're just playing the No. 1 team, and they're solid all the way 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann gave Taft its only highlight against University (16-0) when he swept four 
sets and rallied from 4-2 and 5-4 deficits to beat Jay Jackson, 7-5, in a 
match-opening battle at No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Taft's 6 1/2 points came from Mann, a sophomore who was ranked No. 6 
in Southern California in the boys' 16-and-under division last year. Mann is 
undefeated, posting a 12-0 record in the regular season and winning all 12 of 
his sets in the tournament.

CHATSWORTH ECLIPSES EL CAMINO REAL, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth High's year of living dangerously continued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladly welcoming four El Camino Real errors and a close call that allowed the 
winning run to score, the Chancellors eked out a 4-3 victory Tuesday in the 
first meeting between the two teams since last season's City Section 4-A 
Division final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a day of frustrations," El Camino Real pitcher Randy Wolf said. "Must 
have been that eclipse." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. The morning's interruption of sunlight can't explain El Camino 
Real's dark day, which began with Wolf committing a three-base throwing error 
in the first inning, paving the way for Chatsworth's 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard luck culminated with the Chancellors scoring the winning run when the 
umpire ruled that Wolf missed touching first base on a double-play attempt that 
would have ended the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf was arriving at first when he caught the throw from shortstop Matt Tays 
and and stabbed his foot at the base, appearing to complete the 3-6-1 double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the umpire called hitter Brandon Murphy safe, which meant Rod Daryabigi's 
trot home from third on the play broke a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he touched the base," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. 
</P>
<P>
 I did, said Wolf. "Unless that was a big, soft rock (I touched)." 
</P>
<P>
 But El Camino Real's protests, as most do, went for naught, and Chancellor 
pitcher Jim DeBiase (8-1) shut down the Conquistadores the remainder of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breaks keep going our way," Chancellor shortstop Bryan LaCour said. "To 
be a successful team, you have to win these type of games." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (22-3, 13-0 in conference play) has won 14 consecutive games, 
including seven by two or fewer runs, so the tight West Valley League victory 
was nothing new. The Chancellors win, even if it's in underwhelming fashion. 
Only one of their four runs against El Camino Real scored on a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (17-5, 9-4) scored in more impressive fashion. Wolf and first 
baseman Craig Carlton hit towering back-to-back home runs in the fourth inning 
to tie the score, 2-2. Four batters later, a single by Clint Marcus drove in 
Billy Burnette to give the Conquistadores a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolf, who like DeBiase surrendered only four hits, could not hold the 
lead. "In order to beat a good team, you have to do everything right," Wolf 
said. "Today we just didn't have that."

COOK SOCKS IT TO CAL POLY SLO; COLLEGE BASEBALL: HIS DOUBLE IN SEVENTH HELPS 
NORTHRIDGE TO 5-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Keyaan Cook used the term ugly. How appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook showed up for Cal State Northridge's game Tuesday wearing his socks a la 
Delino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 Pants high. Socks low. His reasoning: At-bats high. Knocks low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Winfield wears his socks like this when he's going bad," Cook said. 
"When he's playing ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's bloop double to right field in the seventh inning also was an 
ugly-finder, but it was fetching enough to help Northridge to a 5-3 victory in 
a nonconference game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "A win is a win is a win," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "That's 
Shakespeare, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cal Poly, it was a Comedy of Errors. Northridge (25-26) opened 1994 with 
three losses to Cal Poly (28-21) and has committed a slew of homely plays 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, everything went their way, partly because of Mustang right fielder 
Kevin Tucker. Everything came his way. When it's crunch time, balls always seem 
to find the shaky fielders. Ugly-finders, in dugout lingo. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 3-3, in the seventh, Eric Gillespie singled to right and 
Tucker kicked the ball, allowing Gillespie to take second. Joey Arnold singled 
to put runners on the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jason Shanahan smashed a single to center to drive home Gillespie for a 
4-3 lead, Cook sent an opposite-field looper down the line in right. Tucker, a 
senior, wrestled with a couple of balls earlier, but neither resulted in an 
error before Gillespie's hit. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Tucker froze, took a step forward, then bolted to his left and 
Cook's blooper landed at his feet to give Northridge a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a tough day out there," Arnold said. "He was lost. But that outfield 
is brutal. There's holes, lumps, places with no grass, weeds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's major? Horticulture, but it didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge entered the game with one victory in seven games. The threadbare 
pitching staff, however, held up against Cal Poly, ranked 23rd in NCAA Division 
II. Jason Vargas allowed one run in five innings and Aaron D'Aoust pitched two 
innings to record the Matadors' second save in 51 games.

CLEMENT GREENBERG; LEADING ART CRITIC, ESSAYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clement Greenberg, a seminal art critic who helped identify and establish the 
Abstract Expressionism art movement and who championed Jackson Pollock as its 
major star, has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg died Saturday of complications of emphysema in New York City, where 
he had spent most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let nothing come between you and art, nothing, no ideas, nothing," he once 
said in describing the work of an art critic. "The idea is to see enough: 
That's how you acquire taste. Don't even look at the name on the label." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's learned commentary appeared in the magazines Partisan Review, 
Commentary, the Nation, Saturday Evening Post, Arts and Art International. His 
cumulative writings were published by the University of Chicago Press in 
several volumes titled "The Collected Essays and Criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the Bronx to Russian Jewish immigrants, Greenberg began drawing by age 
4, only to have his unsupportive parents throw away his artwork. Greenberg 
studied literature at Syracuse University, then taught himself Latin and German 
and supported himself during the Depression by translating books. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired as a U.S. Customs clerk in 1937, which proved a major turning 
point in his life. He spent idle hours in the appraisers division writing 
essays on culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon those essays were being published by Partisan Review, the unofficial 
journal of New York intellectuals. In the small related American art community, 
Greenberg came to know and to praise Pollock and to critique and support 
Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg also frequently visited artists in their studios to offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
 He had devoted himself to lecturing for the last three decades, and spoke in 
1982 in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Janice, a daughter, Sarah, and a brother, Martin.

MARGARET SKEETE, 115; OLDEST AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Skeete, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest 
American, died Saturday at her home. She was 115. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Skeete had been bedridden since a fall three weeks ago and died in her 
sleep, said her daughter, Verne Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinness listed Mrs. Skeete for the first time in its 1993 edition, after 
verifying her age from an 1880 census that listed her as a 2-year-old, Mrs. 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Skeete was born Oct. 27, 1878, in Rockport, Tex. When her husband died 41 
years ago, she moved from Texas to Virginia to live with Taylor's family. 
</P>
<P>
 She outlived two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Skeete was unimpressed by her longevity. "I guess that's something, but 
it doesn't buy me anything," she said at her 115th birthday party in October. 
Her daughter said she maintained a craving for sweets until a few weeks ago.

MOSES ROSEN, 81; ROMANIAN RABBI HELPED THOUSANDS FLEE COMMUNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moses Rosen, who as Romania's chief rabbi helped 400,000 Jews flee the country 
during the purges of the communist era, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen died of a heart attack Friday after suffering a stroke three weeks ago 
that left him partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected Romania's Jewish leader in 1948, when there were 600 rabbis in the 
country, he fought to keep Jewish traditions alive in communist Romania while 
at the same time helping Jews emigrate, mainly to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II, Romania had 800,000 Jews, one of the largest populations 
in Europe. Half were killed in the Nazi Holocaust, and most of the rest have 
since emigrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are fewer than 18,000 Jews among Romania's 23 million people, and 
most of them are over 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Rosen found himself fighting a rising tide of anti-Semitism after the 
violent fall of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989 as Romanian 
nationalists sought scapegoats for their economic woes and the country's past 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, he lashed out at a state television program in which historians 
contended that Jews had incited anti-Semitic feelings in Marshal Ion Antonescu, 
who led Romania into World War II as an ally of Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a weekly escalation in these (anti-Semitic) sentiments," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in the town of Bacau, in what is 
now Moldova, in 1912. He studied law in Bucharest and, after surviving the 
horrors of the Holocaust, worked to help Romanian Jews emigrate.

DANA PARSONS: HOT TUB HEDONISM STILL EXISTS FOR CALIFORNIA DREAMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "How many stores, max, were there on this street?" Stu Robertson calls out to 
his partner behind the counter at their Beach Boulevard hot tub outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen, at one time," comes the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson now starts counting them up. He stops at three. Maybe four, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh, I feel that old wistfulness coming on again. The "California, we hardly 
knew ye" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, who now owns Valley Spa in Westminster, says he got into the 
business in 1976. Where was that on the hot tub timeline, I ask. "In 1976, 
that's when everything was definitely rockin' 'n' rollin,' " Robertson says. 
"There were spa stores everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "From Stanton all the way down to Edinger," his buddy behind the counter says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Robertson was a former Marine who had quit a job as a safety 
superintendent on the waterfront. A friend told him about the burgeoning hot 
tub business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about to lose my house, things were really bad," Robertson says. "I had 
no idea how to sell anything. I knew nothing about nothing. But I had taken a 
Dale Carnegie sales course, and so I was the only guy (at the spa store) who 
had a structured presentation. I walked in there, I was there about three days 
and I sold my first spa. Within about two weeks, I was their top sales guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In those halcyon days when everyone wanted a spa to prove they belonged in 
California, Robertson would sell three or four a day and sometimes be home and 
get a call to come in and make a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea how a spa worked," he says, laughing at the recollection, "but 
I knew the facts. Basically, I had pretty good eyes then and I used to be able 
to read all the numbers off the pumps and I'd say, 'We have a horse-and-a-half 
pump, which is the gold one over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 None of which meant anything to him, but because times were great and everyone 
was having a good time in California then, that's all it took to sell a hot 
tub. "Anybody who could read the numbers off the pumps could have sold them," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal was simple. "I think it was what most Californians thought they 
should be doing," he says. "It's what they thought California was about -- hot 
tubs and the beach and the whole atmosphere. I was real good at selling 
fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him that, as a non-Californian back then, that's exactly how I pictured 
the hot tub industry: a fantasy business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the fantasy myself, before I got in the business," he says. "I had it 
all drawn out where I wanted one." Actually, he wanted two, with the second 
being in his living room "because I had this fantasy of a big party going on 
and everybody jumping in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1980s, the spa industry was flagging. It has flagged so much that 
when I called a salesman at random this week at another store, he said, "Anyone 
who's smart got out of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robertson does the unexpected: he doesn't burst my bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not making a fortune, he says, but business is good and people are still 
buying for the same hedonistic reasons that helped fuel my California 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who walked in the door in 1974 looked just like the guy who walked in 
today. Same guy, maybe the guy's hair is shorter today. The reason he buys the 
spa is to have a good time. The dominant motive is they want to have a good 
time in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson explains that the industry suffered because factory-operated stores 
undercut the traditional mom-and-pop stores, but then lost customers and 
eventually shut down when they couldn't maintain the exorbitant profit levels 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 They quit selling the fantasy. Instead, Robertson says, "Rather than telling 
people how great a spa was, they sat you down with a yellow pad and a piece of 
paper and they lost something doing that. There was a human being out there. 
There's got to be humanity in the selling process." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson says he's survived all these years for a simple reason: He's still 
having fun and he still sells the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing I'm 45 now. I still feel like I'm in my 20s, 
doing the same thing. I've had fun in it ever since I started. We're still 
selling that California dream. It's a fun product to sell. I like using it 
myself. The people who buy spas are fun people. They're not your square kind of 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 I feel better already. Heck, I didn't know the fantasy business still existed. 
</P>

PREP TENNIS / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFF DRAW; EDISON AGAIN FINDS ITSELF IN A 
DIFFICULT SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Still on a high from a Sunset League championship and a 15-4 season, Edison 
High boys' tennis Coach Tim Ball answered his office phone Tuesday with a 
cheery, "Hello, this is Tim." But when Ball heard that his first-round opponent 
next Tuesday in the Southern Section Division I team playoffs would be 
Woodbridge, his spirits quickly sank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," Ball said, "we played them in the second round last year. How in the 
heck could that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just bad luck, apparently. Woodbridge is a third-place team, but the Warriors 
are 15-5 and play in the Sea View League, one of the section's more powerful 
leagues. They are ranked seventh in Orange County, Edison is ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Edison was beaten by Woodbridge in the second round, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to do better than the second round this year, but it's going to 
be tough," Ball said. "We do have a lot better team and more depth this year, 
but I don't know how we're going to do against Woodbridge." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chargers upset Woodbridge, they would play third-seeded Dana Hills, 
which is undefeated in 19 matches, and ranked second in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do our best," Ball said. "My goodness, there's no breaks, is 
there? That'll teach us for winning our league." 
</P>
<P>
 University, the second-seeded Sea View team and fifth-ranked team in the 
county, didn't get a great draw either. The Trojans will play Century 
League-champion Foothill (19-1), ranked fourth in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, the Sea View League champion, is seeded fourth and opens by 
playing host to Lakewood (12-7), the third-seeded team from the Moore League. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills (17-1), the county's top-ranked team, was given the top seeding in 
Division II and will play the West Torrance-Downey Warren winner on Tuesday.

Burroughs assistant Mike McHorney said he is capable of jumping substantially 
higher. "His technique in bending the pole is really starting to improve," 
McHorney said. "If he can keep that going until the state championships, he's 
got a chance to clear 17 feet."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; POSTPONEMENT WAS POSTPONED TOO LONG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Umpire Dave Phillips, the crew chief, stopped the Angels-Rangers game in the 
third inning Tuesday, waited two hours, and decided to postpone it.  
</P>
<P>
 They waited to make the announcement only because the Angels objected to 
playing the makeup game on their scheduled travel day, Thursday. If anything, 
the Angels said, they wanted the game played in the afternoon, considering 
their four-hour journey to Seattle for a three-game series beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Rangers were listening to the Angels' complaints, the rain stopped, 
the weather report suddenly changed, and at 11:02 p.m. (CDT) they were playing 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger pitcher Bruce Hurst, who was making his first start of the season, was 
already showered and dressed by the time the game resumed. Angel starter Phil 
Leftwich, however, resumed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter John Farrell is growing impatient. He knows he belongs in the 
big leagues. There's nothing more for him to prove at triple-A Vancouver, 
already pitching four complete games with a 3.06 earned-run average, but yet, 
he must wait. 
</P>
<P>
 But Farrell is being hurt more by his contract more than his performance. His 
contract stipulates that he must be paid $200,000 once he is brought up to the 
big leagues, but he also has lucrative incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell must be paid $45,000 for every start he makes after his seventh 
appearance, or $20,000 every time he pitches in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to put his contract ahead of our needs," Bavasi said. "If we 
need him, he'll be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Bill Sampen was informed after the suspended game that he would 
be optioned to triple-A Vancouver to make room for starter Mark Langston. "It 
was obvious something had to give," said Sampen (1-1, 6.46 ERA), "but I didn't 
know it was me." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the primary reasons Sampen was sent down, Manager Buck Rodgers said, 
was because he still had an option left to be sent down without having to clear 
waivers."That stinks when decisions are made like that," Sampen said. 
</P>
<P>

 Ranger closer Tom Henke has told friends he's so unhappy he won't be back 
after the 1994 season. He said he will retire, rejecting the $4 million option 
for the 1995 season. BOB NIGHTENGALE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hearing to determine whether Mike Scyphers can return to coaching is 
scheduled for 8:30 a.m. today at Ventura County Superior Court in Ventura, said 
Lawrence Trygstad, an attorney representing parents of Simi Valley High 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents are seeking a temporary restraining order that would reinstate 
Scyphers, who has been suspended as Simi Valley High baseball coach pending a 
police and school district investigation into possible financial and 
disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 If Judge John J. Hunter rules in the parents' favor, Scyphers, 41, could be on 
the field for the Pioneers' game today at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents who support Scyphers will meet with Supt. Mary Beth Wolford 
and Principal Kathryn Scroggin at 7:30 this morning at the Simi Valley Unified 
School District office. JEFF FLETCHER

 BIG MONEY TODAY: Talk about your bad business decisions. . . . TV pioneer Pat 
Weaver writes in a new book that while at NBC he cooked up a deal with Walt and 
Roy Disney: NBC would run Disney films and projects, but would have to buy 25% 
of Disneyland. The Disney brothers had just built the theme park and had a cash 
flow problem. . . . But Weaver says NBC owner David Sarnoff nixed the plan. 
Says Weaver: "I still wonder how much 25% of Disneyland, purchased with 1950s 
dollars, would be worth to NBC today."

 LEAVING KEYS HOME: County transportation officials had hoped to reach 2,000 
riders daily after the new Metrolink train line was 6 months old. They made 
that goal in April -- the first full month -- with 2,057 average daily riders. 
. . . That's five times the number riding the rails here before Metrolink. It's 
operating six trains daily through the county with stops in six cities.

 GREENE LINES: Former Rams linebacker Kevin Greene, who left last year for 
Pittsburgh, said on a TV talk show this week that his troubles with the Rams

but I found out I was just another number." Greene also credited former Rams 
teammate Jackie Slater, an offensive lineman, with making him a Pro 
Bowl-caliber linebacker: "I had to learn to make new moves because I was tired 
of getting whomped up on by Jackie in practice."

 RACER: The first injury during practice for the Indy 500 usually makes the

foot Monday when his engine blew and he slid into a wall.

 CREDIT DUE: There are two ways to get an increased credit line on your credit 
cards. You can call your card company and apply for it. Or you can do it 
yourself by electronically altering the magnetic stripe on the back. The second 
method avoids those troublesome credit checks, but it is, of course, illegal

 INTERVIEW: For months, Stephanie Frederic (above), a Studio City free-lance TV

 BARELY ALIVE: Don't offer last rites just yet, but the chances don't look good

ECLIPSE'S MAGIC CASTS A SPELL ON GATHERING; ASTRONOMY: 300 AT MOORPARK COLLEGE 
ENJOY A CLEAR LOOK. FOG, CLOUDS OBSCURE SKIES ELSEWHERE IN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sky darkened. The temperature dropped 10 degrees. The birds stopped 
singing, and hundreds of people gazed skyward through telescopes and Mylar 
screens Tuesday morning at the Moorpark College Observatory as the moon 
partially blocked out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the light," said Dick Nelson, 73, looking at the landscape around the 
observatory as the sun cast a dim twilight-like yellow glow. "It's eerie and 
magical." 
</P>
<P>
 Clouds and fingers of fog obscured the spectacle of the last solar eclipse of 
the century for thousands of Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 300 people who gathered next to Moorpark College's small 
observatory were treated to a clear view of the eclipse's magical light during 
the nearly three-hour show as the moon passed in front of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a retired electrical engineer from Simi Valley, who has been an 
amateur astronomer since high school, has avidly pursued solar eclipses all 
over the world. On Tuesday, he held up his hands and nodded toward the shadows 
created when the sun filtered between his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the moon reached the point of covering nearly 75% of the sun, the 
diminishing light sharpened the shadows. Using his criss-crossed fingers to 
imitate a pinhole camera, Nelson allowed the light to project tiny crescent 
images of the partially eclipsed sun on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the shadow of that tree," he said, unclasping his fingers and 
pointing to the crescents in the shadows of tree branches. "It's like a 
thousand dancing suns." 
</P>
<P>
 The eclipse seen in Moorpark only covered about four-fifths of the sun. But in 
a 150-mile-wide swath of North America from Baja, Mexico, to New England, 
observers were treated to an annular eclipse, where the moon blotted out all 
but the sun's fiery rim. 
</P>
<P>
 A solar eclipse occurs when the moon, moving in its orbit around the Earth, 
slips in front of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tuesday was the last solar eclipse visible in Ventura County for some 
time -- the next total eclipse is not due until 2019 -- a visually interesting, 
but much less rare lunar eclipse will occur on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hal Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at Moorpark College, said he 
was disappointed that more people did not come to view the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me when people don't seem to care about something like this," 
Jandorf said. "Even the animals know something is up. I try to popularize this 
stuff because I love it, and it's great to see someone get interested in it and 
realize it's something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the opportunity to see the last visible partial eclipse in Ventura 
County this century, astronomy buffs and second- and third-grade students from 
Campus Canyon Elementary School in Moorpark held up Mylar screens and glass, 
and used welding goggles to protect their eyes while gazing at the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while he set up his telescope, Jandorf made sure a filter covered his 
lens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can burn your eyes instantly or damage the telescope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jandorf propped up one large telescope next to a white screen at the 
observatory's 126-seat outdoor amphitheater, and used it to project the shadow 
of the moon as it slowly "took bites" out of the sun. Some of the young 
students took turns looking up through a few hand-held Mylar screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome," said Anthony Medwetz, 9. "It looks bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting next to him, his friend, Steve Serrano, 9, grabbed the Mylar to take a 
look. Steve was surprised by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a joke or a trick or something," he said. "It was cool, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles on Tuesday, about four-fifths of the sun was covered by a black 
crescent at the height of the eclipse at 9 a.m. If you could see it. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 schoolchildren and 200 adults at the Griffith Observatory had to be 
quick to see anything when drifting clouds made the eclipse suddenly appear -- 
and then just as suddenly fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It popped through the clouds a few times," said Bob Kline, 39, a graphic 
artist from Huntington Beach, who had attached a camcorder to a telephoto lens 
in hopes of recording the eclipse. "But I certainly didn't run out of videotape 
-- I guess that's the bright side." 
</P>
<P>
 Czernic Crute, a telephone technician from South-Central Los Angeles, brought 
along two telescopes. But there was no use for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never got bright enough to use our equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith Observatory astronomer Patrick So stood holding a pair of king-sized 
binoculars attached to a cone-like device designed to project the eclipse on a 
small screen. There was little call for it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was crystal-clear in Lancaster, where he lives, So explained. In fact, 
clouds didn't appear until he drove into Los Angeles shortly after dawn. He was 
tempted to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 "But duty called and I came here," he said. "Eclipses can be a hit-or-miss 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Bob Pool contributed to this story. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College Observatory and the Ventura County Astronomical Society 
are inviting those interested in viewing a May 24 lunar eclipse to observe the 
spectacle through the observatory's telescopes. For information, call the 
astronomical society's Star Line at 529-7813.

 SIG ALERT: Caltrans has installed Ventura County's first electronic message 
board on the Ventura Freeway in Thousand Oaks to advise southbound motorists of 
traffic congestion, especially on earthquake-broken freeways. . . . Two more 
flashing signs were planted nearby, advising motorists of radio broadcasts on 
major tie-ups. Thousand Oaks leaders see the signs as another hurdle to scenic 
highway status for the stretch of the freeway through the Conejo Valley."Given 
the city's history regarding unnecessary signs," said Councilwoman Judy Lazar, 
"I'd rather not have them."

 MONSTER PITCH: The giant Godzilla-like creature perched over the Ventura Auto 
Center along the Ventura Freeway is part of a Korean auto maker's plan to crack 
the low-priced car market (D1). . . . Kia Motors Corp. bought the rights to use 
the star of the old Godzilla movies as part of its advertising blitz. Weber 
Motor Co. is one of the 50 dealerships in the West to sell Kia cars and has 
lashed the green inflated monster to the roof of its Mazda dealership. . . . 
"It's a Kiasauris," said Jeff Weber, the dealership's co-owner. "We call him 
Gorgo."

 12 O'CLOCK HIGH: Two vintage World War II bombers landed at Camarillo Airport 
on Tuesday (B1), bringing out WWII veterans and a few memories. . . . A B-17 
Flying Fortress and a B-24J Liberator, restored by a nonprofit foundation, have 
been barnstorming the county in search of airplane aficionados and WWII buffs. 
. . . "Each one of us with wartime experience has a special airplane," said 
Orville W. (Bill) Main of Camarillo, who flew a B-17 in dozens of missions over 
Germany. "The B-17 is the special one for me."

BASEBALL STADIUM SEEN AS NO MINOR FEAT; ATHLETICS: THREE CITIES HAVE AGREED TO 
DO FEASIBILITY STUDY. THE TOUGH PART WILL BE FINDING SITE, FUNDS FOR STADIUM. 
</P>

<P>
 With support from three west Ventura County cities secured, an ambitious plan 
to bring minor league baseball to the county by April, 1996, must still 
overcome parochial rivalries and economic realities. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy part is finished: persuading the cities to consider building a 
stadium for a baseball team to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, Oxnard and, as of Monday night, Ventura have agreed to spend as 
much as $100,000 on a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the tough part: finding a site for the stadium and a way to finance 
the facility, which could cost as much as $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Ventura City Council gave the measure unanimous approval Monday, 
some members expressed doubts that the project would ever be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we get our money back if Ventura is not chosen to be the site?" Councilman 
Gary Tuttle asked before Monday's vote. "If it's in Oxnard, are we really 
prepared to fund an Oxnard facility?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Mayor Manuel Lopez said he would not support a final plan unless 
organizers use private funding, not city money, for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we wanted to, we couldn't do it," Lopez said in an interview Tuesday. 
"I don't think anyone in his right mind on any council would support the cities 
paying for the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of financing should be resolved in the feasibility study now 
approved by all three cities. A consultant is expected to tell community 
leaders where to build a stadium, how to finance it and how much return to 
expect on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Securing a team should not be a problem, minor league officials say. The 
California League has pledged to deliver a Class A baseball team if the cities 
deliver a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Communities have done that in other areas and found the minor league games a 
popular form of entertainment for families. But the baseball teams seldom pay 
back what the communities have invested in the facility, forcing cities to 
lease the stadiums for other events and fund the projects out of city revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting last month, leaders from the three cities agreed to ask their 
councils to study the concept. All the cities have now agreed and will split 
the costs proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said the cities could seek bids for a 
consultant by the end of May and choose a firm by July. He expects a report and 
final vote by the city councils this fall. If the effort is successful, a team 
could be playing in its new stadium by April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take several months to build, and it's going to take several 
months to finance," Little said. "You just start working back from April '96, 
and you don't have a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics are not sure that the project will ever get that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle predicted that selecting a site could kill the current spirit of 
cooperation. Organizers are looking at about 10 sites in the western county, 
most of them near the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to think if it's in Ventura, those councils are not going to fund 
something in the city of Ventura," he said. "I'd be real surprised to see 
Ventura money going to Camarillo or Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Project supporters say the location shouldn't stop a project with so much 
popular appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My No. 1 concern is we get it here in the area, regardless of where it is or 
who does it," Oxnard City Councilman Bedford Pinkard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger hurdle might be the cost of the project. In addition to Lopez, 
Ventura Mayor Tom Buford expressed concerns about the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of dollars we are talking about," he said, "it's going to be real 
difficult to put those kinds of dollars together." 
</P>
<P>

writer. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 In May or June, the cities will issue a request-for-proposal statement, 
seeking bids for a feasibility study for a stadium for minor league baseball. 
Community leaders will convene a meeting for baseball enthusiasts who want to 
be involved in developing the project. A date for the meeting has not been set. 
In July, the cities will choose a consultant to conduct the study. The 
consultant could report back by the fall.

TEST DRIVE OF AUTOMOBILE TURNS INTO POLICE CHASE; MAN IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A man who walked into a Ventura auto showroom for a test drive Tuesday 
kidnaped a salesman and took him on a wild ride across Ventura County, which 
ended after the salesman escaped in the San Fernando Valley and the driver 
crashed the car at Universal Studios, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Lynn Simpson, 32, was booked on suspicion of kidnaping and auto theft at 
the Van Nuys Jail after a brief police pursuit in the San Fernando Valley that 
ended about 1 p.m., Los Angeles Police Sgt. Nicholas Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol and law enforcement agencies in Ventura County 
said they were not involved in the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began at Paradise Chevrolet on Victoria Avenue in Ventura, with 
salesman Russell Phelps showing Simpson a $27,000 black Camaro Z-28, police 
said. Simpson got behind the wheel and Phelps got into the passenger seat for a 
test drive, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps "wasn't concerned until he realized that they were on the 101 Freeway 
heading out of Ventura County," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson told Phelps that he was God and said he was driving to rock music 
radio station KLOS in Los Angeles to pick up money to pay for the car, Wade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps told police that he unsuccessfully tried several times to persuade 
Simpson -- who at one point during the drive ripped off his shirt -- to turn 
around. Simpson responded, he said, by telling Phelps that he would not be 
beaten if he cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove through Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and into the San 
Fernando Valley at about 80 m.p.h., Simpson realized that he didn't know where 
the radio station was located, Phelps told police. When Simpson exited the 
freeway to make a phone call at Balboa and Ventura boulevards in Encino, Phelps 
bolted from the car and ducked into a nearby Smart & Final wholesale store, 
Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Phelps called police and a description of the car was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police spotted the car at Van Nuys Boulevard and Vose Street in 
Van Nuys and called for backup, Wade said. Two more patrol cars pulled up 
behind Simpson within minutes and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson led police onto the eastbound side of the Hollywood Freeway, where he 
reached speeds of up to 90 m.p.h. before exiting at Magnolia Boulevard, Wade 
said. Once off the freeway, he led police through side streets, including a 
dead-end street where he flattened two tires as he drove over a curb to elude 
police, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Simpson crashed through a control gate at a multistory parking 
structure at Universal Studios, where he stopped the car and police took him 
into custody, Wade said.

CITY MANAGER TO LEAVE JOB WITH NEARLY $50,000; VENTURA: JOHN BAKER'S ACCRUED 
VACATION AND SICK TIME HAS SOME OFFICIALS CALLING FOR A LIMIT ON UNUSED 
BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Startling some Ventura City Council members, City Manager John Baker says he 
has accrued enough unused vacation and sick leave to collect nearly $50,000 
when he leaves his job July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 After 13 years in the position, Baker has accumulated 825 hours of vacation 
and 540 hours of sick leave that he has not used and is entitled for 
reimbursement, he wrote in a memo given to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's policy is to reimburse all employees' vacation time in full and 25% 
of all sick time. According to the memo, Baker will get $42,900 for his unused 
vacation time and $7,000 for the sick leave he never took. Baker announced last 
month that he is leaving the public sector to launch a consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom said he was astonished that the city manager could 
amass such a pile of unused vacation and sick time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem I have with the bureaucracy, that they can save up their 
vacation time," he said. "In the private sector, for example, we could only 
accrue a year's sick leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle said the council might want to limit the amount of 
vacation time and sick leave the next city manager may accrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should be really strong negotiators on what we give the next city 
manager," said Tuttle, adding that he'd also like to see the next one make less 
than Baker's annual salary of $108,120 and benefits of $23,957. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, however, said they were not concerned with Baker's 
package of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many presidents and chief executive officers of private companies are awarded 
large sums when they leave their firms, Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with it," he said. "In many private sector jobs, you 
also get a severance for leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said Ventura will probably be forced to retain its policies 
on sick leave and vacation time to stay competitive in its city manager search. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to attract the best talent and I'm not satisfied that this is out of 
line," he said. "I want somebody good in there and I'm prepared to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, however, said she was so alarmed by Baker's 
memo that she is pressing the city's personnel department to find out if the 
city has ever placed a limit on vacation time accrual and whether it would be a 
good idea to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is not worried that such a cap would make Ventura less attractive 
to prospective city managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a competitive edge in terms of where we are situated," she 
said. "We live in the most beautiful place, and I can't imagine having 
difficulty" in finding viable candidates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may not have a choice on the benefits issue unless council members 
choose to change the policy affecting all city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 All employees working at City Hall, depending on their job and seniority, get 
between 10 and 20 vacation days per year, said Christine Schlag, the city's 
senior personnel analyst. All City Hall employees also get six sick leave days 
each year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has only taken one sick day so far this year, according to personnel 
records. Being at the top of the scale, he also gets 20 vacation days each 
year. He estimates that he only takes about half of his vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had the time to take 20 vacation days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, he said, his vacations are pretty much the same: a few days with 
his parents in Boise, Ida., and four or five days skiing with friends at 
resorts from Canada to Lake Tahoe.

SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS STRAIN PENSION FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's 6,000 present employees may have to pay higher contributions 
to their retirement funds in future years if the county's 2,200 retirees are to 
continue receiving supplemental benefits, the county tax collector said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million annual bill for supplemental benefits -- which are paid in 
addition to those due retirees by contract -- could also come from the county's 
general fund, Tax Collector Harold S. Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the county's budget problems, it is unlikely that the Board of 
Supervisors would approve such a move, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman told county supervisors Tuesday that he opposes a proposal to be 
considered by the county Board of Retirement on Monday to continue paying the 
supplemental benefits by tapping the retirement fund's $42-million reserve 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman said that taking money from the reserve account would only deplete the 
retirement fund for present employees. 
</P>
<P>
 If the reserve is tapped, employees would have to make higher pension 
contributions to make up for income lost from the money taken from reserves, 
Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1977, the county has been able to give supplemental benefits -- now 
amounting to as much as $280 per month for some retirees -- because the 
retirement fund was earning large profits on its stock, bond and real estate 
investments. The supplemental benefits were sort of a bonus in addition to the 
benefits provided by the employees' contributions to the pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the recent downturn in the markets, the Board of Retirement has no 
extra funds to pay the supplemental benefits, Pittman said. The Board of 
Retirement would have to take capital from reserves to pay the benefits this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pittman acknowledged that it would be difficult for retirees to accept 
smaller pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very emotional issue for these people," he said. "People out there 
have grown to depend on the supplemental benefits. But I don't think it's my 
responsibility to approve benefits to the detriment of current employees and 
the county general fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman told supervisors Tuesday that they should decide the matter and not 
leave it to a nine-member board of appointed and employee-elected 
representatives who govern the retirement fund. The supervisors decided to put 
the matter on the agenda in two weeks to discuss a possible policy change. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Chairwoman Vicky Howard said the downturn in the markets was bound 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been riding the upsurge for a number of years and this is the 
inevitable shakeout," she said. "But part of our fiscally conservative approach 
is to keep that 5% (reserve) to protect present employees and retirees." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who sits on the Board of Retirement as the 
supervisors' representative, said she also objects to paying the supplemental 
benefits this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a large number of retirees coming to complain on Monday about how 
difficult it is to deal with what could amount to a couple hundred dollars a 
month less," she said. "But we just don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement board member John Crossan, president of National Benefit Services, 
a pension administration and asset management company in Westlake, said he 
plans to take both viewpoints into account when he votes on the matter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand the retirees' position and we would certainly like to help them 
in any way we can," he said. "We'd love to do it. But we have to look at our 
fiduciary responsibilities to the whole fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman added that despite the possible loss of some reserve funds, the 
retirement fund overall is financially healthy, with holdings worth $896 
million, including the reserve. He said that by law, the retirement fund is 
required to keep only a 1% reserve. But the reserves were bumped up seven years 
ago when investment returns were extremely good. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was a good idea to have 5% in times of plenty, why would we want to 
reduce it during a time when we're losing money?" he asked.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FARM WORKERS ACCUSE DOLE OF INTIMIDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of about 35 labor organizers and field workers protested Tuesday 
outside the Dole Food Co. headquarters in Westlake Village over the dismissal 
of two Oxnard celery pickers who said they were fired because they were 
campaigning to start a chapter of the United Farm Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that an employee of Ocean View Produce, a Dole subsidiary in Oxnard, 
had tried to intimidate union organizers and made racial insults to 
fieldworkers, David Martinez, the UFW's secretary-treasurer, called for a 
boycott of Dole products by the Latino community if the workers are not 
rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Dole company thinks Mexicans are ignorant fools and animals, then the 
Dole company doesn't deserve a single cent from Mexicans for their bananas and 
pineapples," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole officials denied the charges of racism and intimidation, and said they 
supported workers' rights to hold a union election. Last week, the UFW gathered 
enough signatures -- more than half of the 600 fieldworkers at Ocean View -- to 
hold an election, scheduled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two workers were let go because they violated company rules and would not 
be rehired, company officials said, refusing to elaborate on what rules had 
been broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their being discharged had nothing to do with their union organizing," Dole 
spokesman Tom Pernice said. "We reject the inflammatory claims made by the UFW, 
and they should be rejected by all Californians, including Latino citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men fired by Ocean View Produce, 32-year-old Ricardo Garcia Cortez, 
said he had been picking celery for the company for seven years. He, his wife 
and their three children are being supported by donations from other workers 
and from the UFW. He is trying to gather support for Friday's election and said 
he wants his job back. 
</P>
<P>
 "How they treated you personally is not important," he said. "To organize the 
workers, that is what is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Estrada Ramos, a full-time volunteer with UFW, accused Dole labor 
consultant Steven Highfield of making racist remarks to him and to 
fieldworkers, including calling workers "pigs" and "ignorant fools." UFW 
contends that Highfield was hired to intimidate workers from joining the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Pernice said Highfield was hired to advise the company on employment law and 
benefits planning, and denied that he made racial comments to Ramos or any 
other workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As pickets shouted the name of UFW founder Cesar Chavez, Dole employees on 
their way back from lunch stopped and stared. Several employees hovered inside 
the locked front doors, opening the door for employees but refusing to admit 
Martinez and Cortez, who asked to talk to company officials. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN FATAL CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Meiners Oaks man pleaded guilty Tuesday to vehicular manslaughter and felony 
drunk driving for smashing his vehicle into an approaching car on California 33 
last February and killing a 6-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmund Castro, 34, who entered the plea in Ventura County Superior Court, 
faces up to 10 years and 8 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, a professional speedway racer nicknamed "Fast Eddie," had a 0.16% 
blood-alcohol level when his car crossed into the oncoming lane and struck a 
vehicle carrying five people, including 6-year-old Sergio Ramirez of Oxnard, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio, who had been riding in the back seat, suffered major head injuries in 
the crash and died later at Ojai Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Also injured in the crash were Sergio's two brothers -- Daniel Albarran, 8, 
and Charles Albarran, 10 -- as well as the boys' mother, Clara Servin, and her 
fiance, Roman Cerda. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was returning from the mountains, where Servin had taken her three 
sons to play in the snow, when their car was struck by Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tragic case where somebody loses a child . . .," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Brian J. Fitzpatrick, who represented Castro, said he 
would ask for probation for the defendant, whom Fitzpatrick described as a 
single father raising children ages 5, 6 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a parent of kids that age, he recognized how awful a thing that was," 
Fitzpatrick said of Sergio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Castro wanted to spare the family of the victim a trial by admitting 
his guilt early in the court proceedings. Sending Castro to prison would only 
compound the tragedy by leaving Castro's children without a father, Fitzpatrick 
contended. DWAYNE BRAY

 Ventura County prosecutors filed a murder charge Tuesday against Gary Michael 
Rose, 25, of Oxnard in the death of his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose faces one charge of murder with the use of a firearm, Ventura County 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Donald C. Glynn said. He was being held at Ventura County 
Jail on $250,000 bail, and his arraignment is scheduled for May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Rose surrendered to police after shooting Victoria Ramey, 31, 
at her Oxnard home Sunday. Friends of the victim said Rose had moved from 
Indiana about two weeks ago and was looking for a job while staying with Ramey. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Ramey, who had been engaged to Rose a few years ago, was 
engaged to be married to another man at the time of her death. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Police arrested four teen-age girls Tuesday after they allegedly stole a 
pickup truck and narrowly missed hitting about a dozen students waiting for a 
school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them had driver's licenses, and they couldn't drive very well," Port 
Hueneme Police Sgt. Jerry Beck said."They were initially going to drop someone 
off at the bus stop, and they were going to make a U-turn, and they blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police received several calls about 8:30 a.m. about a truck out of control 
near the post office in the 500 block of Pleasant Valley Road. The truck, which 
had been reported stolen the day before in Oxnard, knocked over several signs 
before nearly crashing into several students at a bus stop, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup went over the center divider, ran onto and off a sidewalk and hit a 
block wall, Beck said. The driver then put the truck in reverse and drove north 
on Evergreen Lane, where it was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck said he saw the teen-agers running and looking over their shoulders when 
he stopped them a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Four street signs and a sycamore tree were damaged. No one was hurt, Beck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were cars swerving all over the place and horns honking," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the four girls on suspicion of auto theft and hit-and-run 
driving. Arrested were a 17-year-old, 16-year-old and 15-year-old, all from 
Oxnard, and a 14-year-old from Port Hueneme. Their names are being withheld 
because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers were released to their parents and are awaiting a court 
hearing, Beck said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PAROLEE GETS 2 1/3 YEARS FOR DRUG CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
 An Oxnard parolee was sentenced Tuesday to 2 1/3 years in state prison for 
cultivating marijuana, a crime he pleaded guilty to last month after 
prosecutors decided not to charge him under the new "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston A. Shelton, 36, was charged with cultivating seven marijuana plants, a 
felony, only hours after Gov. Pete Wilson signed the new legislation -- which 
mandates sentences of 25 years to life for anyone with prior serious felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton had served more than 10 years in prison for a series of eight 
robberies in Los Angeles County before being released about nine months ago, 
his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on the marijuana charge at his home in the 1200 block of West 
Fir Street in Oxnard. The 28 months handed down to Shelton by Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath was the shortest prison term possible. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY GIVES 1ST OK TO WATER, SEWAGE HIKES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residential water and sewage rates in Ventura would rise 7% under a proposal 
given preliminary approval by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 An average household in Ventura now spends about $75.25 on water and sewage 
bimonthly.The ordinance under consideration by the council would raise that 
bill by $4.91 bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-2 vote Monday, the council preliminarily approved an increase that also 
raises rates for commercial customers by 10% and industrial customers by 12% to 
18%. Council members Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan voted against the increase 
because they said it was not good for business. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases will be effective July 1. The council still must vote on the fee 
hike again before May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee hikes will pay for increased operating costs and future water and 
sewer projects.  
</P>
<P>
 A limited amount will pay for a low-interest loan program to help businesses 
invest in sanitation pre-treatment facilities that would lower overall 
sanitation costs. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESTRICTIONS BACKED ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adult-oriented businesses would be prohibited from locating in most Ventura 
neighborhoods under a proposed law approved Tuesday night by the city Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance, which must be given final approval by the City 
Council, would ban adult theaters, bookstores and other such enterprises from 
all but a few industrial areas. Those areas are mostly south of the Ventura 
Freeway, roughly between Victoria and Arundell avenues, city planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 6 to 1 to recommend the proposed law, with Commissioner 
Ted Temple opposed. Temple said he supports the measure but was concerned that 
use of the term adult-oriented business was not blunt enough, and that such 
businesses should be described as sexually oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also asked staff to prepare a report for the council to find 
out if the city can prohibit such businesses from locating within 100 to 200 
feet of each other. However, staff members said that might result in too few 
available sites and would not be legally defensible under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm afraid of . . . is that Callens Road (where many of the 
businesses could be located) could become a red-light district," Commissioner 
Mike Jones said in asking for the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has had an interim ordinance for two years that allowed a 
pre-existing, adult-oriented business on Main Street to continue operating, but 
prohibited any new such businesses from opening in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved the interim law after church groups and downtown 
merchants objected to a request to open an adult-oriented business near the 
Ventura County superintendent of schools office on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance would prohibit adult-oriented businesses within 500 feet of 
schools, homes, churches, parks or anywhere else children might congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure "would not set anything in stone," City Planner Mitch Oshinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, adult-oriented businesses could locate in any of the 
designated areas. However, the city would consider each request on a 
case-by-case basis, Oshinsky said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; GIANT PLANE MAY LIFT OFF NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A volunteer group restoring a 1950s-era military transport plane say they hope 
to get the giant aircraft into the skies early next month after winning 
permission this week to take off from Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, newly appointed Ventura County Airports Administrator Rod Murphy 
gave approval to the nonprofit Constellation Historical Society to fly the 
C-121C Super Constellation from Camarillo Airport.Earlier this year, county 
officials grounded the huge plane, fearing that it was too heavy for the 
airport's runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft, which served the U. S. Military Transport Service, the U. S. Air 
Force and the Mississippi Air National Guard, weighs about 72,000 pounds 
unloaded and usually about 90,000 pounds when loaded and fueled. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said preliminary studies on the runway by a consultant indicate that it 
is capable of sustaining the weight of the aircraft -- one of only three left 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studies that have been done seem to show that we can authorize limited 
use of this aircraft here," Murphy said. "I think we can work something out 
that all parties will find acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Doyle, general manager of the Constellation's restoration efforts, said 
he was pleased with Murphy's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we're both pleased and relieved," Doyle said. "We are taking 
(Murphy's) decision as a sign of good faith. We think it's a good start in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, however, said he still must decide how many flights the aging warhorse 
may make out of the municipal airport that runs parallel to the Ventura Freeway 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said his group wants to make four to six flights a month in the plane, 
with more flights initially to allow for testing. Murphy said that decision was 
still pending. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; YOUTH TO STAND TRIAL OVER GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks youth must stand trial in connection with several instances of 
gang-related violence in eastern Ventura County last month, a judge ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Willmon -- an 18-year-old, former Westlake High School football player 
-- faces charges of conspiracy to commit assault and assault by means of force 
likely to inflict great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III set his arraignment for May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon was booked on the conspiracy charge for allegedly having a role in 
several street fights that broke out April 14 on Wendy Drive in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights involved three different gangs and occurred within 30 minutes of 
each other, police said. Some gunfire was heard, but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 While free in lieu of $5,000 bail in that case, Willmon was re-arrested April 
21 and accused of bursting into a Thousand Oaks teen-ager's home and beating 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon is now free in lieu of $30,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the judge's order Tuesday, Willmon's attorney said he believes that 
the defense exposed holes in the prosecution's case against Willmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard T. Ferko denied that Willmon assaulted anyone in the Wendy 
Drive fights, saying his client is being charged with "guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferko also denied that Willmon burst into the Thousand Oaks home April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have much evidence," he said. "We put witnesses on who testified 
where Brady was at the time the attack was supposed to have taken place. He was 
not there and didn't have anything to do with it." DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HIGH-TECH BUS PASS TO BE INTRODUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-tech bus pass soon to arrive in Ventura County will work on any bus in 
the county, store important rider information and allow passengers to hop 
aboard without removing the card from their purse or wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an experimental bus pass program, Ventura County bus riders will 
get the chance to try the Smart Card, a credit card-sized pass containing a 
tiny computer memory chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The chip is powerful enough to transmit information without being removed from 
a purse or wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like to tell people they can do that because then they start coming 
onto the buses with these huge purses and setting them right on the sensor 
machine," Smart Card spokesman Ray Rebeiro said. "We prefer it if they take the 
card out and place it on the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the $675,000 cost of the pass program will be paid by the California 
Department of Transportation, which received a federal grant to fund a 
state-of-the-art bus pass service. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans chose Ventura County for the pilot program because of the county's 
manageable size and because of a new countywide bus service that will be 
launched this summer, said Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the county 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a good place to test something like this because we have a lot of the 
same problems as larger counties," she said. "But we're small enough that it's 
not as difficult to try out something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will start installing Smart Card equipment in buses this summer, 
Gherardi said. In addition to on-board card scanners, Caltrans will install 
sensors on buses, allowing the agency to count riders who are not using the 
pass as well as those who do. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment will also be installed on VISTA buses, the new countywide line 
scheduled to begin service July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smart Card system should be up and running by October, Gherardi said. SARA

 Moorpark residents will be able to rid their homes of old paints, solvents, 
pesticides, cleansers and batteries from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday during the 
city's first collection of household hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 A maximum of five gallons or 50 pounds of material will be accepted from each 
resident, said Jill Ruben-Myers, Moorpark's coordinator of solid waste.The city 
will not accept business or commercial waste, used medical supplies, old 
explosives, tires, or radioactive material, Ruben-Myers said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because waste space will be limited to that of 250 residents, appointments are 
required. Residents will be notified of the location of the collection site -- 
and provided with maps -- when they make appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointments may be made using the city's 24-hour appointment line at 
529-6864, Ext. 333. The deadline for calling is 5 p.m. Thursday. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: NEWBURY PARK; ESCROW CLOSES ON PART OF RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Formalizing a deal made months ago, the National Park Service has closed 
escrow on nearly half of the 640-acre Broome Ranch in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service bought 312 acres, including the eastern third of the ranch 
and the rocky ridges along the southern edge.Total price was $1.3 million, said 
David Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Escrow's closed," Gackenbach said. "It's great. We're excited any time we buy 
more property." 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service has not yet determined whether to build trails through Broome 
Ranch or how best to provide access to the rugged terrain, Gackenbach said. The 
acquisition links with existing parkland known as Rancho Sierra Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency, a joint board including the city of 
Thousand Oaks and the Conejo Recreation and Park District, will soon take 
control of the remaining 328 acres of Broome Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation and park district has already paid for the land -- with $1 
million coming from the city and another $1.9 million from the park district -- 
but has not yet taken formal title from the purchasing arm of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very simple transaction," said Rorie Skei, a conservancy official 
who sits on the COSCA board. She said the move could come soon. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover the cost of buying Broome Ranch, city and park district officials 
have proposed building a golf course on the flat field along Potrero Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, plans for a golf course have not moved past the conceptual stage.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EVENT TO HONOR RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A live band, clowns and cartoon characters will be a few of the surprises at 
an event honoring Ventura County American Red Cross volunteers today at Golf N 
Stuff in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 volunteers have made reservations to participate in the 
"Volunteer Appreciation Celebration," which is the first such event of this 
scale, said Brian Bolton, executive director of the Ventura County Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 At the festivities, to be held from 6 to 9 p.m., golf and all the rides are 
being provided free to volunteers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been such a big and serious year that we decided to have a fun and 
relaxing type of activity -- a celebration just to enjoy each other's company," 
Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's more than 2,000 Red Cross volunteers have provided an 
extraordinary amount of emergency relief services to residents in the past 
year, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Jan. 17 earthquake, more than 650 volunteers opened six relief 
centers providing 92,563 meals, delivering health services to 718 people and 
offering shelter to thousands, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's and Vons grocery stores will provide refreshments served by 
Southern California Edison workers, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to have a celebration," he said, "and just enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers who want to make last-minute reservations should call the Red Cross 
at 339-2234. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Food Share is asking that all kinds of canned food be donated, particularly 
meats such as tuna, corned beef hash and ham. The food bank also seeks food 
rich in protein and carbohydrates including rice, pasta, peanut butter and 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help us to replenish our food stock," said Jewel Pedi, executive 
director of Food Share. "Since we had the earthquake, our shelves have become a 
bit empty." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is part of a nationwide food drive sponsored by the National Assn. 
of Letter Carriers and the U. S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter carriers will pick up the food and drop it at the nearest post office. 
The food collected locally will then be trucked to Food Share office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year letter carriers have mounted a food drive in the 
county. During last year's drive they collected more than 40 tons of food, Pedi 
said. "We are expecting to double the amount (of food) this year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal workers are also looking for volunteers to help to pick up food and 
take it to Food Share's warehouse. Volunteers are asked to call Janice Olver at 
647-3944. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RULING ON MUNICIPAL JUDGES IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal judges can try cases on the Ventura County Superior Court bench, a 
state appeals court said Tuesday, rejecting an appeal of a court consolidation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The county public defender's office had challenged the court officials' 
decision to allow two Municipal Court judges to act as Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the appeal, Deputy Public Defender Christina Briles contended that the 
consolidation violated voter rights, jurisdictional limits, and separation of 
the Municipal and Superior courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura denied the writ and refused to 
give an opinion on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Briles said the public defender's office is considering other options, such as 
an appeal to the state Supreme Court or a federal court. She said a decision 
would be made within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant County Counsel Robert Orellana said the state appeals court 
decision not to hear the issue vindicates charges that Ventura County court 
officials implemented their consolidation plan illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think a federal court would be interested in this because there are 
no federal issues" in dispute with the consolidation, Orellana said. DWAYNE

BRAVE CANINE HONORED FOR QUAKE RESCUE; HEROISM: THE SPCA HEAPS PRAISE AND CASH 
AWARD ON SAMOYED STELLA, WHO SHIELDED HER SIMI VALLEY OWNER FROM A FALLING WALL 
UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They were the best of dogs. They were the worst of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tale of two Simi Valley canines, each without warning faced with the 
horrors of January's magnitude 6.8 earthquake. There was Stella, the loyal 
heroine, man's best friend, who threw herself atop her mistress's body and 
absorbed the near-fatal impact of a falling oak wall unit. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Wilbur, who tried to hide under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 For her troubles, Stella, a puffy white Samoyed, nearly lost her left paw, got 
to endure four hours of surgery and now owns a permanent limp. But before TV 
cameras and a fitting crowd of news hounds Tuesday, the gritty pooch was 
honored with the 12th annual "hero dog" award presented by the Los Angeles 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella got a plaque and a $100 check, enough to offset some of her $2,000 in 
veterinary bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur got to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She jumped on my stomach area and took the blow," Stella's proud owner, Myrna 
Huffman, told reporters in recalling the chaos of the pre-dawn Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake that toppled the massive wall unit and all its contents, 
including a television. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffman did not see it begin to fall, apparently Stella did and took 
action, even as Wilbur, Huffman's English sheep dog, scrambled for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the only explanation Huffman can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, Stella was there," the owner said. "If she hadn't done it, 
I'd either be maimed or . . . maybe dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilbur, he was taking care of himself," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman is not bitter. Wilbur is just that way -- nervous, outgoing, a little 
goofy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week Stella was gone for surgery, Wilbur pined for her. "They are 
very much in love," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stella is fit enough to devour the prime rib reward dinner that Huffman 
has promised her, Wilbur will get some too. And Wilbur, although he owns a 
doghouse, is not in it, at least not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sleeps in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The moral? Perhaps there isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday was a dog's day -- Stella's day. 
</P>
<P>
 How about it, girl? Was it . . . rrruuuff? 
</P>
<P>
 Stella did not answer. But her limp and her tongue hanging out said it all.

COUNTY APPROVES 2-YEAR EXTENSION FOR PRIVATE AMBULANCE FIRMS; EMERGENCY 
SERVICES: BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOWS TO OPEN UP BIDDING IN FUTURE TO INCLUDE 
FIRE DEPARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The private ambulance companies serving Ventura County won a two-year 
extension on their contracts Tuesday, but could soon face competition from 
firefighters who say they can transport patients more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they approved the contract extension, the County Board of Supervisors 
pledged to open the bidding process next time to other alternatives, including 
proposals from fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there is a very strong push from the public to take a good look at 
this issue," Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said. "If we do that, it's going to be 
a monumental decision and it's going to take a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year extension, board members said, will buy the county time to 
explore its options and, if necessary, make the transition to a public system. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension also forces Pruner Health Services Inc. to provide an ambulance 
in Oak Park, a community that has long complained about slow response times. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner promised Oak Park an ambulance in July, but later said it would not 
make a commitment to the unincorporated area without a contract extension, 
VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision Tuesday angered Ventura city leaders, who are already 
exploring whether to replace Pruner with the city's firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't even given us a chance to see if it's worthwhile," Ventura City 
Councilman Jack Tingstrum said. "Let's let us bid on it and see how it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, Ventura County began coordinating ambulance services for 
all the cities. The county now has contracts with three companies: Ojai 
Ambulance Service for Ojai, Gold Coast Ambulance Service Inc. for Oxnard and 
Port Hueneme, and Pruner Health Services for the remainder of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The private companies receive a subsidy from the county, totaling $238,700, 
but earn most of their revenues from fees charged to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been complaints about the charges in some cases," said Phillipp 
Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency. "There have been 
complaints about response time, mostly in the Oak Park area. Short of that, 
it's been a good service." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura firefighters lined up Tuesday morning to dispel that notion. Fire 
Capt. Michael Vaughan told of waiting 18 minutes for an ambulance to come for a 
teen-age boy who was hit by a train. Fire Capt. Paul Masiel recounted how the 
husband of a burn victim drove his wife to the hospital after waiting more than 
15 minutes for an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was rather frustrating for us and for the patient," Masiel told the 
board. "From my perspective, it happens far too frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 But private ambulance paramedics defended their work, saying their response 
times meet county standards and often average four to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One paramedic suggested that the firefighters wanted to take over ambulance 
work simply "to justify their large staff and big firetrucks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the firemen, my bottom line is patient care," said Lynn McMillen, a 
paramedic with Gold Coast in Oxnard. "I feel my reputation is being tarnished 
by these gentlemen who are trying to make their own jobs more secure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Fire Department wants to buy its own ambulances and take over 
transporting patients to hospitals. County firefighters have also pushed for a 
larger role in treating accident victims, but the county board has rejected 
their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board asked Wessels to return in July with a realistic 
schedule for when the county could begin seeking bids for new ambulance 
contracts. That schedule should have enough time built in for a transition to 
public firefighter services, if that is what the board chooses, members said.

PANEL BACKS AWAY FROM TIGHTENING SMOG RULES; THOUSAND OAKS: BUDGET-BASED ACTION 
EXCLUDES MAJOR CHANGES TO THE CITY'S AIR POLLUTION POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing that the city won't have money to pay for improvements, Thousand Oaks 
planners have backed away from plans to tighten the city's smog and traffic 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission on Monday night unanimously approved a revised traffic 
control ordinance that excludes any major changes to the city's existing 
traffic and smog-reduction policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The new version, which still must go before the City Council, eliminates 
several tangible proposals, including plans to link traffic signals to a master 
computer and require city buses to run on alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean that we don't want to do these things," said city Traffic 
Engineer John Helliwell, who put together the revised plan. "But because we 
don't have a confirmed source of funding, we don't want to put them in the 
ordinance. We just don't want to commit to them and then find out later we 
can't do them." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is required by law to submit a smog-reduction plan to county 
officials for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved Monday contains major changes from the draft submitted to 
the commission April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Several commissioners left the meeting with the sense that the measure had no 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this as a bureaucratic exercise," Commissioner Mervyn Kopp said. "The 
bureaucrats like paper, and that's all we've given them." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the transportation control ordinance is to set goals that the 
city must meet to reduce pollution and traffic. If the city does not meet its 
goals, it could face federal sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions could include the withholding of federal highway and waste-water 
funds, a staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing those sanctions, Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman said it would 
be a mistake for the city to overcommit to smog-reduction programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that this is the minimum we can submit and still get away 
with it," he said. "We really have no choice in the matter because this is a 
commitment that is going to be nailed to the wall and that we cannot back away 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure passed Monday offers only two additions to the city's existing 
policy. They are a commitment to add a smog-reduction element to the general 
plan and an addition proposed Monday by Planning Commissioner Linda Parks that 
would encourage businesses to start a "shoppers' shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the proposal asked only for the formation of a business association, it 
would not cost the city, she said. And, at the same time, it could result in a 
bus taking shoppers from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks said she was disappointed that the city was unwilling to take steps 
toward other new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed that we weren't attempting to do anything innovative," she 
said. "I see so many opportunities for innovative programs like ride-sharing 
and transit shuttles that we are just not pursuing."

BID TO RECALL 3 SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS FAILS; SIMI VALLEY: BACKERS MISS DEADLINE 
FOR FILING PETITIONS. TRUSTEES SAY PUBLIC SUPPORT WAS LACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An attempt to recall three Simi Valley school board members officially died 
Tuesday when proponents missed the deadline for filing the signatures needed to 
qualify for a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Since declaring their intentions in the fall, backers of the recall had 160 
days to gather 8,232 signatures on each of three petitions targeting board 
members Carla Kurachi, Diane Collins and Debbie Sandland. 
</P>
<P>
 The last day for filing those petitions was Tuesday and, by the close of the 
business day, county elections officials said they had not received any 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard from them at all," said Jenny Harrison, deputy county clerk. 
"It's about like they died on the vine." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort was launched in October by a group of parents upset over 
criticism of fundamental schools, changes to a sex education curriculum and the 
defeat of a plan to establish four-year high schools in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Otto, spokesman for the pro-recall group Parents Aligned for Children's 
Education or PACE, said the dissatisfaction was also driven by deeper 
ideological differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that PACE was a more conservative group of people," he 
said. "You definitely had a difference of opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Otto said the recall drive fizzled initially because of delays in getting 
petitions printed, and then because of the Jan. 17 earthquake and the fatal 
stabbing of a Valley View Junior High student. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would have canvassed the city for signatures turned their attention 
to repairing shaken residences and trying to improve campus safety throughout 
the Simi Valley Unified School District, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two things have affected this community like nothing else," said Otto, 
who would not disclose how many -- if any -- signatures were gathered on the 
recall petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board members who were targeted, and a group that formed in their 
defense, held a different view on why the recall effort faded. They said it 
simply failed to attract public support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think PACE never had any firm basis in the first place," said Linda 
Jordan-O'Connor, a leader of Simi People Against Recall. "When they found out 
the facts, people in Simi Valley could not support it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sandland blasted Otto for blaming the demise of the recall on the 
earthquake and the stabbing, which prompted the district to form several 
committees to study campus safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to use the earthquake and that horrible stabbing on one of our 
campuses is pretty sickening to me," she said. "It was a big excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandland also attacked the members of PACE for being secretive and, she said, 
for not caring what a special election would cost the district, especially when 
Kurachi and board member Doug Crosse are up for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so frustrating for these people not to step forward," she said. "It's 
very difficult as an elected official to go through such a trying time, 
especially when it's so unwarranted and unjustified." 
</P>
<P>
 Otto said the other parents involved in PACE never spoke out publicly because 
it was decided that a single spokesman would be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cost of staging a special election, Otto said PACE members were 
more alarmed with the views of the three school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Otto and Sandland did agree on one thing: The subjects that fueled the 
short-lived recall attempt are very likely to surface in November's school 
board race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message to the community is that even though the recall didn't work, the 
issues are still there," Otto said. "I would hope as a result of all this, we 
end up having a more understanding group of parents that knows what's going on 
in our schools."

ELECIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR; TAXPAYER ADVOCATE ROBINGS CARRIES HIS 
CRUSADE INTO BID FOR OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings announced his candidacy for Ventura 
County supervisor in November, he said he was doing so because of "unfinished 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 For Robings, that unfinished business means reducing benefits for county 
administrators and employees, stopping the formation of benefit assessment 
districts, cutting back regulations on business and demanding audits of all 
county departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to do is bring out to the public's attention the abuses that have 
taken place at the county," said Robings, 62. "If people get elected to office 
and take advantage of the county budget for their own personal gain, that's 
money coming out of services to the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was ousted last year as executive director of the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn., Robings was the county's most outspoken critic of the large 
financial perks paid annually to county administrators and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just took care of themselves first and let whatever else come second," 
said Robings, who has been endorsed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's Assn. in 
the race for the 2nd Supervisorial District, covering Thousand Oaks, Oak Park 
and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of controversy, the supervisors voted in December, 1992, to 
accept a citizen committee's recommendation and eliminate many of the financial 
benefits for board members and other elected leaders. But the panel softened 
the financial blow by folding some benefits into the supervisors' base salaries 
-- resulting in a pay increase of $14,300 to $64,543. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said there are still some benefits remaining for administrators and 
elected officials that should be cut. For example, he said county officials get 
$4,500 in annual car allowance plus 28 cents per mile. "I think they should 
take either one, but not both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, the candidate said he would also push to eliminate the four-day 
workweek for county employees. Although they still put in 40 hours a week by 
working 10 hours a day, Robings says most are gone Fridays, making it difficult 
for people in need of county services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four-day workweek is an abomination," Robings said. "The government 
should be there to serve the people, not vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robings said his first priority will be to focus on wasteful spending. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Robings said he opposed county firefighters' demand for a share 
of money generated from Proposition 172 -- a sales tax initiative approved by 
state voters in November to help fund public safety programs. The money is now 
split among the county's law enforcement agencies and criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings, who campaigned against Proposition 172, pointed out that an audit of 
the county Fire Department released in October showed that it was top-heavy 
with managers, spends too much on overtime and is too lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said he also did not support creation of a county firefighter 
paramedic program because there is no money for it and because he is not 
convinced that it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 To help boost the local economy, Robings said he supports a proposal to 
develop a commercial airport at Point Mugu. The Navy has offered to share its 
runway with the county to help cut operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Camarillo officials have voiced concerns about noise and flight 
patterns, Robings said he believes that those concerns can be addressed by 
requiring the majority of flights to arrive and depart over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't shut down transportation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of waste management, Robings said he supports development of a 
new west county landfill to keep the Simi Valley Landfill from becoming the 
county's only dump. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to develop a new landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai has been 
successfully opposed by officials and residents there for years. Meanwhile, 
Bailard Landfill in Oxnard is scheduled to close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said the county has always had landfills in both the east and west 
county, and should continue to maintain two dumps. But he said he is not 
certain whether Weldon Canyon is the best site for a new landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate's opponents in the June 7 election include Thousand Oaks City 
Councilman Frank Schillo, former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, 
attorney Trudi Loh and rancher Carter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his critics question why Robings, who has spent the last five years 
railing at county officials for some of their spending practices, would want to 
be part of a government panel for which he has had so much contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robings said he believes that he can have more effect working within the 
system. "I've been trying to bring about changes in the county for five years 
from one side of the table," he said. "Now it's time to get around to the other 
side and bring about changes from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Clemence, executive director of the Ventura County Alliance of Taxpayers, 
another tax watchdog group set up last year, described Robings as a man of 
action whose managerial background and understanding of county finances set him 
apart from the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the most informed person I know," Clemence said. "And he's a man of 
integrity. If he thinks he's right about something, there's no talking him out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have known Robings or worked closely with him in the past describe 
him in more ambiguous terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the kind of guy you love, but can hit on the head with a 4-by-4 
sometimes," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), for whom Robings once 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings' outspoken manner has won him as many friends as it has made him 
enemies. The Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. fired him for being too 
confrontational and overzealous in his attacks of county officials over the 
perks issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think very highly of Jere," said Lindsay Nielson, president of the 
association. "But I believe his political ambition has gotten the best of him. 
His lack of judgment overshadows his good points." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a complaint that comes up repeatedly with former friends and associates 
of the candidate. But Robings himself insists that he never even thought of 
running for public office until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was politically ambitious, I would not have waited until I was 61 to get 
into politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if his ambition was not political, it nevertheless has had an effect on 
his working relationship with others. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from Southern California Edison in 1988, Robings went to work 
for Gallegly as a field representative. A year later, he resigned as part of a 
mutual agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jere's style is different than mine," Gallegly said. "I have a lower profile. 
I like to get as much done without making a lot of noise. It was a situation 
where the shoe didn't fit." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, Gallegly said Robings' strong personality left constituents with 
the wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some people come to me who said, 'You know, Jere thinks he's the 
congressman,' " Gallegly said. "He never gave me that impression. But I think 
it would be fair to say I heard that from a lot of folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said he never knew of any such complaints. He said he and Gallegly did 
have disagreements on how his job should be conducted, but that he resigned 
only after receiving an offer from the taxpayers association. 
</P>
<P>
 After 3 1/2 years in that position, Robings was fired. Nielson said members of 
the taxpayer group thought that he had become too vocal about the perks issue 
and they feared that he might be using his position to launch a political 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that he was always running from the day he had that 
office," Nielson said. "He's always had political ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings disputed this contention after announcing his candidacy in November. 
"I'm sure some will feel that way," he said, referring to Nielson's remarks. 
"But they're in error. The (perks issue) was something that had to be brought 
out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, Robings joined the newly formed Ventura County Alliance of 
Taxpayers as president. 
</P>
<P>
 And in November, he made headlines again when he came under fire from county 
officials and associates of the alliance for arranging for four newspaper ads 
attacking a proposal to expand Ventura County Medical Center by adding a 
$30-million outpatient wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance was identified as sponsor of the ads. But it was later revealed 
that the ads had been paid for by an Orange County consulting firm that had 
been working for Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The private hospital was running its own campaign opposing expansion of the 
public hospital, which it considers an emerging competitor for private 
patients. Community Memorial's campaign included joint sponsorship of the 
$6,000 newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the hospital later withdrew its sponsorship, the ads ran anyway 
because the consulting firm hired by Community Memorial had mistakenly placed 
them too soon. As a result, the firm agreed to pick up the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk publicly criticized Robings and Community Memorial 
for their connection with the ads, which she said was part of an underhanded, 
behind-the-scenes campaign to squelch the expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ads appeared, Robings declined to identify who paid for them, saying 
only that they were "people who supported the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gage, then chairman of the taxpayer alliance, told reporters that Robings 
ran the ads without the backing of the group's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jere just got out of hand," said Gage, who resigned from the alliance over 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said he did not need to consult with Gage about the ads because "I was 
in charge of running the alliance. I did everything." He said Gage and Gage's 
son-in-law, Dr. Mike Bailey, resigned because Bailey worked for the county 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gage said he resigned because Robings was willing to take a large sum of money 
from a special-interest group to campaign against the county project, a move 
that Gage believed compromised the reputation of the taxpayer organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is flying into the sun," said Gage, who put up several thousand 
dollars of his own money to form the alliance. "He's off balance and 
uncontrollable." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings makes no apologies for his actions. He said the county has yet to 
produce any financial analysis of the hospital project that would convince him 
that it should go forward. County supervisors have approved the expansion in 
concept, but will not consider a funding package until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those ads hadn't run," Robings said, "I'm convinced that the hospital 
expansion would have been approved and zipped through, and the public never 
would have known what was happening." Profile of H. Jere Robings

<TEXT>
<P>
 May 1994 -- Ram owner Georgia Frontiere says she is considering moving her 
team out of Anaheim because Southern California fans are too fickle and not 
"gung-ho for the team, win or lose. It's that way in some other cities . . . 
but there are so many alternatives in Southern California. It's very, very 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 July 1994 -- Rams open what is expected to be their final summer training camp 
in Orange County. "Watch Wayne Gandy Protect Chris Miller's Backside" 
season-ticket campaign fails miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 4, 1994 -- Rams lose their season opener to Arizona, 44-8, in front of 
only 22,103 at Anaheim Stadium. "I'm surprised that many showed up," Arizona 
Coach Buddy Ryan crows afterward. "Course, if they hired me when they had the 
chance, there'd a been a butt in every damn seat and a line out the door from 
here to San Juan Cappuccino . . . Cappelletti . . . you know, that monk place 
where all the damn birds go. And Georgia wouldn't be movin' anywhere, 'cept to 
a bigger bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 18, 1994 -- San Francisco rookie defensive tackle Bryant Young, selected 
by the 49ers after trading up with the Rams on draft day, breaks through the 
Rams' offensive line and blind-sides Chris Miller, crushing the quarterback's 
right knee. Miller is lost for the season. Rams lose, 30-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 11, 1994 -- Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Trent Dilfer passes for 487 
yards and five touchdowns as Buccaneers defeat Rams, 45-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 24, 1994 -- Rams lose to Washington, 6-3, in what is billed as the team's 
final home game at Anaheim Stadium. Among the 14,149 fans in attendance, four 
unfurl a banner that says, "We Give, We Give. Please Georgia, Move The Team." 
Rams finish 2-14, their only two victories coming against the New Orleans 
Saints, who release Jim Everett at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 February 1995 -- Rams sign a letter of intent to move to Baltimore. "I think 
Baltimore misses having a football team," Frontiere says. "The people seem 
eager to have it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 April 1995 -- Holding the No. 1 pick in the draft, Rams keep trading down 
until they collect all 30 selections in the seventh round. With them, the Rams 
draft 30 offensive linemen. "We need a lot of big guys to help move all this 
furniture," Coach Chuck Knox explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 9, 1995 -- Rams play their first game in Baltimore before a sellout 
crowd of 72,000. In a special pregame ceremony, Johnny Unitas throws a red,

</P>
<P>
 Dec. 30, 1995 -- Rams lose their season finale, 28-10, to Atlanta. Rams finish

You really like us!" 
</P>
<P>
 January 1996 -- Knox resigns as Ram coach to accept a scouting position with 
the 49ers. "I'm going to get to a Super Bowl one way or another," he says.

Arizona State's all-time career leader in hamstring pulls, a gun-shy 
quarterback from Purdue and a goaltender from Swift Current, Saskatchewan, whom 
they plan to convert to cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 April 1999 -- Rams use the last three picks from the Bettis trade to draft a 
one-legged punter from Wayne State, a tight end from the Betty Ford Clinic and 
the intramural flag football rushing champion from Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>

 December 1999 -- Rams finish 4-12 for the fourth straight season. Average home 
attendance slips to 32,000. Frontiere threatens to move Rams to a city where 
the fans are "gung-ho for the team, win or lose."

<P>
 February 2000 -- Rams sign a letter of intent to move to Shreveport, La., 
which has been without pro football since the Steamer of the old World Football 
League folded in 1975. "I think Shreveport misses having a football team," 
Frontiere says. "People seem eager to have it happen again."

<P>
 March 2000 -- Citing a desire to "restore Ram football to the prominence of 
its glory years," Rams hire Jackie Slater as player-coach.

HE'S READY TO CRASH THE INDY 500'S PARTY; AUTO RACING: DESPITE HIS 12 WRECKS 
FOR FOYT LAST YEAR, DON'T CALL GORDON CARELESS -- OR CARLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though Robby Gordon crashed A.J. Foyt's cars on 12 occasions last season 
-- including one wreck at Indianapolis that caused Foyt to retire on the spot 
-- he resents having the reputation of a car crasher. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old Southern Californian says Foyt did not provide him with the 
proper opportunity to develop his obvious talent for driving fast, a 
circumstance he says he is getting this year with Derrick Walker, a soft-spoken 
Scotsman who approaches racing with a more professorial attitude than the 
quick-tempered Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was my first real season in Indy cars, and when you want to climb 
to the next ladder, without a backup car and without testing, you've got to run 
over your head now and then," Gordon said. "I never felt I was getting the same 
opportunity as the drivers on some of the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've won (off-road races in) Baja (California), driving by myself 
one time, and you don't win down there, where there is liable to be something 
around the corner on every turn, without knowing how to save the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon drove 17 hours solo in a Ford truck and won the Baja 1000 off-road race 
in 1989, a feat that caught the eye of Ford racing executives and led to his 
first Indy car ride. "I don't want anyone to think I didn't learn a lot from 
him, I did," Gordon said of his year with Foyt. "But it was tough, real tough. 
I'll say this, though, I'm the only driver who has made it through a whole year 
with A.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, when Foyt suffered shattered feet in a crash at Elkhart Lake, 
Wis., and began putting other drivers in his No. 14 car, the list has included 
Al Unser, Mike Groff, Ross Cheever, Bernard Jourdain, Jeff Andretti, Brian 
Bonner, Didier Theys, Gregor Foytek, Jan Beekhuis, Davy Jones -- who was let go 
last week -- and now Brian Herta, his current driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them didn't last more than a race or two, so I feel pretty good about 
my record," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's brush with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway wall last May 15 -- the 
one that triggered Foyt's retirement -- occurred during morning practice before 
the first qualifying session. Foyt was on the track at the time but when Gordon 
hit the wall for the second time in two days, Foyt pulled into the pits, took 
off his helmet and said he was through with race car driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't run a team the way it ought to be run and still be on the track 
myself, so I'm calling it quits," the four-time 500 winner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he grounded Gordon for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, we were probably good for each other," Gordon said. "I think he 
likes someone who's not afraid to voice an opinion. When I told him I wasn't 
happy, he didn't like it, but I think he respected my saying it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 15 races, Gordon had 10 finishes in the top 10, including a second at 
Mid-Ohio and a third in the season opener in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 When Al Unser Jr. left the Galles team and the Valvoline sponsorship at the 
end of the season, it set in motion a series of events that led to Gordon's 
moving to Walker's team. Valvoline chose to sponsor one of Walker's cars, with 
the stipulation that he have an American driver. Canadian Scott Goodyear had 
been Walker's driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Derrick called, I contacted Parnelli Jones about whether I should make 
the move or not," Gordon said. "Parnelli had raced with my dad (off-road racing 
champion Bob Gordon) for years and I knew him pretty well. He told me it was a 
good opportunity. I knew that Walker had helped Rick Mears make the move from 
desert racing to Indy cars, so I bought out my contract from A.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was a crewman with Roger Penske's team when Mears took his Indy car 
driver's test at Phoenix in 1977 and was Penske's crew chief when Mears won his 
four Indy 500s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't much alike except for their feel for the car," Walker said. 
"Robby is more of a risk taker, where Rick was very calculating, more of a 
controlled individual. We are beginning to see some patience in Robby, but he 
has a ways to go before he has a handle on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to stifle his risk taking, but we want to temper it. If it 
stops him from winning races, it's bad. But if taking a few risks is what he 
needs to win, we'll let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most impressive thing about Robby, and remember he has very limited 
experience in open-wheel cars, is his ability to always have something in 
reserve. Just when you think he is running at the car's limit, he can step up 
to another level. What he's got to learn is not to try it every single lap. 
Overall, I have been pleased with his progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon says his four months with Walker have given him a new outlook on Indy 
car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said I was too hot-headed with A.J., but Derrick says I am one of the 
calmest drivers he's known," Gordon said. "He says my voice never sounds 
excited, or out of control, during a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk a lot, because he is a great strategist. He knows how to play the 
game as the race is being run, and that's something I need. He is like Penske 
and some of the guys like that who try to outsmart the opposition as well as 
outrun them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon has been a factor of sorts in all three Indy car races this season. He 
ran among the leaders in each and might have won at Phoenix had he not run out 
of fuel while in the lead, 13 seconds ahead of eventual winner Emerson 
Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get all the fuel in on our first pit stop and the difference was 
not much more than a gallon, but that was enough," Gordon said. "Emmo 
(Fittipaldi) would probably have taken the lead back when we pitted, but we 
were running him down. I ran Phoenix like I used to run Baja -- stay in sight 
of the leaders, don't jeopardize the car by over-driving and race for the 
finish -- but then the gas ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "With just a tiny bit of luck and a caution flag at the right time, we'd have 
had a win. We definitely had a car that could have won. I stayed out of the 
Villeneuve-Matsushita accident by being extra careful when I went by it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, Gordon finished third, 42 seconds behind winner Al Unser Jr. 
after leading briefly in mid-race. "Derrick has made me feel more a part of the 
team than I did with Foyt," Gordon said. "The crew works really well together 
and we hang out together. I look after them, and they look after me." 
</P>
<P>
 A crew can make a difference in the race, too, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average pit stop with Foyt was 22 seconds," he said. "Derrick's crew can 
get me out in 13 seconds. That's a nine-second shift, and that's an awful lot 
of time to try and make up on the track when cars are as competitive as they 
are today." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon moved into the top 10 practice lap leaders Tuesday with a lap at 
225.129 m.p.h.

JUICE OR PULP?; WHY ARE THERE MORE HOME RUNS THIS SEASON? LIVELY BALLS? 
GRAVITY? OR SIMPLY BAD PITCHING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 We've often been told that baseball is a funny game, and now, as it turns out, 
so is the baseball itself. It seems that yesterday's bland prop actually has 
star potential, which can mean only that the once-lowly baseball was only 
fooling us before. 
</P>
<P>
 What the baseball is saying this season in the major leagues is this: Do not 
think of us merely as colorless round objects in borrowed cow clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside that white, hand-stitched, full-grain leather jacket beats the 
rubber-covered cork heart of an extrovert, even if it is clothed in three 
separate windings of 85% wool and a fourth winding of that winning combination 
of pleasing polyester and cool cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the year of the baseball, all right. After all, they made a film called 
"Mr. Baseball," right? Does anyone remember a movie called "Mr. Bat" or "Mr. 
First Base" or "Mr. Infield Fly Rule?" 
</P>
<P>
 The superstar that has emerged this season is none other than the baseball, 
mainly because it has been flying out of the ballparks as if it had wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting hit so hard, you could hang clothes on them," said former 
pitcher Bill (Spaceman) Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is right, too. The last time there were this many home runs this early in 
the season was never. 
</P>
<P>
 What could be the reason for this? Poor pitchers? Heavy hitters? Expansion? 
Acid rain? 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, naturally, has a theory. He said somebody is tampering with gravity. It's 
a serious charge, he acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's pretty clear there are more homers because of the lower pressure of 
the earth," he said. "It's like Kurt Vonnegut said, we're losing our gravity." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated. But setting 
Lee's theory aside for the time being, could it possibly be the baseballs? Has 
somebody given them something to help them travel? Something other than an 
airline ticket? 
</P>
<P>
 Some -- many, in fact -- say the baseball is juiced, which is slightly 
different from the rabbit ball but clearly related as long as carrot juice is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Garagiola disagrees with the prevalent theory. He says history is merely 
repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the ball juiced?" he said. "No, but I think the pitchers are." 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening now reminds Garagiola of the 1948 season, when he was 
catching for the St. Louis Cardinals. That year, too, baseballs were flying 
without their pilots' licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Garagiola's friends was a Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher named Ernie (Tiny) 
Bonham, who had some novel ideas about the lively baseballs. "One time he said, 
'I don't know if there is any rabbit in these balls, but I saw four of them in 
the equipment bag and 20 minutes later there were 27,' " Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time, he said, 'I don't know if the ball is juiced, but I was 
standing in the outfield and I saw one of them eating grass.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And 46 years later, Garagiola is seeing the same thing. Maybe not a baseball 
eating grass, but you get the idea. He simply doesn't know why he is seeing it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on now, I can't explain it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And who can? A spokesman for Rawlings Sporting Goods Co. said the balls are no 
different from last year's, or any other year's. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlings holds a contract with the major leagues to provide baseballs. Since 
1977, Rawlings has produced about 600,000 balls each year for the American and 
National Leagues. The ball is being made for Rawlings in Costa Rica after a 
move from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The composition of the ball hasn't changed since 1931, when the cork center 
was replaced by a cork center cushioned with layers of black rubber and red 
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball cannot weigh less than five ounces or more than 5 1/4 ounces and must 
be no less than nine inches or more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the rules. But what if there weren't any? For instance, if someone 
wanted to juice a baseball, how would that someone do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Di Tullio of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an instructor 
in the department of aerodynamics. Di Tullio is an inventor on the side. He has 
designed a dimpled bat that he says makes the ball go farther. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Tullio said it wouldn't be hard to make the ball livelier, but it wouldn't 
be very sporting. "All you have to do is change the materials," he said. "Get a 
different core. And wind it with something besides wool, maybe with plastic or 
rubber. But you just can't go tampering with it. You can't be obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to alter the ball to make it livelier probably is to wind the 
wool tighter, although that might affect the weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is another way. Want to juice a baseball? Simple. Cast a 
spell. And for casting spells, there is no one better than a witch. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara McGraw is a witch, or a Wiccan, a practitioner of the religion of 
earth magic. McGraw, a doctoral student in the religion department at USC, said 
the idea would be to concentrate on calling on the energy of the elements to 
aid the batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sample, in case there is a spelling test: "I call all the elements 
of the world to be with me as the swing of my bat impacts the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 If the casting of spells gets popular, though, there is a chance this could 
get out of hand and baseballs would be so totally airborne they would establish 
their own flight patterns, especially if somebody else is turning down the 
gravity spigot. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, then there will be even more pressure to sober up that 
baseball again. Garagiola suggested one way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not make them flat on one side?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Some say the earth is flat, why not a baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah, that'll never fly. Better get the witch on the phone again. Home Run 
Derby 
</P>
<P>
 The figures being posted this season are truly in a league of their own. A 
look at what the end results could be. Statistics through May 9: 04,18,05,05,17

 If the baseball that is producing a record pace for home runs this year is any 
different, it isn't by design. The composition of the ball hasn't changed since

MIKE DOWNEY: IT'S TIME FOR L.A. TO NIP N.Y. STUFF IN THE LARRY BUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Letterman once invested money in the Seattle Mariners, thereby proving 
himself to be a very funny guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying a piece of Seattle's baseball team is like buying a painting of a clown 
on black velvet. Nobody could profit from owning the Mariners, with the 
possible exception of Hillary Rodham Clinton. And even she would rather own 
cattle futures than Seattle futures. Cattle could outplay Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave's a big fan. Athletes are always popping up on his show. Dave has had 
every baseball player on his TV program from John Kruk to that kid from the 
Long Beach Little League. He has had many professionals on the program, as well 
as a number of New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave is doing his show from Los Angeles this week. We need to provide him with 
reasons not to return to New York. Our sports teams are so much funnier than 
New York's now, you would think he could use the material. Our basketball 
players are so bad, Madonna won't date them. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from my personal home office in Steger, Ill., my hometown, which is Sioux 
City, Iowa, without the glitz, here are my top 50 reasons -- 10 aren't enough 
-- why our good friend David Letterman should never leave L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 1. He could drop Clippers off tall buildings to see how high they bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Our traffic cops are much nicer now, thanks to home video. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Lasorda makes diet lasagna milk shake that is mmm-mmm good. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Bruce McNall will sell Dave 110% of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 5. L.A. never has used, and never will use, an athlete named Mookie. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Chevy Chase Theatre available. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Jerry Buss will let Dave coach Lakers for 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Cigar smoking permitted outdoors in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
 9. McNall will buy him new Rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Plenty of excellent Wisconsin Rose Bowl tickets available. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Jack Nicholson is attacking fewer and fewer cars with golf clubs now. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Vince Coleman is willing to handle crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
 13. George Steinbrenner has not been seen here since punching guy in elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 14. During Long Beach Grand Prix, Dave's speeding hardly noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 15. L.A. only town ever to have teammates named Orel and Sax. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Letterman only man who can afford Laker courtside seats. 
</P>
<P>
 17. Muscle Beach, Paul Shaffer made for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 18. When car broken, Dave can always stick out thumb, catch ride with Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Chance to meet personally with Disney execs about possible cameo in 
"Mighty Ducks III." 
</P>
<P>
 20. Special this month on $200 airport haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Jim Everett available to tip over Dave's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 22. No quarterbacks here named Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
 23. "Monday Night Football" over here before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 24. Dave can pick any position, play there for Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 25. With comedienne and center fielder, L.A. currently leads nation in Brett 
Butlers with two. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Nobody buried beneath Ram, Raider end zones. 
</P>
<P>
 27. Unlike New York City, you never need to cross state line to see your NFL 
teams play. 
</P>
<P>
 28. Not one sportscaster here named Marv. 
</P>
<P>
 29. Really cool state where Clint Eastwood, Sonny Bono can be mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 30. Horses used here for racing, not for mounted cops. 
</P>
<P>
 31. Two words: Dyan Cannon! 
</P>
<P>
 32. If willing to move there, will rename town Marina del Dave. 
</P>
<P>
 33. Big laughs guaranteed at 41 Clipper home dates. 
</P>
<P>
 34. Quake will scare hell out of weird woman living in Dave's house. 
</P>
<P>
 35. Next time we play host to Olympics, Dave's mom won't have to fly all the 
way to Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 36. Mob here whacks beach balls, not people. 
</P>
<P>
 37. "L.T." here is two-thirds of good bacon sandwich, not Giant linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 38. If house ever catches fire, Strawberry comes right over with hose. 
</P>
<P>
 39. If Georgia in marrying mood, Dave could own half of Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 40. Laker Girls not only dance; they sing, too! 
</P>
<P>
 41. Clothes-shopping spree with Al Davis would provide Dave with fabulous new 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 42. Teams out here called Angels. Teams back there called Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 43. One word: Piazzamania! 
</P>
<P>
 44. Chance to get back that $92-million loan Dave made to McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 45. Hey, maybe you don't want to wake up in city that never sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 46. Magic Johnson available to guest-host for Dave, but only for 14 nights. 
</P>
<P>
 47. Concept completely foreign to midtown New Yorkers: Outdoor tennis! 
</P>
<P>
 48. Stern here is rear of sailboat, not politician. 
</P>
<P>
 49. Here in L.A., "The Times" puts sports on front page. 
</P>
<P>
 50. And the final reason David Letterman should do his TV program permanently 
in Los Angeles and not in New York . . .  
</P>
<P>
 (Drum roll.) 
</P>
<P>
 . . . while New York athletes busy with playoffs, our athletes totally free to 
be guests on talk shows!

IS JACKSON TRYING TO BE BULLS' FERRY GODFATHER?; NBA PLAYOFFS: COACH TAKES HIS 
TEAM FOR A TOUR OF NEW YORK BEFORE PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keep thinking, Phil, it's what you're good at. 
</P>
<P>
 Marooned in Manhattan, besieged by the Knicks, with his own players wondering 
if they belong in this series, Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson scheduled a 
Monday practice, but told the bus driver to head for the Staten Island Ferry 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his players then took the tour of the harbor and had little conferences 
about their roles in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters waiting at the deserted practice site speculated on Jackson's 
motives (Getting away from the pressure? Saying farewell to New York, since 
they might not be back?) and Tuesday's possible destinations (Empire State 
Building? Bronx Zoo? Radio City Music Hall?). It turned out to be Madison 
Square Garden, where the Bulls practiced, as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York was a great place for me as a young man growing up," said Jackson, 
the Knicks' house hippie in the '60s. "And it's a wonderful experience for my 
players to participate in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it'd be a good day trip: There was a little bit of the Statue of 
Liberty, a little bit of Wall Street. . . . It was a nice day on top of it. We 
had much more to learn about being together in the fresh air, on the ocean, 
than we did on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seemed to have a good time, even if they rolled their eyes a lot. As 
for the educational aspects, Horace Grant learned the Statue of Liberty was a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, that was Clemson University he attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshed, the Bulls return to the larger problem, the Knicks, who lead the 
series, 1-0, going into tonight's Game 2. The Bulls stunned them in Game 1, 
taking a 15-point lead, but couldn't hold it and are worried about what to do 
for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving Chicago, B.J. Armstrong vowed, "We can't go down 0-2 like we 
did last year, with this group of individuals, and get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen was said to be concerned that they had already played as well 
as they could in the regular season and had no next level to step up to. That 
might have inspired his comment after Game 1: "Whether the Bulls win a game in 
this whole series or not, it's not going to be an easy series for them." 
</P>
<P>
 With two days between games, Coach Pat Riley might have let his Knick players 
ride a ferry Monday if they had played better, but with thoughts of Pippen 
slicing down a wide-open lane, he conducted the usual long, hard practice. 
</P>
<P>
 After Game 1, Jackson complained about the refereeing, hoping to impress the 
Game 2 officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, in turn, complained about Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They blew a 15-point lead with 14 minutes left," Riley said. "It's got 
nothing to do with the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to make some excuses about somebody else helping them at that 
time, he ought to take a good hard look at his team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said someone read him Riley's comments over breakfast, but he enjoyed 
the meal anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Jackson said, "another worm had gone on the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: He thinks Riley is trying to bait him and won't reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Jackson, who can hold up his end in any exchange, this 
argument will be settled on the floor, where Riley has an edge. That ferry had 
to dock sometime, and the Knicks are waiting.

 Defensive end Robert Young agreed to terms on a three-year, $3.5-million 
contract with the Rams and expects to sign in the next few days, said his 
agent, Steve Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a restricted free agent, accepted the offer made Monday by the Rams.He 
earned the NFL-minimum $150,000 for a third-year player last season but will 
receive a substantial raise after emerging as one of the team's top pass 
rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 25, had seven sacks in the first four weeks of the season before 
injuring his knee against New Orleans and later undergoing arthroscopic knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also signed free-agent receiver Greg McMurtry to a one-year contract 
worth $500,000. McMurtry, 6 feet 2 and 210 pounds, caught 22 passes for 241 
yards and a touchdown last season for the New England Patriots. MIKE REILLEY

TARKANIAN TURNS DOWN AZTEC JOB

<P>
 Jerry Tarkanian, former Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, said Tuesday that 
he turned down the San Diego State job last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is down, but I think we could build it up," he said."That wasn't 
the problem. I was excited Saturday . . . but I just didn't feel it was the 
right time for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, who finished 12-16 overall (6-12 in the Western Athletic 
Conference), are in search of a replacement for Tony Fuller, who returned to 
his alma mater, Pepperdine, after two seasons at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possible successors: Tim Grgurich, a former UNLV assistant coach who 
is on the Seattle SuperSonics' staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a return to college 
coaching. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

IF PAC-10 PREVAILS OVER NCAA, HUSKIES WILL RETURN TO TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a recent NCAA ruling to the contrary, the Pacific 10 Conference will 
let the University of Washington football program appear on television this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, who last week announced they had been put on an additional year's 
probation and banned from television through 1994 by the NCAA Committee on 
Infractions, are scheduled to make at least two, possibly three appearances on 
ABC: Sept. 3 at USC, Sept. 10 against Ohio State and Sept. 24 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen, once ABC announces its matchups, 
the conference or university cannot amend the schedule. In this case, Hansen 
said, Washington's penalty will be suspended until next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Washington's nonconference opponents next year are Notre Dame and Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in question is the NCAA's stance on Washington's television future. It 
is conceivable the NCAA could ignore the Pac-10 and insist the Huskies serve 
their penalty as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee on Infractions convenes June 5 in Kansas City, where Washington 
officials will argue for reduced sanctions, including abolishment of the 
television ban. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

TITLES AREN'T ONLY MEASURE OF SUCCESS IN SANTA ANA; PREP WEDNESDAY: DISTRICT 
COACHES USE SPORTS TO FOSTER POSITIVE ATTITUDES AND TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT LIFE 
OFF THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rich Prospero didn't see the problem with the hats. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the Santa Ana Valley boys' basketball coaching job in 1991, he 
purchased $700 worth of baseball caps, which he had planned to give to his 
players and sell at Falcon games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prospero didn't notice the signs in the Santa Ana Valley gymnasium 
stating, "Absolutely No Hats Allowed In The Gym." It's a precaution to prevent 
gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and gang concerns are some of the obstacles encountered by athletic 
programs in Santa Ana. The high schools in the Santa Ana Unified District -- 
Century, Saddleback, Santa Ana and Santa Ana Valley -- also face other barriers 
that can hinder attempts to build a successful program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are socioeconomic barriers for many of the students. Some have part-time 
jobs to help support their families. Some have younger siblings to supervise 
while their parents are working, so there is little time for many to 
participate in extra-curricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these obstacles, there are coaches and players in these athletic 
programs who have been successful. Although Southern Section championships 
might not be plentiful, the programs have taught many to succeed outside the 
athletic arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been football championships for the Santa Ana schools, including 
one each for Saddleback and Santa Ana in 1985. On the basketball court, the 
most recent success came last season when Santa Ana Valley advanced to the 
semifinals of the Division I-AA boys' playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Falcons came up two points short in a 69-67 loss to La Crescenta 
Crescenta Valley, Prospero was proud of the team's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real positive experience," said Prospero, who has coached at Tustin 
High and Chapman University. "This is a different environment we work in at 
Valley. Probably 95% of my players come from dysfunctional families. There was 
a special camaraderie here and it was very rewarding to be a part of something 
so positive, in an environment that's not so positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Century girls' basketball Coach Jeff Watts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of good things," Watts said. "A lot of our kids don't have real 
good home lives. I don't consider myself just a coach, this is a family. This 
is about so much more than wins and losses; I don't even think about that 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "School is the one positive for some of these kids. They feel comfortable 
here. It's sort of a safe haven." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley girls' Coach Beth Lovett didn't build a basketball empire 
like Brea's, but she left one similar to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she came to Santa Ana Valley in 1983, she coached basketball in 
Louisiana for 12 years, where she churned out district champions year after 
year at Hahnville High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a question of if we would win, but by how much," Lovett said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lovett burned out from coaching and left Hahnville in 1975. After a few 
years of working in business, she came to California in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just looking to do something different," Lovett said. "I heard about 
the opening at Valley and was hired in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, she completed her 11th season with the Falcons in the Century 
League, where fielding a basketball team sometimes can be tougher than cutting 
players from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You face different obstacles here," Lovett said. "Some kids can't even play 
because many of the kids need to work to support their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruth Vallejo, a former Century girls' basketball player: "A lot of the 
kids from the area . . . aren't really encouraged to go on to college. Making 
money right out of high school is more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hurdle, according to Lovett, is a pervading attitude among students in 
Santa Ana that a high school education is a bonus. Secondary education is not 
even considered by many. 
</P>
<P>
 With a high percentage of students for whom English is a second language, 
Lovett said the language barrier makes academic eligibility a bigger problem in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started at Santa Ana Valley, I thought I was inadequate to reach 
the kids," Lovett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategy for winning basketball was not the highest priority anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a player doing more than she thought was possible in terms of 
basketball, academics and her family life, and if I'm able to teach the kid 
she's capable of a brighter future, that's the winning part of it," Lovett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mangram, Saddleback's baseball coach the last 13 years, added that winning 
is not just the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids have played their hearts out, but still came out on the short 
end of the scoreboard, it doesn't mean you're not a winner," Mangram said. "We 
want our kids to perform to the best of their abilities. If they can say they 
played their best and they are totally exhausted after coming off the field, 
they are winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback had its most successful season in 1985, winning the Central 
Conference football championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget it," said Mangram, who is also an assistant football coach. 
"There was tremendous spirit at the school. At a school assembly, the district 
superintendent came, the mayor came, it was an exciting time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was the only championship season for Saddleback, it hasn't 
dampened Mangram's enthusiasm for coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids work hard for you here," said Mangram, who lives in San Clemente. "I 
thought about taking a job in San Clemente to cut down on my commute, but I 
love working with the kids and people here. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see these kids be successful is a fun thing, especially when they know 
they can be successful on the field and in life itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovett has seen her former players succeed on and off the court. Many have 
come back to Santa Ana Valley to help her with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I gave them some respect and love for the game," Lovett said. "It 
was great that they wanted to stay involved." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a 20-year coaching career, Lovett has finally called it quits. She 
retired at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said I didn't want to be coaching when I was 50," said Lovett, 49. 
"It's time to bring in some new blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Lovett has time for a winter vacation and travel abroad. But she will 
remember her days at Santa Ana Valley fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was at another program winning all the time just coaching basketball, 
what would I have done? I think I would be bored," Lovett said. "It's not as 
much of a challenge. This is where I belonged." 
</P>
<P>
 Prospero knows Santa Ana Valley is where he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it would take to get me away from Valley," Prospero said. 
"There are great kids here who need guidance. As players, they'd run through 
five brick walls for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Prospero took over the team in 1991 after the Falcons won two games the 
previous season. The turnaround was completed when Santa Ana Valley tied Orange 
for the Century League championship last season and came within one 
three-pointer from a trip to the Division I-AA final at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of the team had a greater impact on the community," Prospero 
said. "If you look at who came to our games it was a lot of alums, staff, 
people in the community who were proud of Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 1,200 jammed Glendale High's gymnasium for the Division I-AA 
semifinal game and half the fans took "rooter buses" or made the 50-mile drive 
on their own to support Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a small group of students who really get into it, and that's great," 
Prospero said. "We have one of the largest enrollments of any high school in 
Orange County, but we'll have a pep rally and only 100 students will show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to a degree that more students don't get into it. But hey, I 
realize lots of these kids have other commitments. It's all part of being at 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a rabid boys' basketball following at Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Centurions' gym, more than 100 students sat courtside in a section 
dubbed "The Zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 The students sat in portable chairs, cheering and waving flags and stuffed 
animals in a roped-off area under the supervision of three Century 
administrators known as "the zookeepers." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Bob Halford, also a graphic arts teacher, was one of them. 
He made T-shirts for The Zoo's students and printed flyers promoting the games, 
Century boys' basketball Coach Greg Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the zoo-court advantage, Century won its first playoff game, 63-61, 
against University in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the finest spirit section in the county," Coombs said. "When 
we moved the students down onto the floor, I think it made them feel more part 
of the game; they felt like they had an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions finished second in league, their highest finish, and were 11-1 
at home, losing only to Pacific Coast League champion Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a neat time for us," Coombs said. "There was a lot of enthusiasm. The 
advisers and teachers were all coming out; it helped solidify the whole campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone at the school made the experience successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Century was one of 11 Orange County high schools to earn a distinguished 
school award from the California State Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the kids to take pride in their school," said Coombs, who was the 
Santa Ana boys' basketball coach for eight years before joining Century when it 
opened. "As a coach, you can't control if you get a 6-foot-11 player or a 5-11 
player, but you can control how hard they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our school, which is so young, you can see it growing and see the pride 
and enthusiasm the kids had. I look at where we're at now, and the future is 
bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's newest high school, Century, opened in 1989, and its first 
freshman class included Ruth Vallejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Vallejo could have been just another anonymous student who would finish high 
school and remain in Santa Ana, but she discovered basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think more students should just try high school athletics, any sport, not 
just basketball," Vallejo said. "I tried out for basketball as a freshman and 
found out I liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the sport went hand in hand with school. As I started to improve in 
basketball, I realized I would have to improve my grades to stay eligible so I 
could keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped hanging around with the wrong crowd, people who would like to 
party, drink, skip school, that kind of thing. There wasn't time for it anymore 
with school, studying, practice and work." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vallejo had other problems to overcome, Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruth was the type of girl who had a chip on her shoulder," he said. "In 
basketball, if anyone looked at her wrong or elbowed her or something, she was 
going to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vallejo: "I used to think I was kind of tough. Coach Watts made me a 
better person; he gave me a reality check." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1992, before Vallejo's senior season, she had her showdown 
with Watts. During a tournament game at Lake Tahoe, Vallejo got into a scuffle 
with an opposing player. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was elbowing me so I slugged her," Vallejo said. "I almost got kicked out 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 And Watts almost kicked Vallejo off the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled me over and yelled at me, 'I'm sick and tired of you being so 
feisty, and right now I'm ready to fly you back home.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember tears rolling down my face. I was really scared. That was when I 
realized I had to change, to do things his way." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts chuckles about the incident today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, I forgot about that," Watts said. "I guess I really did lay into her. 
But I remember telling her that there was no place for violence like that. 
There are other ways to get even, like out-playing or out-hustling your 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Ruth, once she started to have a little success in basketball, she 
started to become a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts said Vallejo, who had a 2.1 grade-point average after her sophomore 
year, graduated from Century with a 3.4 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, Vallejo, a 5-7 forward, was named to the All-Century League team, 
and at the team's banquet in 1993, Watts gave Vallejo the first Ruth Vallejo 
Lady Centurion award -- honoring her for hard work and good attitude on the 
basketball court and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Vallejo played at Saddleback College, averaging 4.1 points and 
3.3 rebounds. Although the Gauchos finished 7-17 and 2-10 in Orange Empire 
Conference, she wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met a lot of nice people at Saddleback," Vallejo said. "It was a tough 
decision whether to help my mom out financially by getting a job, or going to 
college. Only one of my eight brothers and sisters ever went to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no way now I'm going to leave school. It's too important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 When Vallejo graduates from Saddleback, she plans to transfer to a four-year 
university. She would like to become an investigator for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Watts: "She's really looking forward to education and playing basketball, 
and I felt we had something to do with that. I'm more proud of things like that 
than any basketball win." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, 46, lives in Irvine, but graduated from Santa Ana High in 1965 and 
returned to the district where he has taught the last 20 years. He has watched 
the changes in the community and the county and is baffled why many parents 
don't agree with him when he preaches academics over athletics to his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't figure out why all these parents emphasize the athletic scholarship 
when they're the hardest ones to get," Watts said. "There are so many more 
academic scholarships. At Century, I've always tried to convince the kids that 
with education, you can do better than what is there now." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts says there is more stereotype than substance to the low-income, 
high-crime image his hometown carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has some problems, and it has traditionally taken a rap over the 
years," Watts said. "People think Santa Ana High is a hell hole. But I taught 
summer school there, and I realize summertime is somewhat different, but there 
were no problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts said the socioeconomic status of the community affects its schools and 
their academic and athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our district has been very good. They realize the importance of athletics 
here, so while everyone else has cut back, they've kept more funding than other 
districts like out in South County," Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mangram: "If we didn't have an athletic program at Saddleback, there 
probably would be more people on the street, doings things they shouldn't be 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are hardships to overcome in Santa Ana, Prospero says he 
doesn't believe he or any of the other coaches are doing anything superhuman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw our choir teacher working during an assembly and she was working just 
as hard as any coach, getting her kids ready to perform," Prospero said. "We're 
all in this profession for the same reasons . . . it's not some kind of savior 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think its more rewarding than some jobs I've had, but that's my own 
selfish opinion. If you look at guys like Jeff Watts who have stayed in Santa 
Ana for 20-25 years, trying to make it better, there's a reason for that. It's 
a great place to be."

SPREADING THE NOOSE; CONVICT LAKE, SITE OF A SHOOTOUT BETWEEN PRISON ESCAPEES 
AND A POSSE IN 1871, A POPULAR PARADISE FOR SIERRA ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is probably safe to assume that Moses Black and Leander Morton did not 
appreciate the beauty of nearby Convict Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, they were busy dodging bullets and, later, having their necks 
stretched. 
</P>
<P>
 The two outlaws were part of a gang of 29 who overpowered guards and escaped 
from Nevada State Penitentiary on Sept. 17, 1871, and part of a group of six 
chased by a determined posse into the foothills of the Sierra south of here. 
</P>
<P>
 After a dramatic shootout with the posse tracking them to what is now Convict 
Creek, Black, Morton and J. Bedford Roberts escaped south toward Bishop. Three 
others had split from the group shortly before the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 The law caught up with Black, Morton and Roberts on Sept. 27. According to 
George Williams III's "The Murders at Convict Lake," Black and Morton were 
"lynched, tried and hung" by vigilantes who wrestled them from the posse. The 
convicts had killed Billy Poor, a young mail carrier, during their escape. 
Black also had killed posse member Robert Morrison during the shootout. 
Roberts, believed to have played only a minor role in the killings, was turned 
over to the posse and returned to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the history behind the naming of the lake. But what's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 Convict Lake could still bear its former moniker, Diablo Lake, and it wouldn't 
change the fact that it is one heavenly reservoir, surrounded by aspens and 
pines and steep granite peaks, and brimming with clear, cold water teeming with 
trout. It is the home of Horgon, a giant German brown that heretofore has 
eluded a persistent posse armed not with six-shooters and Henry repeating 
rifles, but with rods and reels and every lure and bait known to man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A glacier slicing through the region thousands of years ago carved what is now 
Convict Lake, tucked in the mountains at 7,583 feet at the end of Convict Lake 
Road only two miles from U.S. 395 between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes. The lake, 
or tarn, is one of the deepest in the Eastern Sierra at 140 feet. The water is 
so clear you can follow the rays of the sun to depths of 30 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
 On cloudy days, the surface of the lake acts as a mirror, reflecting not only 
the billowy clouds but the steep mountains that rise sharply to heights of 
10,000 feet or more. The 12,268-foot Mt. Morrison, the highest visible peak, 
towers over the lake on the south shore and Mt. Laurel, at 11,813 feet, reaches 
up dramatically from the northeast.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is God's country," said Canoga Park's Rod Lenox, 38, a Convict Lake 
regular who knows an appropriate cliche when he sees one. "The first time we 
came up, we went to Crowley (Lake, a few miles down U.S. 395) and froze our 
butts off. We found this lake by mistake, looking at the map. Ever since then 
we've been coming up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Morrison was named after Robert Morrison, Black's victim during the 
shootout. Morrison, a 34-year-old Wells Fargo agent and posse member, 
reportedly had Black in his sights during the shootout. His gun failed, 
however, and Black, "a large and heavy man with dark hair and beard," walked up 
and "coolly pointed his gun at the back of Morrison's head and fired . . . 
killing him instantly," according to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The posse, one of its members killed and two wounded, fled the scene. A new 
posse formed in Bishop, caught up with the three close to Round Valley near 
Bishop and for Black and Morton it was soon to be curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all more than 100 years ago, but some wonder if the region isn't 
haunted by ghosts of those who met such violent ends here, especially when the 
wind whistles in fast and cold through the mountains and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind that blows here almost has life of its own," said Adrienne DeSurra, 
who with her husband, David, operates Convict Lake Resort. "It has a sound to 
it . . . like a spirit or something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The haunting wind and lore of the Wild West add to the mystique of Convict 
Lake, but they are not what bring thousands here each year. When the snow 
begins to melt and the ice thaws on the lake, usually in mid-April, the 
campground, with 88 sites at the foot of Mt. Morrison along Convict Creek, 
begins to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the last Saturday of April, which marks the beginning of the fishing 
season, the only things that can be found dangling at the end of a rope at 
Convict Lake are trout on a stringer.  
</P>
<P>
 This year's season-opener on April 30 was so successful that David DeSurra 
barely had time to catch his breath, as anglers young and old hauled stringers 
of fish into the general store to have them weighed and photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no monsters, but plenty of three- and four-pounders, and a few 
pushing five. Even 8-year-old Zach Haines of Ventura, on his first Eastern 
Sierra opener, had no trouble filling a stringer. He did, however, have a 
little trouble dragging his trout and those of his father, Randy, into the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by a reporter, Haines became red-faced and mum, until he was asked 
who had caught the two larger rainbows on the string, the tails of which were 
dragging on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught all the big fish," the youngster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convict Lake is small -- about a mile long and half a mile wide -- but it is 
constantly fed by underground streams and the higher back-country lakes in the 
John Muir Wilderness. Its depth of 140 feet, according to DeSurra, "gives those 
big trout plenty of room to hide out in."  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fish taken from Convict Lake was a 19 1/2-pound German brown in 
1956. The biggest in the last 25 years was a 14 1/2-pound brown on Oct. 17, 
1993, which was also the biggest trout caught in the Eastern Sierra last year. 
Kevin Green of Ontario used a cluster of salmon eggs to entice the fish near 
where the lake flows into Convict Creek. After a lengthy fight, Green netted 
the fish, but it took off, ripping the net from his hands and pulling it 
downstream. Green ran in after the net, grabbed it and subdued the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one big fish that has yet to be caught, according to longtime 
outdoor writer Tom Stienstra, who in his book, "California Fishing," gave this 
description of his first visit to Convict Lake: "My mouth dropped like an egg 
from a long-legged chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 Stienstra, reached this week at his Northern California home, recalled the day 
he saw a brown trout estimated at 15-20 pounds: 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at dusk, when all the people were leaving and all the birds and all the 
deer and wildlife were coming out at once, I saw this brown trout jump not more 
than 20 feet from my canoe. Twenty seconds later I got a strike, and I just 
about levitated out of the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Stienstra was unable to hook the fish, however. About two weeks later, he 
caught three brown trout, "all six- to seven-pounders, but none even half the 
size of the one that jumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Stienstra named the elusive brown Horgon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first name to pop into my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two months after the wagon supporting Black and Morton was driven 
out from under them, leaving them hanging, 18 of the 29 escapees had been 
captured and all but one of the other escapees was eventually caught. Black and 
Morton were the only ones hanged. Roberts, who had been serving time for stage 
robbery, was found not to have received a fair trial and was released in 1873.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, three movies have been made about the prison break and ensuing 
chases, DeSurra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Around here these days, however, the only hanging is being done by fishermen 
slipping trout onto a stringer. It could be only a matter of time for Horgon.

NABA ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE ITS WAYS; BASEBALL: GROUP ALTERS POLICY AFTER 
MARMONTE LEAGUE CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local chapter of the National Adult Baseball Assn. is revising the way it 
secures fields after coaches at Simi Valley, Royal and Newbury Park highs 
admitted last week accepting cash or equipment from the group in exchange for 
field use. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments will go to school districts rather than to coaches or the schools' 
baseball programs in accordance with district policies, said Jeff Richardson, 
director of the Thousand Oaks chapter of the NABA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will comply with the policies of each district we deal with," Richardson 
said Tuesday. "There has been an implication that we are trying to pull 
something over on people. That's not the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Under previous guidelines, the league paid baseball programs directly for 
field use. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is our standard practice and there has never been a problem," said Mike 
Micheli, the NABA national director. Micheli said the NABA, a recreational 
league that plays on Sundays, uses about 500 fields nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The league postponed games scheduled at Newbury Park High last Sunday at the 
request of Newbury Park Athletic Director Teri Scarpino. Once a permit has been 
granted through the district office, the NABA might resume play, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several league members questioned Richardson after the revelations last week 
of payments to coaches and the suspension of Mike Scyphers, the highly 
successful Simi Valley High coach. He was suspended pending a police 
investigation into possible financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who took over as director of the Thousand Oaks chapter two months 
ago, assured the group's members that mistakes made before his arrival will not 
be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken a black eye," he said. "I'm paying for what was done before I got 
here and I am doing my best to get the situation rectified." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said he visited the offices of the Simi Valley Unified, Conejo 
Valley Unified and Las Virgenes Unified districts in the past few days in an 
attempt to meet district requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA uses varsity and junior varsity fields at Simi Valley and Newbury 
Park highs and is planning to use a field at Agoura High. The season began 
April 24 and extends into September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley district will charge the NABA an undetermined amount for the 
use of Newbury Park High. The NABA had planned to pay $320 to the Newbury Park 
baseball program for the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have budgeted $7 an hour for fields, so anything more than that will pose 
a problem for us," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA must pay the Simi Valley district an undetermined fee for use of the 
Simi Valley High fields once the group's permit has been approved, said Roger 
Grady, the district's director of facilities. The $2,000 paid to the Simi 
Valley baseball program and Scyphers for field use is not recognized by the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our standpoint, no fee has been made for field use and they should not 
be out there playing until the permit has been approved," said Grady, who added 
that the league must also increase its insurance coverage to a level acceptable 
to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still a strong interest in the NABA, Micheli said. The Thousand Oaks 
chapter has 15 teams and there also are chapters in the San Fernando Valley and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many adults want an opportunity to play baseball on weekends for us to 
fold up now," he said. "(These problems) are very much a shock to all of 
us."NATIONAL ADULT BASEBAL

FABRICIUS GETS GROUND RULES FROM NEWBURY PARK OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Baseball Coach Gary Fabricius on Tuesday received a mild warning -- and a 
definition of Conejo Valley Unified School District policy -- from Newbury Park 
High administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Teri Scarpino said Fabricius inadvertently violated district 
policy last year by accepting a donation of equipment from the National Adult 
Baseball Assn. in exchange for permission to use the school's baseball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside organizations must receive permission from the school and the school 
district before using school property, Scarpino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fabricius acknowledged that he accepted baseballs, batting helmets, 
bats and a home plate from the NABA without the knowledge of district 
officials. He said he took the equipment rather than a rental fee because he 
"was skeptical" about accepting a check. 
</P>
<P>
 After conferring with Principal Charles Eklund, Scarpino said, she met with 
Fabricius Tuesday morning and gave him a memorandum outlining school district 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that Gary is clear on what exactly the district policy is, I don't 
anticipate any misunderstandings in the future," Scarpino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum was not a written reprimand, she said. "It was a follow-up 
memo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricius, whose team is 18-5 and leads the Marmonte League at 11-1, said he 
assumed the NABA would confer with district officials after receiving his 
clearance. "We at the (school) site can determine whether an outside group can 
use the field," Fabricius said, "but after that, arrangements have to be made 
through the district office. That's where (the NABA) failed. I failed by not 
checking up on it."

3RD PROBE OF EL TORO OFFICER'S DEATH BEGUN; MARINES: COL. JAMES E. SABOW'S 
FAMILY, UNDER NEW LEGISLATION, PUSHES TO PROVE THAT HE WAS SLAIN IN 1991. THE 
RULING WAS SUICIDE.

<P>
 For the third time, the military has opened an investigation into the apparent 
suicide of a top officer here in 1991, and investigators took sworn statements 
this week in Arizona from two people who contend the colonel was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps has long sought to put to rest the death of Col. James E. 
Sabow, 51, an assistant chief of staff at the base who was found shot to death 
in his back yard just days after he was suspended for allegedly taking improper 
flights on base planes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sabow's survivors have vowed to clear his name, hiring forensic and 
medical experts of their own, filing a lawsuit against the military and 
pressing for new investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a slew of previously raised questions, they say they can present 
new evidence showing that blood found in Sabow's lungs suggests he was 
murdered. And they have now prodded the military into reopening the case yet 
again -- even after investigators concluded twice before that Sabow killed 
himself out of despair over the allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning," said the colonel's widow, Sally Sabow, who was 
interviewed Monday at her Arizona home for more than an hour by two Pentagon 
Inspector General's investigators who flew in from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the truth, but our hope is to get it out and make it public -- that 
this was foul play," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Callahan, a longtime friend of Sabow who served with him in the Marines, 
said the Pentagon investigators took a sworn statement from him on Tuesday for 
about 90 minutes at his home in Phoenix, and planned to travel to California 
from there to do more interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inspector General's office opened the military's latest investigation into 
the case in mid-April, said Jack Kennedy, a division director who works in 
criminal investigations. Previous inquiries in the case have been left to other 
branches of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe grows out of legislation enacted by Congress last year in the wake 
of growing criticism from survivors who had been frustrated by the way the 
military had handled investigations into possible suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress ordered the Pentagon to review its procedures for investigating 
possible suicides, and it created a mechanism for families to present evidence 
to the Inspector General on "material deficiencies" in death investigations. 
The Sabow investigation is one of several that the office has undertaken 
following passage of that legislation, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obligated to review and re-investigate this if we consider it 
necessary," Kennedy said. He declined to discuss any details of the Sabow case 
because it is an active investigation, but he said the results would be 
forwarded in a report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere reopening of the case is good news for Sabow's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried for 3 1/2 years now to get a complete and impartial 
investigation, so I was pretty surprised and pleased by this," said Callahan, 
now a pilot for America West. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabow's body was discovered by his wife on the morning of Jan. 22, 1991, lying 
beside a toppled lawn chair and a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun in the 
family's back yard on the El Toro base. He had been shot once in the head and 
was dead by the time paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Military investigators at that time ruled the death a suicide.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps reopened the case in late 1991, under pressure from the 
family, but the result was the same: A report reviewed by the Navy secretary 
and the Marine Corps commandant concluded that there was "absolutely no 
evidence of foul play" and that the threat of publicity over the allegations 
against Sabow may have caused him to feel "paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabow and the chief of staff at El Toro, Col. Joseph E. Underwood, lost their 
jobs after it was alleged that they had flown base planes for golfing jaunts 
and other improper trips. A few weeks after Sabow's death, The Times disclosed 
that the man who fired them -- Gen. Wayne T. Adams -- had himself used planes 
for travel to sign his divorce papers and meet his fiancee, and for other 
questionable trips, and he in turn was dismissed as head of the Marines' 
Western air bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabow's family has denied that the colonel did anything wrong, and they have 
speculated that he may have been killed because of information he had on drug 
trafficking at the base. They have gone so far as to name the person they think 
was responsible for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The military, they claim, has tried to cover up the murder to protect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "There never really was an investigation the first time (into Sabow's death), 
and there never really was an investigation the second time. It was all pure 
PR," said John David Sabow, the colonel's brother, a South Dakota neurologist 
who has led the push for a new review. He estimates that family members have 
spent more than $200,000 in their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months of Sabow's death, family members began pointing up possible 
contradictions in the suicide finding, such as the absence of the colonel's 
fingerprints on the shotgun. More recently, their questions have centered on 
the presence of fresh blood in Sabow's lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Feldman, chairman of the physiological science department at UCLA and a 
specialist in neuroscience, signed onto the case with the Sabows about six 
months ago. He said in an interview Tuesday that he finds it "highly unlikely" 
that the blood could have gotten into the colonel's lungs if the suicide had 
been carried out as ruled by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The official finding assumes that Sabow would have been able to take several 
deep breaths of air even after the shotgun blast, drawing the blood into his 
lungs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is contradicted by the fact that the shotgun blast shattered the 
brain stem, which controls the chest and diaphragm, Feldman said. Instead, he 
said the evidence is "consistent with" an alternate theory advanced by the 
victim's brother -- that Sabow was struck on the head before the gunshot, and 
drew blood into his lungs as a result of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It will now be up to the Inspector General to unravel the competing theories. 
But even as the Sabows have succeeded in reopening some doors in Washington, 
others remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabow's brother sent President Clinton a letter asking for a new look at the 
case, but a March 31 response gave a curt rejection. The White House liaison at 
the Navy said a review of the case "revealed no reasonable justification for 
reopening the investigation."

CONFERENCE HELPS CLERGY HANDLE CHILD ABUSE CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a reflection of the religious community's concern about the frequency of 
child abuse, more than 150 clergy gathered at Children's Hospital of Orange 
County Tuesday to learn how to handle cases of suspected abuse within their 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for a long time, the religious institutions have been a part of the 
problem, because we were convinced that it (abuse) didn't exist in our 
congregations," said Rabbi Bradley Artson of Congregation Eilat in Mission 
Viejo, one of the panelists at the seminar sponsored by the Child Abuse 
Prevention Council of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of the clergy, this will be the first time we seriously think about 
the fact that our silence ends up working on the side of the molester," he 
added. "Hopefully, today, we will get the tools to break that silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist and other clergy joined Artson and other Jewish 
leaders. They were given a crash course on the complex workings of Orange 
County's child-abuse prevention network and provided with dozens of contacts to 
call for further guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they held a conference solely for religious leaders because 
the clergy often hear about suspected abuse from parishioners but are generally 
unsure how to use official channels to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has experienced an alarming increase in the number of reported 
cases of child abuse in recent years. The county's Social Services Agency 
investigated 36,000 complaints in 1993, a 28% increase over the 25,850 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency categorizes abuse as physical and sexual, emotional, general 
neglect and severe neglect. But in many instances, children are victims of more 
than one kind of mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Orange County Grand Jury reported that one-fourth of the callers 
to the county's 24-hour child-abuse hot line last year never got through. Most, 
according to the report, hung up in frustration when they got busy signals or 
were put on hold for as long as 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce the number of lost calls, registry officials enacted a 
variety of measures, including increasing the number of hot-line operators. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, there also have been several widely publicized allegations of 
abuse involving members of the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Diocese of Orange suspended Father Richard T. Coughlin after 
five men alleged that he molested them as youths more than a decade ago. 
Coughlin has denied any wrongdoing in the case. The diocese has also settled at 
least three lawsuits since 1988 filed by people who claim to have been 
molested. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Howard, director of Children's Services, which oversees the hot line, 
said Tuesday he was encouraged by the large turnout for the conference, "Orange 
County's Religious Community Response to Child Abuse: Prevention and 
Intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that there will be some heightened awareness of the seriousness of 
some of the child abuse cases," said Howard, one of the panelists. "Hopefully, 
they (church leaders) will feel more comfortable about reporting abuse. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 During the daylong conference, attendees were given vignettes based upon cases 
of actual abuse and asked how they would handle the situation. In one case, 
Mrs. Jones, a church member, confides in her minister about her troubled 
marriage and her defiant 15-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 1 1/2-hour session, she tells the minister that at least 
things were improving because her husband had promised to stop seeking sexual 
gratification through their oldest daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some church leaders expressed concern that disclosing information given to 
them in confidence might compromise their relationships with parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But panelists stressed that the requirement that a clergy member keep a 
parishioner's confidence applies only to limited situations such as confession. 
Officials are free to report any information about suspected child abuse that 
they glean through other channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important, says the Rev. Bill Peterson, religious leaders must 
make it clear from the pulpit that harsh physical punishment in the name of 
disciplining a child is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think that the Bible justifies it," said Peterson, pastor at the 
Congregational Church of Fullerton. "But we need to remind them that physically 
abusing children is not a tenet of religious faith."

NATURE AND NURTURE; TUCKER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IS A PLACE WHERE ANIMALS AND 
CURIOSITY THRIVE 
</P>

<P>
 The fields are abuzz with hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 They hover over the fuchsia-flowering gooseberry plants and dart near the 
abundant black sage. Occasionally they dive madly toward the bubbling brook. 
And almost always, the world's tiniest bird can be seen lingering near the 
veritable town of hummingbird feeders that gave this place its start. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which provided a constant source of delight for the students who 
happened by on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol York had brought her third-grade class from Francis Scott Key Elementary 
School in Anaheim. "Most of them are city children who don't get much of a 
chance to see anything but cement," she said. "This is a very exciting day for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 They, like thousands of other schoolchildren each year, made the class trip to 
the Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary, a place that -- while little known in Orange 
County -- attracts bird-watchers from around the world because of an ecology 
that has remained largely untouched by civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives people a chance to see what Orange County looked like when the 
Spanish got here," said Ray Munson, the naturalist who manages the 12-acre 
sanctuary in Modjeska Canyon, 12 miles east of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hummingbirds were here in 1926 when Ben Tucker, a wealthy 
banker/philanthropist from Long Beach, retired with his wife, Dorothy May, in a 
canyon house that is incorporated in the sanctuary. Both lovers of animals and 
children, Ben built birdhouses while Dorothy May invented the first hummingbird 
feeder. 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife's death in 1939, Tucker donated the house and its 12 acres to 
the San Fernando Audubon Society, which maintained it as a public nonprofit 
sanctuary for the next 29 years. In 1968 the society gave the property to the 
Cal State Fullerton Foundation, which has been running it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the five varieties of hummingbird that have always populated 
the lush spot, according to Munson, the sanctuary is now also frequented by 
about 150 other species of birds including the red-shouldered hawk, Nuttall's 
woodpecker, California thrasher, Western meadowlark, black-headed grosbeak and 
purple finch. More than 360 plant species inhabit the well-shaded area with a 
stream running through it. Among the other animals seen in the area are foxes, 
raccoons, coyotes, weasels, mountain lions and mule deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just beautiful," said Munson, who's been working here for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 40,000 visitors who come to the sanctuary annually, Munson said, about 
10,000 are schoolchildren on tours; most of the rest are bird watchers from 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 People like Nina Olander who, laden with binoculars, came here from Los 
Angeles recently hoping to spot a Western tanager. "I think it's wonderful," 
she said of the sanctuary. "We're seeing some uncommon birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Or Tom Horan, a retired General Motors executive vacationing from Tucson with 
his wife. "I like the outdoors," he said. "This is a nice part of California; 
usually from the highways all you can see are the brown hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing on a wooden walkway over a tree-shaded gully, some visitors -- most 
of whom offer a voluntary contribution of $1.50 apiece for the privilege -- 
stand transfixed by the creek below while they quietly look for birds. A nearby 
pond is home to bullfrogs and turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the Tuckers' old house, nature lovers can sit on benches facing an array 
of hummingbird feeders. Or, for a bout of serious bird watching, they can enter 
the glassed-in observation porch, from which much of the area's bountiful 
feathered community is usually visible. The porch is perched on a slope, near a 
tree with feeders; the glass wall keeps the birds from being scared away by the 
noises people make. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the heart of the place, Munson said, are the kids who trek over it 
every day. After enjoying an hourlong guided tour of the observation porch, 
brook and chaparral trail, the third-graders from Anaheim are ushered into the 
sanctuary's modest museum to encounter the lizards, turtles and snakes that 
seem to make their day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shantell Pinkerton said she had never before seen a lizard resembling a rock. 
Liliana Montes was especially enamored of the turtles. And Jose Pementel 
observed that the snakes are definitely cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It broadens their horizons," Munson said of the experience. "About the only 
thing we don't have here are black bears." 
</P>
<P>
 Said teacher York: "It's a chance for our children to get into nature. I want 
them to have a sense of wonder."

NEWPORT-MESA PARENTS MUST OK CLAS TESTS FIRST; EDUCATION: SCHOOL BOARD VOTES 
4-2 TO GET PERMISSION BEFORE EIGHTH- AND 10TH-GRADERS CAN TAKE CONTROVERSIAL 
STATE EXAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Newport-Mesa school board voted Tuesday to require parental permission 
before eighth- and 10th-graders can take the embattled California Learning 
Assessment System tests. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision came hours after a Los Angeles judge ruled that test questions 
do not invade students' privacy, a significant victory for supporters of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa school board member Sherry Loofbourrow said before the 4-2 vote 
to require parental consent, "It's a matter of freedom. We should give parents 
the choice of allowing students to take this test. . . . We shouldn't burn this 
test." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa school board, like some other school districts, objected to 
test questions related to reading selections taken from works including Richard 
Wright's "Black Boy," Gary Soto's "Looking for Work" and "Father and I" by Par 
Lagerkvist, because, the members said, they depict violence and child abuse. 
The questions also ask students to make judgments based on their personal 
beliefs regarding values and morality, critics said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the vast majority of parents (of middle school and high school 
students) would object to this test," board president Edward H. Decker said. At 
any rate, he said, "The ultimate results will not have any meaning" because of 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's court ruling, Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien denied a bid 
by the United States Justice Foundation to require parental permission before 
any schools can administer the CLAS tests in reading and writing to students in 
grades four, five, eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought on behalf of two parents of students in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the suit has been widely watched around the state as the first major 
test of CLAS opponents' contentions that the exams violate a state privacy law. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS critics based their suit on Section 60650 of the state Education Code, 
enacted in 1968, which states that "no test, questionnaire, survey or 
examination containing any questions about the pupil's personal beliefs or 
practices in sex, family life, morality and religion" or those of his or her 
family, shall be given without first obtaining written parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old system of tests, which also include math, science and social 
studies, attempt to assess higher-order thinking skills by asking students to 
write about their reactions to literature selections. Last year, for example, 
10th-graders were asked to read an excerpt from black author Richard Wright's 
autobiography and relate it their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who reviewed copies of the confidential tests, said the test 
materials "are obviously designed to elicit analytical, comprehension and 
writing abilities. . . . The questions are not designed to elicit the 
prohibited information. More importantly, they, in fact, do not call for a 
revelation of the pupil's parents' or guardians' beliefs and practices on the 
prohibited subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he said, the state law is vague in its reference to "morality" 
and "family life" and could be challenged on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education, which has been under attack for its 
handling of the tests, said the ruling should offer clear guidance to school 
boards who are grappling with whether to give the tests, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finally seeing some reasoned, careful, independent action here that 
will help sort out the myths," Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson said. "This really should set aside with a great deal of authority those 
concerns about (invasion of privacy)." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said, however, that the department will continue to allow objecting 
parents to get their children excused from the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fourth- and fifth-graders in the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District on Monday began taking the CLAS meant for them. If school districts 
refuse to administer the test as the state mandates, they risk legal action by 
the state, said Newport-Mesa district Supt. Mac Bernd. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the trustees of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 
also decided to postpone the CLAS tests for the higher grades. The Capistrano 
Unified School District has decided to continue giving the tests, but to 
postpone processing them.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CALLING FOR HONOR TO BE SET IN STONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carrying the red flags of the United Farm Workers of America and a banner 
stating, "Viva Cesar Chavez," more than 350 people marched through the Cal 
State Fullerton campus Tuesday, demanding that a 5-month-old building be named 
after the late labor leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Their voices thundered in the halls and walkways with shouts of "Si se puede!" 
(Yes it can be done!) 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour demonstration was highlighted by a speech from a niece of Chavez, 
who remembered her uncle as a "humble hero and courageous warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 "My tio (uncle) wasn't able to go beyond the eighth grade" because his parents 
depended on his wages to survive, said Juanita Chavez, 23, a San Francisco 
State University student. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was self-taught and well-read because he had an unquenchable thirst 
for knowledge. So it is fitting that his legacy be continued at colleges and 
universities by students who have the opportunity that he never had," said 
Chavez, whose university recently named its student center after her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Other colleges and universities throughout the country have named buildings in 
honor of the founder of the United Farm Workers union. Chavez, who died in 
April, 1993, was known for leading consumer boycotts of farm products and 
staging hunger strikes to publicize the working conditions of Central Valley 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, Chavez launched a grape boycott that is still supported to 
press for stronger protections against pesticides and better working conditions

 "The work that Cesar Chavez did for the poor is respected all over the 
nation," said Monica Hernandez, a 25-year-old Cal State Fullerton student and 
an organizer of the demonstration. "We want to honor him because he exemplifies 
public service with a commitment to community, youth and education." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25 campus groups including MEChA, the Sociology Student Assn., the 
African Student Alliance, the Filipino Student Assn. and the Chicano Poet 
Society organized the event in which they urged administrators to name the 
building for Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicano Studies Department submitted the request to the Naming of the 
University Hall committee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar Chavez set a moral direction for all of us to follow and is seen as an 
individual who dedicated his life to helping others, and I think those values 
ought to be a part of our university," said Isaac Cardenas, chairman of the 
Chicano Studies Department. "That's why we should pay tribute to Cesar Chavez." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Emry, the committee's chairman and head of the speech communication 
department, said members are considering four proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not reveal the names under consideration, saying the information is 
confidential. But he said the committee will make a recommendation to the 
university's president before December. 
</P>
<P>
 Emry said most university buildings are named after former presidents or 
people who have donated money to help construct them. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POLICE WILL ENFORCE DOWNTOWN CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The police, reacting to increased complaints about rowdy youths in the 
downtown area, will launch a curfew sweep Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The action will enforce a city law that prohibits minors from loitering in 
public places between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK if a kid has been to a movie and is just walking home (after 10 
p.m.)," said Lt. Charles Poe."But if the kids are underage and just hanging 
around, our officers will take them in custody, hold them and summon their 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said the initial sweep of the downtown area will start at 10 p.m. 
Saturday. He said future sweeps will not be announced and could come either on 
weekdays or weekends. But Poe said most problems with nighttime juvenile 
delinquency in the downtown area have been on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "On many nights of the week, especially Friday and Saturday nights, hundreds 
of juveniles loiter on the sidewalks, blocking pedestrian traffic, causing 
disturbances and disrupting the local businesses," Poe said. "The Police 
Department has received many complaints, from both residents and business 
owners, regarding the behavior of some of these juveniles." 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said that youths who are detained by police during curfew sweeps most 
likely will be taken to the city's downtown substation. "We can't put these 
young people in the jail," he noted. Poe said those apprehended would be 
released to their parents. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY REJECTS REQUEST FOR FLASHING SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be no flashing yellow light on the north end of Harbor Boulevard 
here, city officials have decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had requested that the city erect a warning signal just north of 
Arbolita Drive to slow traffic, but they were told it wasn't needed.City 
officials did say, however, that they plan to upgrade traffic signals at 
various other locations on Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgrading involves installing larger signal lights that city officials say 
should be easier for motorists to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had complained that motorists frequently run red lights and that the 
flashing yellow lights would warn of upcoming signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Traffic Commission considered the residents' request for the flashing 
beacon, along with a report from the city's signal-timing consultant, which 
concluded that there was no need for it. Commissioners agreed with the 
consultant, denied the request and, following an appeal from the residents, 
recommended that the council do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The council did so, rejecting the request last week by a unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor David M. Cheverton and other council members said that if the city's 
signal improvements do not help to slow traffic, they will consider installing 
the flashing beacon. MIMI KO

<P>
 Three men were arrested Tuesday after a woman's van was stolen at gunpoint 
when she stopped to make a phone call, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman had gotten out of the van at Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard 
about 1:50 a.m. when a man wearing a ski mask pointed a gun at her and ordered 
her to lie on the ground, La Habra Police Sgt. Bob Wyse said.He took her car 
keys and drove west in her van on Imperial Highway, followed by two men in a 
gold Oldsmobile, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman called police, and less than 20 minutes later, officers pulled over 
an Oldsmobile in Whittier. The woman identified her van keys and stereo in the 
car, Wyse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, police found the van in a residential area between Imperial 
Highway and Lambert Road in La Habra, Wyse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects, Omar Alexander Hernandez, 24, and Robert Juarez Ruiz, 18, 
both of Buena Park, and Mario Albert Montes, 20, of Beaumont, are being held in 
lieu of $50,000 bail each in La Habra City Jail.ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY HALL WILL BE MOVED TO CUT RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to save money on rent, the City Council has decided to move city hall 
to a new location this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed-session vote Monday, the council announced that city hall will 
be moving to an office building at 25909 Tala St., near Alicia Parkway and 
Jeronimo Road, when the city's current lease expires on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hall at 26522 La Alameda has been the seat of city government since 
Mission Viejo incorporated six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred Sorsabal had been negotiating for a rent reduction from the 
city's current landlord. When those talks broke down, the city looked 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent on the Tala Street building will be $1.25 per square foot instead of the 
$1.70 foot now being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 About 26,000 square feet will be rented -- the entire second floor as well as 
first-floor space that will be used for City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a space more suitable for city facilities," Sorsabal said. "I 
think the northeast portion will also be generally more accessible for our 
citizens than our current location. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the main reason we're moving is the rent," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city will sign a five-year lease with a two-year escape clause. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape clause is needed because city officials are negotiating with 
development companies to build a civic center complex at Marguerite Parkway and 
La Paz Road.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; PARAGON CABLE RATES UPHELD FOR 3 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Subscribers to Paragon Cable will not see a change in their cable television 
bill for at least the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 3-2 Monday to maintain the current rates after a city 
study indicated that the cable company's fees were within the levels allowed by 
the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates will be reviewed in July because of a recent FCC finding that cable 
television rates across the nation are still too high, despite a rollback in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that the FCC has ordered another 7% reduction by this 
month, but Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart said Paragon Cable was 
allowed to delay its new rate schedule until July. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the FCC granted the city the power to regulate cable television 
rates under a 1992 federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Weddle, the cable company's public affairs director, called the council's 
decision "fair and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 A study by a city consultant found that Paragon Cable, which provides services 
to more than 2,000 Los Alamitos residents, loses out on about $800 a month 
because it charges less than what the FCC allows. 
</P>
<P>
 But fees for remote control, cable box and other equipment are slightly 
higher. The overall package is cheaper than FCC standards, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had the choice of ordering Paragon Cable to give refunds for fees 
higher than what the FCC allowed. Weddle argued that it will not be fair unless 
the city also allowed the company to raise the low rates to the level allowed 
by the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council decided that the refunds were too small. For example, 
Paragon Cable is charging 17 cents higher for the converter box, three cents 
more for a remote control and one cent for changing the so-called tiers of 
cable service. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon's basic cable service of 67 channels costs $21.25 a month, 45 cents 
lower that what the FCC allows. To add seven more channels, the cost is $2.81 
more a month, which is six cents below what the FCC allows. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're dealing is pretty insignificant in terms of pay-back to the 
consumers," said Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi. "I don't see this as a bad 
package." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Alice Jempsa and Charles E. Sylvia voted with Selvaggi. Ronald 
Bates and Robert P. Wahlstrom voted against the proposal to keep the current 
rates. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 'CAMP HOMELESS' GROUP RELOCATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of homeless people living in an abandoned fire station on Golden West 
Street were moved to a house in Huntington Beach on Mondayin what city 
officials hope is the first step toward getting them back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 men and one woman will stay in a four-bedroom house for up to 60 days 
while they try to find work or receive job training, said Jamie Sanchez of the 
nonprofit group Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said those who find jobs will move to more permanent housing that 
Westminster-based Shelter for the Homeless provides. Those who cannot find work 
will be allowed to stay longer in the Huntington Beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys are pretty employable, Sanchez said. "They have not been 
homeless that long. They are willing to work and they are excited about having 
a new place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the Westminster Redevelopment Agency approved $10,000 to be spent 
for the program. Shelter for the Homeless added $4,000 and Sanchez's services 
as case manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The formerly homeless people will receive free food, utility services and use 
of a telephone. But they will be required to look for a job eight hours each 
day or do volunteer work. In addition, anyone caught using drugs or alcohol 
will be evicted immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give it a shot," said Frank Murphy, a former resident of "Club 
Homeless," the elaborate encampment among thick bushes alongside the San Diego 
Freeway's Beach Boulevard exits. Caltrans officials shut down the encampment 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After their eviction, about a dozen of the camp residents moved to the 
abandoned fire station in the 14000 block of Golden West Street at the 
invitation of Chuck Ross, a 32-year-old Riverside resident who leases the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other homeless people were living in the 5,200-square-foot structure at 
the time, said Ross, who operates a tree-stump-grinding business at one side of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 City code enforcement officials later declared the building unsafe, but 
instead of sending the homeless group, which now totaled 16, back to the 
streets, city officials decided to provide them with temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Don Anderson said Monday that the former fire station 
will be boarded up and sealed in order not to attract more homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not suitable for habitation," Anderson said. "The leaseholder told us to 
secure the building and we expect him to carry through with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said 16 people were on the list to be moved to the Huntington Beach 
house, but only 12 were at the fire station Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who did not show up was Craig Fritts, who wrote "Bush No. 405," a 
poem of tribute to Club Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he was at another encampment near the San Diego Freeway, saying he 
was not accepted as a house resident because he wanted to take along his 
girlfriend, who had lived with him at the encampment. "Just because I'm 
homeless, I can't live with my girlfriend? I don't understand," Fritts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritts also said his rejection was based on the fact that he has a dislocated 
shoulder, broken arm and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez said that Fritts had been accepted. His girlfriend was not 
accepted because she was not on the list of those eligible to join the program, 
Sanchez said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ROAD EXTENSION PLAN STIRS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The people of University Hills are accustomed to the seclusion of living amid 
the largely undeveloped hills at the southern edge of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In hope of preserving the area, they are mobilizing to fight a plan that could 
send thousands of cars a day through their neighborhood, where UCI employees 
walk to work and residents hike through the acres of shrub-covered hills that 
surround the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents are concerned about the proposed construction of several new 
roads. The roads would not be completed for nearly a decade, but neighborhood 
leaders are intent on fighting the plan in its early stages before any final 
decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 University Hills is on UCI property between Berkeley Avenue and Bonita Canyon 
Drive -- just over the hill from the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Corridor Agency wants to eventually extend Newport Coast 
Drive from the tollway to Bonita Canyon Drive. Irvine officials have expressed 
interest in a plan that would have Newport Coast Drive connect with the 
proposed extension of Gabrielino Drive, a main street through University Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents fear that a Newport Coast-Gabrielino connection would flood 
University Hills with commuters searching for a shortcut between the South 
County and central Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really inappropriate," said Jim Danziger, a University Hills resident 
and UCI professor of political science. "We want to keep our neighborhood 
peaceful and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Danziger and other area residents asked the City Council 
to further study how the Newport Coast extension would affect University Hills 
before making a final decision on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Danziger also wants the city to give further consideration to aligning the 
Newport Coast extension onto Culver Drive and away from University Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Turtle Rock residents have long opposed a Newport Coast-Culver connection, 
fearing it would dump extra traffic into their neighborhood. City officials 
don't like the idea either. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner said that one way to satisfy both University Hills 
and Turtle Rock residents is to scrap plans to extend Gabrielino Drive so that 
the road does not connect with Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan, University Park would not receive direct traffic from Newport 
Coast Drive and Turtle Rock residents would not have to deal with the extra 
traffic spilling onto Culver Drive, Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this seems like the smart thing to do," Werner said. "I think they can 
alleviate much of the problem by simply not building this road." 
</P>
<P>
 Danziger said Werner's idea has merit. He said residents plan to lobby against 
the Gabrielino extension when UC Irvine officials take up the issue at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on the Newport Coast extension is being 
prepared and should come before the council this fall, said Arya Rohani, 
Irvine's manager of transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
 University Hills consists of both large homes and apartments nestled near the 
border of Irvine and Newport Beach. The roughly 650 residences house UCI 
professors, administrators and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
 Several new housing tracts are planned for the area, but the new developments 
would still leave many acres of hilly open space. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI employees receive a subsidy from the university if they buy homes in the 
area, making the community more affordable than Turtle Rock. In exchange for 
the subsidy, residents agree to abide by strict resale rules, Danziger said.

<P>
 The Police Department has bought a van with sophisticated communications 
equipment that can serve as a command post during a hostage situation, a 
natural disaster or a community event. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief James Cook said the van, which was purchased with federal money, 
has television monitors, radios, cellular phones and a fax machine.A video 
camera can be mounted on the roof of the van to receive and send signals to 
officers inside the van or to police headquarters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there should be a hostage situation, we can set up quickly at the site, 
monitor all activity to provide constant surveillance and tactical command," 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 The van, which he described as a mobile police station, can be used for such 
police operations as gang sweeps. BERT ELJERA

 Dubbing it a "season of affirmation," a group of Orange County Vietnamese 
Americans on Tuesday announced plans for Project 20 (1975-1995), an ambitious 
commemoration of next spring's 20th anniversary of Vietnam War refugees' 
arrival in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Project 20 organizers said at a news conference here that through musical 
performances, art exhibitions and literary symposiums planned throughout 1995 
locally and in other cities around the country, they hope to celebrate 
Vietnamese Americans' identity, give thanks to their adopted homeland and 
reinforce their cultural heritage with younger Vietnamese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want everybody to know that we do exist here, to share that we come here 
for freedom, to show our gratitude and that we are looking to the future, which 
is our children," said Tien Q. Nguyen, a Garden Grove dermatologist and member 
of the project's 17-person volunteer organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the war's end, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) fell to the Communists on 
April 30, 1975, unleashing an exodus that made refugees of roughly 1.5 million 
people. Orange County is home to roughly 100,000 Vietnamese, the nation's 
largest enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists, musicians, writers and professionals on the project's organizing 
committee all belong to the Vietnamese American Arts and Letters Assn., a 
nonprofit group founded in 1991 by Dieu D. Le, editor of Little Saigon's Nguoi 
Viet Daily, the country's oldest and largest Vietnamese daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we have contacted other cultural groups in Houston, San Jose and 
Washington, D.C.," Le said at the Huntington Beach Public Library. In addition 
to these locales, he said, "we are going to work for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Project 20 will cost roughly $100,000, said organizers, who will raise much of 
the money through VAALA from private individuals and corporations, both 
Vietnamese and American. 
</P>
<P>
 A major component of the event, subtitled "Vietnamese Americans Twenty Years 
After," will be performances of "1-9-7-5," a symphony written by Le Van Khoa of 
Orange. Inquiries have been made for a presentation at the Cerritos Center for 
the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoa said his composition pays homage to those who died in their efforts to 
escape Vietnam by boat, but "the message is that in their death springs up the 
hope for a better future for all of us, for the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very grateful that the United States extended her arms to receive us," 
Khoa said. Project 20 will also feature the Ngan Khoi Choir, a chorale group 
founded in Westminster's Little Saigon, which performed its 1990 debut concert 
to a sellout crowd at Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese American literary community, which produces roughly 40 
newspapers in Southern California alone, will be involved in book-signings and 
a range of symposiums, including those on mass media, Le said. Exhibitions of 
art, an area in which many Vietnamese Americans have gained recognition on the 
mainstream American cultural scene, will include artists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for concerts, educational workshops and other activities 
geared toward and organized by youths and college students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony Orchestra, represented on the organizing 
committee by its executive director Louis G. Spisto, will in April present the 
premiere of a large-scale symphonic-choral work by New York composer Elliott 
Goldenthal commemorating the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 No cultural community has shown "a greater appetite, a greater interest in 
music" than the county's Vietnamese community, Spisto said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the rest of the country could learn a lesson from what you are doing 
here -- celebrating with the arts," he said. "We are absolutely the 
beneficiaries of your being here. You are going to make the arts healthier and 
better." ZAN DUBIN

COUNTY OKS EXTENDING FUNDS FOR AIDS DRUG PROGRAM; HEALTH: $700,000 IN STATE 
GRANTS WILL BE USED TO GIVE AZT AND OTHER MEDICATION TO LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors accepted more than $700,000 in state grants 
Tuesday to extend a program that provides the controversial drug azidothymidine 
-- AZT -- to low-income residents with AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The new funding will extend the drug distribution program through September 
and pay for 13 new drugs that will be added to the list of medications made 
available to poor residents with HIV or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients all across the county are grateful for the state AIDS drug program," 
said Dr. Jody Meador, the county's HIV medical director. "A lot of insurance 
plans don't have prescription coverage or a deductible or make it very 
difficult for anybody to access expensive medication on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, administered by the state Department of Health Services, has 
allocated more than $2.4 million to AIDS-fighting drugs to Orange County since 
1992. Meador said the available medications treat the complications of HIV 
infections and are used in an attempt to halt or slow the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible patients receive an identification card after showing county 
officials they have no means to pay for required treatments. The special 
identification allows patients to fill their physicians' prescriptions at 
Sav-On pharmacies without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive the drug at no cost, patients must earn $29,444 or less annually. 
Patients who earn $29,445 to $50,000 are placed on a sliding-scale payment 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The state program is "a wonderful service," Meador said. "When you get into 
the later stages of the disease, the medications can run thousands of dollars a 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 State funding for AIDS treatment for the poor began in 1987 with AZT and today 
there are 26 drugs, including AZT, available through the state program. The 
effectiveness of AZT is a subject of debate among researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Taylor, the county's manager of sexually transmitted diseases and 
HIV services, said about 200 new patients were approved to receive the drugs in 
Orange County last year. A total of about 1,500 patients receive the drug 
assistance annually. 
</P>
<P>
 AZT is the most widely prescribed anti-AIDS drug. Several studies have shown 
that taking AZT after infection but before the onset of symptoms delays 
progression of the disease. But a study presented last year at the 
international AIDS conference in Berlin questioned the long-term benefits of 
the drug's use. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, known as Concorde, showed that patients who took AZT early lived no 
longer than those who used the drug after developing the symptoms of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Peter Kerndt, director of Los Angeles County's HIV epidemiology program, 
said the drug's availability through the state program has been "better than 
having nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "The exact efficacy of the drug is a matter of debate," Kerndt said, "but I 
would be taking the drug if I was HIV-positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Munro, executive director of Orange County's AIDS Services 
Foundation, said hundreds of the foundation's 611 clients use AZT and many have 
reported various successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "AZT still has its place in the armament," Munro said. "It still is a 
first-line drug."

ANAHEIM BUDGET PLAN CALLS FOR 22 MORE OFFICERS; FINANCES: 16 POSITIONS FROM 
OTHER DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE CUT AND $3.5 MILLION WOULD BE DRAWN FROM RESERVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Showing that public safety concerns are a priority, the city would hire 22 new 
police officers but cut 16 positions from other departments under a proposed 
budget plan released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the officers was one of the few bright spots in an austere 
$137-million general fund budget proposal that dips into the city's reserves 
and imposes a utility "right-of-way" fee against the city-owned Public Utility 
Department to cover a nearly $9-million deficit. The department is fiscally 
independent of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Candidly, I think this is as tight a budget as you can possibly get," City 
Manager James D. Ruth said during a press briefing on the plan. "This has been 
a very difficult process." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the city, which relies heavily on tourism-related revenues, has been 
severely hurt by the state's recession. Sales, hotel and property taxes have 
all declined or remained flat over the past several years, forcing the city to 
make drastic cuts in the work-force and nonessential services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, the city has slashed its 2,000-employee work force by 
about 200 positions and reduced the general fund budget by about $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the city's budget problem has been attributed to the state's siphoning 
a portion of property tax and cigarette tax revenue that had traditionally gone 
to cities. The proposed Anaheim budget assumes that the state, which began the 
practice two years ago, will not dig deeper into the city's revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 1994-1995 budget is about $578 million, but the discretionary 
general fund is $136,914,962, about 1% more than the current general fund 
budget. That increase, however, is largely due to additional public 
safety-related costs. Police and fire services alone make up about 58% of the 
general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance the proposed budget, Ruth said he reluctantly drew about $3.5 
million from the city's $13-million cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something we like to do," he said. But city officials said they hope 
the economy will continue to move out of the recession and this will be the 
last time they will have to dip into those funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also imposing a right-of-way fee against its own utility 
department to raise about $3.8 million. Of that amount, about $2 million will 
be earmarked for the 22 new officers, which will boost the number of sworn 
officers to 375. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee would not raise electricity rates for at least three years because the 
utility department, which supplies Anaheim with electricity and water, has been 
running a multimillion-dollar surplus. Water rates, however, might increase 
slightly, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County cities charge their electricity supplier, Southern 
California Edison, a similar fee, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said there may be other small fee increases in convention 
center parking rates and for services such as using the city-owned gymnasiums 
and fields. A 5% increase in solid waste collection, which is about 60 cents 
per resident, is also proposed. Park officials said they will be forced to cut 
back on watering the grass in parks, resulting in poor quality turf and also to 
trim palm trees less frequently, causing a possible increase in liability from 
falling fronds. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope to achieve the reduction in 16 positions through 
retirements and attrition, but may have to resort to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed budget, four positions are being cut from the library 
department, three from parks, two from human resources, one from data 
processing and eight from public utilities. Of the positions, six are 
management jobs. The Fire Department recently approved hiring 18 dispatchers, 
but those positions will be funded through service contracts with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said budget was balanced in a way that would minimize reduction of 
so-called "nonessential" city services, such libraries and parks programs. The 
City Council will conduct public hearings on the budget on June 7 and June 14 
before it is adopted.

MEETING WILL EXAMINE YOUTH SERVICES STRATEGY; GANG DIVERSION: GRASS-ROOTS 
PROPOSAL HAS FOUR COMPONENTS: EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS, 
FAMILY SUPPORT AND SAFETY. 
</P>

 More than 1,500 people are expected to gather here this evening to urge the 
city's mayor and school superintendent to approve a plan designed to reduce 
gang violence and provide work opportunities and after-school programs for the 
city's young people. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7:30 p.m. meeting at St. Anne's Catholic Church is a follow-up to a 
meeting that drew more than 1,000 churchgoers and residents -- who are fed up 
with gangs and the lack of anti-drug and anti-gang programs -- in December in 
an unprecedented show of grass-roots involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after five months of meetings, as well as research and analysis of 
programs across the country, members of the Orange County Congregation 
Community Organization have come up with a youth action plan that has the stamp 
of approval from 10,000 Santa Ana families and more than 800 teen-agers who 
filled out surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Action Plan is divided into four areas: employment opportunities, 
after-school programs, family support, and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls in part for a model apprenticeship program to be set up in a Santa 
Ana high school; a 400% expansion of the city's summer job programs; staffing 
schools with more outreach workers and creating a Family Support Center to aid 
parents and teens involved with gangs and drugs; and an increase in community 
policing in three targeted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hoping to achieve from this meeting is that they listen to us and 
respond to our requests," said Cecilia Maciel, a mother of four who lives near 
Center Street and McFadden Avenue and is a volunteer organizer for the group. 
"We're not asking for the moon or the stars. We're asking for something that is 
plausible, something very essential." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Congregation Community Organization boasts a membership of 
50,000 families in Orange County -- 20,000 of them in Santa Ana. Members 
include congregants from five Santa Ana Catholic churches and 10 congregations 
of various denominations elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 After the December meeting brought together 1,000 residents desperate to ease 
Santa Ana's youth crisis, organizers got to work.  
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary meeting with Mayor Daniel H. Young and Santa Ana Unified 
School District Supt. Rudy Castruita, volunteers knocked on doors and worked 
the phones, contacting hundreds of their neighbors for suggestions, said 
Maciel, who works through the Immaculate Heart of Mary parish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people wanted supervision more than anything, after-school 
programs or a homework center," Maciel said.

LAGUNA BEACH OKS $46,000 STUDY OF POSSIBLE ANCIENT LANDSLIDE; GEOLOGY: 
RESIDENTS WORRY THAT A FINDING OF INSTABILITY COULD LOWER VALUES IN 
FIRE-DAMAGED TEMPLE HILLS AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before a room full of worried residents, the Laguna Beach City Council voted 
unanimously Tuesday to spend $46,000 to determine if an ancient landslide lies 
beneath the fire-damaged community of Temple Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote came in the wake of a report from geologists that an ancient 
landslide may lie under about 65 lots. 
</P>
<P>
 A geologist told council members Tuesday that the slide area is "significantly 
deeper" than the one suspected to lie beneath a second fire-damaged community, 
Mystic Hills. The city also is expecting a geological report back this week on 
whether a similar condition exists there. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 Temple Hills residents appeared at the special meeting Tuesday night, 
many of them saying they were more concerned about what the news of a possible 
ancient landslide would do to their property values than about the threat of 
landside itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should one neighborhood be unfairly stigmatized as the site of an ancient 
landslide when you know full well there are suspected landslide areas in every 
nook and cranny of the city," said Donn Tragnitz, who lives in Temple Hills. 
"Who will want to buy a house in a landslide area -- even if it's stabilized?" 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, said they felt strongly that the city was 
responsible for investigating the geology reports.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city is faced with a number of difficult choices," Mayor Ann Christoph 
said. "I don't think we really have any choice but to proceed to find out the 
information we need to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who lost his house in Mystic Hills, said, "I 
would like our city response to this to be as thorough as possible."  
</P>
<P>
 Many Temple Hills residents have demanded that the city get a second opinion 
about the slide, and the council agreed to allocate $8,000 of the $46,000 to 
get that second opinion regarding Temple Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want . . . honest answers to legitimate questions," resident Peter J. 
French said. 
</P>
<P>
 French also said the city should study the hillsides if necessary but be 
cautious about saying the land is in danger of slipping. "Just because some 
dirt slid 10,000 years ago, who's to say it's ever going to slide again?" he 
said. "Maybe it slid into place and is never going to go anyplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents anxiously awaited another City Council meeting concerning 
geologists' evaluation of Mystic Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The special meeting to discuss the study has been scheduled for 3 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm, a Laguna Beach geotechnical consulting firm, proposed the extensive 
study of the earth under 65 lots in the Temple Hills area. The study area 
involves properties on portions of eight streets -- Bayview Place, Canyon View 
Drive, Buena Vista Way, Temple Hills Drive, Wendt Terrace, Griffith Way, 
Glomsted Lane and Wilcox Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said 15 to 16 of the affected lots had homes that were lost or 
damaged in the Oct. 27 fire.  
</P>
<P>
 If Geofirm confirms that stabilization work in required in the Temple Hills 
area, French said, the city should get a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say there's an ancient landslide and it's a lot harder to prove 
it," he said, adding that a geology report on his property three years ago 
showed his 55-year-old home is on bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of an ancient landslide under Buena Vista Way and the 
surrounding area was first noted by geologists more than a year ago, after a 
small slide suddenly buckled that street and caused several houses to slip down 
the hillside. Two houses later were condemned, while a third is still being 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Geofirm, which was hired by the city to evaluate the slide, 
have said that while their own borings at the time did not locate a problem, 
other data, including old aerial photographs and information from other 
geologists, led the firm to suspect the existence of an ancient slide. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, geologists hired to perform investigations for individual 
property owners who lost their homes in the fire have uncovered more evidence 
of an old slide. Geologists from several firms have said their test drilling 
has found fractured rock, thick layers of clay and other indications that a 
slide might exist 65 to 76 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents whose hopes of rebuilding homes destroyed in the fire are on 
hold until the studies are completed have expressed frustration at what they 
view as the slow pace of the investigations, as well as a measure of fear about 
what the results might mean to their rebuilding plans. They also worry about 
who would pay for any required stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always described ourselves as fire survivors," said Polly Sloan, who 
heads the ancient landslides committee for the Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "But in the last two weeks, as things have become more and more on hold and we 
get the feeling that the city isn't telling us anything, for the first time 
many of us have begun to think of ourselves as fire victims."

 A second former altar boy has filed a lawsuit alleging sexual molestation two 
decades ago at the hands of a Catholic priest who admitted he had sexually 
abused an Orange County teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 James Rogan, 29, of Riverside alleged in a civil suit filed last week in 
Orange County Superior Court that Father Eluceterio Ramos made him drink 
liquor, had him pose in the nude and performed sexual acts on him beginning 
when he was about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan claims in his lawsuit that he "repressed" the memories of the alleged 
sexual abuse until last May, when newspapers reported a settlement between a 
former altar boy at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Santa Ana and the 
Diocese of Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff in the earlier case, a 27-year-old man who lived in Tustin, had 
alleged in a 1991 lawsuit that Ramos made him pose in the nude, plied him with 
liquor, showed him X-rated movies and then committed sex acts on him over a 
seven-year period beginning in 1974. Ramos admitted in court papers that he had 
molested the man when he was a teen-ager, and the Orange diocese agreed to an 
undisclosed settlement to end the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lawsuit names as defendants Ramos, the Diocese of Orange, the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles and Auxiliary Bishop Michael P. Driscoll of the 
Orange Diocese. Rogan alleges that Driscoll and other church officials were 
told of Ramos' sexual improprieties yet did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diocese of Orange referred questions about Rogan's lawsuit to diocese 
spokesman Msgr. Lawrence Baird, who was en route to a vacation in Baja 
California. He did not return messages left at the vacation residence.  
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Los Angeles diocese, said: "We do 
not generally comment on matters in litigation. Our attorneys will address the 
matter in court." Rogan is suing the Los Angeles archdiocese as well as the 
Orange branch because the two groups divided their religious jurisdiction in 
1976 -- two years after he alleges the molestations began. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit does not set a monetary amount for damages being sought, but 
Rogan's attorney, Werner Meissner, who also represented the Tustin man, said 
his client is seeking "at least a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement conference between Meissner and the diocese's attorneys is set 
for May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing the cast of characters I doubt that it will be settled then, but 
maybe I'll be surprised," Meissner said. "We'll see if they'll just play games 
and run us through the ringer again." 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations on the case has expired, so his client will not 
press for criminal charges against Ramos, Meissner said. But a law passed 
several years ago stipulates that a civil suit can be filed up to three years 
after a repressed memory surfaces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said he will call a retired priest to testify that he once brought a 
boy before Driscoll to tell him about Ramos' sexual molestations of other boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said most of the molestations took place while Rogan, now married 
with two children, was an altar boy and student at St. Joseph's Catholic Church 
in Placentia, beginning when he was about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the allegations mirrors many of the charges made against Ramos 
and the church in the 1991 lawsuit, filed by Ronald Glenane. 
</P>
<P>
 In an undated letter to Glenane filed in court as part of the lawsuit, Ramos 
admitted to molesting the plaintiff, saying the abuse was a "complication of 
mental, emotional and physical problems and illnesses all complicated by 
alcoholism." Ramos also said he himself was a victim of childhood sexual abuse 
and that Glenane was not the only boy he had molested. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, two months after reports of Glenane's settlement, Rogan told 
clinical psychologist Michele Linden that he believed he had been sexually 
abused as a child, according to a statement by Linden included in his lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos left the diocese temporarily in 1979 to enter a chemical dependency 
program in Massachusetts. A spokesman at the Tijuana Diocese's Seminary said 
Tuesday that Ramos is the vicar of Divine Providence Church in Tijuana. He 
could not be reached for comment.

COUNCIL REAFFIRMS SUPPORT OF HEADLANDS RESORT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With little fanfare, the City Council on Tuesday reaffirmed its recent 
approval of an agreement binding the city to a controversial $500-million 
resort plan at the Headlands peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 As it did on April 26, the council voted 4-1 in favor of the 73-page 
development agreement that allows a 400-room hotel, two commercial centers and 
370 homes on the 121-acre peninsula near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires the council to vote twice to officially adopt a city 
ordinance that enacts the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, who has argued that the agreement 
heavily favors the landowners, again cast the lone dissenting vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the plan could be the focus of a citywide vote. The county 
Registrar of Voters is checking a petition circulated by a grass-roots group 
that calls for a referendum on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, members of the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy are raising funds and 
lobbying for a local bond initiative to buy more of land on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's opponents believe that more of the Headlands property should be 
preserved as parks or open space. Its proponents claim the landowners have a 
right to develop the property and the hotel and commercial space will provide 
long-term revenue to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M. H. Sherman 
Co. and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times.

ARRAIGNMENT IN '3 STRIKES' BURGLARY CASE POSTPONED; COURTS: TUSTIN MAN HAS 
THREE FELONY CONVICTIONS, INCLUDING RAPE. HE IS A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR LIFE 
TERM, SAYS DEPUTY D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arraignment for a burglary suspect and convicted rapist, facing the newly 
enacted "three-strikes" law was postponed 10 days on Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Del Wright said Dennis Alan Ferrier, 38, 
of Tustin is a prime candidate to spend the rest of his life in prison under 
the terms of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think this is probably an appropriate case," Wright said. The law was 
not in effect when Ferrier was convicted for a third time in 1986 on a burglary 
charge and parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier allegedly broke into the home of Roger and Katrina Roelle of Costa 
Mesa on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Katrina Roelle first spotted an intruder reflected off the mirrors of her 
closet doors at about 3 a.m., said her husband on Tuesday. The couple was 
asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "She spotted him standing there, at the foot of the bed," said Roger Roelle, 
an assistant football coach at Corona del Mar High School. "My reaction was to 
jump right over the bed. I saw nothing (because of the darkness), but I knew 
something was there." 
</P>
<P>
 The intruder took off and stumbled down the stairs with Roelle following him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tripping all over his feet to get out (of the apartment)," Roelle 
said. "I'm pulling my pants up and trying to catch this guy at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Roelle said he wondered if the intruder was armed, but continued the chase 
through the apartment. He said he was angry because the man could return and 
harm his wife and their 2 1/2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase continued outside the apartment, where, Roelle said, "we made eye 
contact. I saw his hands and he didn't have a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw he was afraid to death, and that fear I had in the bedroom was gone," 
Roelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roelle cornered the intruder and they fought. The man tried to escape several 
times, only to be subdued, Roelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a minute, Costa Mesa police officers arrived and arrested Ferrier, he 
said. Roelle sustained asphalt burns from the fight. Ferrier suffered cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Tuesday, Roelle said the fact that Ferrier is facing 
the three-strikes law does not impress him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep talking about the good that the law is going to be doing, but this 
isn't a baseball game. It should be one strike and you're done," Roelle said. 
"I know what the word violation means, I have a taste of it now. My wife is 
really upset. We're moving. She can't get the picture of the guy standing in 
front of the mirror out of her mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Court Clerk Christine Whitaker said arraignment of Ferrier on a 
residential burglary charge and the three-strikes allegation was postponed 
until May 20 at the request of Public Defender James Spellman, Ferrier's 
temporary lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier has three felony convictions, the first one for the 1979 rape of a 
woman. In 1984, Ferrier was convicted on charges of burglary and trespassing. 
His third conviction came in 1986, on burglary and parole violation charges.

LAGUNA COUNCIL CLEARS WAY FOR CONTROVERSIAL RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A four-year controversy over construction of a reservoir, which became the 
city's most politically charged issue after the October firestorm, neared 
resolution Tuesday as the City Council cleared the way for the tank's 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 While the plan to build a 3-million gallon reservoir in the Top of the World 
neighborhood still must receive a coastal development permit from the city, 
officials agreed the council's 4-1 vote has removed the major hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approval of those permits will not be unreasonably withheld," Mayor Ann 
Christoph said. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of meetings, the council announced it had reached an agreement 
with the Laguna Beach County Water District allowing it to claim the knoll site 
for a price somewhere between $174,000 and $568,000, the amount to be 
determined by a judge. The agreement also ends the water district's 
condemnation proceedings against the city for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date scheduled for June now will be used simply to determine the value 
of the land.  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement clears the way for the water district to build the tank as it 
had previously proposed: rising 17 feet above ground and then covered with 
earth and landscaping in native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Council members had hesitated to approve the plan because the knoll 
had been purchased with money to buy open spaces, and environmentalists 
consider it a sensitive site.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal had become a focal point in a controversy over whether the city 
was equipped to fight the Oct. 27 wildfire that damaged or destroyed more than 
400 homes. Following the fire, many contended that the reservoir would have 
helped firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 A compromise plan previously suggested by the council had called for a 
reservoir to be built underground. But water district officials had said the 
tank should be built above ground to permit the water to flow by gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach County Water District also still must get permits from the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lida Lenney cast the only no vote.

ORANGE SCHOOL DISTRICT, UNION STEPPING UP TALKS TO END STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to end a 7-day-old strike by non-teaching employees in the Orange 
Unified School District intensified Tuesday as district and union officials 
discussed proposals to save the district money on health insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two sides haven't met formally since hundreds of classified 
employees walked off the job, district and union officials said they have 
talked to each other dozens of times over the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking every day by phone," said Jack Elsner, head of the district's 
personnel department. "But I hope one of these days we can sit down together 
and resolve this." 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives have offered district officials a proposal to switch 
health insurance companies, a move that could reduce the district's annual 
health costs from $4.8 million to $4.5 million. The figure includes health care 
costs for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that before they will sit down and talk with union 
representatives, they must have written confirmation on the exact saving under 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and district have been deadlocked for months over a school 
board-approved contract that cut health benefits, imposed three furlough days 
and gave the district authority to reduce hours and lay off workers without 
negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 The district said the cuts were necessary to save $485,000, which was needed 
to close a $2.2-million shortfall in this year's $107-million budget. MARTIN

INCUMBENT HASTINGS WINS SEAL BEACH OLD TOWN RUNOFF; POLITICS: SHE SAYS 
57.1%-42.9% VICTORY OVER KLISANIN VALIDATES HER SLOW-GROWTH PLATFORM AND 
CRITICISM OF ALCOHOL SALES.

<P>
 Incumbent Marilyn Bruce Hastings defeated teacher and realtor Jim Klisanin 
Tuesday by 209 votes in a runoff election for the city's Old Town District 
council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings' victory means that all three incumbents who sought reelection this 
year will return to the council. She received 839 votes to Klisanin's 631 with 
all votes tallied. The percentage breakdown was 57.1% for Hastings to 43.9% for 
Klisanin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings, 65, attributed the win to her firm stance against overdevelopment 
and her criticism of alcohol sales on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a validation of what the people really want," Hastings said. "They want 
to continue being represented in a conservative, responsible, slow-growth 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings' victory caps a heated four-month campaign that was marked by charges 
and counter-charges. Hastings came within 20 votes of winning March's general 
election outright in a three-way race against Klisanin and community activist 
Charles Antos. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates fought to represent the city's oldest neighborhood, with its 
assortment of old Spanish bungalows, apartments and beachside mansions bisected 
by the Main Street shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 The simmering tension between residents and some Main Street merchants was a 
major issue during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has championed the views of some Old Town residents who claim that 
bars and restaurants attract noisy patrons to the neighborhood at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings opposed bids by several restaurants to increase their operating 
hours, contending that Main Street already has an overconcentration of 
businesses that sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin said that Hastings and other council members have been too 
restrictive in their views on Main Street, hurting the city's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin opposed the council's decision in 1993 to more than double the tax 
that residents pay on their monthly gas, electric and telephone bills. The 
council should look for other ways of balancing the city's books, like seeking 
private donations to pay for some municipal projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said raising the utility-users tax was the only way of closing a 
budget deficit without making massive cuts in city services. FINAL ELECTION

'LET FREEDOM REIGN': MANDELA; SOUTH AFRICA: THE NEW PRESIDENT APPEALS FOR 
PEACE, RECONCILIATION AND HEALING AT HIS INAUGURATION. A MULTIRACIAL SEA OF 
SUPPORTERS WEEP AND HUG AS THE GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY HANDED OVER TO THE BLACK 
MAJORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was sworn in Tuesday as South Africa's first black 
president in a joyous celebration that ended the agony of apartheid and marked 
an official welcome for the world's newest democracy into the community of 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement!" Mandela 
proclaimed in an impassioned inaugural address that appealed for peace, 
reconciliation and healing in this troubled land. "Let freedom reign." 
</P>
<P>
 As a symbol of his commitment to human rights, he said the new government 
would consider granting amnesty to prisoners "as a matter of urgency." He did 
not provide details. 
</P>
<P>
 Princes, presidents, potentates and prime ministers -- 6,036 dignitaries in 
all, from nearly every country in the world -- watched as Mandela strode to the 
podium, carefully put on his gold reading glasses and began to read the 
133-word oath of office with his left hand on a goatskin-covered Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so eager he began before the chief justice, Michael Corbett, had asked 
him. "In the presence of those assembled here and in full realization of the 
high calling I assume as president . . . ," Mandela then began to recite again. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finished, at precisely 12:17 p.m., Mandela raised his right hand and 
added, "So help me God," and the new South Africa was officially born. 
</P>
<P>
 His amplified voice echoed down a long hill and boomed out across a 
multiracial sea of tens of thousands of supporters, while his radiant smile 
beamed from giant television screens. Many wept, hugged or ululated in glee as 
the authority of government was finally handed from the white minority to the 
black majority, and Mandela's triumph became their own. 
</P>
<P>
 He dedicated the sun-dappled day of Western pomp and African tribal ceremony 
to the millions who dreamed, fought or died for liberty here. In a rich, 
resonant voice, he pledged to "lead our country out of the valley of darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 The inauguration, in the open-air amphitheater of the stately Union Buildings, 
the government's seat of power and the emblem of white rule, completed a 
remarkable personal journey for Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 At 75, he has devoted his life -- including 27 years as a martyr in prison -- 
to ending the injustice of apartheid and guiding Africa's richest nation from 
the brink of civil war to a chance for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 His metamorphosis from enemy of the state to father of the nation was best 
symbolized, perhaps, after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The new black commander in chief turned to the wall of bulletproof glass, 
suddenly required to protect him, and peered out to review an honor guard of 
marching troops from the army he once fought as a guerrilla leader. The white 
chiefs of the armed services, their chests hung with medals, stood approvingly 
at his side as cannons fired a salute. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, more than 60 Mirage fighter jets, trainer planes and military 
helicopters roared overhead in a flyby of six diamond-shaped formations. 
</P>
<P>
 The final group spewed brilliant long plumes of red, yellow, black, red, white 
and blue vapor -- the colors of the new South African flag. Four choppers then 
clattered by, with huge flags fluttering on poles hung beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in his address, Mandela paid tribute to the security forces, 
including the police, for their protection of last month's democratic elections 
and their transition from "bloodthirsty forces which still refuse to see the 
light." 
</P>
<P>
 "The time for the healing of the wounds has come," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela denounced the brutalities of legalized racial segregation as "an 
extraordinary human disaster that lasted too, too long." He spoke movingly of 
"the depth of pain we all carried in our hearts as we saw our country tear 
itself apart in a terrible conflict." South Africa was "spurned, outlawed and 
isolated" by the world "precisely because it had become the universal base of 
the pernicious ideology and practice of racism and racial oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 But the first all-race voting produced "political emancipation," he said. "We 
pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of 
poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 In a land where the most emotive annual holiday is the Day of the Covenant, 
when white Afrikaners give thanks for a bloody 19th-Century victory over Zulu 
warriors, Mandela pledged his own "covenant" to build a society in which all 
South Africans are "assured of their inalienable right to human dignity -- a 
rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The dignitaries wore a riot of colorful national costumes, from flowing 
African robes to billowing silk saris. And there was an astonishing array of 
headgear, from flowing turbans and tasseled fezzes, to kaffiyehs and Panama 
hats. Others simply shielded their heads with inaugural programs as the hot sun 
burned off the morning mist and the 11 a.m. ceremony was delayed until the heat 
of noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd interrupted Mandela several times with applause. But the cheers were 
loudest when he spoke most dramatically. "Never," he said, "never and never 
again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression 
of one by another. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He singled out for praise the last white president, Frederik W. de Klerk, who 
freed him from prison in February, 1990. They joined forces to use peaceful 
negotiations to unscramble one of the world's worst racial conflicts. The 
result, after four years, has been universal suffrage elections and multi-party 
democracy in a former police state. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, 58, head of the National Party, and Thabo Mbeki, 52, chairman of the 
African National Congress, will join Mandela's coalition government as deputy 
executive presidents. Both were sworn in before Mandela. De Klerk chose 
Afrikaans, the language of his forebears, while Mbeki used English. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mandela's speech, leaders of the new government went down to the lawns 
below, where a concert and dance performance was under way, to speak to the 
gathered crowds. Mandela's remarks were probably most generous toward the man 
with whom he has repeatedly clashed in public. He said De Klerk had "engraved 
his niche" in the country's history and praised him as "one of the greatest 
reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela's comments were less notable than his security. The three men, 
plus the wives of De Klerk and Mbeki, stood in what appeared to be a giant 
shower stall. Constructed of thick bulletproof glass, the enclosure made the 
group look like a diorama in a natural history museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphitheater held a partial Who's Who of world leaders. Vice President Al 
Gore, his wife, Tipper, and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led a U.S. 
delegation of 65, the largest of any nation. Gore's third-row seat ultimately 
wound up in the fifth row as new chairs were hastily added up front for 
late-arriving, or disgruntled, leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last to arrive was Cuba's Fidel Castro, who wore his olive-green 
military uniform. The gray-bearded president of one of the world's last 
Communist countries got a front-row seat and drew cries of "Viva Castro!" as 
well as the greatest gaggle of photographers. Castro told reporters he had read 
Gore's book on the environment during the long flight from Havana, but there 
were no plans for the two men to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the audience were Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Yasser 
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The two men met 
together with Mandela on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's two former colonial rulers, Britain and the Netherlands, were 
represented by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen 
Elizabeth II, and the Prince of Orange. U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, who was attending the inauguration in happy violation of 
protocol, heaped praise on Mandela in a speech of introduction at the official 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was his turn, Mandela spoke with emotion of an unlikely trio of old 
friends whom he had invited as special VIPs to the inauguration: his former 
jailers. He publicly thanked the three white guards who helped him most in his 
years as the world's best-known political prisoner. "I wanted them to share 
this because they had a part in it," he explained. After the Celebration, a 
Host of Problems 
</P>
<P>
 South African President Nelson Mandela has pressing problems to tackle when 
the euphoria of election victory ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unemployment: 40% 
</P>
<P>
 * Illiteracy: 50% 
</P>
<P>
 * High expectations: The black majority, 75% of the population, expects him to 
keep his promise of providing jobs, 2 million houses, education, health care 
and services such as water and electricity to millions during the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Violence: Clashes continue between Mandela's African National Congress and 
the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 * Politics of compromise: The governing structure of national unity -- in 
which Mandela' ANC party must compromise, not fight, with the opposition -- 
could impede quick action.

ROSTENKOWSKI, CLINTON AT ODDS OVER HEALTH TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Additional tax revenues of as much as $40 billion may be needed by 1998 to 
meet President Clinton's goal of providing health insurance to all Americans, 
House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton opposes such a tax increase, according to White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers. And as recently as Monday afternoon, Clinton strongly 
rejected Rostenkowski's proposal, first advanced in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be "sound policy or fair" to ask the middle class to pay more 
than they already do for the cost of treating the uninsured, Clinton said 
during a round-table discussion with health reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement between Clinton and one of his chief congressional allies 
underscores the daunting task of finding a consensus on how to finance health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski conceded that Clinton's approach ultimately would bring medical 
costs under control but he said that he believes the tab will be high in the 
early years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to include a sound and sensible funding mechanism in any reform bill 
will be a fatal blow to the long-term prospects of reform," Rostenkowski said 
in a speech here Tuesday to the International Foundations of Employee Benefits 
Plans. "People must understand the true costs of health care and the best way 
to do that is to let them see the tab," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton appears to be dead-set against such an unspecified tax increase. 
"Why should we have a broad-based tax in which you pay (with employer-provided 
insurance) even more money for health care -- not for the unemployed-uninsured 
but for the employed-uninsured?" the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply don't think it's fair," Clinton added. "Why should we substitute -- 
for the responsibility of other employers -- by putting an even heavier load on 
those that are already doing their part, whether they're employers or 
employees? I don't agree with that. I don't think that's the right way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The President wants all employers to "share" the burden of providing at least 
80% of a worker's premiums, with the employee paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences on the issue, the President was quick to praise the 
influential chairman of the tax writing panel. "He is a very able person who is 
trying to get his committee to come to grips with what the real choices are. 
And I respect that," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who said that his committee soon will begin marking up a bill 
that will provide both universal coverage and cost containment, faces a 
possible criminal indictment, which would mean that he would have to step down 
as committee chairman. Most analysts believe that his departure would be a 
serious blow to the chances of comprehensive health reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Rostenkowski made no mention of the possible legal difficulty. 
Instead, echoing Clinton's sentiments on Monday, he expressed confidence that 
Congress will enact a "major health care reform bill this year." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that members of Congress can return to their districts this 
fall empty-handed," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report, disputed 
by the Administration, that the President's plan would drive up the federal 
deficit by $74 billion by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Tuesday, three female Cabinet members released a study showing that 
12 million working-age women -- 8 million of them with jobs -- have no health 
insurance. It predicted that the Administration's health reform proposal would 
ensure coverage for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that the Administration would stand firm in insisting that 
abortion be covered as part of the reproductive services guaranteed in the 
package of basic medical benefits. The issue is expected to provoke a huge 
battle on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under our legislation, all plans will have to provide the full range of 
reproductive services -- and that includes abortion," said Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala, who, along with Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, 
briefed reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to build upon existing insurance plans," Shalala said, noting that 
many such private plans cover abortion. If it were not covered under the 
Administration's plan, "we would be taking something substantial away from 
women who now have it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala and the others said many of the problems women now face -- such as 
losing coverage when they change jobs or become divorced or widowed -- would be 
eliminated under Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "All women will be guaranteed coverage regardless of their health status, 
regardless of their marital status, job status or their ability to pay," 
Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted by the Institute for Women's Policy Research and funded 
by the Henry F. Kaiser Family Foundation, found that women were more likely to 
work part time, have shorter job tenure and lower earnings than men. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "women have more marginal places in the labor market than men and 
so have less health insurance from their own employers than men do," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in large firms, in higher paying positions and industries and in 
full-time stable work, "women have less direct insurance from employers than do 
men."

ATTENDEES FROM U.S. BASK IN A CLIMATE OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a day, at least, this nation -- long an international pariah -- became the 
magnet of the political universe Tuesday, drawing scores of Americans, from the 
famous to the merely hopeful, into its celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some -- ranging from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell 
to Quincy Jones, the record producer, Maya Angelou, the poet, and David Stern, 
the commissioner of the National Basketball Assn. -- traveled here as part of 
the official delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had to be more creative. About 40 members of Congress, left out of the 
delegation for space reasons, simply commandeered an Air Force plane Sunday. 
They arrived here on the eve of the festivities, sending U.S. Embassy personnel 
and White House planners into a frenzy of last-minute arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The day could have been a humbling experience for the visiting Americans: 
Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat drew far more crowd approval -- and better seats 
-- at the morning's inaugural festivities for President Nelson Mandela than any 
American, no matter how deeply committed to the anti-apartheid struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, all pronounced themselves happily awe-struck by the occasion. "It 
was an incredible day in every respect," Mrs. Clinton said, calling herself 
"overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Americans, with their own experiences of the struggle against racism, 
South Africa provides a "beacon of hope," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the visitors, the day became, in part, an irresistible chance for 
political stargazing. 
</P>
<P>
 At an early morning reception hosted by Mandela at the South African 
presidency, several White House aides and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy had 
their pictures taken with Castro, despite the official U.S. policy of isolating 
the Cuban regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't you even play tourist?" one official grumbled when asked if the photos 
might not be considered a political problem back home. "I mean, I turned 
around, and there he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Others found themselves almost unexpectedly overwhelmed by emotions generated 
by the sight and sounds of Mandela taking the oath of office, receiving salutes 
from the leaders of the South African military and preaching a message of 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elizabeth Furse (D-Ore.) was born in Kenya in 1936 and moved to South 
Africa at the age of 2. There, her mother became an early activist in the Black 
Sash, an anti-apartheid women's organization. Furse left South Africa to attend 
college in England and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been back in 35 years," she said shortly before the plane carrying 
her and other members of Congress landed. "I've brought back my old South 
African passport," she added. "I want to ask Mr. Mandela to sign it for me. It 
will be a way of closing the circle on something I used to feel ashamed of 
carrying." 
</P>
<P>
 The feelings were, if anything, even stronger among the many prominent black 
Americans here. "We've had a weeping contest all day -- uncontrollable tears of 
joy," Jackson said at the end of the day at a reception hosted by U.S. 
Ambassador Princeton Lyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Jackson linked arms with Mrs. Clinton, Gore, Tipper Gore and 
leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the crowd of several hundred 
dignitaries, embassy officials and other Americans, many of them awash in 
tears, in singing the civil rights anthem, "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day it feels great to be black," said Maggie Williams, Mrs. Clinton's 
chief of staff and the highest-ranking black official in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallels between the U.S. civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid 
movement here were a frequent topic for the visiting Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Monday night, Gore spoke at length of the intertwined history of 
the two movements, from the earliest days at the beginning of the century, to 
the joint appeals issued by African National Congress leaders and the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., down to the efforts by black leaders in the 1980s to 
rally international support for economic sanctions against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle for justice" in the two nations "has been one struggle," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-flown words and noble sentiments, of course, did not completely 
prevent the sort of jousting and jockeying one would expect from scores of 
prominent Americans all trying to secure tickets to the world's hottest event. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, each of the more than 100 nations with representatives here for the 
inauguration was limited to seven official seats, plus a small number reserved 
for other "foreign eminent persons," and for weeks, White House officials have 
been deluged with pleas from members of Congress and others desperate to get on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Black members of Congress were particularly keen to attend, and, in the end, 
many decided simply not to take "no" for an answer. After President Clinton 
appointed about a dozen members of the black caucus to serve on the delegation, 
others simply decided to go on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival sent U.S. Embassy officials here scrambling, trying to find 
everything from hotel rooms to inaugural tickets for the unexpected visitors. 
In the end, all were accommodated, and even the touchiest congressional egos 
apparently survived unbruised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went fine," said White House public liaison chief Alexis Herman, her face 
reflecting both relief and exhaustion. "It went fine."

MILLIONS MAY BE MISSING FROM FIRST PENSION CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities investigating the bankruptcy of an Orange County pension 
management firm are looking into whether as much as $100 million in client 
funds may have been lost or misappropriated, according to law enforcement 
sources and others close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is Irvine-based First Pension Corp., which filed for liquidation 
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 22. That happened as 
scores of the firm's estimated 8,000 clients -- individuals and small-business 
operators from across Southern California -- discovered that large sums were 
missing from their accounts or that interest or dividend checks they were 
expecting from the firm were overdue, according to clients, employees and 
lawyers close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some checks mailed by clients to First Pension may have been cashed illicitly 
by people connected with the firm and the money misappropriated, investigators 
said. Money belonging to investors may also have been spirited overseas, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know where a substantial amount of cash is presently located," said 
Andrew C. Snyder, a court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Co., a Colorado 
firm affiliated with First Pension that functioned as custodian of money sent 
by clients to the Irvine firm. Summit Trust was seized by Colorado regulators 
and its accounts were frozen a day before First Pension's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension was one of several companies jointly owned by William E. Cooper, 
a politically well-connected Orange County real estate investor, and two 
associates, Valerie Jensen and Robert Lindley. 
</P>
<P>
 None could be reached for comment, but their lawyers said each was intent on 
cooperating with the authorities investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Since First Pension's bankruptcy filing, the FBI and the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission have opened investigations of the firm and the three 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension served its clients by handling the administration of retirement 
accounts, including Individual Retirement Accounts and Keogh accounts through 
which they could make their own investment choices instead of leaving the 
management to banks or mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, many of First Pension's clients ended up placing their money in 
real estate investment pools offered by its sister companies. Cooper, Jensen, 
and Lindley were also principals of Summit Trust, which handled the cash that 
First Pension clients were funneling into their retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that First Pension was the conduit for the money coming in from 
investors as well as going out to them -- that is, money they were investing in 
their retirement as well as income from some of the same investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said questions exist over the fate of as much as $35 million held by 
Summit Trust on behalf of First Pension clients. A significant portion of that 
sum remains unaccounted for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other authorities are investigating whether as much as $25 million of the 
money may have gone astray as early as December, when First Pension transferred 
its custodial accounts -- money being held for clients pending their investment 
decisions -- to the newly established Summit Trust from a number of Orange 
County banks. Investigators are looking into whether the accounting of the 
transfer might have masked fund diversions for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also exist over the real value of more than $62 million in 
investments made by First Pension clients in real estate mortgage pools offered 
by the sister firms, according to officials investigating the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of these were put into second or third trust deeds (mortgages)," 
said an attorney close to the case. "With the beating in the real estate market 
going back to the 1980s, underlying mortgages and financial instruments started 
to weaken. Loans went into default, so the value of the partnerships declined." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI and SEC are investigating whether the money may have been diverted 
from the accounts to maintain dividend payments to investors in the real estate 
pools. Such diversions might have been aimed at covering up extensive defaults 
among the mortgages making up the pools, one lawyer close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cooper, Jensen, and Lindley were all unavailable for comment on the 
allegations, Milan Smith, an attorney for First Pension, acknowledged that 
cash-flow problems developed among the trust deed pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was done to deal with the cash-flow problem is enough of a concern that 
all three principals (of First Pension) have retained criminal counsel," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attorney close to the case, who wished to remain unidentified, 
confirmed that "the root of the problem was the declining real estate market 
and the deteriorating portfolio of loans. There was a shortfall of funds. Once 
there's a shortfall, errors of judgment can be made that compound the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the three principals maintain that the amount of money missing is 
considerably less than $100 million -- and even less than the $10 million that 
Snyder initially contended was missing. He also said they vehemently deny that 
any money was sent overseas, as Snyder also contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for all three principals said they are intent on cooperating with 
authorities to maximize the recovery of funds to the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and the court-appointed receivers for Summit Trust and First 
Pension also emphasized that a conclusive loss figure must await thorough 
audits of the complex network of firms and investment partnerships involved. 
The actual loss may prove to be substantially less than the $100 million at 
risk, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rather complicated situation," said Smith, who added that "all the 
firm's records are intact and in the hands of the SEC or the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder and others noted that many of First Pension's clients funneled their 
money into garden-variety certificates of deposit, mutual funds or securities 
investments. That money, the receivers say, appears to be intact, although the 
accounts will remain frozen until completion of an audit. The total amount of 
investor funds is roughly $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension's bankruptcy capped a bizarre sequence of events that began 
April 5 with the abrupt resignation of Jensen as president and her replacement 
by Cooper, who previously had rarely appeared at the firm's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that point, there had been few, if any, evident problems with First 
Pension's accounting. But about that time -- a period when tax deadlines mean 
that the flow of money into retirement accounts is at its peak for the year -- 
several clients complained that money they sent to First Pension had not been 
credited to their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery often came only when they asked to have specific cash sums 
transferred from a custodial account at the firm to a final investment and were 
informed that insufficient funds existed to make the transfer. In some cases, 
according to clients, employees and investigators, checks mailed by clients and 
made out to Summit Trust were cashed and deposited in bank accounts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 One such client was Bruce Nelson, a Mission Viejo insurance agent who on March 
30 mailed a check for $20,000 to Summit Trust to fund his Keogh account, which 
already held more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, he wrote First Pension to direct that the combined sum be 
transferred to his brokerage account at Fidelity Investments. About a week 
later, he said, a First Pension representative called back to tell him the firm 
had never received the $20,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called my bank to see what happened and they sent a copy of the check 
showing it had been cashed," Nelson said. The check had an endorsement 
indicating that it had been deposited not at Summit Trust, but in an account at 
Home Bank in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank officers confirm that the Irvine branch held an account in the name 
of Summit Trust, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said that he was subsequently assured by First Pension that his money 
would be transferred to Fidelity. The firm sent Fidelity a check for $25,011 on 
April 25, but it bounced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's queries about his check eventually made their way to officers of 
Summit Trust, along with similar complaints from other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That raised our concern," said Snyder, the Summit receiver. He said First 
Interstate Bank, which held Summit's deposits, also notified Summit that checks 
drawn on the trust company's account were being issued suspiciously out of 
sequence. Snyder said there were also indications that a signature stamp used 
to endorse Summit transactions "was being used without our authorization." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the questions together "led us to take certain actions that led to the 
downfall of First Pension," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those actions included Summit's alerting Colorado banking authorities that 
money under its custodianship might have been misappropriated. The state 
responded by seizing Summit and freezing its assets on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 One day later First Pension filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer James S. Granelli in Orange County contributed to this 
story. Where to Write for Pension Information 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of First Pension Corp. wanting information about cash balances in 
their accounts held at Summit Trust Services of Colorado should write to: 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew C. Snyder, receiver 
</P>
<P>
 c/o Summit Trust 
</P>
<P>
 P.O. Box 6504 
</P>
<P>
 Englewood, CO 80155-6504 
</P>
<P>
 They should include a copy of their adoption agreement with First Pension, or 
any other agreement they executed, as well as copies of the front and backs of 
any checks showing sums they deposited in their First Pension accounts, 
statements they received from the firm, and a cover letter giving any other 
potentially relevant information.

SOLAR ECLIPSE CLOUDED BY DISAPPOINTMENT; ASTRONOMY: SOME CATCH QUICK GLIMPSES 
AS THE GLOOM CLEARS. BUT MOSTLY THE EVENT IS ONE BIG CELESTIAL LETDOWN.

 Elizabeth Calder of Pasadena saw it straight overhead. David Corrick of Los 
Feliz found it by looking north. Lisa Ventura of Tujunga discovered it by 
looking west. James Strogen glimpsed it in Hollywood while gazing east. Howie 
Ngoy faced south to see it in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 People were looking out for themselves Tuesday as the last solar eclipse of 
the century was totally eclipsed over most of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the moon blotting out the sun, clouds did it. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant Ngoy ended up watching the eclipse inside -- on a television set in 
the south corner of his doughnut shop that he kept on during the two hours and 
45 minutes that it took the moon to pass in front of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks fine in here," said Ngoy, 29, of San Gabriel, gesturing toward the 
TV screen. "But what happened out there?" 
</P>
<P>
 It meant that amateur astronomers such as Strogen who traveled to the Griffith 
Observatory above Hollywood to view the spectacle had to act quickly to catch a 
few fleeting glances of the sun peeking weakly through the fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time there was nothing to see in the eastern sky. So Strogen, 46, 
a Van Nuys auto mechanic, trained his 10-inch homemade telescope toward objects 
on the ground to prove that the instrument was working. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant that thousands of schoolchildren such as 7-year-old Elizabeth of 
Jefferson Elementary School in Pasadena had to use their imaginations to see 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it! I saw it!" the first-grader exclaimed to classmates Oscar Miranda 
and Daniel Cazares as she pointed straight up. "It looked like a giant clip!" 
</P>
<P>
 It meant that movie prop maker Corrick, 29, had to rely on his sense of humor 
as he gazed north at the Eclipse Design and Fabrication Co. logo painted on the 
wall of the Echo Park firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've probably got the best eclipse view in town," he joked. "I got up early 
to see it. Of course, getting up early is a condition of my employment." 
</P>
<P>
 And it meant that the lucky few who found themselves in sunshine before the 
spectacle ended at 10:29 a.m. had to act fast to actually see the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, 31, of Tujunga, was recycling soft drink cans outside a Lucky 
supermarket when her chance came. The sun was too bright to look directly at 
it. So she quickly poked a pinhole in a piece of cardboard so it projected an 
image of the eclipse on a piece of paper held to the west, away from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "My next-door neighbors went to El Paso to see this," she said. "You know, I 
could feel the eclipse starting because it got dark and gloomy and cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say El Paso should have been one of the stellar viewing spots 
Tuesday. It is within a 150-mile band stretching from Baja California to New 
England where the moon blotted out all but the sun's fiery rim. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, about four-fifths of the sun was covered at the height of the 
eclipse at 9 a.m. If you could see it. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of astronomy students at the Cal State Northridge observatory in 
Sylmar got a good look, even though some of their equipment remained damaged 
from January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 600 schoolchildren and 200 adults at the Griffith Observatory had to 
be quick to see anything when drifting clouds made the annular eclipse suddenly 
appear -- and then just as suddenly fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It popped through the clouds a few times," said Bob Kline, 39, a graphic 
artist from Huntington Beach who had attached a camcorder to a telephoto lens 
hoping to record the eclipse. "But I certainly didn't run out of videotape -- I 
guess that's the bright side." 
</P>
<P>
 Czernic Crute, a telephone technician from South-Central Los Angeles, brought 
along two telescopes. But there was no use for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never got bright enough to use our equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith Observatory astronomer Patrick So stood holding a pair of king-size 
binoculars attached to a cone-like device designed to project the eclipse on a 
small screen. There was little call for that, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was crystal-clear in Lancaster, where he lives, So said. In fact, 
clouds did not appear until he drove into Los Angeles shortly after dawn. He 
was tempted to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 "But duty called and I came here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eclipses can be a hit-or-miss thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hill from the observatory, things were not looking up for solar 
sunglasses salesman Roger Harrison. His $4 smoky lenses were supposed to 
protect the eyes of people looking into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only sold 20 or 30," said Harrison, 42, of Glendora, looking as gloomy 
as the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby reminded him that the next solar eclipse visible in the United 
States would not occur until 2012. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Jeff Schnauffer in Sylmar contributed to this story.

BATTERY TECHNOLOGY FUELS THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEBATE; BUSINESS: MANUFACTURERS 
SAY THEY NEED MANDATE TO ATTRACT INVESTORS. AIR RESOURCES BOARD DECIDES THIS 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep in the heart of Texas, where oil is king, a little company is developing 
an advanced battery for electric vehicles that it hopes will leave gas guzzlers 
on the roadside like so many dead armadillos. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a decade of research and development, Electrosource Inc. is 
nearing completion of a pilot plant -- the first of its kind -- that the 
company hopes will prove its advanced lead-acid batteries can affordably be 
mass-produced within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 California is counting on Electrosource and other battery developers to 
succeed. Their progress will be center stage in Los Angeles on Thursday and 
Friday, when the California Air Resources Board decides whether to uphold its 
mandate requiring major auto makers to produce zero-emission vehicles -- 
electrics now being the only option -- for sale beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is a watershed in determining whether Californians -- and 
residents of the heavily populated Northeast states that are following 
Sacramento's lead -- will have a new vehicle choice in less than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest issue facing the auto industry today," said Richard 
Klimisch, vice president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn., the 
Big Three's lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers and the oil industry oppose the mandate, which requires 2% of 
vehicles -- about 25,000 cars -- offered for sale in California to be 
zero-emission in 1998, rising to 5% in 2001 and 10% in 2003. Electric 
utilities, environmentalists and others want to stay the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The political stakes are high. The auto makers have taken their case to Gov. 
Pete Wilson, and lobbying on all sides has intensified in the days leading up 
to the hearings. Seven of 11 board members have been appointed since the last 
review two years ago, including ARB Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer, lending an 
element of uncertainty to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the high-powered politics, the debate largely revolves around one 
issue: battery technology. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few clear answers. Strides have been made in just a few years of 
aggressive research. But whether batteries with adequate power, energy and 
durability can be mass-produced for 1998 is hotly debated. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry says it cannot be done. If the mandate stands, car makers 
say, they will be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build 
vehicles that consumers won't want. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ARB's staff contends that a variety of good batteries -- not only 
advanced versions of the lead-acid ones used in cars today, but also 
nickel-metal hydride, nickel-sodium-chloride and sodium-sulfur units -- should 
be at the auto makers' disposal by 1998. Vehicles with these batteries can go 
far enough for most daily uses and cost the same to operate as gasoline-powered 
cars, the staff contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, electric vehicle proponents argue that the zero-emission 
rules must be maintained to keep forcing the technological development of 
electric vehicles and to attract venture capital to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potential investors are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what 
happens," said Richard Schweinberg, manager of transportation research for 
Southern California Edison Co. "If the mandate is delayed, the money will dry 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Electrosource, one of scores of firms racing to bring better batteries to 
market, is a front-runner in the commercialization of advanced lead-acid 
batteries. But its history is as full of ups and downs as the nearby Texas hill 
country. Just three years ago, the company ran out of cash and temporarily 
stopped operations. It has never made money and is in constant search of 
investors and partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Electrosource officials remain effervescent about the company's 
prospects. "If the market develops, I guarantee we will be a major player," 
said President Benny Jay, a former defense industry executive turned 
entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Such optimism is not unusual among small companies seeking a niche in the 
fledgling electric vehicle market, where claims of technological breakthroughs 
are thrown around like confetti at a Texas high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrosource and its backers acknowledge that its technology still must be 
proved through rigorous testing. The company also must show that the battery 
can be affordably manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are close," said Jack Guy, manager of commercialization for the Electric 
Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility group that provides funding to 
Electrosource. "It's a slow process, but it is doable." 
</P>
<P>
 That process began in the early 1980s at Tracor Inc., an Austin-based defense 
contractor, where researchers working with composite materials developed a new 
process to bond lead onto fiberglass thread. Seeking to commercialize the 
discovery, Tracor in 1987 formed a public company, Electrosource, which soon 
said it had found a way to enhance the life, energy and power of lead-acid 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology drew attention after California adopted its zero-emission 
mandate in 1990. Electrosource teamed up with General Motors, which was 
searching for better batteries for its Impact, an electric two-seater. But GM, 
with its financial problems mounting, backed out of the project in 1991, and 
Electrosource -- with losses mounting -- closed its doors that September. It 
was not until early 1992 that the company resumed operations, with new money 
from an investment group headed by Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium -- a partnership of U.S. 
auto makers, electric utilities and the federal government -- was formed to 
speed up development of better batteries. The consortium decided not to put any 
of its $262-million research kitty into advanced lead-acid batteries, figuring 
little could be gained from further development of a century-old technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a federal research consortium declined to invest in lead-acid 
batteries, EPRI concluded that Electrosource's product could help jump-start 
the electric vehicle market. In mid-1992, it gave Electrosource $5 million, an 
infusion that allowed the company to begin building 12-volt batteries and 
testing their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electrosource is the best bet we have for 1998," said Guy, who oversees the 
institute's project with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Electrosource battery differs from traditional lead-acid units in several 
ways. Instead of heavy lead plates, it uses a lightweight lead thread woven 
into mesh grids. These are arranged in a horizontal pattern rather than the 
normal vertical design, which the company says makes the battery stronger and 
lengthens its life. Because the battery is not flooded with sulfuric acid, it 
is also lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrosource says the recyclable, maintenance-free battery can be recharged 
50% in nine minutes and fully charged in 30 minutes. It can withstand 900 
charge cycles, enough to last for 80,000 miles, according to the firm. For an 
Impact-type car, it can provide up to 140 miles per charge, the firm says; for 
a minivan, about 80 miles. Battery packs are expected to cost $2,000 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents -- citing studies that show average round-trip commutes are less 
than 35 miles -- argue that there is a market for electric vehicles with such 
batteries. But auto company officials say their studies show that even 
customers predisposed to electric vehicles would not buy them without a range 
of 125 miles -- 50 for regular daily needs, 50 for emergencies and 25 as a 
cushion to run the heater or air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telling customers, 'I don't care what you want, you only need 50 miles of 
range,' sounds to me like a recipe for disaster," said John Wallace, acting 
head of Ford's electric vehicle program. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Electrosource is putting its batteries through rigorous laboratory tests. 
And in a joint venture with BDM Technologies, a McLean, Va., builder of 
manufacturing systems, it is gearing up battery production at a pilot plant in 
San Marcos, 30 miles south of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant's makeshift production line -- a series of work cells with employees 
carrying parts from one machining area to the next -- now ekes out about five 
batteries a day. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the system will be fully automated. Jay said the company hopes 
to be producing 500 batteries a month by the end of this year and more than 
4,000 a month by the second half of 1995. A fully operational manufacturing 
plant, which will cost about $30 million, could be in operation by 1996 -- if 
funding is forthcoming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company has missed deadlines before. Chrysler and Ford have been 
clamoring for Electrosource batteries for months. The pilot plant is at least a 
month behind schedule, a delay Electrosource blames on suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lags concern auto makers, which soon must make crucial decision on 
batteries if they are to meet the 1998 mandate. The industry says it will be 
difficult to put sizable electric vehicle fleets on California roads before 
2000, given the need to test batteries, set up pilot plants and build 
full-scale manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 So Detroit wants the mandate delayed. But battery developers say that would be 
their death knell. Given the difficulty of raising money for risky ventures, 
further advances will be nearly impossible unless California sticks to its 
guns, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Orr, manager of Electrosource's pilot plant, said: "Nobody is going to 
build a battery plant unless there is a mandate."

U.S. WILL SEND TROOPS TO HAITI, DIPLOMATS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States plans to send at least 600 heavily armed and protected 
troops to purge this nation's military, even if a broader, tougher program of 
international sanctions forces the army regime to give up power, diplomats and 
Haitian sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question is the timing and ultimate size of the force, sources say. 
"When (the American troops) come is under discussion in Washington right now," 
a U.S. official said here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the choices are to send the troops in before or after the local 
military leaders leave. The Americans "prefer that they (the Haitian military 
leaders) leave first," said one source, "but if they don't, the troops will go 
in anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. planners are arguing that the toughening of sanctions should be 
given a chance to work, while others are said to believe that the new efforts 
can't work or will take too long. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. Security Council resolution has given three Haitian military leaders -- 
army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, his chief deputy, Gen. Philippe Biambi, 
and national police commander Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois -- until May 21 
to resign and leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do not, an international economic embargo will take effect, banning 
all trade and commercial dealings with the tiny nation; the sanctions will 
exempt food products, cooking oil and medical and humanitarian aid. Nations 
also are asked to freeze the assets of the Haitian military officers and select 
civilian allies and to withdraw or reject visas for their international travel. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has said that if Cedras and the others resist, the United 
States will consider using military force. But he has maintained that he has 
not made a decision and wants to let the sanctions strategy play out. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials in Washington, as well as diplomats and experts here, say 
the President is only employing semantics in a political ploy to ease U.S. 
congressional objections to a major American military invasion here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a question of whether there will be an American military 
intervention here," said a diplomat from another country, "but its size and 
when it gets here. I think by the time it is all done, we will see several 
thousand U.S. troops here, even if Cedras leaves tomorrow and (ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand) Aristide arrives the day after." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Clinton will want to do is say (his course of action) is a reconstituted 
'Harlan County' and that it doesn't represent any change from what was agreed 
to at Governors Island," this diplomat said. "I can tell you this will be a far 
different situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to an agreement signed last July in New York City that 
provided for the return of Aristide and Cedras' resignation. Among its 
provisions was a call for a multinational, U.N. military and police advisory 
group to train a new police force, restructure the army and build roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the bulk of that force -- about 270 unarmed U.S. and Canadian troops 
-- arrived on board the American military cargo ship the Harlan County, a mob 
of 100 or so men, organized by the Haitian army, rioted to prevent the vessel's 
docking. 
</P>
<P>
 When American officials decided not to risk a confrontation and ordered the 
Harlan County back to the United States, the whole agreement collapsed; that 
led the Haitian military to believe the Clinton Administration was not serious 
about its effort to restore Aristide, who was ousted by Cedras in September, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time," said a diplomat, "there will be at least 600 American troops. 
They will be heavily armed and there will be a large number of combat troops to 
protect the advisers and engineers." 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference, although one Clinton doesn't favor, will be the force's 
composition: Although it will be called a U.N. military advisory group, in 
reality it will be almost entirely an American operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians, who support tougher sanctions but oppose a real military 
intervention, will provide only about 50 police trainers, officials say, and 
not troops as before; the trainers won't come here unless Cedras has resigned 
and left. The French and Venezuelans, who also were involved in the earlier 
trainer effort, have indicated they will not participate in the military 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials interviewed by telephone in Washington said that 
they hoped this would change, but that it would not deter the American plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton will argue that he doesn't need any further U.N. or even (U.S.) 
congressional approval because he will maintain this is just implementing an 
earlier agreement," one official said. "He also will maintain that the troops 
will only be armed for self-protection and will not constitute either an 
invasion or an occupation force -- that they are there only to train and build 
an infrastructure, just as called for in Governors Island." 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat observed that "the Americans feel the end of June is a deadline, 
even those who argue that the (sanctions) should be given a chance before the 
military advisers are sent in." The diplomat argued that if the United States 
has not ousted the Haitian regime shortly thereafter, it "will be faced with a 
serious international public relations crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that Clinton "does not want to attend a hemispheric summit in 
Miami in December with either the military still in power or U.S. troops 
occupying Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials added that the Americans "think it will take six months to 
re-establish Aristide, prepare for (parliamentary) elections in December and at 
least pretend they have reformed the military and created a new, civilian-run 
police force." That means, said one diplomat, that "if the embargo fails, and 
nearly all of us think that will be the case," American troops will be here by 
July 1.

COLUMN ONE; JAILED BUT NOT PROVEN GUILTY; NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION RUSSIANS 
LANGUISH IN MISERABLE PRETRIAL PRISONS. OFFICIALS ADMIT THE NIGHTMARISH 
CONDITIONS ARE THE BROADEST HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN POST-SOVIET ERA.

 In the jail known as Sailor's Rest, every detainee looks exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Every dim cell is a dormitory crammed with bunk beds, each bed shared by up to 
four men. They sleep fitfully, in shifts, while others must stand. Cigarette 
smoke and clotheslines full of graying underwear add to the dank, unbearable 
closeness. The toilet, behind the curtain in the corner and nothing but a hole 
in the floor, fuels the stench. Only the cockroaches thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see everything as through a fog. Most of the time I am not sure whether I 
am asleep or awake," says Vladimir A. Kopylov, on trial after 4 1/2 years in 
Sailor's Rest for alleged default on a Soviet bank loan. "We breathe like fish 
out of water. For lack of oxygen it's sometimes hard to light a match. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reserves of endurance are gone," the frail, 47-year-old businessman adds 
in a courtroom interview. "I cannot imagine I will ever leave this hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopylov is one of nearly a quarter million people in Russia who are imprisoned 
but not proven guilty, and their ranks are swelling as overworked police and 
judges wage a crude, uphill battle against crime. Officials acknowledge that 
the long wait for trial and the nightmarish conditions behind bars are the most 
widespread human rights abuses of Russia's post-Soviet era. 
</P>
<P>
 Visits to two pretrial prisons, in Moscow and Tula, offered a look at the 
overcrowding and its effects -- spreading disease, shortages of food and 
medicine, the suffocating stink. Officials in both prisons said they feel 
powerless to improve things and fear a summer of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews elsewhere, former inmates and prisoner rights advocates 
described frequent, if not systematic, beatings by guards. They said many 
inmates are disciplined by being stripped to their underwear in cold isolation 
cells, where there is even less food and no bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical punishment is also reported in Russia's labor camps, which hold about 
650,000 sentenced convicts. Labor is still compulsory, but camp conditions have 
improved since Soviet times; they are less crowded and more humane than 
pretrial prisons -- so much so that some detainees confess to crimes they 
didn't commit just to move from hell to purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's treatment of prisoners is not exceptional on a global scale. It 
cannot be compared to the terrors of Stalin or the abuses in many countries run 
by dictators or brutalized by war. Some jurisdictions in the United States and 
Western Europe also impose harsher conditions on arrested suspects than on 
convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, and the 
lot of its prisoners is a volatile, if hidden, indicator of progress from 
Soviet dictatorship to the rule of law. By its own measure, President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's government is faltering. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be quite frank, the conditions of our pretrial detention centers, by 
international standards, may be classified as torture," Maj. Gen. Yuri I. 
Kalinin, the Interior Ministry official who oversees most of Russia's prisons, 
admitted in an interview. "It is deprivation of sleep, air, space. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact," he added, "there isn't a single detention center in the country 
with the elementary conditions required by our law." 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisons are a cursed thing," Czar Peter the Great said of Russia's 
18th-Century forerunners of the Soviet gulag. Today's reformers have let in 
Russian Orthodox priests to set up chapels and sprinkle holy water. Yeltsin's 
1993 constitution proclaims that a person is innocent until proven guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But post-Soviet legal reform has barely touched the country's 164 pretrial 
prisons. The simplest of cases can drag up to 18 months before trial and a year 
or more in court. The prosecutor or judge during that time may deny visitation 
rights to a suspect's lawyer or family. 
</P>
<P>
 Few suspects go free before trial. The collapse of the omnipresent Soviet 
state has made judges reluctant to release prisoners to the custody of an 
employer or social organization. A bail system exists, but capitalist ownership 
rights are not entrenched, so the use of private property for bail is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, pretrial prison populations are growing. By law, a cell must have 
at least three square yards of space for each inmate; by that measure, the 
limit for all 164 prisons is 165,000 inmates. As of March 1, they held 240,657. 
Sailor's Rest, with a limit of 3,050, holds about 6,200 inmates, 2,000 more 
than it did a year ago. The place has 510 officers and guards, and 140 other 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a hotel," said Nikolai S. Barinov, the director of Sailor's Rest, 
named for the street it once shared with a naval barracks. "We cannot hang out 
a no-vacancies sign." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a restaurant either. The standard meal is soup with a thick layer of 
grease. The average food budget for each of Russia's prisoners is 40 cents a 
day, Kalinin said, but Russia's financial crunch cut it to about 30 cents a day 
last year. Prisoners at Sailor's Rest have gone four months without sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the crowding problem is that many pretrial prisons were abolished in 
the late 1950s, after Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev declared that a 
crimeless, classless society was at hand. About two-thirds of the prisons 
remaining in Russia were built before 1900. Last year, a wall collapsed at one 
in Siberia. Kalinin says 20 are so decrepit they must be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was built as a prison in 1751 under Czarina Elizabeth," Col. Yevgeny G. 
Mityayev informs visitors to his dungeon in Tula, 125 miles south of Moscow. 
"It hasn't changed much since." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, the cells are dark and overcrowded, but the strongest impression is 
the putrid odor -- a blend of low-grade tobacco, urine, sweat and the grime of 
ages. Prisoners get a shower once a week and fresh air one hour a day, in 
rooftop "exercise" cages just big enough to pace around in. There is one light 
touch: Mityayev allows pet cats. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia grapples with organized crime, the colonel struggles to guard, feed 
and care for 2,100 criminal suspects, mostly the disorganized kind. Nikolai N. 
Nizhelsky, 32, landed here after the drunken January evening when he 
encountered a stranger and helped him lock a pig in a shed. The pig, it turns 
out, had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't steal anything. I'm not pleading guilty," Nizhelsky protested. But 
justice is slow, and he's suffering heartburn and a skin rash he never had 
before, for which "all they give me is herbs." Asked why Nizhelsky cannot go 
free on bail, the colonel said with a shrug, "All he owns is a pair of 
trousers." 
</P>
<P>
 If he were to plead guilty, Nizhelsky could move to Tula's labor colony, a 
short walk and a world away. 
</P>
<P>
 There he might serve up to five years, but at least he would get more sunlight 
through bigger windows and his own bed. He would walk from classroom to 
lunchroom to factory, assembling electric heaters for a modest wage. He could 
even try out for the prison rock band. If he behaved, he could go home for 
periodic 12-day vacations, as 33 prisoners have done this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see that terrible closed door all the time," said Sergei V. 
Spiridonov, 26, who spent eight months in the Tula dungeon before being 
sentenced for hooliganism to 3 1/2 years in the labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
 All prison officials deny beating inmates. But Alexander A. Dmitrichenko, 16, 
interviewed in a juvenile labor camp, said he and his cellmates were often 
clubbed at random by drunken guards in the Tula dungeon until his 1993 
conviction for stealing food. 
</P>
<P>
 Vil S. Mirzayanov, the dissident chemist who spent 27 days this year in 
Sailor's Rest, said he watched similar, pointless beatings. Kopylov, the 
businessman held in the same prison, told of being clubbed for refusing to 
share a cell with dysentery patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Such brutality is rarely prosecuted. But human rights organizations say it is 
not as prevalent or intimidating as the density, decay and disease in every 
pretrial prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer brings scabies, a skin rash spread by parasitic mites. Tuberculosis, 
incurable in damp cells, infects and kills prisoners at many times the rate in 
Russia as a whole, says Natalia Vezhnina, a prison doctor in Siberia's Keremovo 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I pray for bad weather, because when it's too hot, epidemics and 
deaths are unavoidable," Col. Gennady N. Oreshkin, then director of Moscow's 
Butyrskaya pretrial prison, told the Moscow City Council last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's raining, water runs down the walls and conducts electric current 
because the wiring is totally rotten," he said. "The sewage system gets blocked 
up every day. . . . An ambulance has to be called two or three times a day for 
heart patients." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Parliament voted an amnesty that by autumn will free about 
26,000 teen-age, elderly, female, ailing and white-collar criminal suspects. 
But by then, prison officials estimate, 60,000 new suspects will be behind bars 
-- the flotsam of Russia's rising crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
 The overload is a sudden challenge for a criminal justice system in flux, torn 
between its libertarian constitution and its Soviet instinct to diminish the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues familiar in the West are just emerging here: Prison directors fault 
judges and judges fault police for piling on too many cases. Everyone blames 
Parliament for not voting enough money to fight crime. Police want more jails. 
Reformers want swifter trials and easier conditions for pretrial release. 
</P>
<P>
 Under enormous political pressure to catch criminals, police often forgo real 
investigation, beat prisoners into signing Soviet-style confessions, throw them 
in jail and hope the charges stick, according to judges and other officials. 
Nikolai K. Baranovsky, chief justice of a Moscow district, said 10% of his 
defendants claim that their confessions were physically coerced. 
</P>
<P>
 Baranovsky has a staff of 12 judges, 47 other employees who work 10 hours a 
day, two broken computers, some ancient typewriters and a leaky courthouse 
roof. They cannot keep up with a growing caseload of 150 jailed suspects. One 
case involving nine accused thieves has been in court since 1991, delayed by 
periodic measles and scabies quarantines in their cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the trials to be over fast, and so do we, but we cannot do anything 
unless the laws are changed" to streamline trial procedures, the judge said. 
"But the lawmakers don't seem to worry about this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its December election, Parliament has shown concern in two ways but so 
far has changed nothing. It voted in April to launch a six-month study of 
pretrial prison conditions, which nobody doubts are horrendous. And it voted 
down a bill to improve those conditions, on the grounds that the bill didn't do 
enough to guarantee prisoners' rights. The bill is back in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most promising improvement so far is the gradual opening of the 
system to outside scrutiny. Kalinin, the national prison chief, cooperates with 
human rights advocates. Letters from inmates denouncing abuses are read on 
radio and printed in newspapers, even if they are not acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 But many who ran the Soviet gulag are still on the job -- "jailers accustomed 
to total freedom from control by the outside," says Sergei V. Sirotkin, deputy 
chairman of Yeltsin's Human Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Karagodov, an ex-convict who wrote a prison memoir titled "The Right 
Only to Die," believes that the men who have cracked five of his ribs since his 
release are Interior Ministry thugs who feel threatened by the book's reformist 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took seven decades to build this system, and it will take even longer to 
destroy it, because we will do it not by terror and shooting but by democratic 
means," says the 35-year-old author, who spent nearly half of his life behind 
bars for vagrancy, robbery and trying to kill a prison guard. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the immediate problem is keeping all those crowded prisons from 
exploding. Thousands of inmates in Yekaterinburg and Orenburg have staged 
hunger strikes in recent months to protest harsh conditions, and Deputy 
Interior Minister Pyotr G. Mishchenkov warns that "a tiny spark could turn a 
trivial conflict into an outbreak of rioting." 
</P>
<P>
 At Moscow's Butyrskaya prison, Col. Oreshkin once resorted to a desperate 
method to ease the pressure -- one that worked but eventually ended his law 
enforcement career. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other prisons, Butyrskaya buys food on the open market with its cash 
allocations from the Interior Ministry. With tension rising last summer, the 
prison ran out of cash, and the suppliers halted food deliveries. While 
urgently lobbying his superiors for more money, the colonel called in five 
mafia bosses, all former prisoners, and appealed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you were inside, the state was interested in keeping you alive so you 
could work," he recalls telling them. "Now you see that the state simply 
doesn't give a damn about those whom it no longer needs. So please, have mercy. 
They are your people as well as mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning a truck pulled up to the prison gate and unloaded 15,000 cans 
of corned beef and 500 cans of condensed milk, along with wholesale quantities 
of cheese, soap and cigarettes -- enough to supply the 6,000 detainees for five 
days, free of charge.

DAMAGED I-5 TO REOPEN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bringing another dose of relief to quake-weary Southern California commuters, 
officials said Tuesday that the reconstruction of two Interstate 5 bridges will 
be completed a month early, enabling the heavily traveled freeway to open to 
traffic next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's office confirmed that southbound lanes of the Golden State 
Freeway will open first -- probably on the morning of May 18 -- followed a day 
later by the opening of the northbound lanes, which cannot carry traffic until 
a detour is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor feels that the I-5 Gavin Canyon project is a shining example of 
what happens when you combine top-notch engineers with an outstanding 
contractor and cut away the red tape," said Sean Walsh, a Wilson spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, under an incentive system, will receive a bonus of $4.5 
million for completing the work early. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the freeway removes a bottleneck that has slowed traffic on the 
major north-south artery into Los Angeles since the Northridge earthquake 
knocked down two 80-foot-high bridges at Gavin Canyon. The bridge destruction 
forced state transportation officials to construct a detour from Gavin Canyon, 
located about 23 miles north of Downtown, to the I-5 interchange at the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramps linking the two freeways at that interchange also were toppled in the 
Jan. 17 quake. Their reconstruction is not scheduled to be completed until late 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake inflicted heavy damage on highways throughout the Los Angeles 
area, crippling segments of Interstate 5, the Santa Monica Freeway and the Simi 
Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Freeway last month became the first of the damaged freeways 
to reopen to traffic after contractors were able to complete reconstruction of 
two overpasses at Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard 69 days ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the first phase of the work on the Simi Valley Freeway overpasses 
at San Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek is expected to be completed. 
Traffic now being routed over the westbound lanes will be shifted to a newly 
constructed bridge on the eastbound lanes. The westbound lanes will then be 
closed so contractors can rebuild that section of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, who have provided almost all the financing for the 
rebuilding of quake-damaged freeways, said the speed with which construction 
has been completed demonstrates that government can mobilize in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through innovative contracting, intergovernmental cooperation and the sweat 
and muscle of hundreds of construction workers, we're setting records bringing 
quake-damaged highways back on line," said U.S. Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Interstate 5 as the "commercial backbone of the state's economy," 
he said the bottleneck at Gavin Canyon has hampered the movement of 
agricultural and manufactured products from California's heartland to Los 
Angeles area ports and markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the reopening is expected to be made jointly today by 
state and federal officials, who had earlier bickered over who would command 
the spotlight when the Santa Monica Freeway reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The early completion of the I-5 reconstruction is expected to renew criticism 
of the financial incentives given contractors to complete work ahead of 
schedule. Each contractor has been offered a bonus for every day construction 
is completed early; they also face a penalty for every day their projects are 
completed late. 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Myers Inc., the construction company that rebuilt the Santa Monica 
bridges, earned a nearly $14-million bonus for finishing in less than three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 E.L. Yeager Construction Co. of Riverside, the contractor for the Gavin Canyon 
bridges, will earn a $4.5-million bonus on top of $14.8 million for completing 
the project. The bonus payment -- $150,000 for every day the project is 
completed early -- is based on the company's finishing the reconstruction 30 
days before a June 17 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Aaland, Yeager's chief engineer, said his company was able to complete 
the project more quickly than usual by working crews around the clock, seven 
days a week. "It was just a lot of working together between all parties," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the California Department of Transportation said the new bridges 
have been built to much higher strength than the ones that collapsed in the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans press secretary Jim Drago said they have been designed to withstand a 
7.1-magnitude quake on the San Gabriel Fault, which at four miles away is the 
fault nearest the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gavin Canyon bridges are designed not to collapse in an 
earthquake, Drago acknowledged that they have not been classified as 
"important" structures. That designation, reserved for bridges that must carry 
emergency traffic, would have required that they be engineered so they would 
not sustain damage requiring closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said state engineers made several modifications to the design of the 
bridges while they were being constructed to add features that would enhance 
their ability to withstand earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans was criticized for rebuilding the Santa Monica Freeway bridges with 
potential weaknesses at the abutments -- the concrete structures connecting 
bridges to land -- which required them to be retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said the same weaknesses in the design of the Gavin Canyon bridges were 
corrected while the bridges were under construction. Because of that and other 
additional work, he said, the contractor may ultimately get a higher bonus. He 
said nearly $1 million in additional bonus payments is still being negotiated.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; GARAMENDI URGES HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi on Tuesday proposed a 
top-to-bottom overhaul of California's health care system as the keystone to a 
state economic revitalization program. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion to a single program covering all Californians for all their 
health care needs would save $5.5 billion a year in insurance costs, said 
Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, during an address to the 
Commonwealth Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who is facing Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) for the Democratic nomination in the June 7 primary, said the 
savings could be used in a variety of ways -- both public and private -- to 
rebuild the foundation of the California economy and to stimulate the creation 
of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic program could include the development of a $200-billion 
transportation system over the next 20 years, construction of other public 
works such as highways and earthquake safety projects, and the creation of an 
educational technology industry, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds could be used to help finance a high-speed bullet train between Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, he added, and to replace the aging rail system that 
transfers goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to interstate rail 
lines near Downtown via the new Alameda Corridor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is reform of a system under which many Californians now pay for as 
many as eight health insurance policies and in which many others have no 
regular health insurance. He said health care absorbs 15% of the gross domestic 
product, up from 6% two decades ago, with billions of dollars "squandered" on 
administrative and legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must provide universal access to health care for every Californian," said 
Garamendi, who was wearing a flexible cast and walking with the aid of crutches 
because of a broken right leg he suffered at his ranch Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far too many California families live in the fear of losing everything if 
they lose their health care," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's address is one of four major speeches Garamendi said he will deliver 
this week, including education reform, revival of "the California spirit," and 
rebuilding trust between people and their government. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Brown also used the Commonwealth Club, an organization of corporate 
executives and professional people, as the forum for her own economic program. 
Delivered Jan. 26, it relied heavily on a series of proposed tax credits and 
other incentives for new business and creation of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last month, Brown has capsulized the program into a "mission" of 
creating 1 million jobs during a first term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Garamendi's health reform is President Clinton's health care 
proposal. But Garamendi's California plan would go much further. 
</P>
<P>
 The average working Californian now receives health insurance under a plan 
such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield at work, workers' compensation, auto insurance, 
homeowners liability insurance, business liability, Medi-Cal and Medicare, and 
others, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He would remove the health components from all those plans and put them into a 
single program that would cover all Californians 24 hours a day for any illness 
or injury. Care would be provided by alliances such as the one that now works 
under the state Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing would come primarily from payroll withholding and employer 
contributions, he said, along with government funds now spent for health care 
for the poor and elderly. In most cases, payroll deductions would be no more 
than they they are now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are likely to vote this fall on an initiative measure to create a 
"single-payer" health plan financed by the state. Garamendi has indicated that 
he opposes that initiative.

MODIFIED PLUMBER'S PLUNGER MAY AID CPR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A modified toilet plunger developed at the University of California may work 
significantly better than conventional CPR to resuscitate heart attack victims, 
according to results of a trial reported today in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The device was developed by UC physicians who treated a man whose son had used 
a toilet plunger to resuscitate him. It is essentially a suction cup that 
expands the lungs when it is pulled away from the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients treated with the device were more likely to survive than those who 
were treated with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the 130-patient 
trial. But the results were not statistically significant because the study -- 
and four others like it -- was terminated by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration because informed consent was not obtained from participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents are calling for a larger study of the device, called the Ambu 
CardioPump, which is approved for use throughout much of the world, including 
Canada, England and most of Europe. The new technique is called active 
compression-decompression CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 In conventional CPR, intermittent pressure is applied to the chest to 
stimulate the heart and air is forced into the lungs through the mouth. In the 
new method, the suction device is pressed to the sternum and withdrawn 
repeatedly. This action not only stimulates the heart, but inflates and 
deflates the lungs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was conducted in St. Paul, Minn., said Dr. Keith G. Lurie of the 
University of Minnesota. Lurie co-invented the CardioPump while he was a 
faculty member at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a 10-month period, 77 patients received standard CPR and 53 received the 
new method. The team reported that 26% of the patients who received standard 
CPR were revived and admitted to intensive care units, while 40% of those who 
received the new treatment were admitted. The remainder of the heart attack 
victims died. But because the study was ended early, the team did not study a 
large enough number of patients for the results to be ascribed to use of the 
new method rather than chance, Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Better results were achieved when the group considered only patients who were 
treated within 10 minutes of their heart attack. Among this group, 38% of those 
treated by the new method were eventually released from the hospital, compared 
to 20% of those treated with standard CPR. "These results are statistically 
significant" because the differences in results between the two groups is 
larger, even though a smaller number of people were involved, Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was ended last year by the FDA, which has sharply limited most 
clinical trials of resuscitation techniques, Dr. Carin M. Olson, a contributing 
editor of JAMA, wrote in an accompanying editorial. The problem is the 
difficulty in obtaining informed consent from patients or their families for 
participation in a clinical trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In these cases, the patients are too sick to give permission, and family 
members are either not present or too distraught to give consent in the short 
time available before treatment must be begun. The researchers obtained 
permission from relatives after the fact, a concept called deferred consent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FDA recently decided that it would no longer accept trials involving 
deferred consent, Olson said. Considering the potential benefits of the Ambu 
CardioPump and other potential resuscitation devices and techniques, Olson 
said, the FDA rules are absurd.

FRIENDS RECALL POLLY'S ABDUCTION; COURTS: IN PRELIMINARY HEARING FOR RICHARD 
ALLEN DAVIS, TWO GIRLS TELL HOW A BEARDED INTRUDER TIED THEM UP AND HAULED 
THEIR SCHOOLMATE AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two schoolmates of Polly Klaas described in frightening detail Tuesday how a 
bearded stranger with a knife abducted their friend from her Petaluma bedroom, 
turning a giggly sleep-over into a nightmare that ended two months later when 
Polly's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Composed but clutching stuffed animals, the 12-year-old girls recalled for a 
Municipal Court judge how an evening of ice cream, board games and dress-up 
turned bizarre and ultimately terrifying when the intruder tied them up and 
then hauled a whimpering Polly away. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I assumed that it was some kind of a trick or practical joke," Kate 
McLean said. But gradually, as she lay face-down on the floor, her wrists 
tightly tied, her mouth gagged and her eyes blinded by two pillow cases over 
her head, "I didn't find it too funny. I found it scary." 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony from McLean and Gillian Pelham marked the opening of a 
preliminary hearing for Richard Allen Davis, 39, who is charged with the 
kidnaping and murder of Polly last October. McLean said she could not 
positively identify Davis as the intruder but believes it was him. Pelham 
testified that Davis was definitely the man who took Polly. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors plan to call two dozen witnesses over the next few days in their 
effort to persuade Sonoma County Municipal Judge Robert P. Dale that Davis, a 
repeat felon who committed his first crime at age 12, should be bound over for 
trial. If convicted, Davis could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly's abduction galvanized her hometown, sparking a massive grass-roots 
search that dramatically altered the standard approach to missing child cases. 
The circumstances of her kidnaping -- she was snatched from her own bedroom 
while her mother slept down the hall -- touched a nerve with millions of 
Americans gripped by mounting fear of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a recent parolee, was arrested two months after Polly's disappearance. 
On the night of her kidnaping, he talked his way past two Sonoma County 
sheriff's deputies while Polly, perhaps still alive, was stashed nearby in the 
woods. It was only later -- when items linked to the child were found near the 
scene of the deputies' encounter with Davis -- that he became a suspect and, 
according to the FBI, confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's testimony came in a heavily guarded courtroom crowded with Polly's 
relatives and their supporters, many of whom wore buttons bearing a picture of 
her smiling face. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Polly's friends, plans for the Oct. 1 sleep-over were made over 
the lunch hour at Petaluma Junior High. At the Klaas home that night, the girls 
played board games and, preparing for Halloween, tried on various costumes, 
including Mickey Mouse ears and deer antlers. In an eerie twist, Polly also 
applied white makeup and black eye shadow to make herself "look like a dead 
person," McLean recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hour grew late, the girls decided to prepare for bed. When Polly opened 
her bedroom door to fetch sleeping bags, she found a stranger holding a knife 
and duffel bag standing in the hall. Marching into the bedroom, "he said not to 
scream or he'd cut our throats," Pelham recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 As the intruder tied up the seventh-graders with strips of cloth and 
electrical cords, Polly began to cry. Using a calm and comforting voice, the 
round-faced man with thick, graying hair insisted repeatedly that he would not 
hurt the girls, and asked where the valuables were kept, Pelham testified. 
Then, she said, he left with Polly and "told us to count to 1,000 and that when 
we were done Polly would be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Also testifying Tuesday were Polly's parents, Eve Nichol and Marc Klaas, and a 
series of police and FBI witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichol, sleeping in another bedroom with her younger daughter on the night 
that Polly disappeared, recalled that it was a warm evening and several windows 
were left open. A back door might also have been left open by Polly, who 
earlier had retrieved a vacuum cleaner from a rear porch, Nichol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas has made the fight for tougher sentences and the search for missing 
children his full-time mission. When he took the stand, Davis -- who had kept 
his gaze pointed down at the defense table during the girls' testimony -- 
looked directly at the grieving father, who shot back a cold stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate Richard Allen Davis," Klaas said later, "but I don't put a lot of 
energy into thinking about him. He's a small man, a very, very small man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still to testify are coroner's investigators who may shed new light on the 
circumstances of Polly's death. A report released Tuesday said the likely cause 
was strangulation, but no firm conclusion could be drawn because of the body's 
advanced decomposition.

ON CALIFORNIA: ON ROOT, ROOT, ROOTING FOR THE HOME TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 We have found California's lost voice of reason, and it belongs to Irv 
Pickler. He is a self-described "sports nut." He is also, however, a member of 
the Anaheim City Council, and here is how he reacted last week as the Rams 
football team made noise about relocating out of state -- to a better 
"environment," which, in this context, can be defined as a "sweeter deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams hold up their nose and look down at us and say, 'Tell us what you 
can give us,' " Pickler said. "And it shouldn't be that way. They've been 
arrogant. I've lost my respect for the organization, and I think maybe it's 
best for the city of Anaheim if the team moves." 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude is rare for these times, this place. Up and down California, most 
elected officials seem to have swallowed whole the notion that they are to 
blame for a flat housing market, the end of the Cold War and other fiscal 
calamities. And when CEOs threaten to move their firms to places such as Utah, 
these politicians do more than listen. They reach deep into their pockets -- 
make that, your pockets -- and they pay the ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, here is what Pickler said about that: "Utah! Let them move. More power 
to them. They will find out what Utah is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It can be argued that professional sports franchises invented this form of 
shakedown. They learned long ago how to pit city against city, state against 
state, market against market. Before the Rams were in Anaheim, they were in Los 
Angeles, and before that Cleveland -- and with every move came nice rewards 
from the raiding municipality. In a book titled "Playing the Field," Charles C. 
Euchner, a political science professor, wrote that "by simply exploring options 
for playing in other cities . . . teams have gotten all manner of largess. New 
stadiums are only the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California firms responsible for products ranging from tacos to 
missiles play the what-will-you-pay-us-to-stay game, and, in hindsight, what 
amazes is that it took them so long to follow the lead of their sporting 
brethren. Of course, sports teams do enjoy extraordinary advantages in this 
game. Waivers of standard antitrust laws, for example, let professional leagues 
limit the number of franchises. This creates a scarcity of big-league 
franchises -- and an oversupply of new money millionaires and up-and-coming 
municipalities desperate for a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, sports cast a certain magic spell. Ruthless bottom-line CEOs and 
conservative politicians alike lose all reason when brought in close contact 
with a sports franchise. There have been a number of studies challenging the 
notion that franchises contribute significantly to a municipal economy. There 
have been a number of otherwise savvy entrepreneurs who have gone belly-up 
buying mediocre left fielders. Still, when it comes time to deal, these 
realities are put in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams offer owners a chance to shed the anonymity of business-page agate, and 
to generate some real attention. "These teams are like collectibles," is how 
Leigh Steinberg, the sports agent, put it, "and they come in only a limited 
edition." Cities see a franchise, any franchise, as a shortcut to becoming "big 
league," a winner. For example, just this week in San Jose, the whole town has 
gone crazy because its Soviet bloc emigres beat Detroit's Soviet bloc emigres 
in the first round of hockey playoffs. The victory, it's being said, at last 
put San Jose "on the map." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course when owners grow weary of the game, when the will to invest in 
victory weakens, when the teams begin to stumble and the crowds cover their 
heads with paper bags, they can easily sell and recoup their losses and then 
some. The unnatural market ensures it. For cities, however, a lost team leaves 
behind nothing but an empty stadium and a cache of surplus Jim Everett jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why strapped city officials throughout California are hopping about 
like crazed kangaroos these days, searching for ways to mollify antsy 
franchises. The Oakland Athletics are up for sale. Al Davis is on the prowl for 
a new place to play. In San Diego, the Padres are discontent. And the Rams are 
entertaining offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads us back to Irv Pickler, who insists he does not intend to "grovel" 
to keep the Rams. "With them it is always give, give, give," he said Tuesday, 
"and this city is $8 million in the hole, and we need to put more police on the 
street, and fix some roads, and provide more park services to keep kids off the 
street, and keep the libraries open." 
</P>
<P>
 A sensible man, this Mr. Pickler, but a real spoilsport.

CORRUPTION TRIAL OF GOP LEGISLATOR, EX-AIDE BEGINS; COURTS: PROSECUTOR CHARGES 
THAT SEN. FRANK HILL BOUGHT AND SOLD THE STATE'S LAWS. DEFENSE CALLS HIM AN 
HONORABLE MAN WHO 'IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL POLITICIAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal prosecutor contended Tuesday that the political corruption case 
against state Sen. Frank Hill is "about the buying and selling of the laws of 
California" and said that the Whittier Republican lied to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's lawyer painted a vastly different picture, describing the legislator as 
an honorable middle-class family man who never "linked money to legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 The contrasting arguments were made before a U.S. District Court jury that 
began hearing evidence against Hill and his co-defendant, former Democratic 
Senate aide Terry E. Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is the first GOP legislator to stand trial in a string of cases growing 
out of an elaborate sting operation in which undercover FBI agents posing as 
out-of-state businessmen sought legislation to help set up a bogus 
shrimp-processing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, is charged with extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. Frost, 
44, now a private consultant, is charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. 
Both men have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Atty. Bradford Lewis cited a 1988 
meeting in which Hill received a $2,500 honorarium from the undercover agent 
and told the agent "we'll do everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said that two months later Hill lied when he told FBI agents he couldn't 
recall anyone asking him for assistance or to use his influence to help with 
the shrimp bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's lawyer, Stephen D. Miller, acknowledged that Hill initially failed to 
recall the details because he was interviewed after a 15-hour day at the end of 
the legislative session and he was "preoccupied with other business." But 
Miller said his client did not make a false statement to agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also sought to tarnish the integrity of former GOP Assembly aide Karin 
Watson, the prosecution's chief witness. He said that undercover agents and 
informants "wined and dined" Watson with lobster and champagne to induce her to 
make incriminating statements against Hill and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller told the jury that Hill "is not your typical politician." He described 
him as a family man who speaks his mind and "has served with honor and 
distinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday, the government began the time-consuming process of playing the 
first of 30 or so tapes of conversations secretly recorded by John A. 
Shahabian, a onetime Senate aide who became a crucial government informant. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tapes, Frost boasted to Shahabian that he had always been "behind the 
scenes" but was emerging as a key player in steering campaign contributions to 
Senate Democratic leaders from special interests seeking legislation. The 
exchanges provide an insight into how staff members such as Frost and Shahabian 
sometimes exerted considerable clout over legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Feb. 9, 1988, lunch, Frost cited proposed legislation affecting oil 
companies in which he claimed to have attracted a contribution for then-Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he "offered the oil companies total control of the bill" in 
exchange for control of their political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he "just got five grand for David Roberti out of it for his San 
Francisco event. They're . . . gonna have major money." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost told Shahabian that the bill, apparently related to service stations, 
"was one of my all-time best efforts at playing the system. I had a win-win 
situation for everybody." It was unclear whether the bill was ever introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lunch, Frost also told Shahabian that a legislator had introduced a 
bill that was hostile to the airline industry to pressure the carriers into 
improving service for legislators and their staff. As a result, Frost said, 
"the airline guys started to go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislators agreed to drop the bill, Frost said, after one airline 
agreed to give staff members a state discount without the customary 
reservations, set up a telephone number for legislators and staff members to 
call for information on delayed flights, and allowed legislative staff members 
to get priority "bumping people on reservations." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's lawyer, Christopher Wing, acknowledged during his opening arguments 
that his client was at times blunt in conversations but contended that "Frost 
never agreed with anyone to sell or buy votes" in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the tapes played so far related directly to the case against Hill. 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; WILL EUREKA SEE ITS SHIP COME IN?; DEPRESSED COASTAL TOWN 
HOPES CRUISE VESSEL'S STOP TODAY WILL MARK TURNAROUND FOR ITS ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fussing and preening like the shorebirds along nearby Humboldt Bay, residents 
of this northern coastal community have been sprucing up the town, washing shop 
windows and splattering paint on its famous but weathered Victorian facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Company is coming -- and there hasn't been a moment to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, for the first time in 17 years, a cruise ship laden with travelers will 
call on Eureka, a once-bustling port city that has seen better days. About 700 
passengers and crew members with nine hours on their hands and money in their 
pockets will step off the 563-foot M/V Sun Viking in a trial run that Eureka 
hopes will become a continuing engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship boarded in Los Angeles on Sunday and has stops in San Francisco, 
Eureka, Seattle and Vancouver. It will pause in Eureka again in September, on 
its way back from Alaskan summer cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming of the cruise liner could not be more welcome in this economically 
battered town of 28,000, located about 250 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Declines in timber and fishing revenue have cracked the backbone of this 
region, leaving tourism as a last hope for growth in the local economy. Eureka, 
the seat of Humboldt County, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the 
state and an average annual income of $12,500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 But a partnership with the cruise line industry could mean dozens of stops 
each year. This could lead to a tourism explosion and bring jobs to this 
isolated region. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting first," said Mayor Nancy Flemming, "and it has the potential 
to help diversify our harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat atmosphere in town is, in part, about money. Studies show that each 
passenger may spend between $75 and $100 in Eureka. But Flemming insists that 
the boon for Eureka will be more than money in its coffers. She hopes that 
being part of a Royal Caribbean cruise will accomplish what "we could never 
afford to do" -- bring a more hopeful outlook to the town and open up new 
avenues for its development. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with hopes high, the people of Eureka are out to make a good first 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eureka," Flemming promises, "will be in bloom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was Flemming and other local leaders who lobbied Royal Caribbean managers, 
persuading them to schedule a trial Eureka stop. The idea was met with some 
skepticism at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell is this Eureka?" Rick Strunck, manager of vessel deployment for 
Royal Caribbean cruises, said his bosses asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 But offering Eureka as an "undiscovered location" had appeal, especially as 
the cruise line was shifting away from the European market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the passengers are going to have a great time," Strunck said. "They'll 
get the cosmopolitan flavor of the cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco 
and then they'll see poor little Eureka. But it's that down-home, small-town 
friendliness that's going to make this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some hurdles in attracting and accommodating the ship, such as 
Eureka's lack of public dock space. But a local timber company jumped in and 
agreed to provide its private dock. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a quick fix for other longstanding problems along Eureka's 
waterfront, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sight of Eureka for the passengers who will be stepping off the Sun 
Viking today will be the sprawling, decaying waterfront, with its rotting piers 
and shabby, deserted buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because larger ports have better rail and road access, the Humboldt Bay harbor 
has fallen into disrepair -- underdeveloped and poorly utilized, according to 
various studies. Reduced timber harvests and federal regulations cut into the 
area's only significant export, dropping by 30% the export of wood chips and 
other wood products, said Andy Westfall of the Eureka-based Westfall Stevedore 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, with a lack of boat repair and other fishing support services, much 
of the fishing fleet has fled to better ports in Ft. Bragg and Crescent City. 
</P>
<P>
 No one realizes the impact of dilapidated piers and abandoned buildings as 
well as Flemming, who lives on Gunther Island, nestled inside Humboldt Bay. 
From her kitchen window, she has a bird's-eye view of Eureka's eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 Its renewal has been bogged down in lawsuits and planning disagreements with 
county officials, property owners and the harbor district. But recently the 
city of Eureka and the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation 
District agreed to deepen harbor channels and replace a burned-out pier by 
1996, a promising step. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can remove the blight," Flemming said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Old Town, it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations in the historic heart of Eureka have brought accolades, including 
a recent state Main Street design award. Visitors will see well-preserved 
Victorian architecture along brick-lined streets with antique lighting 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of people wandering around this county is certainly going to be good 
for us," painter John Norton said about a week ago, as he put the finishing 
touches on an 1880s saloon being reborn as a kitchenware store in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 An artifact junkie, Norton will join others in showing off the wonders of 
Humboldt County when the passengers alight today. His collection of old coins 
and bottles will be on display in "history tents," along with fishing exhibits 
and logging demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Serenaded by a local high school band and showered with flowers from the local 
bulb farm, the Royal Caribbean passengers will be deposited on vintage rail 
cars for a 10-mile trip around the bay, with an ornithologist on board to help 
spot the region's hundreds of bird species. Then the visitors can tour the 
exhibits, ice cream parlor, art galleries and quaint shops in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 For the more rugged passengers, there will be tours to a lumber mill, a 
redwood forest, a re-created Indian village and the dairy town of Ferndale. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does this visit mark a first for cooperation among Eureka area 
officials, it will present a sight unseen in Eureka. At seven stories, the Sun 
Viking will dwarf Eureka's landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even have a building that tall in town," said Deborah Musick, a 
coordinator for the local Main Street program. "It's a big ship and a big day 
for us. It really is."

BILL TIES WELFARE REFORM TO CUT IN IMMIGRANT AID; BENEFITS: DEMOCRATIC PLAN 
WOULD SHIFT COSTS ON CARE TO STATES FOR THE NEW, LEGAL ARRIVALS. CALIFORNIA 
LIKELY WOULD SHOULDER THE BIGGEST BURDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An influential group of moderate and conservative House Democrats has crafted 
legislation that would finance welfare reform by eliminating nearly all 
benefits from food stamps to medical care for newly arrived legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, scheduled to be introduced in the House today by the Mainstream 
Forum, is similar to those supported by House and Senate Republicans. By 
reducing federal benefits to immigrants, it would transfer billions of dollars 
in immigrant-care costs to the states. California, with its large numbers of 
immigrants, likely would bear the greatest burden. 
</P>
<P>
 That a group of Democrats would make such a proposal signals the breadth of 
anti-immigrant sentiment in Congress and provides further evidence that a 
divisive battle is looming over the financing of welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The welfare debate could become consumed in an ugly immigration debate," said 
Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 As a measure of the political delicacy of funding a welfare overhaul by 
reducing immigrant benefits, some early supporters of the Mainstream initiative 
have dropped out. The brewing controversy demonstrates how complicated it will 
be to finance a major welfare reform without raising taxes, as President 
Clinton has promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that, while they disagree with the group's 
financing plan, other provisions in the bill are similar to the 
Administration's own welfare reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both initiatives would provide job training and placement, as well as child 
care, to help welfare recipients give up their reliance on the nation's largest 
welfare program: Aid for Families With Dependent Children. Both proposals also 
would establish a two-year limit for benefits and would be directed only at 
welfare recipients born after 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new twist on the President's proposal however, the Mainstream plan would 
limit to three years the period in which former welfare recipients could 
qualify for community service jobs after their welfare payments end. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said that provision potentially could leave many poor Americans 
without a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It signals that there is now a group of Democrats willing to deny the most 
basic form of assistance to poor children whose parents have complied with 
every requirement thrown at them," said Robert Greenstein, executive director 
of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington-based 
research institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it is the financing mechanism that is expected to generate the 
most heated debate and the Administration has indicated that it disapproves of 
that element of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their bill is a serious attempt to make good on the President's 
campaign pledge to end welfare," said Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser to 
the President and a chairman of his welfare reform task force. But "the danger 
in their financing approach is that it will shift costs to the states and 
create as many problems as it solves. We're going to fight those provisions to 
make sure the financing is balanced and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the bill, its chief sponsor, Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), said 
through a spokesman: "It's a matter of priorities. We believe that American 
citizens are the priority. The welfare system was not designed to (help) 
immigrants adjust to their new country." The Mainstream Forum would pay for the 
lion's share of its proposal -- $21 billion over five years -- by eliminating 
Medicaid, Aid for Families With Dependent Children, food stamps and 
supplemental security income for most newly arrived immigrants. Immigrants over 
75 would be permanently exempt from the ban on benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House plan also envisions diverting funds from immigrant benefits to 
pay for welfare reform. But Administration officials insisted that their more 
modest reductions would only serve to shift costs to the families of immigrants 
and not to local governments. The Administration would extend the time period 
for considering the income of a sponsor when judging the eligibility of an 
elderly, blind or disabled immigrant for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hispanic Caucus and liberals in Congress, as well as immigrant advocate 
groups, are opposed to any reductions in benefits to legal immigrants. They 
argue that the Administration is trying to use the harsher Mainstream Forum and 
Republican proposals as a lever to force them to compromise.

COURT ORDERS KEVORKIAN MURDER CHARGES REVIVED; DEATH: APPELLATE PANEL SAYS NO 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SUICIDE EXISTS. BUT IT THROWS OUT STATE'S BAN ON 
ASSISTING WITH DEATHS, CITING TECHNICAL GROUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 Tuesday that there is no 
constitutional right to suicide in that state, and it ordered two dismissed 
murder charges against assisted-suicide crusader Jack Kevorkian reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the court struck down Michigan's ban on assisted suicides on 
technical grounds. Under the state constitution, the ban should have been a 
separate bill rather than part of a measure creating a commission on death and 
dying, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the three rulings was to send proponents of the ban back to the 
drawing board to draft a new version, while dealing a setback to Kevorkian and 
his allies on the broader issue of whether suicide is constitutionally 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very unhappy," said Howard Simon, executive director of the state 
branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. "Superficially, it may look like 
we won because this strikes down the law. But the court went way beyond that to 
rule on the substantive issue, and we may have to appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling also increases the chances that the Supreme Court will ultimately 
hear the case because a federal judge in Washington proclaimed last week that 
there is a constitutional right to decide when to die. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 30 states bar helping with a suicide, but lawmakers and judges in 
Michigan have been forced to pay particular attention to the issue by the 
activities of Kevorkian, 65, a retired pathologist who lives in a Detroit 
suburb and has been present at 20 suicides since 1990, five since the ban took 
effect last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first jury test of Michigan's ban, Kevorkian was acquitted last week by 
a panel whose members said they believed that he intended only to help ease the 
suffering of a 30-year-old former landscaper and construction worker with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
Last August, Kevorkian placed a mask over the face of Thomas Hyde and allowed 
Hyde to begin a flow of deadly carbon monoxide gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate ruling means that, although Kevorkian cannot be charged with 
assisted suicide, he could be tried for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The court reinstated murder charges in the 1991 deaths of Marjorie Wantz, 58, 
who suffered from pelvic disease, and Sherry Miller, 43, who had multiple 
sclerosis. The two women died in a remote cabin in Oakland County, north of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinstatement of the charges, dismissed at the trial court level, was 
based on a 1920 state high court ruling that a defendant who mixed poison and 
placed it within reach of his terminally ill wife was guilty of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said he had no immediate plans to 
take the cases to trial. "I think that prudence dictates that we would wait for 
the Michigan Supreme Court to make a final ruling" in the cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the broader issue of constitutional protection for suicide, Michigan 
Appeals Court Judge Thomas Fitzgerald wrote that the right to commit suicide is 
not a logical extension of the right to privacy. "Liberty and justice will not 
cease to exist as a result of this court's decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Judge Donald E. Shelton wrote that the "government may not totally 
take from us our inherent right to determine not only who we are, but, even 
more essentially, whether we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the current legal status of assisted suicide in Michigan remained 
unclear.

WATER TO BE DIVERTED FROM 2 DAMS FOR SAKE OF SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday approved an emergency plan to spill 
extra water over the Snake and Columbia river dams in hopes of boosting salmon 
survival despite concerns that it could do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonneville Power Administration was prepared to start "wheeling power" 
from other sources at midnight to make up for the loss of generating capacity 
from diverting more water to spillways and away from turbines, corps spokesman 
Orel Dugger said in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps was developing a program to monitor whether the spills kill fish 
because the extra water going over spillways puts more nitrogen into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissolved nitrogen gas can kill fish in much the same way that a deep-sea 
diver gets the bends from surfacing too quickly. Scientists are divided on 
whether it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordered by a federal judge to do more to help salmon survive passage over the 
Columbia Basin dams, the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed the bold 
step. It is aimed particularly at helping Snake River runs of sockeye, which 
are endangered, and chinook, which are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydroelectric dams are blamed for killing as many as 90% of the salmon smolts 
coming out of the Snake River. The idea is to push more salmon smolts over 
spillways. 
</P>
<P>
 Less water would be available to go through hydroelectric turbines as a 
result, and the Bonneville Power Administration would have to buy electricity 
from other sources.

 A man obsessed with his former girlfriend went on a shooting rampage in 
Newark, N.J., when her brothers laughed at him because she had a new boyfriend. 
He killed the two brothers and a motorist and the next day in his New York

 Harvard University is launching what is believed to be the biggest single 
fund-raising campaign in American history with a quest to raise $2.1 billion 
over the next five years. The school has a $500-million head start due to early 
pledges and donations. Nearly half the goal will go toward the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, Harvard's undergraduate college, which hopes to hire about 40 
more faculty.

 Environmental Protection Agency scientists have concluded that the primary 
threats from dioxin are subtle effects on fetal development and the immune 
system that may come from very low exposure levels, a published report says. 
Most people have dioxin levels in their bodies at or close to the levels that 
cause immune system and fetal problems in lab animals, the scientists said in 
the draft summary of a 2,000-page report, which was described in the New York 
Times. But the report says that many of its conclusions came from animal 
studies.

MONEY; BIG CHUNK OF CHANGE IN DESIGN OF GREENBACKS APPEARS LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government is scurrying to rescue Ben Franklin, Ulysses S. Grant and 
Andrew Jackson from the clutches of increasingly wily counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100, $50 and $20 bills bearing the portraits of the famous three are 
headed for the most radical design change in 65 years, and Treasury officials 
said Tuesday that they hope to have a plan ready by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "With color copiers and other sophisticated printing technology at the 
disposal of counterfeiters, we're trying to stay ahead," spokeswoman Rebecca 
Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation abounds in numismatic circles that the new greenbacks will sport a 
second color and will have their portraits shoved off to the side to make room 
for a hard-to-duplicate watermark in the center. Such devices are already in 
use on the currency of several other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also guess that the size of the new U.S. notes will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal dismisses such talk as "sheer speculation," saying: "No one at the 
Treasury Department has issued a proposal or issued a picture of a possible 
redesign. . . . There are thousands of possibilities being looked at in the 
mock-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 She did acknowledge that one possible move under study is a watermark, a 
translucent design impressed on paper during manufacture and visible when the 
paper is held to the light. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the changes is a task force composed of top Treasury officials, 
the Federal Reserve, the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the 
Secret Service, which investigates all counterfeiting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 New designs have been considered for a decade, but with the counterfeiting 
threat accelerating, activity went into high gear last year upon the arrival of 
the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The government took a couple of emergency steps three years ago, installing 
new security features on high-denomination bills, starting with the forgers' 
favorite, the $100 note. 
</P>
<P>
 A security thread was embedded in the paper to the left of the portrait, and a 
new microscopic line of type -- appearing to be merely a decorative edge -- was 
placed around the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Coin World, a collectors publication based in Sidney, Ohio, said in a recent 
issue that most, if not all, of the anti-counterfeit devices on bills "can or 
already have been duplicated, including the security thread." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lowenthal insisted the two new security features have been effective. "No 
one's currency is completely secure, but those two features have definitely 
made an impact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Leuver, a former director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, 
is quoted in Coin World saying that Treasury decided to go with a security 
thread because a paper supplier, Crane & Co. of Dalton, Mass., lacks the 
equipment required to make a registered watermark. 
</P>
<P>
 Crane, which has had an exclusive contract for currency paper with the 
government since 1879, told Coin World that it does have the equipment and is 
producing watermark currency paper for its international bank note customers. A 
spokesman was quoted as saying that the government decided not to use the 
watermark because it did not want to change the outward appearance of 
greenbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Leuver nor Crane officials could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 An indication of the growth in counterfeiting -- and the increasing problem of 
enforcing laws against it -- is suggested in figures provided by the Secret 
Service. The value of counterfeit money seized has declined from $110 million 
in 1988 to $24 million last year, and the estimated value of bogus money in 
circulation has gone up, from $11 million to $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely existing currency would be recalled with the issuance of new 
bills, Lowenthal said. There are $207.5 billion worth of $100 bills in 
circulation worldwide, along with $5.5 billion in $1 bills, $841 million in $2 
bills, $6.5 billion in $5s, $13.2 billion in $10s, $75 billion in $20s and $41 
billion in $50s. That totals more than $349 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 One-dollar bills wear out in about 18 months, but the typical $100 bill or $50 
bill stays in circulation nine years.

SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNING COUNCIL REBUFF ARAFAT; MIDEAST: PLO LEADER 
MUST NAME 24 MEMBERS OF AUTHORITY THAT WILL PRESIDE IN GAZA AND JERICHO. BUT 
KEY PALESTINIANS VIEW TASK AS POLITICAL SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as the first contingent of Palestinian police crossed into the Gaza Strip 
on Tuesday, the Palestine Liberation Organization faced a crisis in naming its 
new Palestinian Authority, which will preside over autonomy in Gaza and Jericho 
until elections this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Key PLO officials say PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has been repeatedly rebuffed 
by Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories as he tries to set up the 
24-member governing council. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are depressed, and it seems that the end of the problem will not come 
soon," an Arafat adviser said Tuesday. "Until now, many people are refusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, the PLO Executive Committee was unable to come up with a 
list of names for the new government and postponed a decision until after 
Arafat's trip to South Africa for the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. 
But with Arafat's scheduled return here today, there is still no certainty he 
will find the leaders he needs for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of Palestinian leaders view the authority, which will be only 
temporary and subject to Arafat's whims, as a ticket to political suicide, or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that nobody is accepting to be used for three months," one PLO 
official said. "It could be the end of your reputation -- and maybe your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Key leaders from the occupied territories -- such as Faisal Husseini, Ghassan 
Khatib and Saeb Erekat -- have all refused posts on the authority, which is to 
be headed by Arafat and draw 60% of its members from inside the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Arafat is said to have phoned Gaza Strip Palestinian leader Zakaria 
Agha from South Africa to urge him to join the council. Agha, a PLO official 
here said, told Arafat, "Until now, it's not clear what my responsibility, my 
power, will be." 
</P>
<P>
 The official noted: "People see this as just nominating names with no clear 
idea of the future, and there is no support, no investment. Arafat is having 
big troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Another PLO official said that, as matters now stand, it appears that even the 
next executive committee meeting after Arafat's return "will not be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was able to persuade Agha, Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij and Gaza Bar 
Assn. chief Freij abu Midan to sign on to the authority, according to reports 
Tuesday from the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The first contingent of the Palestinian police, 148 men in olive-drab uniforms 
and green berets, crossed into the Gaza Strip from Egypt on Tuesday afternoon. 
But the group was held at immigration for hours by Israeli security officials, 
for identity checks and luggage searches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are letting 9,000 terrorists, retrained and armed to be policemen, into 
Gaza and the West Bank," an Israeli army officer said, explaining the delay. 
"Is it any wonder we are rather careful about who is who and what he is 
bringing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, interviewed by Israel Television in South Africa, exploded with anger 
over the delay when asked whether he had not asked for a slowdown in the 
hand-over because the PLO was not ready. "Who asked for the delay?" he snapped 
at the interviewer. "Our security forces are there. We have not asked for the 
delay -- not one hour, not one day. Who can ask for a delay in returning to his 
homeland?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy processing deprived the policemen of the popular welcome Gazans 
had planned. For the third day, thousands of people had gathered outside the 
Rafah border post to greet the police, all members of the Palestine Liberation 
Army, and thousands more lined the roads, standing around campfires until well 
past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 More Palestinian police are expected to enter the West Bank town of Jericho as 
well as Gaza today. Israeli troops handed over the first of the Gaza bases they 
will transfer to the Palestine police. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a historic day for the Palestinian people because this will be the 
first day on the road to independence," said Maj. Gen. Nasser Yousef, commander 
of the Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slow start, plans still call for 6,000 police to be deployed by 
May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO leaders say Israel has told them that no substantial action on 
admitting the officers will occur until the Palestinian Authority is named. And 
even after the officers enter, they say, Israel has said they must remain in 
camps in Gaza until Israel completes its withdrawal from the new autonomous 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in naming the new governing council reflects both factional disputes 
and growing challenges to Arafat's single-handed leadership style that have 
plagued the PLO for months. But it is also a sign of the general confusion in 
Tunis as the PLO prepares to take on the greatest challenge in its history: the 
transition to governing its own people. 
</P>
<P>
 There are widespread preparations in PLO departments all over Tunis to shift 
operations to the autonomous areas. But the PLO also appears to be planning to 
rely on the existing Israeli-created civil administration -- which is already 
in place in Gaza and Jericho -- more than preparing detailed proposals to take 
on responsibilities in areas such as housing, electricity, schools and health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're having problems with organization. They haven't got everything 
figured out," said one Western diplomat monitoring the transition. "They were 
leading us to believe all along that as soon as the agreement was signed, they 
were ready to go in. This is clearly not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Another observer noted: "Despite the fact they've had this time, they (the 
PLO) clearly are not organized. They've got the expertise on the ground in the 
territories, they've got expertise in the diaspora. But here in Tunis, where 
they should have experts on the ground working, they haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, there is surprisingly little confidence that the PLO is up to 
assuming the difficult task of ensuring security in the turbulent Gaza Strip 
once its police are allowed to enter and deploy. Some PLO officials here 
complain privately that the two men chosen to head the police force in the 
territories have backgrounds as commandos, not police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that the kind of experience you want when you are trying to keep things 
calm?" one official asked. "What will happen the first time they have to enter 
one of the camps to arrest a wanted suspect? The whole camp will be against 
them! And they will be seen in the streets as Israeli collaborators." 
</P>
<P>
 These concerns have been widely expressed in the international community and 
in Israel; that they now are echoed here at PLO headquarters testifies to the 
immensity of the job ahead for this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is a momentum for peace here -- for pushing forward with the job 
ahead at all costs -- that is born of the feeling that there is no alternative. 
"There will be problems, but there will not be civil war," said one Arafat 
adviser. "We are eager to be in our land. We were obliged to be out, we are all 
educated, we are open-minded, we have the practice of living together, and, 
somehow, we will do it."

ITALIAN PREMIER FORMS RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 After prolonged haggling with ambitious, suspicious allies, Silvio Berlusconi, 
the billionaire turned politician, announced the formation Tuesday of the first 
right-wing Italian government since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, the 57-year-old political newcomer who is one of Italy's richest 
men, will be sworn in this morning as prime minister of the 53rd postwar 
government in Italy and the first with neo-fascist representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro after 11 days of wide-ranging 
talks and last-minute horse-trading, Berlusconi presented a Cabinet that he 
called "a good team . . . above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 Two deputy prime ministers represent controversial allies who stormed to 
victory with Berlusconi in March elections driven by voter disgust with 
institutionalized corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to bring to government what I have learned in business all these 
years," Berlusconi said. 
</P>
<P>
 His holdings include supermarkets, three national television stations, 
magazines, real estate and Italy's best soccer team. They reportedly did $7 
billion in business last year and have a collective debt of about $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting his government, Berlusconi said he is sure he can win required 
votes of confidence in both houses of the Italian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Maroni -- of the federalist Northern League and a stand-in for League 
founder Umberto Bossi -- was named to the key Interior (Police) Ministry as 
well as to the deputy premiership. The League seeks a federal, decentralized 
Italy, and Bossi on occasion has talked of splitting the country into three 
federal republics: north, central and south. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuseppe Tatarella of the neo-fascist National Alliance became the other 
deputy prime minister, as well as minister of post and telecommunications. 
Tatarella thus became the first of the political heirs of former dictator 
Benito Mussolini to hold Cabinet rank in half a century. Like Bossi, 
controversial neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini did not seek a Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervousness over the unabashed right-wing nature of the government triggered 
an unprecedented letter to Berlusconi from Scalfaro on Tuesday. The Italian 
president, who is at least nominally above politics, reminded the Milan tycoon 
that his government is constitutionally obliged to respect the democratic 
institutions of an indivisible republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro asked Berlusconi to form a government on April 28. It took 11 days 
principally because of Bossi's demands that the powerful Interior Ministry 
should go to his party. Neither Berlusconi nor Fini liked the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi threatened to withdraw from the coalition and railed against potential 
conflicts of interest in Berlusconi's assumption of political power atop his 
economic clout -- a concern that is still paramount among opposition parties.

HATA REITERATES JAPANESE REGRET FOR PAST 'ACTS OF AGGRESSION AND COLONIALISM'; 
HISTORY: PREMIER ADDRESSES PARLIAMENT, SENDS MESSAGES TO ASIAN LEADERS. HE 
SEEKS TO UNDO HARM OF OUSTED MINISTER'S DENIAL OF 1937 ATROCITIES.

<P>
 In a policy speech, and in unusual messages to Asian leaders, Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday renewed "the recognition that Japan's past actions, 
including acts of aggression and colonialism, caused unbearable suffering and 
sorrow for many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata made the declaration in the aftermath of statements by his ousted justice 
minister, Shigeto Nagano, who denied past Japanese aggression and described a 
major atrocity Japanese soldiers committed in 1937 in China as a "fabrication." 
</P>
<P>
 In both the speech -- his first to Parliament since he was elected prime 
minister April 25 -- and the special messages, Hata promised to convey to 
future generations of Japanese the recognition of the nation's past misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on its deep remorse, Japan will do its utmost to create peace and a 
bright future for the Asia-Pacific region," he added, declaring that his 
statement would constitute the "political creed of the new Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain and anger of peoples of neighboring countries caused by the recent 
remarks of a Cabinet minister shows . . . that Japan's past actions have left 
great scars which remain even today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Hata dispatched a special letter to 
Chinese Premier Li Peng, telephoned South Korean President Kim Young Sam and 
had Japanese diplomatic missions deliver messages to other Asian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently for foreign consumption, official translators subtly strengthened 
Hata's main remark. Where the English translation had Hata condemning 
"aggression and colonialism" in his speech, in Japanese he said "acts of 
aggression and colonialism." 
</P>
<P>
 That phrasing stops short of describing Japan's entire war as aggression -- as 
ex-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa characterized it in an August news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a Socialist walkout from his coalition, which left his government 
without a majority in either house of Parliament, Hata said he wanted to add 
"cooperation" to "reform" as a second pillar of his minority government. 
</P>
<P>
 He also took note of predictions that his administration may soon face a test 
at the polls. A bill to establish the boundaries of 300 new single-seat 
districts for the lower house will be submitted as soon as possible "so that 
the next general election can be held under the new system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the establishment of new districts, any election that Hata might be 
forced to call by a vote of no confidence would be carried out under the old 
system, in which voters choose an average of four representatives from each 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 On economic issues, Hata added a tone of concern that Hosokawa had not shown 
before resigning over suspicions involving his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese economy has experienced sufferings previously unknown and has 
gone even to the point of shaking our confidence about future prospects," Hata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also called a prolonged delay in enacting the 1994 budget "alarming" and 
promised to tackle "serious economic issues (that) remain unresolved between 
Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that Japan's large surpluses were built upon "the untiring 
efforts of the people within the rules of international free trade," Hata 
acknowledged that Japan's continuing black ink "cannot but invite the criticism 
of its trading partners." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must change our way of thinking . . . to achieve a phased reduction of the 
current account surplus (and) to change Japan's economic structure so that it 
is internationally harmonious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said Japan "tended to be an onlooker to developments of the international 
community" during the Cold War. Now, he said, "Japan needs to move to center 
stage, play an active role for world peace and prosperity and earn the trust of 
the international community."

 Here is the text of President Nelson Mandela's inaugural speech:  
</P>
<P>
 Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished guests, comrades and 
friends: 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all of us do, by our presence here and by our celebrations in other 
parts of our country and the world, confer glory and hope to newborn liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long 
must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South 
African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen 
its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for 
a glorious life for all. 
</P>
<P>
 All this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the world who are so 
well represented here today. 
</P>
<P>
 To my compatriots, I have no hesitation in saying that each one of us is as 
intimately attached to the soil of this beautiful country as are the famous 
jacaranda trees of Pretoria and the mimosa trees of the bush-veld. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time one of us touches the soil of this land, we feel a sense of personal 
renewal. The national mood changes as the seasons change. We are moved by a 
sense of joy and exhilaration when the grass turns green and the flowers bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 That spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this common homeland 
explains the depth of the pain we all carried in our hearts as we saw our 
country tear itself apart in terrible conflict, and as we saw it spurned, 
outlawed and isolated by the peoples of the world, precisely because it had 
become the universal base of the pernicious ideology and practice of racism and 
racial oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 We, the people of South Africa, feel fulfilled that humanity has taken us back 
into its bosom -- that we, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been 
given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 We thank all our distinguished international guests for having come to take 
possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common 
victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 We trust that you will continue to stand by us as we tackle the challenges of 
building peace, prosperity, non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We deeply appreciate the role that the masses of our people and their 
political mass democratic, religious, women, youth, business, traditional and 
other leaders have played to bring about this conclusion. Not least among them 
is my second deputy president, the Honorable F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 We would also like to pay tribute to our security forces, in all their ranks, 
for the distinguished role they have played in securing our first democratic 
elections and the transition to democracy, from bloodthirsty forces which still 
refuse to see the light. 
</P>
<P>
 The time for the healing of the wounds has come. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come. 
</P>
<P>
 The time to build is upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to 
liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, 
suffering, gender and other discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 We succeeded to take our last steps to freedom in conditions of relative 
peace. We commit ourselves to the construction of a complete, just and lasting 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 We have triumphed in the effort to implant hope in the breasts of the millions 
of our people. We enter into a covenant that we shall build the society in 
which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, 
without any fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human 
dignity -- a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As a token of its commitment to the renewal of our country, the new Interim 
Government of National Unity will, as a matter of urgency, address the issue of 
amnesty for various categories of our people who are currently serving terms of 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this country and the 
rest of the world who sacrificed in many ways and surrendered their lives so 
that we could be free. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward. 
</P>
<P>
 We are both humbled and elevated by the honor and privilege that you, the 
people of South Africa, have bestowed on us, as the first president of a 
united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South Africa, to lead our country 
out of the valley of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. 
</P>
<P>
 We must therefore act together as a united people, for national 
reconciliation, for nation-building, for the birth of a new world. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be justice for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be peace for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to 
fulfill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again 
experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being 
the skunk of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement! Let freedom reign. 
God bless Africa!

THE REBIRTH OF SOUTH AFRICA; GORE, MANDELA SEARCH FOR WAYS TO AID RWANDA; 
DIPLOMACY: U.S. VICE PRESIDENT HOLDS TALKS AT INAUGURATION. SOUTH AFRICAN 
APPEARS OPEN TO A GLOBAL FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore met here Tuesday with U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, the head of the Organization of African Unity, South African 
President Nelson Mandela and other African leaders in a search for ways to 
invigorate stalled international efforts to aid civilians in strife-racked 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, speaking at a brief news conference after meeting with Gore, appeared 
open to the possibility of an international force to restore order in Rwanda -- 
a move that African leaders have opposed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials cautioned later that they do not believe Mandela is prepared to 
fully endorse the idea of an international force -- something the Clinton 
Administration has proposed in the past. But even his willingness to consider 
such a move could be significant, officials said, because of his influence with 
other governments on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an informal report Tuesday to the Security Council, the U.N. staff 
recommended consideration of a force of at least 5,500 soldiers, saying "it is 
imperative that a further deterioration of this catastrophic situation is 
prevented and that the basic humanitarian needs of the huge numbers of Rwandese 
civilians who have been displaced or otherwise affected by the fighting be 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomatic efforts came as U.N. officials reported continued heavy 
fighting around the Rwandan capital of Kigali and advances by soldiers of the 
Tutsi rebel movement that has been fighting against a Rwandan government 
dominated by the Hutu tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting "does not appear to be slowing down," Gore told reporters after 
meeting with Boutros-Ghali, OAU chief Salim Salim and Ali Hassan Mwinyi, the 
president of Tanzania, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to 
escape the Rwandan killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it is a horrible tragedy that calls out for a response," Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meeting, Gore said, he proposed "several new ideas," but he declined to 
outline them, saying "the discussion is unfortunately at a delicate stage which 
does not make it easy to talk publicly about the ideas that we have advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these are earth-shattering or in the nature of an ultimate solution," 
he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some form of international force to restore order has been an idea suggested 
by U.S. officials in the past. But African leaders have resisted, in part 
because of concerns over violating the sovereignty of another African state, 
however devastated, and in part too because the Administration has made it 
clear it would supply logistic aid and money but expects the Africans to supply 
the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela told reporters "if a force is there merely to maintain law and 
order and to save lives, that is something that is absolutely necessary." He 
cautioned, however, that he would "not feel comfortable" discussing details of 
any proposal until after he had consulted with other African leaders.

ARRESTED IN '89, DEFENDANTS GET NO PITY FROM BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six pale, weary prisoners shuffle into an oblong cage against the wall of a 
courtroom. They sit in a row on a bench. The cage door locks, and their trial, 
now in its fifth year, resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their crime: borrowing from a Soviet bank to import computers, in competition 
with firms tied to the Soviet KGB, and defaulting on part of the loan. The 
defendants argue that only their arrests in 1989 kept them from repaying in 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 The offended Soviet Union and its KGB no longer exist, and thousands of 
entrepreneurs it jailed for "speculation" now work freely in the new Russia. 
But the trial of the Tellur Cooperative drags on -- an example of judicial 
sluggishness that is turning the country's pretrial prisons into overcrowded 
infernos. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that the original Soviet investigators are still on the case for 
Russia's Interior Ministry. Six judges thought the charges too flimsy to hear; 
one threw them back at the ministry, only to be overruled by the Supreme Court. 
Hearings are often interrupted for up to four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial is intentionally delayed to force those who are still in prison to 
plead guilty," charges Alexander Morozov, one of five original defendants who 
were freed after falling ill (Morozov from a hunger strike) but are still on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is now focusing on ailments of the six jailed defendants. 
Alexander Golushko rises in the cage and describes how cellmates saved his life 
with a chest massage after his heart stopped. Judge Tamara F. Savina declines 
to free him. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Andreyanchenko gets up and declares a hunger strike. He calls the 
judge a "puppet" of the Interior Ministry. She sends him back to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir A. Kopylov, 47, director of the Tellur Cooperative, blows a kiss from 
the cage to his wife, who manages a few words describing their daughter's 
recent 15th birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's rotting alive," his wife says later. He has 107 cellmates in 67 square 
yards of space. He's losing his hair, his eyesight and his spirit, she says. 
"He's already an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Savina is not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want us to do about prison conditions?" the judge replies to a 
reporter's question. "Close down all the prisons and let the criminals go 
free?" She laughs. "Go back to America and pry into your own judicial affairs."

 A second adult mountain lion was killed by federal trackers in eastern San 
Diego County, about 10 miles south of where a female lion was killed earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 125-pound male was killed about 10:45 p.m. Monday. The owner of a private 
Descanso ranch told officials that a 120-pound pregnant ewe on the ranch had 
been killed and partly eaten by a mountain lion Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, park rangers tracked and killed an adult female mountain lion 
in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, a day after a big cat charged a child.

KEVORKIAN MISSES HEARING ON REVOKING CALIFORNIA LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Kevorkian moved closer to having his California medical license 
permanently revoked Tuesday when he failed to appear at a hearing before an 
administrative law judge in connection with the assisted suicides of two 
Southern California residents. 
</P>
<P>
 By not attending or sending a lawyer to represent him, Kevorkian defaulted on 
keeping his license, which state officials suspended in April, 1993. Judge 
Joyce Wharton forwarded the matter to the Medical Board of California, which is 
expected to revoke the license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect of this litigation is to reduce Jack Kevorkian to Mr. Kevorkian," 
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas Lazar, who represented the state at Tuesday's 
hearing. "He's essentially been kicked out of the world of medicine. In any 
future litigation, he won't be able to say, 'This was my patient.' He's not 
licensed to practice medicine anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, Dixon Arnett, executive director of the medical board, 
announced his intention to have the license revoked, expressing concern that 
Kevorkian had begun to recruit Californians who might desire his help in 
committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett asked the judge to begin the proceedings after Kevorkian helped the two 
Southern Californians die. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 65, dubbed "Dr. Death" for having assisted in 20 suicides, obtained 
a California medical license in 1957 and worked from 1979 to 1982 at two 
hospitals in Long Beach. He lives in Troy, Mich., near where each of the 
suicides has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and his Michigan-based 
attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, declined to comment. But last year, when California 
suspended Kevorkian's license, Fieger said the retired pathologist had no 
intention of filing an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials presented evidence Tuesday showing that Kevorkian had assisted 
in the suicides of a Costa Mesa man -- whose best friend argued that he was 
merely depressed over the death of his mother and not seriously ill -- and a 
San Diego woman suffering from terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathon Grenz got cancer in 1992, causing doctors to remove his voice box and 
tongue. At the time of his death early last year at age 44, Grenz was 
"depressed from his surgery, overwhelmed with grief over the loss of his mother 
and was never given the opportunity to grieve over his losses," according to 
the court testimony of Newport Beach real estate agent Linda Healy, who had 
worked with Grenz at an Orange County real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Ruwart, 40, of San Diego, whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small 
intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors, died in a Waterford, Mich., home in 
1993 with Kevorkian by her side. It was Ruwart's death that prompted the 
Michigan Legislature to pass a law banning assisted suicide.

 A former boys choir director and priest at St. Anthony's Seminary pleaded 
guilty Tuesday to a charge of molesting a boy under 14 at the seminary. Father 
Robert Van Handel faces a maximum eight years in prison when he is sentenced 
June 21.He was the second priest convicted of child abuse at the Franciscan 
seminary and boarding school. Former students have made allegations against 11 
St. Anthony's priests. Because most of the alleged incidents occurred before 
1987, the criminal statute of limitations has expired. Van Handel and others 
still face civil lawsuits. The Franciscans have acknowledged that sexual abuse 
took place at the seminary boarding school between 1964 and 1987. Van Handel, 
former leader of the Santa Barbara Boys Choir, molested the unidentified boy 
between 1987 and 1989. "I'd like to admit that I did abuse this child. I accept 
full responsibility for that. At no time was it ever the child's fault, and I'm 
very deeply sorry," Van Handel told Municipal Judge Frank Ochoa.

 A 7-year-old boy was killed and his mother, grandmother and sister were in 
critical condition Tuesday after being bound, gagged and stabbed in a dispute 
over money, police said. A relative of the victims was arrested in Oakland by 
the California Highway Patrol a few hours after the attack.Ricky Tejada, the 
father of the slain boy, returned from his night job at a hotel to the bloody 
scene at his home Tuesday morning, police said. Tejada's son, Jerico, was dead 
and his wife, his mother and the couple's daughter had been bound and stabbed, 
police said. Virginia Tejada, 64, Felina Tejada, 36, and Jerrilyn, 6, were 
taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where they were in surgery, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. A 3-year-old and an infant in another part of the house were 
uninjured, police said. Ricky Tejada's brother-in-law, Richard Villegas, 23, 
who used to live in the basement of the Tejada house, was arrested while 
crossing an Oakland street, San Francisco police said. Tejada told police that 
his wife said Villegas came to the house to ask her for money and attacked the 
family when she refused to give him any.

 A member of Thailand's Parliament was charged with smuggling 45 tons of 
marijuana into the United States over a 14-year period in a 1991 indictment 
unsealed Tuesday. U.S. authorities have already seized a $1-million Beverly 
Hills home and a 1987 Mercedes-Benz owned by Thanong Siriprechapong. A federal 
judge's forfeiture order last May accepted the government's claim that the 
property had been bought with drug money.Thanong, a member of the opposition 
Chart Thai party, was secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in San 
Francisco in November, 1991, on charges of smuggling, conspiracy and operating 
a continuing criminal enterprise from 1973 to 1987. Each charge is punishable 
by 10 years to life in prison and a $4-million fine. The chief prosecutor in 
the case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Scoble, said at least 10 major drug 
defendants have been convicted of charges related to Thanong's activities.

CORRUPTION PROBE TARGETS BAJA'S EX-ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mexican federal investigators probing alleged corruption at the highest levels 
of law enforcement in state government interrogated the former attorney general 
of Baja California and a state police commander Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense questioning began Monday night at the headquarters of the federal 
judicial police, continued past dawn Tuesday and then resumed later in the day, 
authorities said. Although law enforcement officials on both sides of the 
border said arrests appeared imminent, the two men were not taken into custody, 
according to a spokesman for the Mexican federal attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal police have targeted a network of officials they suspect of protecting 
the Arellano drug cartel. The main suspect appears to be Juan Francisco Franco 
Rios, the former attorney general who stepped down last month. They also 
questioned state Police Cmdr. Jorge Alvarez Barriere. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic arrest last week of the state's deputy attorney general resulted 
in a confrontation between state police and a heavily armed contingent of 100 
federal officers. The deputy attorney general was charged with aiding the 
escape of cartel gunmen after five men died in a March 3 shootout between 
federal agents and state police allegedly working for traffickers. He pleaded 
innocent and told reporters that investigators pressured him to implicate 
Franco, the former attorney general, in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's interrogation, Franco was questioned about a 1992 incident in 
which Baja police credentials were found on slain Arellano gangsters after a 
gunfight in a Puerto Vallarta discotheque, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco says he did not supply the credentials and that someone forged his 
signature on the identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also interrogated Alvarez -- who was temporarily replaced as the 
commander of the state judicial police in Tijuana on Monday -- about the 
chaotic March shootout. They are expected to scrutinize at least five more 
commanders who were charged in the shootout but cleared by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who told reporters that he has nothing to hide, was scheduled to 
return for further questioning Tuesday at 5 p.m. Franco's interrogation will 
resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has been criticized as politically motivated in Baja 
California, a state run by a conservative party opposed to the ruling party in 
Mexico City. It comes amid growing tension caused by the politically charged 
assassinations of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and of Tijuana's 
police chief. Critics have accused the federal government of using the Baja 
crackdown to divert attention from the two unsolved slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel said Tuesday that he would meet today with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari to discuss crime and state-federal relations.

BREYER JOINS BABBITT, ARNOLD ON CLINTON'S SHORT COURT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Judge Stephen G. Breyer, a top candidate in President Clinton's last 
search for a Supreme Court justice, suddenly has joined U.S. Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt and Judge Richard S. Arnold on the short White House list of 
candidates to replace Justice Harry A. Blackmun, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, an erudite appeals court judge with support from both parties, has 
risen in the search amid predictions that President Clinton will announce his 
choice this week. Federal District Judge Jose A. Cabranes and federal appeals 
Judge Amalya Kearse of New York are also said to be in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and top White House officials met Tuesday afternoon to talk further 
about the candidates. But the meeting broke up without a decision, officials 
said, and Clinton headed off to play golf on a balmy spring afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision "may hit him on the 16th fairway," said one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, who sits on the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, has been 
touted by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and also has strong support from 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking minority member of the Judiciary 
Committee. In recent days, Hatch has warned the White House that fears Babbitt 
would be a judicial activist could crystallize opposition in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's selection would win Clinton high marks from the legal community and 
would ensure Clinton of a smooth nomination proceeding in the Senate. But 
Breyer is not the political figure of broad experience that Clinton has said he 
would like. Breyer's nomination also would disappoint those who want another 
member of a minority group on the court and would make it more difficult for 
Clinton to name a white male later if he gets another court appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Arnold were alarmed Tuesday by a news report that White House 
officials had become concerned that Arnold's investments and aspects of his 
personal life could complicate his possible nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pure hatchetry," one supporter said. Said another, Washington lawyer 
Steven M. Umin: "You couldn't find a cleaner whistle" than Arnold. 
</P>

O.C POP MUSIC REVIEW ; PAM TILLIS: LIVING UP TO THE PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pam Tillis emerged in 1991 with all the predictable prerequisites for modern 
country stardom. She had the capable but indistinctive voice so typical of the 
new generation, video-ready good looks, a satchel of mainstream songs and a 
famous last name in an industry that never begrudges a good bloodline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is year No. 3," the singer crowed in her early show Monday at the Crazy 
Horse Steak House, "and we're still out there making records and having hits. 
It's amazing -- I've still got a job!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, her performance showed she has grown to fill that job 
remarkably well. The bit of spunk that was hinted at in her singing three years 
ago has blossomed, so that she now spices up a novelty lyric with the sass of a 
mid-career Dolly Parton, and her serious singing has become a thing of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 14-song set, she was often able to make even microwaved Nashville fare 
seem like home cooking. She took the hackneyed "Do You Know Where Your Man Is" 
(as in "It's 10 O'Clock, do you know where . . . ") and dragged it into serious 
Tammy Wynette country with a vocal that seemed heartfelt, if acknowledgedly 
indebted to Wynette in its phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tillis made a passing mention of her famous father, Mel, and her Cherokee 
mother, but didn't milk either connection. Saying how much she loves singing, 
she did note: "I never wanted to do anything else. Some people got a hardware 
store. I got a microphone." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent personnel changes, her six-piece Mystic Biscuits band provided 
a spirited, responsive backing to Tillis' vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs ranged from her early hits, such as "Don't Tell Me What to Do," 
"Maybe It Was Memphis" and the bluesy "Draggin' My Chains"; through her 
sophomore 1992 "Homeward Looking Angel" album, with the feisty "Shake the Sugar 
Tree," "Let That Pony Run" and "Cleopatra: Queen of Denial"; up to her current 
"Sweetheart's Dance" album and even beyond it with an unrecorded new tune, 
"Tequila Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
 She used that song to inaugurate an "unplugged" portion of her show. While the 
tune is the sort of fluff the title suggests, the acoustic setting was ideal 
for her voice, which proved to have far more nuance and character than her 
typical belting allows to shine through. 
</P>
<P>
 The softer approach laid out equally fertile territory for her band members. 
Former Vince Gill singer-fiddler-guitarist Andrea Zonn offered an eloquent, 
intimate fiddle solo that rose above the song's pun-happy lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A far better marriage of song and setting came with the following number, 
"Melancholy Child," which Tillis wrote with her husband, Bob DiPiero. It was 
nearly acoustic, with only the bass going electric, and given a minor-key Irish 
waft colored by pedal steel player Brook Langston's switch to mandolin. 
</P>
<P>
 It clearly is a personal lyric, telling of a young mother, a father on the 
road and a child with "a black Irish temper and some solemn Cherokee," and 
Tillis sang it as such, with a sad ache and a dollop of hope. If more of her 
performance could connect with the emotion she found here, Tillis would be in a 
class with Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as she's grown in three years, there were few other moments Monday to 
hit near that mark. The hit "Spilled Perfume" certainly didn't. Her current 
cover of Jackie DeShannon's "When You Walk in the Room" was surprisingly 
lacking in the urgency DeShannon, the Searchers, Bruce Springsteen and others 
have brought to the tune.

THEATER REVIEWS; ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF A 'KING'; FLOWING, COLORFUL COSTUMES AND 
EXOTIC SETS TAKE CENTER STAGE IN YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Aniceto, who plays the Siamese ruler in the Yorba Linda Civic Light 
Opera's "The King and I," is pretty good at the old huff-and-puff. His monarch 
is an oversized kid stuck in a tantrum -- he bellows and bellows, but we don't 
mind because he's so unaware of his own arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Art-Deco-meets-Oriental-spice set and the colorful-as-a-bazaar 
costumes (both of which go uncredited), Aniceto is the most interesting feature 
of this show. He's not a riveting vocalist, but he does try to charm us with 
the king's harmless conceit. More important, Aniceto works to keep everything 
moving along. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, even Aniceto's performance isn't rousing enough. The Larry 
Watts-directed production is dawdling and marked more by lost opportunities 
than anything else. This "The King and I" is a slow boat to Siam. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of the king's huge brood in the first act is telling. The 
scene can be a whimsical treat of fatherly pride and youthful posturing as each 
child is paraded before Anna, the Brit brought over to teach them English. But 
at Yorba Linda, there's not much fun in the long procession. The kids look 
cute, but they don't register beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is the lack of a connection, romantic or otherwise, 
between the king and Anna. When one of the king's wives notes fairly early on 
that they need each other, we wonder where that came from; they seem more like 
employer and employee than reticent sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a debilitating flaw; even Yul Brynner, who all but created the 
role, didn't pay much attention to Anna, whether on Broadway or in the 1956 
movie. But a more vivid bonding would help raise the tempo in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Anna, Margaret Tolberg is sweet and properly anglicized, but her voice 
could be larger, more resourceful. She's entrusted with many of the signature 
tunes in Rodgers and Hammerstein's score ("Hello Young Lovers," "Getting to 
Know You") but only gives a serviceable accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there's little exceptional singing throughout the cast, although 
Vince Aniceto as Lun Tha offers a tender rendition of "We Kiss in the Shadows" 
in his duet with Adriana Sanchez as Tuptim. It's Sanchez's strongest moment, 
too, much better than her introduction with "My Lord and Master." 
</P>
<P>
 The visuals, however, are noteworthy, especially by community-theater 
standards. Most of the action takes place in the king's throne room, an 
environment rich in gold-hued, geometric details. The flowing costumes are a 
satisfying complement to this exotic setting.

THEATER REVIEWS; MURDER AND MUSIC ARE ALSO 'AFOOT'; PLACING THE WITTY, 
CHRISTIE-ESQUE WHODUNIT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LONDON BLITZ MAKES A NICE POINT 
ABOUT SURVIVAL AND THE VALUE OF ENTERTAINMENT AS ESCAPISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As almost everyone knows, it's not enough to do a whodunit anymore. There has 
to be a why along with a who . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its purely unaffected entertainment value, "Something's Afoot," a 
musical-ized amalgam of Agatha Christie plots at Rancho Santiago College, isn't 
content with being a singing Christie-gram. 
</P>
<P>
 In its own modest way, it's about survival and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the best irony in the book by James McDonald, David Vos and Robert 
Gerlach (who also wrote the music and lyrics, with added music care of Ed 
Linderman) is that while death is more or less universal in the play, the world 
of the British music hall that frames the whodunit carries on. 
</P>
<P>
 We like to see rich people get knocked off in a mansion but don't like the 
idea of Nazi warplanes blitzing London and its theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-act tune "You Fell Out of the Sky" isn't about the destruction that 
may or may not be coming down on the music hall, but a ballad, weakly warbled 
by Lisa Hallsted as the young love interest, Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The connections between the war and the escapist fare remain fairly subtle 
(especially by brawling music-hall standards), but they make the point about 
how escapism has a real value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which, in another irony, makes "Something's Afoot" more than just escapist 
fare. Just as the plot is heating up with guests at Lord Dudley Rancour's Lake 
District estate being knocked off one by one like 10 little Indians, the 
air-raid alarm erupts, bombs erupt and the lights momentarily dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Then stalwart company leader Cathy Newman takes command and leads her 
comrades, and the audience, in the wartime morale-booster "The White Cliffs of 
Dover." So this is how the Brits got through. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Harwood, to mention one, has dealt with this world before in his fine 
play, "The Dresser," but there's something special about watching Newman hold 
the reins of the theater and the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Chuck Ketter also plays the music-hall manager (and the butler), but 
Newman's the boss as amateur detective Miss Tweed, the human Rock of Gibraltar. 
She's also a loony cut-up who can kick up her heels while booming out the 
score's more charming tunes, including the title number, "Carry On" and the 
frolicsome tribute to dear Agatha herself, "I Owe It All." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Newman's young cast members struggle visibly to keep up. 
Although they have moments to shine, Hallsted, Melinda Avent as Lady Grace 
Manley-Prowe, Arme Caballero as the maid, Jon Breeden as Hope's new love 
Geoffrey and Randy Rock as the "dissolute cousin" Nigel lack the musical comedy 
tools to take real advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But -- as always with students-in-training -- patience, patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brand keeps a firmer hold on his rascally seeming caretaker Flint, and 
Ketter is all proper business as the butler. Michael Allen serves up good camp 
as the stern Dr. Grayburn, and James Rice's Col. Gillweather appears to have 
popped right out of a Rudyard Kipling tome. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all having fun, but probably not as much as set designer Ketter and 
lighting designer D. Silvio Volonte. They have arranged a house of lightning 
and electrical fires, traps and falling chandeliers, all of which may be too 
elaborate for a wartime music hall but which deliver the goods nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Return to your seats well before intermission ends to get a taste of the 
music-hall atmosphere, including a mini-show of period songs with help from 
musical director Michael MacMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 If it worked during the London Blitz, it might work during a recession.

 Heavy clouds filling the Tuesday morning sky dashed the hopes of most Orange 
County amateur skywatchers who dragged out special-filter telescopes and 
protective welder's glasses to glimpse a rare partial solar eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky darkened for about 20 minutes just after 9 a.m., when, somewhere above 
the murky clouds, the moon was covering about 73% of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really bums me out," said 21-year-old Lisa Rosas, a student in an 
introductory astronomy course at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, who 
waited in vain for the clouds to part. "I've never seen an eclipse before." 
</P>
<P>
 Her instructor, Steve Eastmond, had promised his students extra credit for 
rolling out of bed early to look at the eclipse through a telescope near the 
college's Tessman Planetarium. The overcast skies forced him to cancel plans 
for the telescope, but the 20 or more depressed, budding astronomers who showed 
up still got a couple extra-credit points. 
</P>
<P>
 But astronomy students at Cal State Fullerton fared a bit better, getting a 
decent, though quick, look at the natural phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very nice here," said Cal State Fullerton staff physicist Jeff Cady, 
who set up telescopes for about 40 students who caught glimpses of the moon's 
slow slide in front of the sun. "The cloud cover was just enough to block out a 
lot of the bright light and yet still have it visible." 
</P>
<P>
 At the nearby Southern California College of Optometry, Bob Gill, a past 
president of the Orange County Astronomers, attempted to videotape the eclipse 
to help teach students about the harmful effects the sun's rays can have if 
someone looks directly at the sun during an eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't tape very well because it kept coming in and out, but it was 
interesting," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Orange County's true astronomy buffs had headed out to New Mexico and 
Texas to be closer to the eclipse's path of annularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In an annular eclipse, only part of the sun is covered by the moon. In a total 
eclipse, the moon blots out the entire sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the 150-mile-wide path of annularity, which stretched from southeastern 
Arizona to southeastern Maine, the moon covered the entire center of the sun, 
leaving visible only a breathtaking "ring of fire" but not completely blocking 
out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 schoolchildren and 200 adults at the Griffith Observatory above 
Hollywood in Los Angeles had to be quick to see anything when drifting clouds 
made the eclipse suddenly appear -- and then just as suddenly fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It popped through the clouds a few times," said Bob Kline, 39, a graphic 
artist from Huntington Beach who had attached a camcorder to a telephoto lens, 
hoping to record the eclipse. "But I certainly didn't run out of videotape -- I 
guess that's the bright side." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith Observatory astronomer Patrick So stood holding a pair of king-size 
binoculars attached to a cone-like device designed to project the eclipse on a 
small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was crystal-clear in Lancaster, where he lives, So explained. In fact, 
clouds didn't appear until he drove into Los Angeles shortly after dawn. He was 
tempted to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 "But duty called, and I came here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eclipses can be a hit-or-miss thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa eclipse buff Jeff Sloan had to settle for no eclipse at all. He 
stood in his driveway for about half an hour, wishing the weather was like it 
had been the day before. But it was not meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit disappointed and I'm a little bit not," Sloan said. "I 
didn't put in a lot of plans like I have for other eclipses. It would have been 
nice to have 80% coverage right over home to get a better show. But I've seen 
better, and I'll just wait for the next opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Pate, the tutor for Eastmond's astronomy classes at Rancho Santiago 
College, waxed sanguine about the eclipse flop. "But we have to be pragmatic 
about it. The weather can be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 While Eastmond sat inside the planetarium grading papers during the time he 
had expected to be "oohing" and "aahing" about the moon's movement, Pate 
thought to get the best view of the eclipse around -- the one from CNN cameras 
stationed in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 And just hours after the morning's disappointment, Eastmond was already making 
plans for viewing a partial lunar eclipse on May 24, and for the next partial 
solar eclipse to be visible in Southern California -- in the year 2000.

O.C. LEGISLATORS RAISE THEIR GUARD IN PAY HIKE REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 After nurturing their image as tax-fighting, anti-spending conservative 
Republicans, state legislators from Orange County have muddled their message 
with a decidedly mixed reaction to a state commission's ruling to boost their 
pay by 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the reluctance of some local legislators to reject the pay raise has been 
taken up as an issue by other Republicans seeking election to open Assembly 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to quickly establish their own records on the controversial pay raise, 
two local Assembly candidates issued statements that if elected they would 
reject the pay hike. A third candidate said he would donate it to charity until 
the state's unemployment rate drops. 
</P>
<P>
 The salaries for state legislators will go up in December from $52,500 to 
$72,000 a year, following approval last week by the California Citizens 
Compensation Commission, which was created by the passage of Proposition 112, a 
reform measure, in 1990. The legislators also receive an annual expense 
allowance totaling about $21,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting for the pay hike, the commission compared legislators' salaries to 
those of other state officials and judges, who receive more. The commission 
also noted the pay increase was needed to attract qualified candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pay raise approval created a firestorm of controversy across the 
state. In Orange County, some legislative offices said they had received far 
more than their usual number of telephone calls, mostly in opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, only state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) said he will 
either refuse the increased salary or donate it to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Local legislators who support the pay hike include Assemblymen Mickey Conroy 
(R-Orange), Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson is leaving the Assembly to run for the state Senate seat being 
vacated by Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is running for the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors. Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) also is 
leaving to run for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange), long numbered among the county delegation's most 
stubborn tax fighters and budget cutters, is "undecided at this time" whether 
he will except or reject the pay raise, said Christopher Jones, his chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a more telling sign of the issue's sensitivity is the reluctance of 
some legislators to publicly state a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) didn't even particularly want to talk 
about the salary hike. Asked what he thought about the issue, Johnson replied: 
"I have no opinion I care to express." Asked if he would take the pay raise, 
Johnson replied: "I think I expressed myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who favor the higher pay said that if they did not take the money, it 
would be spent elsewhere -- probably by the Democratic leadership -- because 
the amount set aside for the Legislature is established by law. Also, lawmakers 
would be taxed on the higher salary even if they returned it or donated it to 
charity, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could mean (the Democratic leadership) would be hiring more Democratic 
staff up here," Morrow said, adding that they could spend the excess funds 
however they wish. "That's the last thing I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, Conroy and Ferguson also maintained that the financial strain created 
by legislative duty prevents good candidates from seeking office. Younger 
lawmakers with families and living away from home much of the time need the 
financial help, Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have argued differently earlier in my life. But I've come to realize 
that many people who come to Sacramento have sacrificed a great deal and 
basically have a hard time making ends meet on fifty-two five," Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that some Capitol staff members make much more than lawmakers, 
even after this raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the press was fair," Conroy said, "they could reach over and show a whole 
bunch of people in government who are making a whole lot more for doing a whole 
lot less." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said many city managers and Orange County supervisors still will make 
more than state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in government for 35 years and I have never run into a time that 
people did not complain about a pay raise," Craven said. "I am happy to have 
it, and I am most appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ferguson has no argument with the increased pay, he conceded it was bad 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This recession is so deep, this is the wrong message to send the public," he 
said. "People don't think the Legislature has done enough to get the state out 
of this recession and that a raise isn't deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pringle said he was shocked by the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The salary commission was set up by the people to make sure legislators don't 
set their own rate of pay. We have no input in the process. Whatever the salary 
rate is set at is what we'll get paid," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, who owns a manufacturing plant that grosses in excess of $20 million a 
year, "feels that, considering the lousy shape they've left California in, no 
one in the Legislature deserves a pay raise," said Joe Yocca, his chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue flared up in the Republican contest for 69th Assembly race, where 
candidate Martin Ageson of Santa Ana, who said he would reject it, criticized 
Conroy for accepting the raise. Conroy has endorsed Anaheim businessman Jim 
Morrissey in that race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's obscene for a state legislator to claim that they have done such 
a good job that they are entitled to a pay raise," Ageson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey pledged to donate the extra pay to charity until the state's 
unemployment rate drops from the current level of 9.6% to 5.5%. A campaign 
spokesman said Morrissey is not criticizing Conroy's decision because Morrissey 
believes the issue is one of "personal choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Marilyn Brewer, a Republican candidate in the 70th Assembly 
District, said she would refuse the salary increase, because "even in normal 
times, a salary increase of this magnitude is not something that I would ever 
accept."

NATURE OFFERS LITTLE HELP IN SEEING ECLIPSE; ASTRONOMY: HAZE FAILS TO FRUSTRATE 
VIEW FROM CSUN SOLAR OBSERVATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A blanket of haze Tuesday mocked eclipse watchers, who found that their 
telescopes and pinhole contraptions were of little help in viewing what 
astronomers said would be the area's last visible solar eclipse this century. 
</P>
<P>
 So while most of the San Fernando Valley had trouble even telling in which 
direction the sun was shining, a small group of would-be astronomers gathered 
at Cal State Northridge's solar observatory in Sylmar that sank three inches 
during the Jan. 17 quake, rendering its two largest telescopes inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 Using two refracting telescopes mounted with cameras and a 3-inch Cartesian 
full-disc telescope, astronomy professor Stephen Walton and a handful of 
students and technicians who had seen many eclipses quietly watched as maximum 
eclipse was reached at 9 a.m., when 72% of the surface was obscured by the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nice," astrophysics student Chris Mach, 25, of Los Angeles remarked 
dispassionately as he photographed one of the sun's prominences: eruptions of 
gaseous material that can stretch hundreds of thousands of miles above the 
sun's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's research helped them test the accuracy of the telescopes in 
measuring sunspots, areas of intense magnetic activity on the sun's surface 
that Walton said may be associated with changing weather patterns on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-experts among the observers just wanted to know what they were seeing. 
"So that big, round black thing . . . that's the moon right there?" asked a 
Department of Water and Power worker who spent his coffee break observing the 
eclipse through one of the small telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on the CSUN campus, some were hardly interested at all. "It comes 
on TV and that's safer anyway," said Dalila Valenzuela, 20, sitting on a 
fog-shrouded patio outside the campus bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't see it anyway, so why bother?" said student Jim Marshall, who dozed 
in his car during the apex of the eclipse, while waiting for his class to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say it wasn't Los Angeles but El Paso, Tex., that should have been 
one of the nation's stellar viewing locations Tuesday. It is within a 150-mile 
band stretching from Baja California to New England where the moon blotted out 
all but the sun's fiery rim. 
</P>
<P>
 But visible locally or not, the eclipse was loaded with significance for 
Valley astrologers, who said 20% of it was located in the constellation Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a fiery new beginning," said Helene Cushman, a Tarzana 
astrologer whose telephone directory ad lists her as a consultant, teacher and 
lecturer on the subject for 25 years. "There should be more energy associated 
with this one . . . more people starting new businesses. It should be positive 
for people who know how to harness that energy, but for those who can't control 
their tempers or who drive too fast, it could be negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Whitaker, who has been practicing astrology for 20 years in Canoga 
Park, said that while lunar eclipses are symbolic of dying and diminishing, 
solar eclipses bring with them periods of increasing or adding. But that is not 
always positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eclipses do set things in motion," she said. "People get a little antsy. The 
last (solar eclipse, in 1993) was partly responsible for the (Northridge) 
earthquake, but this one is going to be a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 At Chaminade High School in West Hills, science teacher Dave Reeves and about 
100 students battled the gloom with reflecting telescopes and telescopes 
mounted with cameras for about an hour before finally giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty good until the cloud came by," said Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, a few of his students even moved on to Simi Valley in search of 
sunnier skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloudless blue skies in the Antelope Valley created some of the best viewing 
conditions in Southern California, but that didn't mean everyone in the high 
desert was consumed by the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed it," said Palmdale resident Paul Heindel. "I was in a meeting, I 
think. I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Heindel said he did not make a point of seeing the eclipse because "I've seen 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster, several employees did venture 
outside to watch the sun all but disappear in the shadow of the moon. But not 
all of them actually got a chance to witness the celestial event. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Manager Bruce Latta said, "I went outside and stood under a tree and 
talked to someone and never looked up. I didn't have anything to look through." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center didn't have to worry about 
protecting their eyes with welder's goggles or other filters because the 
eclipse was carried on the space agency's in-house television system, NASA TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameras in five locations across the country -- including the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida -- provided views of the eclipse to NASA employees and 
anyone with a satellite able to pick up NASA TV. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Griffith Observatory, a traditional Los Angeles gathering spot for 
observing astronomical phenomena, eye protection was also the furthest thing 
from the minds of the 800 or so who showed up to view the eclipse. Solar 
sunglass salesman Roger Harrison of Glendora said he had sold fewer than 30 of 
his $4 smoky lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 When told that the next solar eclipse would not be visible in the United 
States until 2012, he promised, "I'll be back."

KEVORKIAN CLOSER TO LOSING STATE LICENSE; COURT: HE FAILED TO APPEAR BEFORE 
JUDGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSISTED SUICIDES OF A COSTA MESA MAN AND SAN 
DIEGO WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Kevorkian moved closer Tuesday to having his California medical 
license revoked when he failed to appear at a hearing before an administrative 
law judge here in connection with the assisted suicides of a Costa Mesa man and 
a woman from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 By not attending or sending a lawyer to represent him, Kevorkian defaulted on 
keeping his license, which state officials suspended in April, 1993. Judge 
Joyce Wharton forwarded the matter to the Medical Board of California, which is 
expected to revoke the license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect of this litigation is to reduce Jack Kevorkian to Mr. Kevorkian," 
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas Lazar, who represented the state at Tuesday's 
hearing. "He's essentially been kicked out of the world of medicine. In any 
future litigation, he won't be able to say, 'This was my patient.' He's not 
licensed to practice medicine anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, Dixon Arnett, executive director of the medical board, 
announced his intention to have the license revoked, expressing concern that 
Kevorkian had begun to "recruit" Californians who might desire his help in 
committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett asked the judge to begin the proceedings after Kevorkian helped the two 
Southern Californians die. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 65, dubbed "Dr. Death" for having assisted in 20 suicides, obtained 
a California medical license in 1957 and worked from 1979 to 1982 at two 
hospitals in Long Beach. He lives in Troy, Mich., near where each of the 
suicides has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and his Michigan-based 
attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, declined to comment. But last year, when California 
suspended Kevorkian's license, Fieger said the retired pathologist had no 
intention of appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials presented evidence Tuesday showing that Kevorkian had assisted 
in the suicides of a Costa Mesa man -- whose best friend argued that he was 
merely depressed over the death of his mother and not seriously ill -- and a 
San Diego woman suffering from terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathon Grenz got cancer in 1992, causing doctors to remove his voice box and 
tongue. But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian's help, he had 
recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the loss of his mother, 
according to the court testimony of Newport Beach real estate agent Linda 
Healy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death early last year at age 44, Grenz was "depressed from 
his surgery, overwhelmed with grief over the loss of his mother and was never 
given the opportunity to grieve over his losses," testified Healy, who had 
worked with Grenz at an Orange County real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Ruwart, 40, of San Diego, whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small 
intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors, died in a Waterford, Mich., home in 
1993 with Kevorkian by her side. It was Ruwart's death that prompted the 
Michigan legislature to pass a law banning assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, who assisted in five suicides after Ruwart's, was recently 
acquitted of having violated Michigan's law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Michigan Court of Appeals on Tuesday ordered murder charges 
reinstated against Kevorkian in connection with his role the 1991 deaths of two 
women and also overturned the state law designed to stop Kevorkian's practice 
of assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan, the only other state in which Kevorkian has ever practiced medicine, 
suspended his license in 1991. But the license has yet to be revoked in 
Michigan, where Kevorkian's attorneys continue to argue that being prevented 
from assisting in suicides would violate his constitutional liberties.

NOVEL STUNTS; MANY PRINCIPALS RESORT TO SILLINESS TO SELL STUDENTS ON READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Call them the Almost-Ready-for-Prime-Time Principals. 
</P>
<P>
 They've come to school dressed as hot dogs, bears, ballerinas, raisins, 
alligators and Hershey Kisses. They've climbed roofs, milked cows, smooched 
frogs, kissed pigs and shaved their heads -- all in the name of education. 
</P>
<P>
 And they've eaten worms -- fried, microwaved, cooked in omelets -- to 
encourage their students to be, you guessed it, bookworms. Last month, in front 
of gaping, gasping students, Colfax Avenue Elementary School Principal Shirley 
DiRado ate three mealworms -- live, wriggling mealworms. 
</P>
<P>
 In challenging their students to crack open books, school administrators 
across the country have increasingly turned to stunts worthy of "Saturday Night 
Live" or David Letterman's Stupid Human Tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the bear costumes are shed and the smudges left by a pig snout wiped 
away, do the students continue to read? Or do they shut the books until the 
next stunt? 
</P>
<P>
 "After the worm is swallowed and after the contest is over, the kids probably 
go back to watching television," said Myron H. Dembo, professor of educational 
psychology at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Dembo and some other educators consider the hype and excitement that often 
surround such challenges no substitute for a year-round emphasis on reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cute, but it's not necessary," Dembo said. "If that's all it took to get 
kids to read, my God, I'd get every teacher on a roof." 
</P>
<P>
 But educators who use stunts to challenge students to meet a reading quota -- 
a certain number of books, pages or hours spent reading -- say at least it's a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the couple that really enjoyed the book and got another one?" 
DiRado said. "If you open doors with students and present learning as a 
wonderful thing instead of a boring, horrible thing, then you're ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 J. P. Roberts, a Colorado special reading teacher, cajoled her principal into 
wearing a monkey costume and reading Curious George books to the school's 
children. "Through this promotion to get children to read, there's a good 
chance they will come across something that will touch their heart. If they 
don't read, there's not a chance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fraternity of educators willing to reach for the ridiculous in the name of 
education has burgeoned in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me it's picking up a lot now in the last three or four years," 
said Julie Million, spokeswoman for the National Assn. of Elementary School 
Principals. "There's a lot of pig kissing." 
</P>
<P>
 Roof-sitting once reached epidemic proportions, with principals climbing up 
ladders while dressed as bears, gorillas and chimney sweeps. A Santa Ana 
principal climbed to the roof in a clown costume when her students read 1 
million pages. 
</P>
<P>
 But now any educator worth his or her stunt knows that roof-sitting is passe. 
The cutting edge is far more ludicrous. In Michigan, a principal dressed as an 
alligator and rode her bicycle to school. Another flew over his school in a hot 
air balloon for a "Sky High with Reading" promotion. Yet another skated on 
roller blades while dressed as a piece of candy.

<P>
 Richard Lioy of Beachy Avenue Elementary School in Arleta let a teacher give 
him a crew cut in June. This year, if enough students read two books in a 
summer reading campaign, they will turn him into a human ice cream sundae -- 
covering him with ice cream, hot fudge and cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out of ideas for next year," complained one principal. "Do you have any 
suggestions?" 
</P>
<P>
 DiRado is the latest inductee into this frog-kissing, fake fur-wearing 
fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal of the North Hollywood school made international news -- she was 
interviewed by South African radio -- with her worm-eating reward for students 
who had read at least two books in the school's Read-a-Thon. 
</P>
<P>
 With each swallow, DiRado sealed her fate. Though she's been in education 
since 1958, "I'll go down in history as the worm principal." 
</P>
<P>
 But her plan to lure students out of their apathy and away from their 
television sets apparently worked. The number of students participating in the 
Read-a-Thon doubled to about 350. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got kids to read who normally wouldn't be interested," DiRado said. 
"Parents were calling and saying, 'I can't believe it. They want to read.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Cerny, a sixth-grader from North Hollywood, was an avid reader well 
before DiRado pledged to eat a worm. He read 26 books in the Read-a-Thon. But 
the 12-year-old was nevertheless impressed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It showed how dedicated she was to the school. She was willing to donate her 
time and her stomach to make sure kids get a good education." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel said his classmates, every one of whom read enough books to earn 
tickets to the worm-eating assembly, now share his enthusiasm. Many students 
who would read Mickey Mouse books during silent reading time are now choosing 
books like Madeleine L'Engle's "A Wrinkle in Time." 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to read to see it and now they see reading can be fun, too," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Loveman, a fourth-grader from Studio City, thought DiRado's trick was 
disgusting, but an interesting tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was pretty different," said Jessica, who read 20 books for the 
Read-a-Thon. "Because, what other principal would eat a worm?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though the stunt was a success, DiRado said no more worms will pass the lips 
of this former science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no plans. No crazy extravaganzas," she said. "I'm not going to do this 
every year." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some educators, each year brings a new challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year I was really groping. I was running dry of ideas," said Bob 
Ziegler, a principal in New Hope, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler has milked a cow in the New Hope Elementary School gymnasium. He even 
challenged the state's commissioner of education to a milking contest. Big 
mistake. The commissioner had grown up on a farm. Ziegler grew up in Milwaukee. 
Ziegler lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler has eaten his hat -- a gingerbread hat that he swears was drier and 
less tasty than the real thing would have been -- he's been sawed in half by a 
magician, has filled in for the local television weatherman and has kissed a 
pig.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm stuck. I don't know what to do next year," he said. "I'm thinking 
about doing something with a boa constrictor, maybe walking around the hall 
with him wrapped around me. But I don't know how heavy they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing trend concerns some educational experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a lousy idea," said Julia Palmer, a New York educational 
consultant who founded the American Reading Council, which disbanded in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "This assumption that you have to put on high jinks or give them free 
doughnuts in order to get them to read gives them all the wrong reasons. It 
teaches them that reading is something you have to be lured to do," Palmer 
said. "You don't do things like that to get kids to play Nintendo." 
</P>
<P>
 The stunts might not be harmful, educators argue, but unless they are combined 
with an intensive reading program, they aren't worth the time it takes to plan 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conventional methods of teaching reading haven't really panned out that well 
and they're trying something new. But there are lots of better things to try," 
said M. C. Wittrock, chairman of the Division of Educational Psychology at 
UCLA's Graduate School of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing comprehension instead of the number of books read, and setting up 
classroom projects about the books will foster a long-term interest, educators 
say. And the choice of reading material is paramount. The way to get children 
hooked on reading is to have them read about things that are familiar or 
interesting to them, educators say.  
</P>
<P>
 If a child who likes to fish reads a book on fishing, he will learn that 
reading is more than just an exercise, that he can get something out of it, 
Wittrock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns them on and they get interested in it and they're ready to read 
something else," Wittrock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals, many of whom say the stunts are part of a larger reading focus, 
agree that getting children to read for the sake of reading is the objective. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler, the Minnesota principal who milked a cow, said that since he came to 
the school in 1986, the circulation in the media center has shown a marked 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard from kids and parents saying that had it not been for that 
reading contest, they wouldn't be reading as much as they are now," he said. 
"It is hokey and it doesn't work for everybody. But it works for some." 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's society they need to know somebody's willing to do something 
ridiculous for them," said DiRado of North Hollywood. "I cared enough to eat a 
worm." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Millen, principal of Pearblossom Elementary School in the Antelope 
Valley, cared enough to be a pie-throwing target, to kiss a frog and to rub 
noses with not one, but two, pigs. She even talked a vice principal into acting 
as a ventriloquist's dummy. 
</P>
<P>
 But how far will Millen go to encourage her students to read? Not as far as 
they'd like. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of smart alecks suggested she swallow a goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not until I check with my doctor," she told them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more she thought, the less appealing it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goldfish has been ruled out for health reasons -- mine and the fish's," 
she said, adding a few more conditions. "I don't want this to be permanently 
damaging. I don't do snakes, and I don't do bungee jumping."

MEMORIES HAUNT WIDOW AFTER APARTMENT COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL and KAY HWANGBO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hyun Sook Lee couldn't sleep again Saturday night, after searching all day for 
mementos in the ruins of Apartment 101 at Northridge Meadows, where the 
collapsing walls and ceiling crushed her husband and teen-age son during the 
Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am never going there again," Lee, 43, said Tuesday, as she and her lawyers 
filed the seventh wrongful death lawsuit against the builder and owner of 
Northridge Meadows. Like the other lawsuits, it alleges that construction flaws 
contributed to the collapse, which killed Lee's husband, Pil, a Korean-educated 
engineer who worked as an RTD mechanic, and their son, Howard, a student who 
aspired to be a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 She was able to retrieve some photographs Saturday, along with a video and a 
battered Asian chest. Her wedding ring was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 She considers the ring gone, like the life she had built with husband Pil, 
whom everyone knew as James. The Lees had weathered hardship before, moving to 
Northridge Meadows in 1993 when they lost their spacious Valley home after the 
family's restaurant business failed. As long as they were together, the Lees 
endured. But the quake shattered even that modest life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost everything in one second," she said. "We lost the head of our family 
and the big son. We only have the small son." 
</P>
<P>
 She is fatalistic about the future, and although she maintains her composure, 
the quiver in her chin reveals that tears are never far from the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can build up the same life as before," Lee said. "Once it's gone, it's 
gone. It's gone for good." 
</P>
<P>
 But the horrible memories stay, especially at night, when sleep still won't 
come. Then she remembers her panic and confusion as she recited Hail Marys in 
the darkened cave that had been their apartment, waiting for help to come. 
</P>
<P>
 After praying with son Jason, 12, on Tuesday morning, Lee dressed in a 
business suit and accompanied lawyers to file legal papers at the San Fernando 
Superior Court clerk's office, itself displaced by the quake to Van Nuys. Her 
lawyer, William J. Downey III, also filed nearly identical lawsuits for the 
families of two other Northridge Meadows victims, Darla Enos and Ruth Wilhelm. 
</P>
<P>
 Families of seven of the 16 people who died at Northridge Meadows have sued, 
and more lawsuits are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a nurse, said her lawsuit "is not about greed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people have to stand up for their rights," she said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyers, Downey and Myron M. Kim, said the suit seeks unspecified monetary 
damages to provide for Jason's education and allow the Lees to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been relying on the charity of friends and members of their church 
to scrape by, and that's not something that a proud family like the Lees wants 
to continue," Downey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee said her greatest worry is for Jason. "He's very quiet," she said, adding 
that he often prays and talks to a priest from their church. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she doesn't know where she belongs, or what she will do. She is a 
woman without a husband or a home, caught between two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 She felt uncomfortable during a recent trip to her Korean homeland, where 
widows often do not remarry. Yet she doesn't feel completely at ease in her 
adopted country, where she has lost everything except her faith and her younger 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, at least, mother and son have fallen into a routine. They pray together 
every morning and evening, for the lost father and son, hoping their souls are 
happy and at peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors recently removed a cast from Jason's right leg, which was pinned by 
rubble. He finally walks without crutches. They are planning to move at the end 
of the month to a house near Jason's school, affiliated with St. Bridget of 
Sweden Church in Van Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 Every day after Lee drops Jason at school, she attends an 8 a.m. Catholic 
Mass. She spends the day at the library, reading novels and religious books to 
improve her English. Lee, a nurse, has not worked since the earthquake. She 
plans to return in September to her job at the Jewish Home for the Aged, a 
Reseda convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past 2 1/2 years, Korean Americans have suffered a series of 
disasters," lawyer Myron Kim said. "None have suffered as much as Mrs. Lee, 
losing two family members. She in effect lost her American dream."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; MIDDLE SCHOOL OKS OPTIONAL UNIFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to curb student affinity for high-priced fashion trends and 
foster school spirit, Richard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley has joined 
the growing ranks of public schools to adopt an optional uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can minimize the cost of wardrobing youngsters and stress school 
spirit and self-esteem at the same time," Byrd Principal Jerry Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-and-white uniform, with pants and a shirt for boys and pants or a 
plaid skirt and blouse for girls, will cost under $40, Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's leadership council approved the decision after administrators 
received a positive response from parents to a questionnaire about uniforms. 
Administrators expect that about one-third of the students will be wearing the 
uniforms when the program officially begins July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Several elementary schools in the San Fernando Valley have adopted school 
uniforms, including O'Melveny Elementary in San Fernando, where about 60% of 
the students wear uniforms and San Fernando Elementary School where nearly 80% 
come to school in uniform. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SEPULVEDA BASIN; FUNDS SOUGHT TO ERADICATE ARUNDO REEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds like the plot of a rejected film script: a 20-foot-tall killer 
invading a park and choking every living thing in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 But the environmental threat of the Arundo donax reed in the Sepulveda Basin 
is real, and conservation groups have asked Los Angeles County for $200,000 to 
literally weed out the problem with help from the Los Angeles Conservation 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is almost impossible to kill," said Melanie Ingalls, who wrote the 
grant proposal for the Los Angeles office of the National Audubon Society. 
"It's like a forest, knocking off natural plants that live in the area, along 
with most of the insects and birds that rely on the plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists are concerned that arundo, which can grow six inches a day, 
is obliterating the fragile ecosystem of one of the few remaining natural 
tributaries of the Los Angeles River -- Bull Creek in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Audubon Society's proposal asks the Los Angeles County Regional Park and 
Open Space District for $200,000 in Proposition A funds to remove the 
bamboo-like reed along the creek between Victory Boulevard and the Los Angeles 
River, about a five-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will also require a permit from the Los Angeles city departments of 
Public Works and Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has the backing of several Valley environmental groups, including 
the Sierra Club, California Native Plant Society and the Army Corps of 
Engineers, which manages the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arundo has no value whatsoever," said Ted Carr, Army corps project manager. 
"It's very prone to fire and soaks up a lot of water. It's really a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very beneficial project to restore the creek and give people a 
chance to observe native plant and animal populations," said Jill Swift, 64, a 
member of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin. "The arundo just keeps them 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds would also be used to eradicate castor bean and tree tobacco, two 
poisonous plants that also are not native to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the grant would go to the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, a 
nonprofit agency that employs at-risk youths, whose task it will be to 
eradicate the reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Arundo is a giant, non-native reed that guzzles up water, eliminating native, 
water-dependent plants and creating an inhospitable environment for wildlife. 
Human habitats are threatened when the unchecked reed begins to create fire 
hazards, drain creeks or alter water flow in flood-control channels such as the 
Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant was brought over from Spain more than 100 years ago primarily for 
erosion control. Its seeds are easily spread by both wind and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists believe the basin became inundated with arundo when seeds 
flowed down the creek and took root, wiping out elderberry bushes, willows, 
monkey flower, mule fat and even young sycamore trees. Another result: blue 
herons and white egrets, that would often visit the creek side, cannot even 
land in the dense foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 To restore the creek to its original habitat, the grant would pay for a crew 
of 12 corps members to comb the creek with clippers for four months, slashing 
away at the stalks just above the ground.  
</P>
<P>
 To prevent regrowth, an herbicide must immediately be sprayed on the shorn 
areas. Arundo is extremely hardy, secreting a protective gel that can halt the 
herbicide if it is not applied quickly enough. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; GROUP SEEKS TO LET JURIES NULLIFY LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors arriving at the Van Nuys Courthouse on Tuesday morning were greeted 
with an unusual message: If you don't agree with the law, ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harnsberger, a 38-year-old San Diego county resident, stood in front of 
the Municipal Court building and urged jurors to vote their consciences when 
asked to reach verdicts in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The state coordinator for the Fully Informed Jury Assn., a group that 
Harnsberger says is active in 44 states, preaches the view that government has 
meddled too much in the lives of citizens. Government is foisting too many laws 
on people, Harnsberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors walking up the courthouse steps seemed unaffected by Harnsberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnsberger and his group want to get a "jury rights bill" introduced in the 
Legislature next year. If the proposal is passed, it would institutionalize the 
concept of "jury nullification," where juries could essentially nullify laws 
they believe are unjust -- even if the defendant admits committing the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Letteau, the supervising judge of Van Nuys Superior Court, said 
"chaos is inevitable" if juries fail to follow the law. "Their job is to weigh 
the evidence, not summarily disregard it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated recent case of jury nullification in California occurred 
last October in San Diego, where a panel acquitted a man on two felony counts 
of growing marijuana. Samuel Skipper admitted cultivating the plant, but the 
jury said he should be allowed to smoke pot to combat the nausea he suffers 
from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 After only 22 minutes of deliberation, according the Harnsberger, the jury in 
Skipper's trial "said it was a medical necessity and in that case we're not 
going to apply the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Assn. "is to raise public 
debate," Harnsberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Harnsberger spread the word were several members of the Granada Forum, 
a San Fernando Valley group that also seeks to increase public discussion of 
"political and health freedoms," according to member Anne Winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnsberger, who is in the midst of a 19-city tour of California, was 
scheduled to address the Granada Forum on Tuesday night on the proposed jury 
rights bill and a proposed jury compensation act, which seeks to increase pay 
for jurors. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; NEW WAY TO DISINFECT WATER SUPPLY SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With federal funds, San Fernando officials are researching ways to disinfect 
the city's water supply without using chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, there are (Federal Emergency Management Agency) 
funds that we are eligible for to disinfect our water," San Fernando Public 
Works Director Mike Drake said in a City Council meeting last week."We should 
take advantage of this to update our technology." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando, which uses a blend of well water and supplies from the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, has hired a consultant to 
review the city's needs and assess what other chemicals are available to 
disinfect the water, Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Doude Wysbeek was concerned that San Fernando would be trading in a 
time-proven chemical method for a more high-tech but less time-tested one. 
Councilman Raul Godinez, however, was more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great opportunity to be on the leading edge and, if FEMA will 
pay for it, I support this wholeheartedly," he said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; MAN WHOSE SON DIED FACES MURDER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man was charged Tuesday with murder in the death of his 
5-year-old son, who was killed when the man was involved in a traffic accident, 
allegedly while driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Guzman, 34, faces second-degree murder charges in the death of his son, 
William, and is being held in County Jail in lieu of bail of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 California law allows drunk-driving suspects to be charged with murder if they 
have prior DUI convictions and if they have been to school to learn about the 
dangers of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman has three prior convictions, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. 
Cohen. Los Angeles Police Detective Ron Vega said that after the accident, 
Guzman had a blood-alcohol content of 0.13%, well over the legal limit of 
0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew somebody could die, but he drove anyway," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was killed during the accident on Riverton Avenue near Arminta Street 
in Sun Valley just after 6 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman allegedly swerved into oncoming traffic and struck another vehicle 
being driven by Gilbert Ramirez, a 24-year-old Sun Valley resident, who pleaded 
no contest to driving while under the influence. He was sentenced to 193 days 
in jail. The city attorney's office had charged Ramirez with a misdemeanor 
count of driving under the influence. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; GRANT SOUGHT FOR OIL RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 San Fernando may soon begin a new program making it easier for residents to 
recycle dirty motor oil, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our city, we find a lot of motor oil illegally disposed of in sewage 
drains," said Gabrielle Sanchez, who is in charge of recycling programs for the 
San Fernando Public Works Department."This program will provide curbside 
collection of used motor oil." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council approved the free program last week, and the 
city is now seeking a $37,000 grant from the state Integrated Waste Management 
Board to finance it for two years. City officials have already discussed the 
plan with the Waste Management Board and expect to receive the grant, Sanchez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando has a curbside recycling program that does not include motor oil. 
The new program would provide all participants with a container in which to 
deposit dirty oil. Residents would be able to leave the filled containers by 
their curbs, where they would be picked up by Los Angeles city waste management 
workers, and replaced with clean containers. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HORSE OWNERS RILED UP OVER 'BILL OF RIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the latest in a long line of battles between urban and agrarian values. 
And this one, some say, could cost Los Angeles agrarians their most treasured 
icon -- the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Horse-Keeping Bill of Rights," as the proposed ordinance is informally 
called, "will have the effect of making almost every horse owner in the city 
nonconforming," said West Valley community activist Walter Prince, who filed 
suit Tuesday in Superior Court in an attempt to halt a Thursday Planning 
Commission hearing on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse owners say the 40-page list of regulations -- which, in the words of one 
equestrian, reads as though it had been drafted by people "who wouldn't know 
one end of a horse from the other" -- is a failed attempt to pen a 
comprehensive plan that would perpetuate horse-keeping in the area and also 
allow for development. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure passes, they say, the urbanites will have won a big one. City 
Planner Steve Ciccarelli, who headed up the study and wrote much of the 
proposal, said the document was intended to make life a little easier for horse 
keepers in one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities. And in many ways, he 
said, it succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that in the long run, it will actually help preserve horse-keeping 
lots and horse-keeping privileges," Ciccarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are several aspects of the "bill of rights" that worry equine 
owners, including the clause that says existing horse lots that don't meet the 
new standards -- some claim more than 90% of horse-keepers' properties will 
fall into that category -- will become nonconforming. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lots would not be subject to the new regulations -- with a couple of 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is not a horse on the property for a period of three years, the 
corral or barn must be altered -- at a potential cost of thousands of dollars 
-- to meet the new regulations before horses can again be kept. And if a horse 
has not been kept on the land for a full year, the property owner may also be 
forced to comply with the new rules if an adjoining landowner is granted a 
permit to build a residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The equine community is also concerned about a clause that mandates a 10-foot 
buffer zone between a corral and the property line. Horse owners say corrals 
are very typically put in the corner of a lot and setting them back would waste 
a considerable amount of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciccarelli said many of the disputes between horse owners and their neighbors 
result from horses urinating, defecating and damaging fences at the property 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of an all-encompassing horse-keeping ordinance came at the behest of 
Councilman Hal Bernson in 1991, when he oversaw creation of the Equine Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kent Lovelady, a task force member, the group spent a year 
studying the issues of horse-keeping and development, then submitted a proposal 
aimed almost entirely at regulating new development, not existing lots, to 
planners in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the Planning Department's version "bears no resemblance to 
the document we turned in," Lovelady said. "For the city to even represent that 
that document (the 'bill of rights') had any relationship to the document of 
the equine committee is almost libelous." 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Smith, a planner who also worked on the project, said the bill is a 
sizable step in the direction of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will make it so the horse owners could possibly coexist with the 
developers," she said. "That was the mission. If we don't have something, we 
may lose horse-keeping all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse owners say the measure seems almost to have been written to force them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got the horse community up in arms," Lovelady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a judge grants an injunction, the Planning Commission will meet for a 
hearing on the measure and to discuss other issues at 8:30 a.m. Thursday at the 
Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, 4808 Kester Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the Planning Commission's decision, the full City Council would 
have to approve the measure for it to become law. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; SAFETY COMES FIRST, RIORDAN TELLS CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the top of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's five-point budget plan is a 
single goal that comes before everything else: improving safety in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a group of 16 west San Fernando Valley homeowners associations 
Monday night, the mayor said the other four points in his budget -- making the 
city friendlier, cleaning up its infrastructure, making it more livable and 
improving government efficiency -- would all get considerable attention.But 
improving safety comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 And to that end, he told the crowd, he will hire 1,522 more police officers 
and purchase 400 more black-and-white cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he would make the improvements by cutting and streamlining 
elsewhere, not by seeking additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no new taxes," he said, garnering a hearty round of applause 
from the 400 on hand at the Francis Parkman Middle School auditorium in 
Woodland Hills. Acknowledging that the city has continued to suffer from the 
recession and has a growing reputation as a crime-ridden region, Riordan said 
such town meetings were the places to initiate change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you the secret of turning L. A. around," he said. "It's 
organizing like this. If you wait for governments to do it, in the long run, 
it's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Marvin Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky and Laura Chick also made brief 
statements, and Riordan spent more than half an hour taking questions from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan planned to meet with east Valley homeowners Tuesday night at Osaka 
Sangyo University in Studio City. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; 'BURNOUT' BOOTHS SET UP FOR CSUN FINALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to ease the quake-frazzled nerves of students at semester's end, 
counselors at Cal State Northridge set up two "burnout" booths on campus this 
week to offer advice on how to beat the stress of finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three weeks are the stretch when the demands are greatest," said 
Marshall Bloom of the University Counseling Services at CSUN."But burnout is 
much worse this semester with all the extra challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the ongoing chaos on campus after the Jan. 17 earthquake, Bloom 
said, students have been more vulnerable than usual to feelings of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they're feeling exhausted, that their functioning is not as adequate 
as they would wish and that they're working harder than ever but getting less 
done," Bloom said. "They might find that they're not taking care of themselves 
as they should." 
</P>
<P>
 The stress can bring sleepless nights and nagging colds, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, counselors will provide information on how to sleep better, 
manage stress and anger, and deal with a "disaster environment," Bloom said. 
The information will be available at the campus bookstore and in the courtyard 
of the student union from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., or by calling the counseling 
services at (818) 885-2366. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MAIL CARRIERS PLAN FOOD DRIVE SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Postal carriers throughout the San Fernando Valley -- and across the country 
-- will be picking up cans of food for the needy Saturday, in what is predicted 
to be the largest food drive in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The second Saturday in May may also become the date for an annual food drive 
by letter carriers, said Terri Bouffiou, spokeswoman for the U. S. Postal 
Service in the Los Angeles area.The food drive was scheduled for May to restock 
the shelves of food banks, which typically run low during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller food drive, involving 200 postal union locals across the country, 
was held in May, 1993. But much of Los Angeles, including parts of the Valley, 
did not participate in that event, Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 200 cities in Southern California, including Los Angeles and all of 
the Valley, will have letter carriers collecting cans or boxes of 
non-perishable food. A kickoff for the food drive for the Van Nuys postal 
district -- with representatives from 80 post offices -- is planned Thursday 
morning in Burbank, when letter carriers will bring in food from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a worthy cause myself, and it can open the doors for other 
organizations to follow our example," said Rick Riley, president of Branch 2086 
of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want everyone in Southern California to know they can take part," Bouffiou 
said. This year, organizers predict that 35 million to 45 million pounds will 
be collected, Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 1 million pounds was collected from the Valley as well as from 
Ventura County and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter carriers are asking participants to leave non-perishable cans or boxes 
of food by their mailboxes Saturday morning. But they do not want food in glass 
containers, officials said. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN SEEKS WAIVER TO HASTEN REPAIRS 
</P>

<P>
 Trustees of the California State University system are slated today to approve 
a measure permitting expedited earthquake repairs at Cal State Northridge by 
waiving the formal competitive bidding requirements normally required by state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the trustees recommended Tuesday that CSUN take advantage of a 
provision in the law for emergencies that grants an exemption from the 
time-consuming process for awarding public contracts.The full board was 
expected to approve the resolution today. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing the trustees at their meeting in Long Beach, CSUN President Blenda J. 
Wilson said she needs the expedited contracting process to meet her goal of 
having 10 major buildings and the University Park Apartments fully repaired by 
the start of the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the normal contracting procedures that require soliciting bidders and 
giving them time to respond, Wilson said the campus might only have two of the 
priority buildings fully repaired by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to make a quantum leap difference in what our campus looks 
like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials said the resolution simply will permit CSUN to continue 
the expedited contracting process that campus officials already have been using 
since the quake. But Wilson pledged to still meet goals for including minority- 
and women-owned firms in the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees' resolution said the total damage at CSUN from the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake now "exceeds $325 million," although the source of that 
estimate was unclear. Wilson said it came from Cal State officials, but a Cal 
State official said it came from the campus. JOHN CHANDLER

TEST DRIVE OF CAR TURNS INTO CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who walked into a Ventura auto showroom for a test drive Tuesday 
allegedly kidnaped a salesman and led police on a chase in the San Fernando 
Valley that ended in a Universal City parking structure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Lynn Simpson, 32, was booked on suspicion of kidnaping and auto theft at 
the Van Nuys jail, said Sgt. Nicholas Wade of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began, police said, at Paradise Chevrolet on Victoria Avenue in 
Ventura, with salesman Russell Phelps showing Simpson a $27,000 black Camaro 
Z-28. Simpson got behind the wheel and Phelps got into the passenger seat for a 
test drive, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps "wasn't concerned until he realized that they were on the 101 freeway 
heading out of Ventura County," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson allegedly told Phelps he was God and said he was driving to radio 
station KLOS, a rock music station in Los Angeles, to pick up money to pay for 
the car, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps told police he unsuccessfully tried several times to persuade Simpson 
-- who at one point during the drive ripped off his shirt -- to turn around. 
Simpson responded, he said, by telling Phelps he would not be beaten if he 
cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove through the San Fernando Valley at about 80 m.p.h., Simpson 
realized he didn't know where the radio station was located, Phelps told 
police. When Simpson exited the freeway to make a phone call at the 
intersection of Balboa and Ventura boulevards, Phelps bolted from the car and 
ducked into a nearby Smart & Final wholesale store, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there Phelps called police, and a description of the car was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers spotted the car at the intersection of Van Nuys 
Boulevard and Vose Street in Van Nuys and called for backup help, Wade said. 
Two more patrol cars pulled up behind Simpson within minutes and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson led police onto the eastbound side of the Hollywood Freeway where he 
reached speeds of up to 90 m.p.h. before exiting at Magnolia Boulevard, Wade 
said. Once off the freeway, he led police through side streets, including a 
dead end street where he flattened two tires as he drove over a curb to elude 
police, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Simpson crashed through a control gate at a multistory parking 
structure at Universal Studios, where he stopped the car and police took him 
into custody, Wade said.

GROUP PROTESTS FIRING OF TWO FIELD LABORERS; WESTLAKE VILLAGE: DEMONSTRATORS 
SAY DOLE WANTS TO BLOCK THE UNITED FARM WORKERS FROM ORGANIZING. THE FIRM 
DENIES THE CHARGE.

<P>
 A group of about 35 labor organizers and fieldworkers protested Tuesday 
outside the Dole Food Co. headquarters in Westlake Village over the dismissal 
of two Oxnard celery pickers who said they were fired because they were 
campaigning to start a chapter of the United Farm Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that an employee of Ocean View Produce, a Dole subsidiary in Oxnard, 
had tried to intimidate union organizers and made racial insults to 
fieldworkers, David Martinez, the UFW's secretary-treasurer, called for a 
boycott of Dole products by the Latino community if the workers are not 
rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Dole company thinks Mexicans are ignorant fools and animals, then the 
Dole company doesn't deserve a single cent from Mexicans for their bananas and 
pineapples," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole officials denied the charges of racism and intimidation and said they 
supported the workers' right to hold a union election. Last week, the UFW 
gathered enough signatures -- more than half of the 600 fieldworkers at Ocean 
View -- to hold an election, scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two workers were let go because they violated company rules, and would not 
be rehired, company officials said, refusing to elaborate on what rules had 
been broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Estrada Ramos, a full-time volunteer with UFW, accused Dole labor 
consultant Steven Highfield of making racist remarks to him and to 
fieldworkers, including calling workers "pigs" and "ignorant fools."  
</P>
<P>
 Dole spokesman Tom Pernice said Highfield was hired to advise the company on 
employment law and benefits planning and denied that he made racial comments to 
Ramos or any other workers. MARY F. POLS

JURY ISSUES SPLIT VERDICT IN MARATHON TOXIC EXPOSURE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors rendered a split verdict Tuesday in the first phase of a marathon toxic 
exposure trial, ruling that Lockheed workers may proceed with injury claims 
against 10 of 20 chemical firms accused of failing to provide adequate warnings 
on the health risks of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, which followed three weeks of deliberations in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, sets the stage for a final trial phase in which jurors will 
decide if the workers were harmed by chemicals supplied by the 10 companies, 
and if inadequate warnings were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-month-old trial stems from claims by more than 600 Lockheed workers and 
involves dozens of chemical products -- including solvents, primers and epoxies 
-- used to build the Stealth fighter and other military aircraft at Lockheed's 
Burbank manufacturing complex during the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, who are seeking unspecified damages, contend they suffered 
injuries ranging from eye and skin irritation to cancer because the chemical 
suppliers did not adequately explain the health risks or needed safety 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who waded through scores of questions on a 47-page verdict form, found 
that 10 of the 20 chemical suppliers, including industry giants DuPont and 
Ashland, were guilty of negligence for failing to provide adequate warnings in 
the material safety data sheets that accompanied shipments of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that two of these companies -- Dexter Corp. and J.T. Baker Inc. 
-- also could be liable for punitive damages because their failures constituted 
"despicable conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on whether punitive damages could be sought against four 
other firms. In those cases, at least nine of 12 jurors agreed that the 
companies failed to provide adequate warnings, but fewer than nine could agree 
if they were liable for punitive damages. Lawyers for the workers could seek a 
retrial of the mistrial counts at a separate proceeding in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict removed the other 10 defendants from the second phase. Six of this 
group, including Arco, Shell and Unocal, were found to have supplied enough 
safety information. Jurors could not agree on the warnings provided by the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the case declared victory. "It's spectacular," said Thomas V. 
Girardi, lead attorney for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful result. After 10 years of litigation, we have a decision 
that half of these chemical companies and oil companies are liable. . . . We're 
very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robert H. McMillan, one of the chemical company lawyers, "This is a very 
poor showing on the part of the plaintiffs, because they certainly threw all 
they had at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The result "confirms our general belief that the cases are without merit." 
</P>
<P>
 Before collecting any damages, plaintiff lawyers must persuade jurors that the 
workers were injured by toxic exposure and would have taken adequate 
precautions if properly warned. 
</P>
<P>
 This second phase, which is to begin Monday, will be confined to the health 
claims of 14 "pilot" plaintiffs, although the result is likely to guide 
settlements with more of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 After sending the jurors home, Judge Richard C. Hubbell addressed a courtroom 
full of lawyers, wondering aloud if the removal of many chemical products from 
the case weakens the claims of any of the 14 workers. He asked the lawyers to 
consider before Monday if a settlement is possible, advising them to "put your 
heads together with some private judge . . . and perhaps mediate this."

AUTOMATIC GAS SHUT-OFF VALVE PLAN STALLS; SEISMIC SAFETY: CRITICS OF BERNSON'S 
PROPOSAL SAY THE DEVICES ARE TOO SENSITIVE TO SMALLER QUAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to require all new buildings in the city to have gas valves that 
automatically shut off during a quake suffered a serious setback Tuesday when 
the Los Angeles City Council refused to approve it, instead sending it to a 
council committee for further study. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious blow to the proposal came when fire and building and safety 
officials told the council that state standards regulating the shut-off devices 
are too lenient, making the devices too sensitive to motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's moving a little too fast," Fire Marshal Davis R. Parsons told 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 9-3 vote to send the proposal to the Public Safety Committee for 
further study angered Councilman Hal Bernson, who has been pushing the gas 
shut-off valve plan for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the proposal is technically still alive, Bernson said he fears it 
will not survive the delay. He said he may not have enough support on the 
council to get it approved. "Unless the council has more courage to act, this 
is dead," he said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the same meeting, Bernson introduced a proposal to require the 
owners of about 400 steel-frame buildings in the San Fernando Valley and 
Westside to have the frames inspected for quake damage. That proposal will be 
considered later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of installing quake-sensitive gas valves in seismically active areas 
has been discussed by quake experts and lawmakers for years in Southern 
California. In Japan, the devices are mandatory. All federal buildings in 
quake-prone areas already have the valves. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bernson's proposal, about 900,000 residential, commercial and industrial 
buildings would be required to install the devices. If approved, the city would 
be the first local jurisdiction to require the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members, real estate leaders and gas company officials 
said they would prefer if the shut-off valve installation program were 
voluntary, not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the proposal also said they fear that the devices would be 
triggered by small aftershocks or large trucks driving by, creating headaches 
when it comes time to turn the gas back on and ignite pilot lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all these reasons, I think the prudent thing to do is to slow down," said 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, who suggested the idea be studied further and 
returned to the council in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons and a representative of the city's Building and Safety Department said 
the standards set by the state for the devices are so lenient that the gas 
shut-off valves may close because of vandalism, accidents or small aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson and representatives of firms that sell the valves shrugged off 
such concerns, saying the city should take a lead role in improving the 
standards so that the devices work properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is more important: economics or the safety of this city?" Bernson asked 
the council. "We need to move forward on this." 
</P>
<P>
 The devices, which cost between $100 and $200 for most residential homes, fit 
on a gas pipe between the gas meter and the house. A significant quake triggers 
a mechanism in the device that shuts off the gas flow automatically, preventing 
dangerous gas leaks inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 After ensuring that no gas leaks exist, the property owner can reopen the gas 
flow by pulling on a small metal lever on the device. The shut-off valves are 
now sold at many hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Gas Co. does not recommend such devices because the 
devices will close in a quake regardless of whether there is a gas leak. Of the 
150,000 customers who were without gas service after the Northridge quake, only 
about 10% actually had gas pipeline breaks. Most turned off the gas as a 
precaution, then had difficulty getting it turned back on again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's proposal would require the valves be installed on all new buildings, 
all buildings undergoing significant remodeling, all mobile home parks and 
multifamily residential buildings.

COMPUTER STORE OWNER RECALLS ATTACK IN $250,000 ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last thing Mohamad Nematzadeh remembered, he told police much later, was 
being kicked by a masked gunman who had forced open the door to his computer 
store after it had closed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nematzadeh regained consciousness Monday evening, the gunman and his 
accomplices were gone, along with $250,000 of personal computers that were 
stored in the warehouse at the 23900 block of Ventura Boulevard, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old businessman was treated by paramedics at the scene for cuts to 
the head Monday night, when the robbery occurred, and released, said Detective 
Mary Baker of the Lost Hills Malibu sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the gunman pushed open a Plexiglas door panel, reached in 
between the bars and unlocked the front door to PC International, located in a 
small industrial park next to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nematzadeh emerged from his office, the gunman, who wore gloves, pointed 
a small-caliber pistol and ordered the merchant to the shop's foyer, where he 
recalled being kicked, before he lost consciousness, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear when the attack occurred. When Nematzadeh regained consciousness 
about 7:40 p.m., he pressed an alarm button, alerting a security firm, which 
called sheriff's deputies.

TWO BROTHERS CONVICTED IN MAN'S KIDNAP-MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a 2 1/2-month trial, two brothers from Tennessee have been convicted in 
the kidnaping and execution-style murder of a North Hills man, who was abducted 
as he left a Studio City bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty against Ronald Boscaino, 32, 
in the Sept. 24, 1989, slaying of Sheldon Oppenheim. Boscaino fatally shot 
Oppenheim, according to trial testimony.Vincent Boscaino, 27, who also was 
convicted of the killing, could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury that convicted Ronald Boscaino on Monday will reconvene June 7 
to determine if he should be sentenced to death or to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Boscaino bragged about the killing to two friends and threatened to 
kill anyone who went to authorities because "I'm going to hell anyhow," 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Chasworth. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony by Troy Simons, an accomplice who testified after 
striking a deal with prosecutors, Ronald Boscaino put a gun to Oppenheim's head 
and pulled the trigger while holding a pillow over the weapon to muffle the 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will ask that Vincent Boscaino receive a sentence of life in 
prison without the possibility of parole at a July 7 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just very happy these people will never see the light of day because they 
are seriously dangerous people," Chasworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were also convicted of burglarizing a home the day before Oppenheim 
was killed, where they stole the gun used in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the jury determined that the Boscaino brothers kidnaped Kenneth 
Fromberg in Woodland Hills on Oct. 8, 1989, and forced him to drive to Las 
Vegas, where they pushed him out of the car along Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasworth said Fromberg identified the Boscainos as his captors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 4, 1989, Ronald Boscaino kidnaped another man from the same parking 
lot where Oppenheim was abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Boscaino was convicted of attempted murder for putting a gun into Tory 
Christopher's mouth and pulling the trigger. The gun did not go off, apparently 
because Boscaino could not figure out how to unlock the safety mechanism.

WOMAN DROPS RAPE CASE AGAINST DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A New York City detective and two friends accused of raping a Burbank woman 
were released Monday after the alleged victim told authorities she had been 
drinking heavily, consented to sex with the police officer and "may have" led 
on his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we interviewed her, we knew no way could we convince 12 jurors beyond a 
doubt" that she was raped, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Walt Lewis, assistant head of 
the district attorney's Pasadena office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis added that the 27-year-old woman did not want to pursue charges against 
the three tourists, whom she had accused of raping her after driving her home 
from a local nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Released from the Burbank City Jail were New York Police Detective Thomas John 
Kid, 27; John James Calimano, 27; and Richard Daniel Haime, 28, all of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested Thursday as they stood in line at NBC Studios in Burbank 
for a taping of the Jay Leno Show and were held in lieu of $1-million bail on 
charges of rape, forced oral copulation and false imprisonment. LESLIE BERGER

2 ACCUSED IN 1992 SLAYING OF TAFT HIGH STUDENT, 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed murder charges Tuesday against two reputed gang members in 
the slaying of a Taft High School student nearly two years ago by a group of 
youths who apparently mistook him for a rival gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Andres Lopez, 18, has been charged with the Aug. 5, 1992, stabbing of 
Lamoun Thames, a 15-year-old South Central Los Angeles boy who was attacked 
while waiting at a bus stop after attending a preseason football practice, 
authorities said.Lopez is expected to be arraigned by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy whose name is being held because of his age was arraigned 
Tuesday on murder and conspiracy charges for allegedly being present during the 
attack on Thames, who was not associated with a gang, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses said they saw two people get out of the car and approach Thames," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Taklender said. "We filed on each of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Taklender said his office will seek to have Lopez, who was 16 at the time of 
the slaying, tried as an adult. The 17-year-old would be tried as a juvenile.  
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Lopez on Friday after a confidential informant said he had 
heard Lopez bragging that he had committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is being held on $1-million bail on charges of participating in a spree 
of armed robberies in West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley last month. He 
has been charged with attempted murder, seven counts of armed robbery and other 
counts in that case.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOARD TO WEIGH PLAN FOR STUDENT UNIFORMS; 
EDUCATION: THE PROPOSAL HAS A DEGREE OF SUPPORT FROM ALL FOUR TRUSTEES. BUT 
SOME STUDENTS ARE UNHAPPY.

 A proposal to require that students at a new junior high school wear uniforms 
during the 1994-95 school year is receiving near-unanimous support from the 
district's board of trustees, who will decide tonight if a plan can be 
submitted for final approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at La Mesa Junior High School in Canyon Country would be required to 
wear black bottoms -- shorts or pants for boys, and skirts, "skorts" or pants 
for girls -- and one of several shirts available in multiple colors when the 
school opens this fall, said Principal Rochelle Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 She said parents overwhelmingly support the idea because it would eliminate 
gang-type attire and reduce clothing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal also said that her discussions with students have convinced her that 
uniforms will improve their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It validated for me how strong the peer pressure is," she said. "Many of them 
breathed a sigh of relief that they wouldn't have to wear designer label 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But elementary and junior high students at campuses near La Mesa interviewed 
Tuesday -- most clad in T-shirts and jeans or shorts -- voiced strong 
opposition to the proposal. Among other things, they said requiring uniforms 
would rob them of their freedom to choose and would do little to solve problems 
such as gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gross, because everyone will look the same," said Robyn Almeida, 12, a 
seventh-grade student at Arroyo Seco Junior High School wearing shorts and a 
Mickey Mouse T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms also are being considered for Placerita Junior High School in the 
Newhall School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of education President Gonzalo Freixes said he and other parents will 
discuss the idea at the end of the month and possibly attempt to establish a 
uniform requirement by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees of the William S. Hart Union High School District is 
scheduled to decide tonight if La Mesa officials can collect information for a 
plan to be submitted to the board June 8. The meeting is at 7:30 p.m. at the 
district administrative center, 21515 Redview Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 All four board members said they support uniforms to some degree, although at 
least one, William Dinsenbacher, indicated he doesn't approve of students 
having to buy specific clothing chosen by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Patricia Hanrion said she supports uniforms because most parents 
she has spoken to approve the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, ballots cast by 172 people at four public meetings in April 
showed that 86% of those in attendance supported uniforms. Only 12% were 
opposed and 2% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Argelio Gonzalez, a parent who lives three blocks from La Mesa, said he 
supports uniforms because his fifth-grade son has recently acquired a taste for 
gang-like clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to wear the same thing as his friends are wearing and I'm a little 
concerned. . . . I don't want him wearing anything that will get him into 
danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez and other parents said that placing more restrictions on existing 
dress codes might accomplish the same purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents objecting to the uniforms would have the option of transferring their 
children to another junior high school, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost per student is expected to be less than $150 a year, with the clothes 
provided through a local retail store. Neal said that local businesses, 
churches and other organizations would be asked to donate to a fund that would 
pay for uniforms for families unable to afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member John Hassel said he believes uniforms will be more affordable to 
families than current clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's far, far more economical for parents to buy two, three or five 
uniforms -- if you want to call them that -- rather than the trendy stuff kids 
just have to have," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ROCKWELL TO LAY OFF WORKERS AT SHUTTLE PLANT

 Nearly three-fourths of the work force at Rockwell's Space Systems Division 
here will be laid off at the end of this month when modification work on the 
space shuttle Atlantis is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell spokeswoman Janet Dean said that effective May 27, the number of 
employees in Palmdale will be cut from 300 to 80.The few who are remaining will 
maintain the modification facility and prepare it for the arrival of the next 
orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
 As little as four months after losing their jobs, Dean said, most of the 
workers will have an opportunity to return. Rockwell will need 275 to 300 
employees once the shuttle Columbia arrives in Palmdale for modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Work furloughs between the departure of a shuttle and the arrival of the next 
one are a fairly common practice for Rockwell in Palmdale, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Columbia arrives, modifications are expected to take seven to eight 
months, she said. Atlantis has been undergoing $74 million in modifications in 
Palmdale since October. SHARON MOESER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOTHER SENTENCED FOR CHILDREN'S TRUANCY

<P>
 A Lancaster woman accused of failing to send her four children to school 
regularly pleaded guilty Tuesday to criminal charges stemming from the 
attendance problems, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmel Odelia Gallardo, 30, was given a 718-day suspended jail sentence and 
placed on three years' probation during a hearing before Antelope Municipal 
Judge Chesley N. McKay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallardo also must attend parenting classes and make sure her children attend 
school regularly or she can be placed in jail, said John K. Spillane, 
supervisor of the district attorney's Antelope Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was charged with four misdemeanor counts of contributing to the 
delinquency of a minor. When she failed to appear at an April 26 court hearing, 
an arrest warrant was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the district attorney's office arrested Gallardo on Monday 
at her Lancaster home and jailed her at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's Antelope Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gallardo nor her attorney could be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spillane said such criminal charges against a parent are rare because most 
attendance problems are settled at the school district level. He said Gallardo 
is the first parent to face attendance-related charges during his 1 1/2 years 
in the Antelope Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Gallardo's case also is unusual because it involves four 
children -- ages 8, 9, 10 and 12 -- all of whom had missed a significant number 
of school days over the past two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the continuing problem and her lack of cooperation and interest, I 
directed that criminal charges be filed," Spillane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spillane said the woman has two other children, who are of preschool age. The 
family has been referred to the county's Department of Children's Services for 
review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Gallardo apparently did not keep the children out of 
classes because of a philosophical disagreement with local schools or because 
she wanted to teach them at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a question of neglect and she didn't realize how serious it 
was," Spillane said. "I'm sure she does now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ned McNabb, an administrator at the Lancaster School District, which referred 
the matter to the district attorney's office, said he was pleased by the 
outcome of Tuesday's hearing.

VENTURA COUNTY OKS LOAN TO FIX QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to speed up efforts to build earthquake-damaged homes, Ventura County 
supervisors Tuesday approved a temporary loan of $300,000 from the county's 
general fund to replace delayed federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Rehabilitation Program, to be administered by the city of Fillmore 
for residents there and in neighboring Piru, needs the funds now to buy 
materials to help residents repair homes, Administrative Analyst Susan Van Abel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have been assembled to help repair homes and victims have been 
identified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to go with the program in Fillmore and Piru, but we don't have 
the money because of an administrative holdup with the Community Development 
Block Grant funds," Van Abel told the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will help Hand to Hand, Habitat for Humanity and the Christian 
Relief Work Reform Committee work with residents of the two communities to 
repair homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Project organizers have requested a total of $575,000. but the $300,000 will 
get them started until the federal funds arrive, Van Abel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of noise made about the federal government getting the money 
to us very quickly, and it has not been forthcoming," Supervisors Chairwoman 
Vicky Howard said.

VALLEY BRIEFING: BLACK AND BLUE; INJURIES SIDELINE LAPD OFFICERS DAILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is common knowledge that police work can be a deadly, dangerous business. 
But less publicized are the countless bumps and bruises officers receive doing 
everything from chasing suspects to wrestling them to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more than one-third of the Los Angeles Police Department's 7,722 
sworn officers, or about 37.3%, have been hurt on the job every year since 
1991. According to the department's medical liaison section the injuries 
average out to one week off for every officer on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of injuries has declined in recent years, they remain an 
inescapable part of police work. It's difficult to establish the financial cost 
to the state's worker's compensation program, because LAPD records combine 
stress claims with those for physical injuries. But in 1990-91, claims from the 
department totaled $72 million. In 1992-93, they reached $86 million. * Death

O.C. DANCE / CHRIS PASLES; PUTTING A STAMP ON FLAMENCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Flamenco is like the blues in America," says Juan Talavera of the Flamenco 
Dance Theatre. "There's a guy wailing, another guy playing the guitar, and 
someone says 'I can move to that kind of number.' And he starts dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 The wailing springs from the lives and passions of the Gypsies, the "very 
proud people," in Talavera's words, who created flamenco. "Unfortunately they 
are a very persecuted people, even today. They don't hold jobs. People don't 
hire them. They can't go into restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Spain last year," Talavera continued, on the phone from his home in 
Whittier, "I saw a family of Gypsies thrown out of a McDonald's. I went up to 
the manager and asked why. He said: 'They're Gypsies.' That's their reason. 
That's what the Gypsies have to deal with. All that comes out in the singing 
and dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend and next, Talavera will present four different programs of 
flamenco music and dance at the Curtis Theatre in Brea. He will include a 
variety of forms that he divides into "light, medium and heavy" -- because, he 
says, otherwise "it gets too heavy. You want to shoot yourself after the last 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cante chico means light, happy, no cares, we're having a fiesta-type of 
thing. We're eating and enjoying ourselves. Medium flamenco: The (dining) is 
over, you think of lost loves, lost whatever. You have a couple more drinks and 
get into the deep stuff -- persecution, isolation. You're by yourself -- 
solitude, loneliness. We're always singing about lost loves or lost things. 
We're always losing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the style, Talavera noted that "in American dancing, jazz or tap or 
any of that Broadway musical thing, everything moves at the same time and at 
the same pace. In flamenco dancing -- not Hispanic dancing; flamenco is 
different -- the upper body always moves a lot slower than the feet. The upper 
body is very statuesque, proud. The hands undulate slowly. The feet might be 
going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the essence of the music is spontaneous emotional expression, "the 
hard part is to get the singer to sing the same verse each time.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're not into rehearsal. They hate it. The first thing I get (from them) 
is, 'How many rehearsals? How long are they?' 
</P>
<P>
 "In rehearsal that day, the singer might be feeling low. When the performance 
comes along, maybe it's been a good day, maybe he made $500 -- he's not going 
to sing the same verse."  
</P>
<P>
 Like the Gypsies, Talavera knows something about harassment. Born in Los 
Angeles and raised in East L.A., he began studying dance when he was 6. It was 
a risky thing for a boy there to do. "You got beat up; you got called names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, people call me names because they know I'm a dancer. Talk to any 
male dancer here in the United States and tell me he hasn't gone through some 
sort of backlash because he's a dancer." 
</P>
<P>
 He persevered and began dancing professionally as a teen-ager. When he was 22, 
he and two older associates founded the El Cid Flamenco Nightclub in Los 
Angeles, where he continued to dance until 1985, long after its ownership had 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview that year, he said: "I don't want to be dancing when I'm 50. 
You look real strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded of that quote recently, he laughed. "I'm 54, and I'm still dancing. 
Unfortunately, I think it's my life. I tried all sorts of different things. 
I've tried acting. That hasn't worked. I've done teaching. . . But when I hear 
a good flamenco guitarist and a good flamenco singer. . . You give me flamenco 
and man, I'm there. I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * Juan Talavera and Flamenco Dance Theatre present different programs -- 
Saturday at 8:30 p.m., Sunday at 3:30 p.m. and May 20 and 21 at 8:30 p.m. -- at 
the Curtis Theatre in the Brea Civic Center, 1 Civic Center Drive, Brea.

A MONSTROUS EFFORT; KOREAN AUTO MAKER KIA TACKLES SOUTHLAND MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The television ads feature a giant Godzilla-like creature named Gorgo stomping 
through downtown Tokyo as screaming residents flee the imperiled city. The 
message: "There's only one thing more frightening to Japan -- a well-built car 
for under $8,500." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Japanese auto makers abandoned the low-priced new car market in the 
United States several years ago. But there's no doubt that -- despite the 
hyperbole -- the television and billboard campaign is helping establish 
America's newest import. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its Feb. 3 debut in Portland, Korean auto maker Kia Motors Corp. has 
opened 50 dealerships in the West and sold 2,600 of its compact economy cars, 
which sell for as low as $8,495. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kia is coming to Southern California -- the nation's toughest car market 
-- with the scheduled opening Thursday of 16 new dealerships. They cover a 
territory stretching from Bakersfield to Cathedral City, but are concentrated 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers -- all of them already selling other brands -- are eager to see if 
Kia will live up to its advertising, or flop like the 1961 movie "Gorgo," in 
which Kia's monster mascot originally starred. 
</P>
<P>
 Although new to the United States, Kia does have a track record. It sells cars 
under its own name in 90 countries and produces nearly 700,000 cars and trucks 
a year. With annual revenue of more than $4 billion last year, it ranks 333rd 
on Fortune's Global 500 list and is Korea's second-largest car maker after 
Hyundai Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in Korea in 1944 as a metal tubing and bicycle parts 
manufacturer -- Kia means "gear," as in a bicycle's toothed sprocket. It later 
began making bicycles, then motorcycles and heavy trucks. It began passenger 
car production in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Kia contracted with Ford Motor Co. to begin manufacturing the 
Ford-designed Festiva economy car. That successful venture has put more than 
800,000 Kia-built cars into American garages. Ford discontinued the Festiva 
this year, but Kia builds its replacement, the Aspire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kia officials decided in 1990 to begin selling cars in the United States under 
their own banner and set up a small office in Irvine under the name Kia Motors 
America Inc. the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Greg Warner, a former Hyundai Motor America executive, was hired as chief 
operating officer. He had firsthand experience with that company's spectacular 
1986 launch and the myriad problems its early sales successes caused. One of 
Warner's missions has been to ensure that Kia does not repeat the Hyundai 
mistakes. To do that, he designed a go-slow approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia has been taking a regional approach to launching its sales network, 
opening dealerships in quick succession in Oregon, Las Vegas, Washington, 
Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Northern California and, last month, San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Each opening has been trumpeted in a flurry of local radio, television, 
newspaper and billboard ads featuring the grainy image of Gorgo. On average, 
each of the new dealers has been selling 1.1 Kias a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kia plans to introduce a curvy sports utility vehicle, the Sportage, 
in December, and a mid-sized sedan in 1995, the company is entering the U.S. 
market with only one model, the four-door Sephia. It typically is the third or 
even fourth brand sold on dealers' lots, which helps new Kia dealers ensure 
profits with the line because they didn't have to invest $1 million or more in 
separate showrooms. Most dealerships also haven't had to hire new sales or 
service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is enthralled with the Sephia. Most reviews give it high marks 
for quality at a low-to-moderate price and find the styling acceptable, though 
not trend-setting. But Kia is knocked for omitting air bags from its inaugural 
offering and for having the smallest engine in its class, which includes 
four-door versions of the Saturn, Ford Escort, Mazda Protege and, if one can be 
found, a base-priced Dodge Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 In its June issue, Car and Driver magazine compared nine four-door economy 
sedans and ranked Kia ninth, largely because of the performance-oriented 
publication's dislike of the Sephia's 88-horsepower engine and its pedestrian 
handling characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the review says that with air conditioning, power windows, mirrors and 
door locks and an AM-FM-cassette stereo system, the fully-loaded Sephia GS at 
$12,065 "offers excellent value . . . for bargain hunters who ask, 'How much 
car can I get for the least amount of money?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, where Kias have been part of the Budget Rent-A-Car fleet since 
August, the Sephia -- which comes in three trim levels -- has become one of the 
city's best-selling four-door automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtesy Kia, the lone dealer in America's gaming capital, sold 75 of the 
$8,500 to $12,000 cars in February. And Courtesy didn't start selling until the 
5th of that 28-day month, said owner Harold Drezner. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more Sephias registered to private owners in Las Vegas in February 
than new four-door models of the Honda Civic, Ford Escort, Nissan Sentra or 
Toyota Corolla, according to data collected by independent analyst R.L. Polk & 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one really expects the car to become a phenomenal seller overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts, Kia dealers and even the dark-suited executives at Kia 
Motors America Inc.'s new headquarters in Irvine say the goal is to start small 
and grow at a moderate pace while building a solid reputation for customer 
service and product reliability. "That's the reason for our existence," said 
Warner, "to deliver vehicles that are the equal to the best available in the 
category at a significant price advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner is determined that his company not repeat the Hyundai experience: When 
that company's subcompact Excel hit the market at under $5,000 it became an 
instant hit and the factory opted to make as many cars as it could sell instead 
of only as many as its quality control system could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hyundai set U.S. records for a new automobile franchise, selling 
more than 250,000 cars in its second year and almost 1 million by 1989, when 
the bubble burst as its overzealousness left it with a reputation as a maker of 
inexpensive but unreliable cars. The image has hung on although industry 
experts say the reliability problems have been cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner maintains, and industry specialists like J.D. Power & Associates' 
competitive market analyst Tom Dukes agree, that Kia seems to have produced a 
good, competitive economy car that meets or exceeds the basic quality standards 
that have been set by the Japanese auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared not to like it," said Dukes, "but I was pleasantly surprised. 
All the fundamentals are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannine Saniz certainly thinks so, and while positive reviews by consultants 
are nice, Saniz's opinion is more important -- because she actually bought a 
Sephia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old San Diego bank teller and her husband were about to purchase a 
$13,800 Geo Prizm -- the Toyota Corolla clone built in Northern California and 
sold by Chevrolet-Geo dealers -- when Kia's advertising blitz in San Diego 
caught their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She drove 40 minutes to a new Kia dealership in Carlsbad last month to look at 
Sephias and drove away in a turquoise model with air conditioning, power 
steering, automatic transmission and a stereo AM-FM radio and tape cassette 
player for just over $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $1,800 savings, Saniz said, she doesn't mind not having an air bag -- 
a safety device Kia says will arrive with its 1995 models. "We were really 
surprised at the quality for the price," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One item that helped clinch the sale: Kia provides a free 36-month 
bumper-to-bumper warranty that includes 24-hour roadside service. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia officials say their focus on quality control and customer satisfaction is 
derived from the company's ownership structure: employees own the largest block 
of stock, 12%, and have a vested interest in making sure the company does well. 
In addition, Ford owns a 10% stake and Japan's Mazda Motors Corp., which 
supplies the designs for Kia engines and transmissions, owns 8%. The rest of 
the company's shares are traded on the Korean Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee interest in the company, as well as the Mazda and Ford links, 
prompted Carson auto retailing magnate Don Kott to ask for a Kia franchise. 
Kott already sells Fords, Lincolns, Mercurys, Chryslers, Plymouths, Isuzus and 
heavy trucks and figures a company that is partly owned by its workers has got 
to be finicky about quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "I know they build a good product. Of all the cars we've 
sold over the past 10 years, the Festiva has had the lowest incidence of 
repair." Kott said he's so sure of the long-term value of a Kia franchise that 
he intends to build a separate Kia showroom to anchor a six-acre expansion of 
his Carson auto center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 300-pound car dealer said there's another thing he finds 
impressive about the Kia Sephia: "I fit in it and am comfortable. And that's 
unlike a lot of small cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Other dealers who have signed on with Kia said the company's focus on consumer 
satisfaction -- the name of the game in today's car business -- was a key 
reason for signing on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never, ever, been through as much to get a franchise as with Kia," 
said Ron Dixon, owner of the dealership in Carlsbad. "They talked to my 
bankers, I had to show them my quality and customer satisfaction ratings from 
Ford and Isuzu going back three years. When they called and asked me if I would 
be interested in applying for a franchise, they warned me that they wouldn't 
talk to anyone whose ratings weren't better than the industry average." 
</P>
<P>
 Dealer Danny McKenna said Kia -- unlike other manufacturers -- stressed 
customer satisfaction over sales volume. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna, who will sell Kias at his South County Motors Volkswagen and Isuzu 
lot in Huntington Beach, also owns McKenna Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi and BMW in 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the others, the first concern is unit sales -- how many cars I can 
move. They all care about customer satisfaction, but sales is on top of the 
list," he said. "With Kia, the very first thing we discussed was customer 
service." Kia Motors America

FLETCHER JONES CAR DEALERSHIP SEEKS TO MOVE; AUTOS: AGENCY WANTS SITE 
OWNERSHIP, MORE VISIBILITY. IT MIGHT LEAVE NEWPORT, WHICH WOULD COST CITY 
HEAVILY IN TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, the nation's second-largest Mercedes-Benz dealer, 
said Tuesday that it wants to move from its leased lot to a new home that would 
be more accessible and visible to its customers -- a lot possibly in another 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Any move out of Newport Beach, where it has an eight-acre facility, would cost 
the city up to $1 million or more in annual taxes, though the exact amount is 
confidential, the auto dealer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at other sites," said Fletcher Jones Jr., the dealership's 
owner. "Our overwhelming desire is to stay in Newport Beach. We're in the best 
Mercedes-Benz market in the country. But there are some other areas we've 
looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he would like to be located near Jamboree Road and MacArthur 
Boulevard or near a major freeway or road. His current lease expires in 
December, 1996, and he wants to buy his future site. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has 150 new cars and 100 used cars for sale at its lot on Quail 
Street near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest reason we want to move is that our current site is leased and we 
would like to find some property we could purchase," Jones said. "We would also 
like to have better visibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, Tustin or Santa Ana would make likely sites, said John Rettie, an 
editor with J.D. Power & Associates, an auto research firm in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, dealers like to be near a freeway off-ramp," Rettie said. "I think 
it's been shown that over the years it can make a significant difference to 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
 A loss of the dealership would be a big blow to Newport Beach because it is 
one of the largest single contributors of sales tax dollars to the city. 
However, Jones said he does not want to move his dealership to another area, 
such as the Irvine Auto Mall or Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Other car dealers said Fletcher Jones probably would not move to Irvine 
because other dealers already serve the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would be leaving one primary market area and entering another, which is 
already covered by Mission Viejo Imports," said Lou Webb, chairman of the 
Irvine Auto Dealers Assn., a group of dealers in the Irvine Auto Mall. "He's in 
a pretty good place now. I don't know why he'd want to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Paul O. Brady, Irvine's city manager, said Fletcher is believed to be 
looking at the Irvine Auto Mall, which has at least one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher Jones is the nation's second-largest Mercedes-Benz dealership in 
terms of auto and related sales during 1993, according to Auto Age magazine, a 
monthly trade publication in Van Nuys. Jones bought the dealership for $11.5 
million in a 1991 bankruptcy sale involving former owner James B. Slemons.

 Bond yields posted their biggest decline since early April on Tuesday, buoyed 
by heavy demand at a Treasury note sale and a powerful rally in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got a lift as well, and the Dow Jones industrials rose 27.37 points to 
3,656.41 in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that European central banks had joined forces to buy huge amounts of 
Treasury securities swept world financial markets and added momentum to bond, 
stock and dollar gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 7.49% from Monday's 18-month high of 
7.65%. The yield's decline was the biggest one-day drop since April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar surged to a six-week high against the Japanese 
yen as traders began to sense that the Clinton Administration's plan to shore 
up the dollar, announced last week, might be working. Also, rumors swirled 
about phone consultations among world central bankers regarding future 
coordinated interventions to support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar jumped to 104.68 yen in New York from 102.68 on Monday. It also 
soared to 1.675 German marks from 1.653 marks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping the dollar were small overnight cuts in short-term interest rates 
by the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan. With the Federal Reserve Board 
expected to raise U.S. short-term interest rates again soon, lower rates 
overseas may increase foreign investors' interest in U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a stable dollar -- and it seems like we have -- our market is 
incredibly cheap relative to other markets around the world," said Peter 
Hirsch, head government bond trader at Salomon Bros. "I don't think anybody saw 
anything but buyers all day." 
</P>
<P>
 The turn in investor sentiment toward bonds, after the surge in rates Friday, 
was also apparent at the Treasury's auction Tuesday of $17 billion in 
three-year notes. The average yield on the notes was 6.54%, slightly below 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury received bids totaling $48.25 billion for the notes, an 
indication of healthy demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three-year went real well," said Andrew Brenner, trader at Nomura 
Securities International. "I got lifted out of a lot of (bonds) today" by 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a sign of strong demand from small investors, the Treasury said it 
received $1.45 billion of non-competitive tenders for the notes, up from the 
$846 million for notes auctioned Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Such offers are usually submitted by small investors who agree to accept the 
average yield. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market overall, foreigners were thought to be active buyers, led 
by central banks using dollars they snapped up last week. Before U.S. markets 
opened, Middle East investors were said to have jumped into the bond market in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 "Large buyers from the Middle East who had been out for quite some time" 
stepped in, said Peter Mayers, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, shares rallied broadly, snapping a four-session losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials' gain of 27.37 points offset some of the 85 points lost in 
the last four sessions amid interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones 1,316 to 
881 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market was still uneasy about the prospects for higher 
short-term interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major concern is still that we're faced with a series of short-term rate 
hikes, beginning with the one that will probably happen next Tuesday," Jack 
Shaughnessy, research chief at Advest said, referring to next week's meeting of 
the Fed's policy-setting committee. "The question is: To be followed by how 
many more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebounding blue chip stocks included Caterpillar, up 1 1/8 to 106 3/4; IBM, 
up 1 to 58; Procter & Gamble, up 1 1/8 to 54 5/8; GM, up 1 5/8 to 55 1/2, and 
Anheuser-Busch, up 1 7/8 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, AT&T rose 1 1/8 to 52 7/8 on news that it has won a $4-billion contract 
to modernize telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks continued their recent rally. Pfizer rose 3/4 to 60 1/4, 
Warner-Lambert jumped 1 5/8 to 72 1/8, Johnson & Johnson gained 7/8 to 41 5/8 
and Merck was up 3/4 to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility stocks, many of which fell to five-year lows Monday, 
continued to be under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida utility FPL rebounded 1 5/8 to 29 1/8 after diving 4 3/8 on Monday, 
after it cut its dividend. But American Electric Power plunged 1 3/8 to 28, 
Houston Industries dropped 7/8 to 31 3/4 and SCEcorp eased 1/8 to 14 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Many overseas markets were higher. London's FTSE-100 index gained 38.5 points 
to 3,136.3 and Frankfurt's DAX index added 16.27 points to 2,235.15. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index soared 65.51 points to close at 2,213.09. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index added 130.82 points to 19,917.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodity markets, June crude oil futures eased 12 cents to $17.61 a 
barrel on the New York Merc, a retreat from the morning high of $17.90, which 
was a six-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 But gold slipped $2.40 to $378.80 an ounce at the Commodity Exchange in New 
York. Silver lost 12.8 cents to $5.32.

JAMES FLANIGAN: STILL FRETTING FOR THE ECONOMY? JUST LOOK AT THE AUTO BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Panic is caused by unstable prices and short memory. Turmoil in the financial 
markets is leading otherwise sensible people to lose their balance and to doubt 
the strength of the real economy. The Federal Reserve Board is criticized for 
acting too quickly or too slowly on interest rates; inflation or recession or 
both are coming, cry the doomsayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality is more complex and encouraging. The economy is truly strong and 
likely to be so for four or five years -- as can be seen from a good look at 
the automobile business. That most basic and evocative American industry is in 
its best shape in two decades and offers an excellent example of trends in the 
real economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, turmoil in financial markets may continue for a month or two. Stock 
and bond prices are bouncing around -- they rose Tuesday after a deep dive 
Monday -- not really because of inflation or Fed policy, but because billions 
of dollars of speculation in U.S. Treasury notes and bonds is being liquidated 
by big-money investors who borrowed heavily to play in the government bond 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 That's unnerving and affects interest rates for business, housing and personal 
loans. But such effects are temporary, as history shows. Similar bond market 
turmoil occurred in 1958, reports James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate 
Observer, in the "ostensibly serene years of the second Eisenhower 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Then as now, Grant relates, investors borrowed money to play the spread 
between low short-term interest rates and high long-term rates. Corporations, 
too, sought to pick up a quick buck speculating on interest rates -- as Procter 
& Gamble and others have done recently in derivatives. But all were confounded 
when Treasury bill rates rose from 1% in the summer of 1958 to 4% a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet back then, the stock market went right on rising and the real economy 
started its long, healthy, non-inflationary march through the first half of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates didn't stop the economy then. Nor is business activity 
slowing today. On the contrary, banks are lending to small business again for 
the first time since 1990. And they are pushing car loans for the first time in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the car business. U.S. car and truck sales are running at 
an annual rate of 15.5 million vehicles, which is almost historic. But most 
experts think sales will go even higher in the next few years. Chrysler and 
Ford are selling everything they make and expanding capacity. Furthermore, they 
have dramatically improved operations. Chrysler developed the new Neon in just 
31 months; Ford is unifying its manufacturing worldwide. General Motors is 
doing better than it has in a decade, with further product improvements coming 
in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is so heavy that Japanese car makers, whose prices have been forced up 
by the high yen, nonetheless are having a good year because leasing deals are 
moving cars for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet auto stocks are down -- Chrysler from $61 a share to about $46 currently, 
Ford from more than $70 a share to about $59, and General Motors from $65 to 
$55 -- because rising interest rates have frightened the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors think higher rates will slow car buying. But a look at the numbers 
tells you that's not so, says analyst Joseph Phillippi of Lehman Bros. "These 
higher rates will add about $7 a month to the average car loan payment," 
Phillippi says. "That won't stop this car rally." 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively new wrinkle, leasing, is moving cars out of showrooms. Individual 
leases, as opposed to company fleet deals, now account for more than one-fifth 
of all new cars purchased, says Doug Kevorkian, an automotive consultant in Ann 
Arbor, Mich. More than half of all luxury cars are leased, he adds, because 
leases allow for lower down payments and often lower monthly payments than a 
conventional loan. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that manufacturers subsidize leases through their finance 
companies, which leads some on Wall Street to worry about future write-offs if 
car values at the end of the leases are lower than financiers had predicted. 
The effect on the used car market is also imponderable. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so much else in America, the car business is changing. The rise of 
leasing, which experts think will level off at one-third of all cars sold, 
reflects different lifestyles. Many people like the idea of hassle-free service 
and a new luxury car every two years. Auto companies and dealers, in turn, like 
the idea of customers coming back all the time for repairs or a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 So cars will become somewhat like housing, where many people rent their homes. 
There will be financial innovation as markets develop automobile loan paper 
similar to mortgage pass-through certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one shadow on the rosy picture. U.S. car makers have taken advantage 
of their Japanese competitors' problems with the yen to raise prices 
themselves, taking profit today rather than market share for tomorrow. That 
could come back to haunt them, because U.S. auto makers are still a hair behind 
Toyota and Nissan, which can go from drawing board to finished car in 30 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 So it remains a competitive world. Still, Detroit in the next few years will 
move a lot of iron, as they say, and other industries will move a lot of 
merchandise and services too. The economy's strength is real. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't necessarily mean a bull market, says master investor Peter 
Lynch of Fidelity Investments. The next 12 months could see a further 12% 
decline in stock prices, Lynch said recently in Barron's. Such a bear market -- 
a decline of about 25% in major stock averages -- has occurred every six years 
throughout this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even that wouldn't stop profits of most U.S. companies from rising. And 
that's the reality that will drive stock prices higher over the next four to 
five years, Lynch said -- demonstrating that a long memory and a calm 
perspective are keys to understanding and investment success, especially in 
these panicky times.

CANCER CLINICS, MANAGED-CARE FIRM TEAM UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles operator of cancer clinics, in another sign of how managed 
health care is influencing medicine, said it has developed a method for 
improving the treatment of breast cancer while also restraining costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Salick Health Care and Value Health Inc., a 
Connecticut-based managed-care firm, is part of a growing effort in the health 
care industry to establish clinical guidelines for physicians' use in treating 
certain illnesses, particularly those that involve costly experimental 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of when and how to use expensive treatments for breast cancer and 
other major illnesses has become a point of conflict in the national debate 
over how to contain medical spending. Insurers nationwide have faced a number 
of lawsuits filed by patients who were denied coverage for treatments the 
insurers considered experimental. 
</P>
<P>
 Salick and Value Health said they have a set of clinical guidelines for breast 
cancer treatment developed by a panel of "internationally known academic and 
clinical experts." Specifically, the guidelines focus on one of the most 
controversial issues in medicine: the use of bone marrow transplantation to 
treat breast cancer. The guidelines are intended to provide standardized 
criteria to help insurers and doctors decide when a bone marrow transplant 
would be the appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue drew national attention in December, when a Riverside County 
Superior Court jury ordered Health Net, a health maintenance organization, to 
pay nearly $90 million in damages to the family of Nelene Fox, a Temecula woman 
who was denied coverage for a bone marrow transplant to fight her advanced 
breast cancer. She later died. Health Net recently settled with the Fox family 
for a lesser, undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bernard Salick, chief executive of Salick Health, which operates cancer 
centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and other prestigious hospitals, said 
the Health Net case put insurers on notice that they could face significant 
liability when they refuse to pay for certain medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Managed-care companies are begging for someone to give them a clear set of 
guidelines" to help them decide whether to cover certain tests, treatments or 
drugs, Salick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say to third-party payers, some of whom are very confused about 
whether or not to pay for bone marrow transplants, that . . . if a patient fits 
these guidelines, then that person gets a bone marrow transplant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Chris Desch, a professor at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, 
said there is "tremendous variation in how physicians care for patients -- and 
it's not just cancer. . . . There is disarray in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 "The guideline movement is trying to introduce some order and standards within 
the system," said Desch, who is helping to develop clinical guidelines for the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, two Duke University researchers reported that insurers can be 
"arbitrary and capricious" about covering autologous bone marrow transplants, 
even though they approve 77% of requests for such coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow transplants are widely used to treat leukemia, but many 
researchers consider them experimental in the treatment of breast cancer, a 
disease that strikes 180,000 women a year. A bone marrow transplant costs 
$100,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Armando Giuliano, medical director at the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast 
Center at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, said cancer 
specialists are debating whether "morbid and expensive procedures, such as 
high-dosage chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants, are really superior to 
standard therapies and whether they are worth the cost and risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing influence of HMOs, he said, will prompt other health care 
companies to develop clinical guidelines for other major illnesses. "It will 
probably catch steam as the health system changes from what we know it to one 
where costs must be carefully controlled," Giuliano said.

A MONSTROUS EFFORT; KOREAN AUTO MAKER KIA TACKLES THE L.A. MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The television ads feature a Godzilla-like creature named Gorgo stomping 
through downtown Tokyo as screaming residents flee the imperiled city. The 
message: "There's only one thing more frightening to Japan: a well-built car 
for under $8,500." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Japanese auto makers abandoned the low-priced new-car market in the 
United States several years ago. But there's no doubt that, despite the 
hyperbole, the television and billboard campaign is helping to establish 
America's newest import line, South Korean auto maker Kia Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its Feb. 3 premiere in Portland, Ore., Kia has opened 50 dealerships in 
the West and sold 2,600 of its compact economy cars, which are priced as low as 
$8,495. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kia is coming to greater Los Angeles -- the nation's toughest car market 
-- with the scheduled opening Thursday of 16 dealerships that cover a territory 
stretching from Bakersfield to Cathedral City but are concentrated in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers, all of which already sell other brands, are anxious to see if Kia 
will live up to its advertising or flop like the 1961 movie "Gorgo," in which 
Kia's monster mascot originally starred. 
</P>
<P>
 Although new to the United States, Kia has a track record. It sells cars under 
its own name in 90 countries and produces nearly 700,000 cars and trucks a 
year. With revenue of more than $4 billion last year, it ranks 333rd on 
Fortune's Global 500 list and is South Korea's second-largest car maker, after 
Hyundai Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Kia contracted with Ford Motor Co. to begin manufacturing the 
Ford-designed Festiva economy car. That successful venture has put more than 
800,000 Kia-built cars into American garages. Kia also builds the Ford Aspire, 
which replaced the Festiva this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Hyundai Motor America executive, W. Greg Warner, is chief operating 
officer of Kia's U.S. sales operation, which is headquartered in Irvine. 
Intimately familiar with Hyundai's spectacular 1986 launch -- and the myriad 
problems its early sales successes caused -- Warner is on a mission to ensure 
that Kia does not repeat Hyundai's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, he designed a go-slow approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia first is seeking a regional base, opening dealerships in quick succession 
in Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Northern California 
and, last month, San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is entering the U.S. market with only one model, the four-door 
Sephia, though Kia plans to introduce a sport utility vehicle in December and a 
mid-sized sedan next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And typically, it is the third or even fourth brand on its dealers' lots, 
which means Kia dealers don't need to make big investments in separate 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most reviews give the Sephia high marks for quality at a low to moderate price 
and find the styling acceptable, though not trend-setting. But Kia gets knocked 
for omitting air bags and for having the smallest engine in its class, which 
includes four-door versions of the Saturn, Ford Escort, Mazda Protege and, if 
one can be found, a base-priced Dodge Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, where Kias have been part of the Budget Rent-A-Car fleet since 
August, the Sephia -- which comes in three trim levels -- has become one of the 
city's best-selling four-door automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtesy Kia, the lone dealer in the Nevada gaming capital, sold 75 of the 
$8,500-$12,000 cars in just 23 days of February, according to owner Harold 
Drezner. There were more Sephias registered to private owners in Las Vegas that 
month than new four-door Honda Civics, Ford Escorts, Nissan Sentras or Toyota 
Corollas, according to data collected by independent analyst R.L. Polk & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one really expects the car to become a phenomenal seller overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts, Kia dealers and even the dark-suited executives at Kia 
Motors America Inc.'s headquarters say the goal is to start small and grow at a 
moderate pace while building a solid reputation for customer service and 
product reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner is determined that his company not repeat Hyundai's experience. When 
that company's subcompact Excel hit the market at less than $5,000, it was an 
instant hit. The factory opted to make as many cars as it could sell instead of 
the number its quality-control system could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hyundai set U.S. records for a new automobile franchise, selling 
more than 250,000 cars in its second year and almost a million by 1989. But 
then the bubble burst; its overzealousness left Hyundai with a reputation as a 
maker of inexpensive but unreliable cars. The image has hung on, though 
industry experts say the reliability problems have been cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner says Kia has produced a competitive economy car that meets or exceeds 
the basic quality standards set by the Japanese auto industry. Industry 
specialists such as Tom Dukes, competitive market analyst at J.D. Power & 
Associates, agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared not to like it," Dukes said, "but I was pleasantly surprised. 
All the fundamentals are there."  
</P>
<P>
 Jeannine Saniz certainly thinks so. And while positive reviews from 
consultants are nice, Saniz's opinion is more important -- because she actually 
bought a Sephia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old San Diego bank teller and her husband were about to purchase a 
$13,800 Geo Prizm -- the Toyota Corolla clone built in Northern California -- 
when Kia's advertising blitz in San Diego caught their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She drove 40 minutes to a new Kia dealership in Carlsbad last month to look at 
Sephias and drove away in a turquoise model with air conditioning, power 
steering, automatic transmission and an AM-FM radio and cassette player for 
just over $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $1,800 savings, Saniz said, she doesn't mind not having an air bag -- 
a safety device Kia says will arrive with its 1995 models. "We were really 
surprised at the quality for the price," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One item that helped clinch the sale: Kia provides a 36-month bumper-to-bumper 
warranty that includes 24-hour roadside service. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia's employees own the largest block of the company's stock, at 12%; Ford 
owns a 10% stake, and Japan's Mazda Motors Corp., which supplies the designs 
for Kia engines and transmissions, owns 8%. The rest of the company's shares 
are traded on the Korean Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee stake, as well as the Mazda and Ford links, are reasons that 
Carson auto retailing magnate Don Kott sought a Kia franchise. Kott already 
sells Fords, Lincolns, Mercurys, Chryslers, Plymouths, Isuzus and heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they build a good product," Kott said. "Of all the cars we've sold 
over the past 10 years, the Festiva has had the lowest incidence of repair." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 300-pound car dealer said there's another thing he likes about 
the Sephia: "I fit in it and am comfortable. And that's unlike a lot of small 
cars." New Kia on the Block 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is virtually unknown in the United States, South Korea's Kia Motors 
Corp. sells vehicles in 90 other countries. Car and light truck production 
figures for 1993 in major markets worldwide, in millions of units: 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors: 6.44 Ford Motor Co.: 5.60 Toyota Motor Corp.: 4.33 Nissan 
Motor Co.: 3.23 Volkswagen AG: 2.35 Chrysler Corp.: 2.28 Honda Motor Co.: 1.89

 Semiconductor Book-to-Bill Ratio Rises: The closely watched ratio rose to 1.14 
in April from 1.13 in March, the Semiconductor Industry Assn. said.A 
book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 means that for every $100 worth of products shipped, 
or billed, manufacturers received $114 in new orders, or bookings. The ratio is 
computed by dividing three-month average bookings by three-month average 
billings. April bookings rose 4.6% to $2.89 billion from $2.76 billion in 
March. April billings rose 3.6% to $2.53 billion from $2.44 billion in March. 
Analysts said the ratio came in much better than expected.

 Peoples Calls Off Merger: Peoples Telephone Co. abandoned its planned 
$280-million merger with IDB Communications, citing IDB's low stock price and 
attempts to renegotiate the deal.IDB's plan to buy Peoples would have created 
the nation's fourth-largest long-distance company, but Peoples said it was 
highly unlikely that the companies could reach a final agreement. The merger 
was negotiated based on an IDB stock price of a minimum $16 a share, but it has 
consistently closed below that, Peoples Chairman Jeffrey Hanft said. Culver 
City-based IDB is an international telecommunications carrier. Miami-based 
Peoples owns and operates about 50,000 public, prison and cellular pay 
telephones in 46 states.

 Cutbacks Ordered at Kaleida Labs: International Business Machines Corp. and 
Apple Computer Inc. told their joint venture to cut its work force by 20% and 
focus on its core multimedia technology.Mountain View, Calif.-based Kaleida 
Labs Inc. said it will now "focus completely" on delivering its ScriptX 
multimedia development product and eliminating jobs not essential to rushing 
the software to market. Kaleida will also stop working on software to control 
the basic functions of set-top boxes, the devices that will bring such services 
as movies-on-demand to the living room. "Our vision has not changed; we have 
only redefined our plans to implement it," said Mike Braun, Kaleida's chief

 Three Media Vision Directors Resign: The beleaguered maker of multimedia 
products for computers that has watched its shares plummet to almost nothing 
from $46.50 in January, announced that the three board members have resigned 
and that it has closed a software development office. The company, based in 
Fremont, Calif., is being scrutinized by the FBI and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission after allegations of securities violations came to light. 
With the closure of the facility in Bellevue, Wash., development of some 
software titles has shifted to another office in Westlake Village.

elected to the additional post of chairman, replacing Michael Walsh, who died 
Friday following a 16-month battle with brain cancer.Mead, 58, joined Tenneco 
in 1992 as president and chief operating officer. He became chief executive in 
February, after Walsh stepped down for health reasons. Although Walsh, 51, 
retained the chairman's title, he had been on a medical leave of absence and 
Mead had been carrying out the chairman's duties. The Houston-based oil company

AIR CANADA PICKS AIRBUS FOR $1-BILLION ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Canada spurned American manufacturers Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. on Tuesday and placed a billion-dollar order with the European consortium 
Airbus Industrie for A-319 twin-jet aircraft to replace its DC-9 fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Canada said it signed a letter of intent to lease 25 new A-319s, with 
options on an additional 10 aircraft.No value was given for the order, but 
industry analysts said it is worth about $1 billion when options are included. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said competition for the Air Canada order was fierce among major 
manufacturers, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Fokker of the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline said last year it would modernize its aging McDonnell Douglas DC-9 
fleet to extend its operating life. But Tuesday's order with Airbus appears to 
have ended that deal. Air Canada said the decision means it will "review its 
plans" related to the DC-9s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selection of the A-319 was based on obtaining attractive acquisition 
terms for an aircraft offering excellent operating economics and increased 
revenue generating capability," Air Canada Chief Executive Hollis Harris said.

LOCKHEED ALLOTS $150 MILLION TO IMAGE SERVICE; VENTURE: PARTNERS ARE SOUGHT FOR 
SATELLITE-BASED PHOTO AND MAPPING BUSINESS. DIVIDEND IS RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. plans to invest at least $150 million in a satellite-based 
Earth image service it expects to launch in 1997 with the help of outside 
partners, Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the project, called the Commercial Remote Sensing System, Lockheed would 
use a satellite to supply map makers, geographic researchers, energy 
exploration firms and others with aerial pictures of Earth that have much more 
detail and resolution than photos available to commercial users in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department last month awarded Calabasas-based Lockheed a license 
to begin the business, after the federal government issued guidelines allowing 
companies to commercially market certain types of satellite technology that had 
been reserved for military and intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aerospace firms, including Beverly Hills-based Litton Industries and 
Orbital Sciences Corp. of Virginia, are pursuing the same market. Orbital 
recently entered a joint venture, called Eyeglass, to market such images. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed also wants to enlist partners, domestic and foreign, to help finance 
and distribute its service, Tellep told reporters after Lockheed's annual 
meeting in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to approach a broad cross-section of aerospace firms for 
partners, and has already taken part in exploratory, technical discussions 
about the project with Hughes Aircraft Co., Loral Corp. and E-Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep would not predict the service's sales potential but noted that the 
worldwide market for aerial photography is estimated at $1.7 billion a year, 
and sales of other geographic data may be worth as much as $3 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Touching briefly on several other issues, Tellep said Lockheed is less likely 
to pursue another takeover of a defense firm because prices of recent merger 
deals have climbed too high. 
</P>
<P>
 He referred particularly to Northrop Corp.'s recent purchase of Grumman Corp. 
for $2.2 billion and Loral's buyout of IBM Corp.'s Federal Systems division 
early this year for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, which last year bought the F-16 fighter jet line from General 
Dynamics Corp. for $1.5 billion, also looked at Grumman, but, Tellep said, "we 
couldn't justify getting into the bidding" at the prices Grumman was fetching. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed also announced an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend, to 57 cents 
a share from 53 cents. The dividend is payable June 6 to stockholders of record 
May 23. The company is also studying whether to buy back more of its stock, 
Tellep said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both announcements helped Lockheed's shares Tuesday. The stock climbed $1.25 
to $60.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading.

MAN GETS $1-MILLION WORKERS' COMP AWARD; COURT: STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE 
FUND IS PENALIZED FOR WITHHOLDING EX-ENGINEER'S REHABILITATION BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the biggest workers' compensation penalties assessed in California, 
an insurance company has been ordered to pay more than $1 million to a Los 
Angeles man whose rehabilitation benefits were improperly cut off for 4 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the criticism against the state's troubled workers' compensation 
system has focused on fraud by insurance claimants and their doctors and 
lawyers, the recently imposed penalty reflects an often-overlooked issue: 
insurers who drag their feet for years in handling claims, driving many 
disabled people into poverty or bullying them into unfair settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent case, State Compensation Insurance Fund was found by a Los 
Angeles workers' compensation court referee to have "unreasonably" withheld 
vocational rehabilitation checks to a worker who claimed psychological stress 
and related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The referee, Barbara Burke, also penalized SCIF -- the state's biggest 
workers' compensation insurer -- for repeatedly underpaying the engineer even 
after resuming his rehabilitation checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves former South Coast Air Quality Management District engineer 
John McGregor, who was 61 when he filed his injury claim in 1983. The Los 
Angeles resident -- who worked for the AQMD and a predecessor agency for 33 
years -- claims he developed psychiatric, voice and cardiovascular problems 
after being unfairly pressured by management to quit his job. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor reached a settlement with SCIF in 1986 for $36,500 that covered lost 
wages and medical bills. But it left open the issue of vocational 
rehabilitation and related living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, McGregor decided to pursue voice "retraining" to help him 
overcome speech problems and become a real estate agent. Contending that his 
strained voice stemmed from the stress of his job at the AQMD, he sought 
vocational rehabilitation payments from SCIF. 
</P>
<P>
 Although SCIF initially approved the payments, it cut them off in late 1987 
based on medical evaluations that the voice retraining was unnecessary, 
according to SCIF spokesman Ron Christensen. Christensen said the company 
believed it was on solid legal ground so it continued to withhold all payments 
until suffering a legal reversal in the case in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 SCIF's subsequent under-payments to McGregor, Christensen said, stemmed from 
"miscalculations" of what was owed in fines, and he acknowledged that other 
"missteps" were made during a period while the company reviewed its actions in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen portrayed the case as being emblematic of how the state's 
much-criticized workers' compensation system "has gone mad." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of vocational rehabilitation is to put people back to work, he 
said, "not to make a semi-retired man independently wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case where technicalities show the flaws in the system," 
Christensen added. "This should have been a minor expense but it's expanded 
into something enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor, who represented himself in the case after studying workers' 
compensation law on his own, said in an interview Tuesday that he pressed his 
case because of the "arrogance" the company showed. He said SCIF 
representatives "laughed in his face" when he proposed various rehabilitation 
settlements. Back in 1987, McGregor said, the company turned down a 
rehabilitation plan that would have cost well under $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an isolated case," McGregor said, referring to SCIF's delays and 
under-payments. "The worker, unless he can do something for himself, is a pawn 
of the insurance companies and workers' compensation attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, the workers' compensation court referee, also has sharply criticized 
the company's actions. In one of her rulings in the drawn-out case, she said 
SCIF's refusal to pay McGregor "what he was owed despite repeated demands and 
threats of penalty and the years of delay have made this a case from hell" for 
him. Burke's most recent ruling, imposing 20 penalties on SCIF, was issued 
quietly last month and has not previously been disclosed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the penalties and back interest, along with a small amount of 
rehabilitation-related expenses, will cost SCIF at least $1.5 million. That 
includes $1.17 million paid last month, as a result of the referee's latest 
ruling, and $331,000 paid previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McGregor is seeking further penalties in an appeal filed with the 
seven-member Workers' Compensation Appeals Board in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen said that in the future, costly disputes over vocational 
rehabilitation are far less likely because rehabilitation costs now are 
normally limited to $16,000 per injury under a reform package passed by the 
California Legislature last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the key injury claimed by McGregor, psychological stress, is expected to 
come up less frequently in workers' compensation cases because of tighter 
standards adopted in the reform package.

AFFORDABILITY OF HOMES NEAR 20-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although rising mortgage rates narrowed the typical American family's ability 
to buy a home, affordability was at the second-highest level in 20 years in the 
first quarter, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the recent rise in mortgage rates, affordability conditions remain at 
a level not seen in more than two decades," said Robert H. Elrod, president of 
the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said its housing affordability index was at 140.9 for January 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that was down from 141.9 in the final three months of 1993, it was 
the second-highest level of affordability since the index stood at 145.1 in the 
second quarter of 1973. It was 132.5 during the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed rates on 30-year mortgages averaged 7.30% during the first three months 
of the year, up from a 25-year low of 6.74% last October, according to the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. As of last week, the average rate had risen to 
8.53%, the highest since it was 8.54% on June 12, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 When the housing affordability index reaches 100, a family earning the median 
income has exactly the amount needed to purchase a median-priced, previously 
owned house with conventional financing and a 20% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the median is the midpoint, the composite index shows that half the 
families in the nation had at least 140.9% of the income needed to qualify to 
buy a home priced at the median $107,400. 
</P>
<P>
 The median household income was $38,310, so the typical family could afford a 
home costing $151,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Elrod said the real estate industry expects market conditions to remain 
steady, "which could open the home ownership door for thousands of families 
this year -- both first-time and repeat buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The first-time buyer index was 91.6, up from 86.7 during the first quarter of 
1993 but down from 91.9 in the final three months of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 When the index equals 100, the typical first-time buyer can afford the typical 
starter home with a 10% down payment. Housing Affordability 
</P>
<P>
 The affordability index measures the ability of a typical American family to 
buy a home. A reading of 100 means that a family earning the median annual 
income of $38,310 had 100% of the income needed to purchase a median-priced, 
previously owned house with conventional financing and a 20% down payment. The 
index, quarterly: March, 1988: 111.63 June: 111.40 Sept.: 110.63 Dec.: 112.10 
March, 1989: 107.60 June: 101.40 Sept.: 101.47 Dec.: 106.40 March, 1990: 106.60 
June: 105.27 Sept.: 107.13 Dec.: 114.23 March, 1991: 112.27 June: 110.13 Sept.: 
110.50 Dec.: 120.03 March, 1992: 120.13 June: 119.17 Sept.: 126.63 Dec.: 129.40 
March, 1993: 132.20 June: 132.83 Sept.: 135.53 Dec.: 141.53 March, 1994: 140.90

 Jett Asks Judge to Expedite Release of Money: Joseph Jett, the bond trader 
fired by Kidder, Peabody & Co. for allegedly reporting bogus profits, broke his 
silence to say Kidder has been "extremely unfair" in handling his case and that 
he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Jett and his lawyers filed an application in 
New York State Supreme Court for expedited arbitration of a claim for release 
of almost $5 million of his money being held by Kidder. Jett refused to comment 
on the allegations that are being investigated by the U.S. attorney's office in 
Manhattan and the SEC.

 Appeals Court Upholds Judgment Against Universal: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals affirmed a 1991 jury verdict for $11.6 million in favor of Accent 
Films against Universal Pictures. Accent had claimed that Universal in 1983 
breached a contract to distribute the Roman Polanski film "Pirates."The film, 
eventually released by MGM/UA in 1986, was a box office flop. Accent had 
claimed that Universal refused to pay $18 million of the $27-million budget of 
the film for U.S. and Canadian distribution rights, while Universal argued that 
it had the right to reject the distribution agreement. Lawyers for Accent said 
they expect to collect $13.5 million from Universal to cover the judgment and 
accumulated interest. Universal said it has no plans to appeal the ruling.

 GTE Directories Loses Lawsuit: A federal jury in Los Angeles awarded a small 
electrical contracting firm $5.2 million in a breach-of-contract suit with GTE 
Directories Corp. Jessen Electric & Services Co. of Seattle filed suit in 1992 
after it said GTE withdrew a 35% discount available for yellow pages 
advertising anywhere in the country. The company, which also has operations in 
Oregon and Northern California, was also unable to advertise in GTE yellow 
pages unless it agreed to relinquish the discount, said Jessen's attorney. A 
spokeswoman for GTE said the company is studying its options, including 
appealing the award.

 Peugeot to Sell Electric Cars: The French car maker said it will sell electric 
cars in specially equipped French cities this fall, thus launching Europe's 
most ambitious electric vehicle project to date. Sales, and assembly-line 
production of the cars by the end of the year, won't succeed unless the French 
government offers up to $5,300 in tax breaks to offset the cars' price 
difference with gasoline-powered vehicles, PSA Peugeot Citroen said. The 
converted PSA subcompacts can travel just 50 miles before needing an eight-hour 
recharge at home or a two-hour recharge at special electrical outlets installed 
in town centers.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: OPTIMISM ON RISE, BONDS MAY YET SEE A TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors who've been waiting for a convincing sign that longer-term interest 
rates are peaking -- at least temporarily -- may have gotten it on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Treasury offered $17 billion in three-year notes to the public, the 
response from small investors was extraordinary. "Non-competitive" purchase 
orders for the notes, the kind of order usually submitted by individuals, 
totaled $1.45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, $846 million in non-competitive orders came in for three-year 
notes at the last such Treasury auction, in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, three-year notes were yielding about 4.7% annually. Now they pay 
6.5%. To a significant number of small investors, 6.5% must look like an 
attractive yield if they're willing to be stuck with it for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly the kind of change in psychology that the bond market needs to 
stabilize, after more than three months of surging interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 And while individual investors buying T-notes can't turn the bond market 
around by themselves, they may soon get more help. There are indications that 
foreign investors also have decided that U.S. rates have reached levels too 
attractive to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's value rocketed Tuesday versus key foreign currencies, which bond 
traders said was in part the work of foreign investors buying dollars to use 
for Treasury bond purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the dollar was falling between January and last week, foreigners had no 
incentive to buy U.S. bonds, because every drop in the dollar devalued U.S. 
assets held by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the Clinton Administration has decided to defend the currency, 
foreign investors can see a double-barreled payoff in buying U.S. bonds if the 
dollar is in an upswing: They can lock in decent yields, plus get the gift of 
price appreciation if the dollar keeps rising. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rosenberg, who runs the Oppenheimer U.S. Government Trust bond mutual 
fund in New York, is one pro willing to bet that the turn in the dollar also 
signals that bond yields have reached at least a near-term crest. On Tuesday, 
he bought some 10-year Treasury notes, yielding about 7.3% annually, for his 
$325-million fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg believes that the latest sharp jump in long-term yields, which 
occurred Friday in response to the strong April employment report and resultant 
inflation paranoia, represented the kind of capitulation often seen when market 
moves reach the "blow-off" stage. "People were throwing up their hands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, Rosenberg noted, many professional traders jumped on the gloom 
bandwagon, "shorting" Treasury bonds ahead of the three-year note auction 
Tuesday and today's planned Treasury auction of 10-year notes. In a short sale, 
traders sell borrowed bonds, betting they can replace them with cheaper bonds 
later on. 
</P>
<P>
 When bonds appreciated Tuesday (as yields fell) instead of depreciating as the 
shorts expected, some of the shorts were forced to buy bonds on the open market 
to cover their wrong-way bets. Combined with genuine demand from small 
investors and the sudden buying interest on the part of foreigners, the bond 
market rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 But can this rally stick? Each time bond yields started to pull back in recent 
months, more "bad" news came along (usually in the form of healthy economic 
reports) that reignited worries about inflation returning as the economy 
expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, to be bullish on bonds now, you have to assume that yields have reached 
a level that takes into account almost any additional signs of economic 
expansion imaginable in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be the view of individuals buying three-year T-notes at 6.5%. 
The next group that must be convinced consists of Rosenberg's peers, U.S. bond 
fund managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Bannan, manager of the Phoenix Balanced fund in East Hartford, Conn., 
is a case in point. Short-term "cash" assets make up nearly 25% of her fund's 
$2.8 billion total. Of the rest, 45% is in stocks and 30% is in bonds. If she 
were to decide that rates had peaked and that bonds were attractive, she'd have 
lots of cash to put to work. 
</P>
<P>
 What would make her a buyer? First, Bannan says, the Federal Reserve Board has 
to take "real action" to show it's serious about keeping money tight enough to 
restrain inflation. That means a half-point rise in the Fed's benchmark 
short-term interest rate, from 3.75% to 4.25%, she says -- a move she hopes to 
see next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, "I need to see signs that the economy isn't that strong," Bannan says. 
A month or two of mostly moderate economic reports could convince her, she 
allows. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a chance that neither of her wishes will be granted, of course. But 
with small investors and foreigners already moving into bonds, even a minor 
turn in sentiment by U.S. fund managers could be enough to spark a dramatic 
rally in this beaten-up market. Rates don't go up forever -- at least not in a 
straight line. Enough may be enough. Enough Is Enough? 
</P>
<P>

TAX HIKES EYED FOR FUNDS LOST UNDER GATT; REVENUE: ADMINISTRATION EXAMINES 
OPTIONS FOR MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR LOSS OF TARIFFS THAT MUST BE REPLACED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Higher taxes and spending cuts that would hit broadcasters, retailers, farmers 
and chemical companies are being considered to make up revenue that would be 
lost under a new world trade agreement, Administration officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, President Clinton kicked off a lobbying campaign for the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to adopt the (agreement) this year," Clinton told a coalition of 
industry, labor and elected officials. "This is about exports and jobs. It's 
also about our leadership in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 While predicting that opposition can be overcome and the world trade agreement 
approved this year, the President acknowledged that the Administration has not 
yet found a way to address the thorniest problem: how to make up between $12.5 
billion and $14 billion in federal revenue that would be lost when tariffs are 
reduced. Under congressional budget rules, any lost revenue must be offset by 
spending cuts or tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said his economic team is still trying to resolve that question. 
Administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a package 
of spending cuts and tax increases has been put together and is being shown to 
congressional leaders in an effort to win support. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the options include raising $4.8 billion by taxing radio 
and television stations for their use of the public air waves and making $3.1 
billion in additional cuts in farm subsidy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals under active review, these officials said, are raising $1.5 
billion from reauthorizing a hazardous-waste cleanup tax on chemical companies, 
$1.3 billion in higher taxes primarily on retailers by changing tax rules 
covering business inventories, $600 million from a new tax on gambling 
earnings, $500 million by taxing free parking provided by companies to their 
employees, and another $500 million from collecting certain corporate taxes 
quarterly instead of annually. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor refused to discuss details of the 
package Tuesday but told reporters that the Administration is counting on 
broad, bipartisan support for whatever proposal is reached in negotiations with 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, strong opposition has already surfaced among affected interest groups 
to the point that other Administration officials concede that the agreement, 
negotiated under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is 
facing growing opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty members of the House sent a letter to Clinton on Friday complaining that 
farmers are being unfairly singled out to pay for 40% of the lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate letter signed by 55 House members has urged Clinton to delay a vote 
on the trade pact until next year, citing the difficulties in making up the 
lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), an important ally in last fall's struggle to 
win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, said he will probably 
oppose the GATT accord because of concerns that actions of the more powerful 
World Trade Organization will result in a loss of U.S. sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 The GATT accord, which lowers tariffs and other trade barriers among more than 
100 countries, will be considered under the same fast-track procedures that 
governed last fall's debate on NAFTA, which the Administration won in a close 
vote in the House after a furious lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking to the Administration's trade advisory panel, said he is 
willing to consider a waiver of the congressional budget rules requiring that 
lost revenue be replaced, but only if there is "clear, deep and bipartisan 
consensus" in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the Administration is not actively seeking such a waiver, and he 
indicated that it plans to put forward a revenue replacement package. 
</P>
<P>
 The President did confirm that the Administration will try to replace only the 
$12.5 billion to $14 billion that will be lost in the first five years of the 
agreement -- not the larger $40 billion that will be lost over 10 years.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; ON-LINE NEIGHBORHOODS YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love to stroll around in major cities, but I wouldn't dream of venturing out 
at night without knowing which areas to avoid. I never get in a car without 
buckling up. My wife and I encourage our young children to read books and watch 
an occasional TV show, but we make sure the material is appropriate. Life is 
risky, but prudence beats paranoia any day. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true when it comes to using the Internet or on-line services such 
as Prodigy, America Online or CompuServe. They offer a trove of valuable 
information and services for adults and kids, but there are some danger spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek recently profiled a pedophile who used an on-line service to lure 
children whom he later sexually molested. A recent episode of CBS' "Eye to Eye 
with Connie Chung" focused on a stalker who used an on-line service to send 
harassing and threatening electronic mail and bulletin board messages to people 
he met on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Should these stories dissuade you from exploring on "the Net"? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to harassment and danger, on-line services are no different than 
the post office, the phone company or the local shopping mall. Each of these 
institutions does what it can to protect its customers, but none can guarantee 
safety and comfort. Nevertheless, most people continue to open their mail, 
answer their phone and shop -- for the most part safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Crank or obscene e-mail is especially hard to control. The Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 requires public e-mail and on-line services 
to protect the privacy of the sender and receiver. As a result, there is no way 
for the service to routinely screen the content of a message, any more than the 
phone company or postal service can screen incoming mail or calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages posted on on-line bulletin boards or forums and Internet "newsgroups" 
are not private -- they can be read by anyone who has access to the network. If 
they're inappropriate, they can be deleted by the service's system operator, or 
"sysop," who is responsible for maintaining the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get a harassing, threatening or obscene e-mail message, you can forward 
a copy to your service provider, who can take action, including removing the 
sender from the service or, if appropriate, contacting law enforcement 
officials. Because virtually all public e-mail systems are linked via the 
Internet, it's possible for the message to originate from another service, 
possibly even from overseas. Your service provider can help you track down the 
source of the message, but there's no guarantee the culprit will be found. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be able to prevent someone from striking twice. Some services and 
software packages have what are commonly referred to as "bozo filters," which 
let you weed out mail or even public bulletin board messages from unwanted 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise common sense when posting or responding to public notices on computer 
bulletin boards or forums. Unlike e-mail, your responses can be read by anyone 
with access to the service. Never give out your home address, and be very 
careful when it comes to personal or financial information. Consider using a 
pseudonym if your service allows it. Responding to messages that are sexually 
explicit or suggestive could tag you as a potential harassment victim. At the 
very least, anyone reading your response will know your e-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon for people who meet on-line to arrange face-to-face 
meetings, sometimes resulting in friendships, business relationships or even 
marriage. But if you do arrange a meeting, make the first one in a public spot, 
such as a restaurant, where you feel safe.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents should never use a computer or an on-line service as an electronic 
baby sitter. Just because kids are on-line doesn't mean they're engaged in 
productive or appropriate behavior. Most Internet systems, for example, provide 
access to newsgroups (forums, really) that feature sexually explicit stories, 
graphics and even short video clips with virtually no limits on content. 
</P>
<P>
 The major commercial on-line services generally do not permit the posting of 
sexually explicit material. A few racy graphics or stories might get through. 
One exception is CompuServe's Human Sexuality Forum, which includes erotic 
stories. Although it's not foolproof, the forum does employ measures to screen 
out minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what service you use, children should be warned never to give 
out personal information and to tell their parents if they encounter mail or 
messages that make them feel uncomfortable. They should never agree to a 
face-to-face meeting unless their parents are present. Don't alarm your 
children, but do remind them that not everyone on-line is a good citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Remind your children that people on-line are not always what they seem to be. 
A message from what appears to be a 12-year-old girl, for example, could really 
be from a 30-year-old man. Children should be especially careful in live 
interactive chat areas, and parents should be aware that even the commercial 
services carry frank discussions that might be inappropriate for some children. 
Some services allow parents to block access to areas that may be inappropriate 
for their children.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; MONITORING THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR KID AND COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 See child. See child compute. See child slip a penny into the floppy-disk 
drive, rendering it useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are born nerds and seem to take to microchips almost as readily as 
chocolate chips. For parents, placing that beloved computer in those grimy 
little hands is a rite of passage akin to handing over the car keys for the 
first time -- and just as fraught with peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's great they feel comfortable with the infernal machines. But with 
computers, new opportunities for learning entail new opportunities for 
mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a parent protect the computer from the child, not to mention the 
child from the computer? Are computer-addicted kids just a different flavor of 
couch potato? Can kids call "Dibs!" on the computer the way they do on the 
front seat of the car? And then there's The Expense, The Expense, The Expense. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this, of course, is enough reason to toss the tricycle off the 
information superhighway. For the most part, parents tend to balance their 
concerns and data catastrophes with the thought that the skills their little 
darlings pick up today can be employed later to help support Mom and Dad in 
their dotage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena public relations executive John Echeveste is a computer-afflicted 
parent. Like others of his kind, he loves to boast about his two sons' 
computing skills, and recalls only after much prodding the downside of kids and 
computers. Like the time a few years ago when Echeveste was in the middle of 
writing a major proposal and his younger son, entranced by the red light on the 
computer's surge protector, crawled over and flicked the thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost everything," Echeveste said ruefully. "So if you have a surge 
protector, don't leave it on the floor. Those flashing red lights are like a 
beacon for small kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old twins John and Kate McGlynn recently discovered that if they 
entered naughty words into a reading program marketed by their mother's 
employer, Broderbund, the computer dutifully pronounced the words back at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was so much fun," said Erin McGlynn, sales support manager at 
Novato, Calif.-based Broderbund. The company's sales force was less amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer consultant Charles Taft, who writes about family computing issues for 
several publications, recalls being stymied by a client's unresponsive computer 
-- until a Lego tumbled out of the disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right about that time, the 5-year-old dived for cover behind the couch," Taft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 These things happen when small children and big-ticket electronics end up in 
the same room. But there are gadgets and software designed to protect your 
machine and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical locks or other impediments can be placed in front of disk and CD-ROM 
drives to ward off errant Barbie shoes, and form-fitted plastic sleeves can be 
slipped over keyboards to shield against chance encounters with apple juice. 
For repeat offenders, the entire computer can be locked inside a piece of 
special furniture, like a high-tech roll-top desk or a computer armoire, for 
when the parents aren't around. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can set up their systems so children are restricted to certain areas; 
among such software is KidDesk, by Edmark, which sets up a special computer 
desk just for children, locking them out of the grown-ups' stuff. On the flip 
side, some children's programs allow kids to set up special codes so the old 
folks can't read their files. 
</P>
<P>
 But as in any child-related endeavor, the best defense is a good set of rules 
that are enforced with consistency, says consultant Taft, the father of 
8-year-old Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to teach computer manners," he said. "The computer is a valuable and 
expensive object in the house, and it must be treated that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft said he and Benjamin have agreed to certain ground rules that include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Don't touch the screen." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Never hit the computer, no matter how mad you get." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Never use pirated software." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Always scan outside software for viruses." 
</P>
<P>
 "You set limits that are fair limits and you stick with them," Taft said. 
"Infractions are summarily dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 FutureKids, a fast-growing chain of computer learning centers, teaches its 
youthful charges about computer etiquette before tackling clicking, dragging 
and other fun topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do take certain precautions in terms of food and other things," said Peter 
Markovitz, co-founder of the Los Angeles-based company. "But computers are 
quite hardy, and children seem to find that no matter what, these things do 
endure." 
</P>
<P>
 Fights between siblings or between child and parent over who gets the computer 
next can also be a good learning opportunity for such low-tech values as 
sharing and moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our classes are cooperative so that there are two to a computer," 
said Sherie Samstag, owner of the Irvine FutureKids franchise. "That's by 
design, because you learn more with a partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Sibling rivalry throws a more unpredictable element into the mix, Samstag 
acknowledged. Parents can ease those conflicts by strictly scheduling computer 
time, which has the added advantage of lifting the computer out of the realm of 
the toy box. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lifelong skill, and it's a skill that you cannot afford your kids 
to get bored with," Samstag said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other worries, lighten up, the experts say. Exercise the same sort 
of moderation you know you're supposed to use with the television set: Don't 
leave the kids there all day, and don't let them contort their bodies while 
they're in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-fashioned parental supervision goes a long way, especially with older 
children, who can get themselves into all sorts of trouble with a modem and a 
natural curiosity about adult bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 And comfort yourself with the hope that the children are learning something 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computers are powerful tools that can be used for good or for ill," said 
Santa Monica-based computer consultant Ken Laskin, who has introduced dozens of 
preschoolers to the Computer Age. "It's something parents have to be constantly 
vigilant about." TECH TIPS / Coping With Kids Who Compute 
</P>
<P>
 A few things to keep in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make some basic rules -- no hitting the computer, for example -- and enforce 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make frequent backups of your data and store them at a safe distance from 
the PC. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a password, menuing program or special software environment for kids to 
protect your own setup. 
</P>
<P>
 * As in all things, practice moderation.

 The good news is that you don't have to worry about those pesky subscription 
cards and scratch-and-sniff inserts. The bad news is that to get magazines 
without these annoyances, you have to ferret around on the Internet.Still, 
subscribing to electronic magazines can be worth the effort. They're typically 
free, and they often deal with narrow subjects you won't find on the newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 electronic "zines" are available on the Internet, from the 
Journal of the American Academy of Research Historians of Medieval Spain to 
Z*Net International PC Online Magazine for Atari. Zines are delivered as 
electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 One interesting offering: Edupage, a summary of the week's news on information 
technology. To subscribe, send e-mail to listproc@ivory.educom.edu with the 
message subscribe EDUPAGE (your e-mail address here). You will get back a 
confirmation when your subscription is processed. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial list of electronic magazines can be retrieved by typing gopher 
etext.archive.umich.edu at the prompt, then looking under "Zines." Or send 
e-mail to listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca with the message GET EJOURNL1 DIRECTRY 
and GET EJOURNL2 DIRECTRY on two separate lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of Research Libraries publishes the most complete and authoritative 
list of electronic magazines; unfortunately, it is not available 
electronically. The third edition is titled "Directory of Electronic Journals, 
Newsletters and Academic Discussion Lists" and costs $47. Call (202) 296-8656. 
</P>
<P>
 To discontinue an electronic subscription, you must send a message telling the 
publisher to take you off the mailing list. For example, to stop Edupage, send 
e-mail to listproc@ivory.educom.edu with the message signoff EDUPAGE (your 
e-mail address). ADAM S. BAUMAN

 Video-on-demand would appear to be still in the future for most households 
with a TV set. Not so for guests who check into a hotel these days. Comsat 
Video Enterprises already offers a wide choice of movies at several hundred 
thousand Hilton Hotels, Embassy Suites, Marriotts, Holiday Inns and other 
hotels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Comsat's On Command Video has been limited by its use of analog tape 
players linked to each guest room by the hotel's cable system. A hotel worker 
has to grab the tape you ordered, slam it into a tape player and press the play 
button. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Comsat has teamed with computer maker Silicon Graphics to develop a 
digital storage system that will slash the time between ordering a movie and 
receiving it, as well as allow for more frequent updates of films. 
</P>
<P>
 A peek into the future: Last month Comsat joined Bell Atlantic, Marriott 
Hotels and the 4th Communications Network in announcing the test of interactive 
multimedia yellow pages and shopping service at the Santa Clara, Calif., 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailmobile delivers: Neither rain nor sleet nor even a bad hangover deters 
this mail deliverer from its appointed rounds. That's because it is a $28,000 
robot from Bell & Howell called the Mailmobile. Automated mail carriers have 
been around for a while, but most depend on wires or electronic sensors buried 
in the floor to guide them on their appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Mailmobile relies on a fluorescent material sprayed on carpet 
or flooring. The chemical is invisible under standard light, but when exposed 
to ultraviolet light, it turns a bright green, enabling photocells in the 
Mailmobile to follow its path. A fluorescent bar-code-like pattern is placed 
where the Mailmobile is to stop. A soft chime or blinking light announces its 
arrival to nearby employees. 
</P>
<P>
 When a company reconfigures an office floor or expands into a new wing, a new 
mail route can be added quickly and cleanly. The Mailmobile -- known in some 
offices as "Luke Carpetwalker" or "Beeping Tom" -- is already hard at work at 
the Lockheed Federal Credit Union in Burbank, Xerox in Santa Ana, Mattel Toys 
in El Segundo and the California Department of Transportation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 New breath test: Your breath can reveal more than whether you've just eaten 
garlic or had too much to drink. Rutgers University physicist Daniel E. Murnick 
and Brian J. Peer, a former research associate in Murnick's lab, have developed 
an instrument that can use a patient's breath in diagnosing such medical 
problems as peptic ulcers, liver and colon dysfunctions and metabolic 
disorders.  
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, the breath test would obviate the radioactive isotopes now used in 
diagnostic tests, doing away with the problems of possible harmful exposure and 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new laser-based analyzer isolates and measures naturally occurring 
isotopes (elements with extra neutrons and slightly different weights, which 
allow them to be traced). If a patient is suspected of suffering from an ulcer, 
he or she can be given a tablet containing an excess of carbon 13. Exhaled 
breath is then analyzed by the laser to determine if there is any increase in 
carbon.  
</P>
<P>
 Such an increase would indicate the presence of the bacterium associated with 
ulcers, because the bacterium is the only one able to metabolize the carbon 13. 
The analyzer has been licensed to Diagnostics & Devices Inc. of Bernardsville, 
N.J., for commercialization. Other potential uses might include tracing 
pollutants in the environment.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CASE STUDY: HOW 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A BUSINESS; AT SMART & FINAL, SOME SAVVY COMPUTER BUYS ENDED 
A CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smart & Final's inventory managers were at the end of their rope. Shipments 
were disappearing into the company's vast warehouse in Vernon. Space was 
running out. Employees couldn't put their hands on what customers needed fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that Smart & Final's powerful mainframe computer system was 
too rigid to help keep timely track of the 150,000 items shipped every day. The 
company was considering building a new warehouse -- or moving out of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Smart & Final -- the oldest "cash and carry" retail chain in 
the country -- had more room than it realized. Now, without moving, it can keep 
track of every roll of toilet paper and box of rice that comes into the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did it by using a computer system that keeps track of the stock in 
"real time." This is important because, with the warehouse operating at more 
than 95% capacity (80% is ideal), having unaccounted-for storage space is 
wasteful and extremely costly. 
</P>
<P>
 For help, Smart & Final turned to Beverly Hills-based Motek Information 
Systems, which specializes in developing computer systems for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was critical. The Vernon warehouse, containing more than 6,000 
products at 50,000 different pallet locations, serves 70% of Smart & Final's 
137 stores. The warehouse receives about 3,000 pallets of goods every day, and 
there are fewer than 1,000 pallet slots open each morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposed to be out of this facility 18 months ago," recalled Carlos 
Angulo, Smart & Final's director of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Motek saw that Smart & Final had been tracking warehouse inventory with IBM's 
mainframe-based Chain Store System. Although this was fine for warehouse 
purchasing and accounting, it could not be updated more often than every 12 
hours. This meant Smart & Final was losing valuable time while shelf space in 
the 550,000-square-foot warehouse was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfilled space in a warehouse is akin to a ship anchored in port or an 
airliner at the gate -- it loses money for the owner. Forklift operators would 
zoom a quarter of a mile down the cavernous aisles of the warehouse, only to 
discover that the item wasn't there -- someone had retrieved it earlier in the 
day, but the computer had not yet recorded the movement. Under orders to move 
16 to 18 pallets an hour, the forklift operators were forced to waste valuable 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most warehouses today still work on paper and pencil," said David Price, 
Motek's technology director. "Unbelievably, 85% of warehouses still are not 
automated." 
</P>
<P>
 Motek found a way to improve Smart & Final's mainframe system instead of 
scrapping it. The solution was to use a small computer "server" to link the 
mainframe system with mobile radio-frequency computers mounted on the 
forklifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The forklift operators now use a scanner to read bar code labels on the 
pallets; the information is relayed wirelessly (and instantly) to the server. 
Thus the system is immediately told of every change in the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of this real-time inventory tracking is that Smart & Final sharply 
boosted the efficiency of warehouse employees and carved out additional space 
in the facility. The forklift drivers' productivity has improved 16%, and 
warehouse capacity is up 10% to 15%, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts us a full day ahead as far as how soon we can use locations in the 
warehouse," Angulo said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, even the most efficient real-time inventory tracking 
system could not keep up with Smart & Final's rapid growth. The company is 
building an additional warehouse, in Stockton, to serve its Northern California 
stores. Meanwhile, the Vernon warehouse will remain open.

PLOWSHARES; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; GETTING MORE 
BANG FOR RESCUE DEVICE BUCKS

 Defense industry explosives aren't usually intended for humanitarian purposes. 
But Hi-Shear Technology Corp. of Torrance, a producer of aerospace systems, is 
trying to develop a new Jaws of Life-type rescue device powered by the 
explosive cartridges it now sells for powering jet fighter ejection seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the effort succeeds, the rescue device could eventually account for 50% of 
the company's sales, transforming it from a defense-dependent contractor to a 
diversified commercial manufacturing firm, according to Don Novotny, Hi-Shear's 
vice president for business development. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi-Shear won $700,000 in government funding for the project last year under 
the Clinton Administration's technology reinvestment program, a centerpiece of 
the Administration's defense-conversion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The government funding amounts to half the projected development cost of 
Hi-Shear's rescue device. The project also includes participation by the 
Torrance Fire Department, which will test and evaluate the device. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional rescue devices operate on hydraulic pressure fed by a gasoline 
engine and pump, and they require a crew to set up the machinery. The 
cumbersome hoses that carry hydraulic fluid also limit rescue operations in 
cramped areas. For example, the devices often cannot be used in a collapsed 
building after an earthquake, Novotny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi-Shear's device, which resembles a large pair of scissors, will be lighter 
and less expensive than a Jaws of Life. Each stroke of the scissors would 
require the use of a single cartridge. Cutting open the roof of a car, for 
example, would require four cartridges. Thus, each sale of the device ensures a 
steady business in cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotny said Hi-Shear's device will cost less than half the $10,000 to $15,000 
price of a conventional Jaws of Life device. Hi-Shear hopes to be able to 
introduce the product at a price of only a few thousand dollars so it can win 
orders from the hundreds of rural and volunteer fire departments unable to 
afford conventional systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi-Shear's explosive cartridges for military customers must meet strict 
quality standards because a pilot's life depends on them in an emergency. The 
cartridges are also used to separate stages of high-value rockets and deploy 
antennas on spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotny says competitors should have a tough time figuring out the chemical 
composition and physical configuration for a cartridge, thus giving the firm a 
crucial lead in the new market. RALPH VARTABEDIAN

 ICN's Big Market: When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev came to sunny Southern 
California, he went to Disneyland. The latest Russian politician to step foot 
in Orange County, however, bypassed the theme park and headed to Costa Mesa 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Jakovlev, the vice mayor of St. Petersburg, spent his time at the 
world headquarters of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., the $1-billion drug firm 
founded by Milan Panic, the former prime minister of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN recently purchased St. Petersburg-based Oktyabr, Russia's oldest drug 
company, transferring stock to the 280-year-old plant's 2,175 workers. It has 
also announced plans to construct a new manufacturing plant there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakovlev pointed out that ICN is virtually the only U.S. drug company with 
significant investments in Eastern Europe -- all others have continued to shy 
away from the potentially unstable region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most businessmen are reluctant to invest in Russia," Jakovlev said Tuesday. 
"This project will set a good example for others and will provide much-needed 
products for our country." James M. Gomez, Times staff writer

CORVEL POSTS IMPRESSIVE FISCAL GAINS; WORKERS' COMP: THE NATION'S AGITATION 
OVER SOARING MEDICAL COSTS LIFTS COMPANY TO NEW HEIGHTS IN PROFIT AND REVENUE.

 CorVel Corp., a provider of managed health care programs in the workers' 
compensation field, on Tuesday reported record profit and revenue for its 
latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 CorVel President Gordon Clemons said that nationwide concern over rising 
health costs has helped the company expand rapidly and swiftly diversify its 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Last quarter, the Irvine-based company introduced a new line of health 
information work stations for employers and insurers to help hospitals and 
clinics become more efficient. The desktop information systems allow customers 
to tap directly into CorVel's database for quick access to information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heightened national interest in controlling health care costs is bringing 
rapid change to the managed care market," said Gordon Clemons, CorVel 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has also expanded its patient management services with so-called 
preferred provider organizations -- physician groups that offer discounted 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year ending March 31, CorVel reported net income of $4.4 million, or 
$1.01 a share, up 76% from annual profit of $2.5 million, or 61 cents a share, 
for the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual revenue for the past fiscal year was $80.6 million, up 30.4% from 
annual revenue of $61.8 million for the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported fourth-quarter profit of $1.2 million, or 29 cents a 
share, compared to profit of $755,000, or 18 cents a share, for the previous 
fourth quarter. Quarterly revenue was $21.5 million, compared to $17.3 million 
in revenue for the year ago fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 CorVel's announcement caused the company's shares to jump $1 on the Nasdaq 
market, closing Tuesday at $25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance is impressive, considering CorVel shares sold at $10 when the 
company went public in June, 1991, said Leonard S. Jaffe, a health care analyst 
for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been very successful," said Jaffe, adding that Montgomery 
Securities has issued a buy recommendation on CorVel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe said that the company has plans to diversify further, and hopes to offer 
its cost-saving programs to health care companies and insurance carriers 
outside the workers' compensation field in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Jaffe suggests the company continue its focus on the 
workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers' compensation cost containment is one of the last frontiers of health 
care to come under managed-care constraints," Jaffe said. "It is something that 
has been neglected for too long."

FRESNO AUTO DEALER SUES AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fresno automobile dealer is alleging that American Honda Motor Co. and its 
chief executive officer engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with 
awarding Honda dealerships, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Koichi Amemiya, American Honda's president and CEO, knew 
about widespread fraud and dealer racketeering in the awarding of Honda and 
Acura dealerships in the past two decades.About 18 similar suits have been 
filed around the country, according to Automotive News. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed about a month after federal officials indicted 13 former 
Honda executives in connection with a fraud and racketeering investigation. 
Eight of the executives subsequently pleaded guilty to fraud-related charges. 
The civil suit filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Clara, contends that top 
Honda executives, including Amemiya, knew about the alleged wrongdoing.

PDA ENGINEERING AGREES TO BE ACQUIRED BY RIVAL COMPANY; TECHNOLOGY: 
MACNEAL-SCHWENDLER WILL PAY $65.8 MILLION IN DEAL TO CREATE THE BIGGEST FIRM IN 
ITS PART OF THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PDA Engineering Inc., continuing the consolidation in the engineering software 
industry, said Tuesday that it has agreed to be acquired by a Los Angeles 
company for about $65.8 million in corporate IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
 MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., the industry's biggest player, said it would pay 
$6.85 a share for PDA by issuing debt securities to shareholders, who must give 
the deal their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies provide software that enables engineers to draw a 
three-dimensional object, such as a design for an airplane wing, and to 
simulate its strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two companies compete, there is little overlap among their products 
and customers, and therefore no immediate layoffs are planned, said Larry 
McArthur, MacNeal-Schwendler's president. His company will add PDA's 290 
employees to its own staff of 450. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur said he expects most of PDA's management to remain, though details 
have not been settled yet. MacNeal-Schwendler acquired a smaller company last 
year, one of a number of deals in the industry over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a chance to take a leadership position in doing this merger," said 
Louis Delmonico, PDA's chief executive. "The timing is right. From a strategic 
standpoint, this is good for PDA." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted positively. PDA stock closed at $5.625 a share, up $2.75, 
in Nasdaq trading Tuesday. MacNeal-Schwendler stock closed at $12.50 a share, 
up 75 cents on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sale, the company will record a "substantial" write-off to pay for 
costs related to the merger, according to a MacNeal-Schwendler press release. 
The costs include the elimination of some research and development. The amount 
of the write-off will be disclosed later. 
</P>
<P>
 Both MacNeal-Schwendler and PDA have grown quickly in the last few years as 
computer-aided engineering has blossomed. The software has become popular 
because it is far quicker to use computers to create and revise engineering 
drawings than to change designs by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 PDA's products "fit closely with our other products," McArthur said. In fact, 
he said, both were started with funding from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. MacNeal-Schwendler was formed in 1963, PDA in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, MacNeal-Schwendler reported net income of 
$11.4 million on sales of $79.6 million, while PDA posted a profit of $4.4 
million on revenue of $43.1 million for the fiscal year that ended last June 
30. Combined, the two companies will become the largest operation in the 
industry with about $120 million in sales, McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each company has taken a foothold in various markets among engineers. For 
instance, PDA has done well selling to engineering analysts at aerospace 
companies, while MacNeal-Schwendler has focused on designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the two companies have tried to expand the engineering analysis 
market by making their software easier to use and easily adaptable to any kind 
of computer. Using such techniques, the companies said they hope to expand the 
market from 100,000 sophisticated engineers who use analysis software to more 
than 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes years of practice to train people to use most of the software out 
there," McArthur said. "We're trying to take the arcane terminology and 
procedures out of it."

 Valued Employees: How much are good executives worth these days? 
</P>
<P>
 If they are in the fast-growing biotechnology field, quite a lot, according to 
a survey just released by the Newport Beach office of Coopers & Lybrand , the 
giant consulting and accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Coopers & Lybrand reports that despite suffering from Wall Street jitters, the 
biotech industry has been generous in issuing compensation packages to 
executives, at both privately held and publicly held firms. This comes from its 
Seventh Annual Leadership in Biotechnology survey. 
</P>
<P>
 After questioning 127 biotechnology firms around the country, Coopers & 
Lybrand researchers found that top executives received double-digit salary 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the average salary for chief executives in privately held 
companies -- those that are usually still in the start-up phase -- rose 14% in 
a year to an average salary of $129,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Their counterparts in publicly held companies saw their average base salaries 
hiked to $198,000, up 16% from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also noted that R&D executives have enjoyed hefty wage increases, 
even as the biotech industry in general has fallen into disfavor by investors 
unsure about the effects of impending national health care reform and slowed 
sales from customers under pressure by cost-conscious insurance carriers. James

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; FHP-TAKECARE MERGER NOW AWAITS APPROVAL BY STOCKHOLDERS

 The day of reckoning is approaching for executives of FHP International Inc., 
the Fountain Valley health maintenance organization, and its Northern 
California competitor, TakeCare Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies have announced an ambitious $1-billion plan to merge, 
creating the third-largest HMO in California and the fifth-largest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the deal can close, shareholders of both companies must weigh in 
with their votes on whether it should proceed. Those votes will be counted June 
10, when the two firms expect to hold separate annual meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP spokeswoman Ria Carlson said that executives do not anticipate any strong 
opposition, though a proxy statement sent out recently showed that TakeCare 
executives would receive more than $12 million in bonuses for giving FHP the 
nod to take over the Concord-based HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, four FHP board members, including Chairman Robert Gumbiner , 
would receive $50,000 each for their work on the much-publicized acquisition.

DISCOUNTER EYES BURGEONING LINGERIE BUSINESS; RETAIL: CLOTHESTIME UNVEILS PLANS 
TO OPEN CHAIN TO COMPETE IN $8-BILLION MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Operating on the theory that less is more, Clothestime Inc. is opening a chain 
of stores to compete against Lingerie For Less, Victoria's Secret and 
Frederick's of Hollywood in the $8-billion market for lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime, which operates 557 women's apparel stores in 22 states and Puerto 
Rico, plans to open 10 Lingerie Time stores during 1994, Clothestime Chairman 
John Ortega said Tuesday. Clothestime views the Lingerie Time chain as "a 
strategic part of our long-term store growth," Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stores will open in Dana Point, Huntington Beach, Anaheim Hills and 
Placentia. A store also is planned for Pearl City on the island of Oahu in 
Hawaii. Clothestime will locate lingerie stores near its existing stores in 
strip centers. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clothestime's stores offer private-label merchandise, Lingerie Time will 
sell name-brand merchandise -- including Christian Dior, Lily of France, 
Maidenform and Bali -- at deep discounts, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, that strategy pits newcomer Lingerie Time against Marina del 
Rey-based Lingerie For Less, which has 23 stores, including 11 Orange County 
locations. Lingerie For Less opened its first store in Huntington Beach in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry volume is now at about $8.2 billion and we see it growing to $10 
billion within a couple of years," said Karen Bromley, a spokeswoman for the 
Intimate Apparel Council, a New York-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fastest-growing sector in lingerie sales are the chain and discount 
stores," Bromley said. "Target, Mervyn's, Kmart and the like all are doing a 
big business in lingerie and intimate apparel. . . . There's tremendous 
competition in chain stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and manufacturers are responding to consumer demands for better 
values by creating private labels that are less costly than leading name 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanity Fair is one manufacturer that created Vassarette, a new brand that 
won't cannibalize its own line," Bromley said. "And Victoria's Secret, one of 
the largest brands in the country, is a very price-driven (private label) 
brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime's bid to join the lingerie war "makes sense because it's a market 
that's just beginning to happen," said Donna Eide, director of store operations 
at Lingerie For Less. Lingerie For Less offers name-brand merchandise -- 
including bras, panties, night wear and day wear -- at deep discounts from 
department store prices, Eide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eide said lingerie sales are booming because "lingerie is becoming outerwear. 
. . . People are wearing camisole tops to the workplace, out dancing, to 
nightclubs, everywhere. It's now day wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lingerie Time and Lingerie For Less are targeting women between the ages 
of 24 and 45. Name brands are important to this age group because "customers 
are used to shopping in department stores and are comfortable with name 
brands," Eide said. "We try to give them the product they want, the color they 
want, and the right price." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime views Lingerie Time as an important part of Clothestime's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is a tremendous opportunity for Clothestime since there are 
currently no national, off-price specialty chains selling intimate apparel," 
Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime shares slipped 12.5 cents to close at $5.50 on Nasdaq on Tuesday.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: US FACILITIES TAKES EARNINGS JOLT FROM QUAKE

 US Facilities Corp., the target of a hostile takeover attempt, said Tuesday 
that damage claims from the Northridge earthquake in January caused its 
first-quarter earnings to fall 68% to $600,000, or 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa holding company for several insurance carriers said that claims 
from the earthquake resulted in payments of $2.1 million, which lowered net 
income by $1.4 million.Last year, the company earned $1.9 million, or 31 cents 
a share, for the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly revenue rose to $30.5 million from $26 million for last year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities provides medical stop-loss and property and casualty reinsurance 
for employers. Reinsurance is a layer of coverage over primary insurance. The 
company's medical stop-loss coverage provides self-insured employers with 
benefits after the employers pay a preset amount in claims. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities is the target of a takeover bid by Fidelity National Financial 
Inc. in Irvine, the nation's fifth-largest title insurance company. Fidelity 
had offered $79 million, or $15 a share, to acquire the company as part of 
Fidelity's effort to diversify its operations. That offer technically expired, 
but will be revived later, Fidelity has said. JAMES S. GRANELLI

a $10.4-million charge-off on costs related to recent acquisitions, corporate 
restructuring and executive severance packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Not factoring in the non-recurring charges, the company would have posted net 
income of $3.7 million, or 29 cents a share.

 Revenue for the first quarter was $117 million, up from $71 million for last 
year's first quarter.
