 Time to flush those pipes!Nancy Allen of L.A. received a flyer announcing a 
"spring-cleaning special" at the Total Health Connection in Beverly Hills. It's 
"Colon Hydrotherapy ($49.50)."

 Free doughnuts aren't enough: After CBS' Dan Rather hosted a "48 Hours" 
special on the undermanned cops of L.A.'s 77th Street Division, the police 
station was besieged with calls of sympathy and offers of financial aid from 
viewers around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers here were thrilled with the positive response," said Capt. Larry 
Goebel, the division commander. "We were getting calls before the program even 
showed on the West Coast -- they started coming after it showed on the East 
Coast. And we were deluged all the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Goebel said viewers obviously "could see the archaic equipment" that some of 
the officers are saddled with. "We got a call from a businessman in Virginia 
who wanted to buy us computer equipment. A man in Catalina sent us $1,000 for 
some new hand-held radios."  
</P>
<P>
 The most unusual offer came from a Southland group that volunteered to raise 
funds with a benefit concert. "It's a barbershop quartet," Goebel said.  
</P>
<P>
 And, to think, the 48-hour period covered by CBS was relatively quiet in the 
77th -- just one murder, 23 assaults and 19 robberies.

 It's surely a coincidence, David Cooper of Beverly Hills points out, that 
Robert Maxson was recently named president of the college. Maxson previously 
held the same position at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.

GOP WELFARE REFORM PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with interest your March 9 article on Republican welfare proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The article did a good job covering a long-overdue debate about what must be 
done to reform our welfare system; however, it seemed to imply that in raising 
the issue of out-of-wedlock births I am adding something new to the mix of 
welfare reform. But the truth is, it is the President who has said that welfare 
reform must deal with the fact that one out of three children born in America 
are in homes without fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last year, President Clinton said, "Once a really poor woman 
has a child out of wedlock, it almost locks her and that child into the cycle 
of poverty which then spins out of control." The solution, according to the 
President, is that "government's going to have to adopt some very firm 
pro-family policies to encourage the preservation and the development of strong 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 If the President means what he says, he will support the efforts of 
conservative Republicans to deal with this crisis. We have not raised the issue 
of illegitimacy to scuttle the President's welfare reform effort; rather, we 
are offering substantive proposals which, with the President's help, really can 
pass the Congress this year. What stands in the way of accomplishing what the 
President says he wants to do is the leadership of his own party in Congress. 
In the absence of presidential leadership, the Democratic leadership in 
Congress will either prevent real change from coming to a vote or twist enough 
arms to prevent a real bill from passing.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time for a little of what President Harry Truman would have called plain 
speaking. President Clinton has spoken, often with passion, of his desire to 
reinvent the federal government. Given that he was the governor of a small 
state for 12 years -- a job which, unlike service inside the Beltway, 
occasionally brought him into contact with the real world -- it is likely that 
his passion is at least partly sincere. The status quo in Washington is a 
liberal status quo. Nowhere is this more evident than in the welfare system. On 
this issue the President has a chance, maybe his last chance, to re-create a 
vital center for the Democratic Party and align himself with two basic values 
of middle-class Americans: work and marriage. His alternative is to continue 
shilling for an elite that is philosophically bankrupt and that must eventually 
collapse politically as well.

 * With the recent acquittals of Lorena Bobbitt and now, Aurelia Macias (March 
19), in the mutilation of their respective husbands, it seems that we have a

a most important criminal justice system. The jurors were unable to listen to 
simple fact, and to separate that fact from irrelevant drama, hysteria and 
emotionalism.

GUNNING DOWN A CIVILIZATION; THE HORRIBLE DEATH OF TWO STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "W hy doesn't Japan have problems like this? They don't have guns on the 
street. We've got to have stronger laws or we're going to kill each other off." 
 
</P>
<P>
 -- Erica Stenta, a student at Marymount College Stenta's plaintive call for 
tougher gun control laws echoes across the nation as we mourn the murders in 
San Pedro of two much-admired college students from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were gunned down in a carjacking last Friday at a 
supermarket parking lot. The 19-year-olds died Sunday from shots fired at close 
range into the backs of their heads. They had come to Marymount College to 
become filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their deaths are yet one more grim reminder of the need to move America toward 
a near-total ban on the possession and manufacture of handguns and assault 
weapons to reduce the supply of firearms that are contributing to gunshot 
homicides and accidents. For while the shooting of the Japanese students 
grabbed world headlines this weekend, and was an international embarrassment 
for the United States, a crime of this sort was nothing new for police. Every 
week police blotters fill with gunshot victims no less innocent than Ito and 
Matsuura; almost every day the targets of bullets die with scant notice. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, in expressing official condolences in 
Tokyo, stressed that such crimes do not represent everyday American life. 
Granted. But shootings do occur far too often here, in part because it is too 
easy to get a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 To foreign -- and now, especially, Japanese -- eyes, U.S. gun laws are 
irresponsible and impossible to understand. Japan's gun laws are among the 
world's strictest. Guns can be sold only to those legally authorized to possess 
them -- members of police or defense forces, prison guards, licensed hunters 
and marksmen who compete in approved competitions. A gun owner must carry a 
permit, as well as proof that the weapon is registered. And police have the 
authority to look for and seize firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a plan to us. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 66 people were killed in firearm-related homicides in Japan, a 
country of 124 million; handguns were used in 60 of those killings. With almost 
double the population, the United States that year had 15,377 gun murders -- 
13,220 by handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the United States and Japan are not entirely comparable. Japan is 
homogeneous and an island nation; America is diverse with porous borders. But 
respect for life crosses cultures and oceans -- or at least it should. 
Unfortunately, sometimes in the United States guns get more respect than 
people.

ISOLATE THIS DANGEROUS SPOILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi is a hard man to please. Maybe it's 
time for South African President Frederik W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the 
leader of the African National Congress, to stop trying. 
</P>
<P>
 These days nothing seems to appease the exceedingly difficult Buthelezi, head 
of the Inkatha Freedom Party. Not a private visit on Saturday with De Klerk. 
Nor a high-profile session with Mandela. Even the concessions that Buthelezi 
sought a year ago and recently won from De Klerk and Mandela, to guarantee 
greater independence for regional leaders like himself in South Africa's 
future, no longer seem to satisfy him. What's left to give? 
</P>
<P>
 On April 26-28 the country will hold its first elections in which all racial 
groups can vote. This should be the proudest moment in South Africa's history. 
Instead, with people like Buthelezi trying to play the spoiler, it could prove 
to be one of the bloodiest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulu chief's stubbornness would be bad enough if it simply amounted to 
obstructionism, but the effect is much worse than that: His anti-ANC rhetoric 
is calculated to inspire violence. The latest blood bath, on Monday, involved 
yet another clash between armed supporters of Inkatha and the more dominant 
ANC. It left 16 dead and 50 wounded in Johannesburg. The ANC, aided by South 
African police officers, opened fire to protect its headquarters from 10,000 
Zulu protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 However deplorable the carnage, the newfound partnership between white and ANC 
security forces will be beneficial. Mandela seems to be leaning precisely 
toward such cooperation, despite black worries because of past white support of 
Buthelezi's forces. But publicity about that support has cost Buthelezi the 
respect of many Zulus, and this fact provides Mandela with a further 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls indicate that among Zulus, the largest tribal group, Buthelezi can count 
on the solid support of only 25% at most. In fact, most younger, more educated 
Zulu men and women who have left their rural homeland for jobs in the cities 
appear to be firmly in the Mandela camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi may never support a government that he does not control. That is his 
choice. But in ways that perhaps not even he understands, he is a relic of 
apartheid. South Africa must move forward without him; De Klerk and Mandela 
need to work together to isolate him.

LET TOPANGA BE TOPANGA; SUPERVISORS WILL WANT TO NAIL DOWN TERRIFIC PARKLAND 
DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of turmoil in Topanga Canyon, the Board of 
Supervisors can bring the oldest land dispute in Los Angeles County history to 
an end today. 
</P>
<P>
 Without delay the board can, and should, approve an agreement that will allow 
the purchase of 662 canyon acres by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
This is the best solution to a bitter struggle that has pitted residents 
against various developers for no less than 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt at developing the canyon came from Canyon Oaks Estates. The 
plan was to build luxury homes and a golf course. Its proponents touted the 
benefits of permanent jobs and hefty property tax revenues for county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in real estate, it's all location, location, location -- and Topanga was 
simply the wrong place for something like this. In fact, canyon residents saw 
the project as a flatland idea hoisted onto mountain terrain and feared the end 
of their beautiful, semi-isolated, rustic valley. They rallied the troops, they 
petitioned the board, they simply would not go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, an eleventh-hour proposal surfaced: The developers, part of a 
Disney family trust, could profit, finally, by selling the land to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, which would buy it with Proposition A parkland 
acquisition funds; and Topanga residents could keep their canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers would get $14.1 million in Proposition A funds as part of the 
sale. The Board of Supervisors, in which member Ed Edelman is championing the 
sale to the conservancy, must act by April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 A big advantage of the deal is that county firefighters would not have a 
greater number of expensive structures to protect in the canyon's next major 
fire. This is no small consideration. There have been 15 major blazes in 
Topanga since the 1920s, some followed by floods. That should be foremost in 
the minds of those who favor further development there. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are on the verge of a nailing down a good deal. This is a 
beneficial and appropriate use of Proposition A money.

ALLY WATCH; TURKEY'S IRON LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turkey has been an important -- and friendly -- ally of the West. During the 
Gulf War its NATO air base proved to be an invaluable asset.Precisely because 
of Turkey's vital role in the region, its roiling internal politics are always 
watched closely. Thus did this weekend's local elections attract world 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago Tansu Ciller, a scrappy politician who claims Margaret 
Thatcher as her role model, became prime minister in a series of events 
triggered by the death of President Turgut Ozal, an enormously popular 
politician who was held in affectionate regard in many Western capitals. Since 
taking over, the American-educated Ciller has not had an easy time. But on 
Sunday, to virtually everyone's surprise, Ciller's True Path Party did very 
well, providing a psychological boost for her government -- basically a 
parliamentary coalition with the Social Democratic People's Party. And that 
unexpectedly strong showing bodes well for the conservative leader's prospects 
in the 1996 parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the weekend's success, Prime Minister Ciller must not only overcome 
serious economic and political corruption problems but also the challenge of 
dealing with the Kurds -- a stateless minority with large populations in Iraq 
and Iran as well as Turkey. Ciller favors a severe crackdown on terrorist 
Kurds. But she must avoid a wholesale, indiscriminate repression of the Kurdish 
people that is in itself destabilizing -- and creates serious problems for 
Turkey's allies. The path between now and 1996 may be true, but it is also 
tricky.

CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial, "But Should UCLA Cost as Much as Stanford?" (March 20), 
accurately points out the conflict between access and rising fees in the 
University of California and California State University systems. It misses the 
heart of the problem, however, which is the unwillingness of Californians to 
pay for education. Open access is possible only when the taxpayers will pay a 
disproportionate share of the costs; higher fees are necessary when the 
taxpayers and/or their representatives refuse to pay those costs. Will new 
taxes be assessed to cover the cost of the expensive and misguided "three 
strikes and you're out" bill, so quickly passed and signed without regard to 
its enormous costs? Recent history suggests that they will not, but prison 
construction will have to be paid for and so will come from the same pot that 
funds higher education. The result will be higher fees and even less access. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario would be to squeeze the universities further and require 
"more with less," as the report of the California Higher Education Policy 
Center suggests, according to the editorial. Our department and most others at 
CSU Fullerton have been cut close to 30% in the past three years and we are 
still expected to serve nearly as many students as we did five years ago. For 
this reason, elective classes in the major, and equipment maintenance and 
replacement are but memories, while the construction of every course schedule 
is an exercise in survival. The editorial ignores the fact that we are already 
doing with much less, and there is precious little room for contraction without 
the abandonment of programs and/or the watering down of degree requirements to 
eliminate required classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens of this state have a choice to make; pay for access through 
higher taxation, deny it through higher fees, or dismantle the universities 
through lack of funding.

 * Ruth Rosen's comments in Column Left on March 22 really hit home with me. As 
a student at UC Irvine for the past two years, I am acutely aware of how much 
and how fast fees have risen. Last year, annual fees were about $3,100. This 
was the figure after several consecutive years of increases. This year's fees 
went up to almost $4,000 and they are going up again next year. These fees do 
not include books or room and board, transportation or any other expenses.

 And what do we get for this price? With the exception of labs, every single 
class I've had in the past two years has been in an auditorium with 200-400 
other students. Yes, there are smaller discussion sections with teaching 
assistants but this is a poor substitute for being able to carry on a dialogue 
with a professor as questions arise. There are so many students competing for 
the professors' limited office hours that office hours are generally packed 
with students and resemble discussion sections more than personal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen is correct in saying that the sacrifices necessary must be shared all 
around. Over the past five years, the student's share of the sacrifice has 
increased dramatically. Perhaps it is time for the upper echelons to join us.

 * Rosen, a UC Davis professor, bless her, was half-right in attacking UC 
President Jack Peltason's largess toward college administrators at taxpayer 
expense. Alas, half-wrong, she trotted out an educrat's tired cliches to 
rationalize her own pay raise. The faculty is "demoralized" and "overburdened." 
How so, Ruth, with an average 2.68 classes to teach and graduate assistants to 
help? Meanwhile, voluntary retirement programs have "devastated" the 
university, she says. Hardly. A top administrator at UC Irvine says that they 
can't get highly paid professors there to retire. With the summer off, and only 
2.68 classes to teach, they are already retired, and with a great salary.

 * Thank you, Jesse Jackson, for telling it like it is on the Whitewater fuss 
(Column Left, March 17). Most accurate is your assessment of the "get Hillary" 
attitude that pervades this country.We have been appalled at the viciousness 
and hatred we hear from people, even when they tell "Hillary jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 We finally have a First Lady who is using her brains. She is a role model to 
all women who wish to participate in the political process. We consider this a 
continuation of the suffragette movement, when women weren't even considered 
intelligent enough to vote.

 * In Jackson's column encouraging the Clintons to "stand tall" amid the 
Whitewater controversy, he sums up the Clintons' lack of business acumen by 
saying, "It's a good thing he went into public service, because he surely 
wasn't cut out for the private sector." What an amusing but alarming 
commentary, and by a fellow Democrat doing his best to defend the Clintons!

 * I enjoyed Ben Joravsky's article on the Arkansas political machine which 
described the Rose Law Firm as the centerpiece of the Clinton fiefdom (Opinion, 
March 20). It is difficult to believe in 1994 that it was legal and ethical for 
Hillary Clinton's law firm to do any business with the state government while 
her husband was the governor. The taxpayers pay a heavy price for this type of 
incestuous behavior, but we are apparently unable to pass the laws to prevent 
it.

PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME; BRING IN THE ARMY TO END THE FEAR; ORDER IN MOGADISHU IS 
NO LESS IMPORTANT THAN SAFE STREETS -- AND SUPERMARKET PARKING LOTS -- IN LOS 
ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last weekend's murderous attack on the two Japanese students in Los Angeles is 
a stark and tragic reminder that the police have lost the ability to control 
crime on our streets. Car-jackings will take place whether or not the police go 
on strike.  
</P>
<P>
 We need the police. They are heroes and heroines. We do not pay them enough to 
risk their lives and health the way those on patrol do every day. And we do not 
put enough of them on the streets to really reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we need those 3,000 new police officers that Mayor Richard Riordan made 
the linchpin of his campaign. But even if the mayor has the political courage 
to offer a realistic plan to pay their salaries and get them on the streets, 
they won't be enough. Too many of our neighborhoods are out of control. The 
young, the crazy, the drunk and the drugged are armed. Fear stalks us.  
</P>
<P>
 We have grown too comfortable expecting police officers to lose their lives 
confronting menaces to society. Police officers, restaurant patrons, bystanders 
and babies are gunned down. We mourn for a few moments when we see their photos 
in the paper or on television. But it passes. They are buried, and what remains 
is more fear for us. The police continue taking life-threatening risks, without 
any real promise of an intervention that will change the situation for the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't stop car-jackings and all the other urban horrors with a local police 
force. "Three strikes and you're out" will send third-time felons to jail for 
life while subjecting the rest of us to three felonies before they are put 
away. It has gotten so that the police and small-market owners, armed and in 
flak jackets, are the front lines of the battle to reclaim our city. Without 
drastic intervention, it is a losing battle.  
</P>
<P>
 It's time to send the Army into our cities to restore order, to disarm 
dangerous populations and to detain those who are causing their neighbors to 
live in fear. Why should we be sending thousands of troops to restore order in 
Mogadishu when on most days, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Washington 
experience worse gunfire? Why should we be deploying troops to face up to North 
Korea? It is surrounded by some of the richest, lowest-crime societies in the 
world. Let them face down North Korea, if it truly is a risk. Use our soldiers, 
for which we all pay so much, in defense of our troubled cities. 
</P>
<P>
 We seem to have accepted the premise that our army is to be used only abroad 
and our soldiers' lives should almost never be at risk. We have shown a 
willingness to pay for the world's most expensive and best-equipped military 
forces, but we have not thought creatively about how we might use them as an 
interim force to back up our police. Our police departments are understaffed 
and underequipped to do the job that most of us put as our highest public 
priority. They lack modern communications and logistics equipment -- supplies 
that we lavish on our military. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke more than 60 years ago about his 
dream of an America free from fear, he could not have envisioned the sad, 
violent face of America today. Millions of people, old and young, sit 
imprisoned in their homes or anxious in their cars. They are afraid to venture 
out for fear that they will face the barrel of a gun or never know what hit 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 We talk of human rights. In the United States, our emphasis has been on 
protecting the political rights of the individual. We have not emphasized the 
right of the community to live in an ordered society, where it is reasonable to 
expect civil behavior from the young men you meet on the street.  
</P>
<P>
 We avoid the streets and if possible the young men who are most likely to kill 
or rob us. We send the police out to confront them -- knowing they have neither 
the tools nor the numbers to get the situation under control. We have become 
callous about violence and unwilling to pay to get it under control. As Erica 
Stenta, a friend of the murdered student Takuma Ito, said, "We have to stop 
accepting this as a normal, everyday part of life. . . . It can't go on like 
this."  
</P>
<P>
 Help the police. Bring in the army to get control of our neighborhoods. Create 
a society free from pervasive fear. That, too, should be a human right worth 
working for.

PLATFORM; SAY NO TO HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS E. WELCH, a writer in North Hollywood, comments about the escalation 
of hate in the world today. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we were children, the cries of "I hate you" were often used 
indiscriminately. With typical childhood hyperbole, we used the strongest words 
at our command to express our dislikes.Children often confuse their anger and 
frustration with hate. 
</P>
<P>
 We have entered an era, like many before, where hate has become accepted 
behavior. Despite the lessons of history, the world is set on flirting with its 
own destruction again. Rhetoric shouted from a long-dismantled German pulpit is 
rejected for the hate it inspired, yet today, from a thousand pulpits, similar 
messages appear. Whether the hate is based on ethnicity, politics or sexual 
orientation, it seeks to reduce the targeted population to no more than germs 
to be purged or poisons to be regurgitated. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only in the throes of hate that weapons of mass destruction will ever be 
used. Yet there is little talk of limiting strategic arms capabilities. What 
good is dismantling the bomb while leaving the fuse intact and armed?  
</P>
<P>
 It is time to establish a "zero tolerance" for hate throughout the world.

A TSUNAMI OF JOBLESSNESS ON THE HORIZON; GLOBAL STABILITY: INDUSTRIAL NATIONS 
MUST ATTEND TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD'S EXPLOSIVE RATES OF UNEMPLOPYMENT AND 
POPULATION GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Council, a Washington-based public policy institute. Courtenay Singer of ODC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concern about unemployment drew the finance ministers of Europe, Japan and the 
United States to the recent summit in Detroit, but who spoke for the rest of 
the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment rates in the industrialized countries are at the highest levels 
since the Great Depression -- 6.5% in the United States and 12% in Western 
Europe. But unemployment rates in much of the developing world already average 
40% to 50%. And that does not take into account the greater number of men and 
women who are "underemployed," working long hours for pennies. Without major 
new efforts by both developed and developing countries, the problem will not be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened by debt and a rapidly expanding population, economic growth in the 
developing countries still remains below 1970s' levels. These countries are 
also adversely effected by the slow growth in industrial countries, which still 
account for three-fourths of the total world output. 
</P>
<P>
 Work-force growth remains a key element of future employment patterns around 
the world. Workers in industrialized countries are aging and retiring from the 
ranks of the employed without an equal surge of "new blood" coming in from 
below. The developing world has the opposite problem. In the decades ahead, 
about 95% of the world's population growth will be in the developing countries 
of Africa, Asia and Latin America. These countries will account for virtually 
all of the new entrants into the world labor force over the next 25 years. To 
meet this surge, these countries will need to increase employment by more than 
2% a year for the foreseeable future just to prevent unemployment rates from 
rising beyond today's critical level. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should be concerned about employment in the developing world 
for its own interests. Economic growth in the developing world means jobs in 
this country. As developing-country income rises, so does the demand for U.S. 
goods. Proper policies by the United States and the dynamic economies of Asia 
and Latin America could stimulate U.S. export growth by more than 10% a year, 
creating as many as 1.7 million new U.S. jobs by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton has recognized, jobs bring more than just income to 
individuals. High unemployment wreaks havoc on society, particularly on 
families. It ranks as one of the fundamental causes of political unrest, 
particularly in newly emerging democracies, where people expect to reap the 
economic benefits of free elections. Jobs also help the environment because 
they allow people to earn a living without over-cultivating fragile lands or 
cutting down forests just to stay alive. Over the longer run, development of 
decent jobs will help to cut down on immigration. whether from the developing 
world, Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy-makers may be tempted to ignore this "other" employment crisis. The 
feeling persists that we have enough to worry about and should focus on 
domestic problems. But ignoring developing-world problems will not make them go 
away. Immigration, conflict and political unrest, as well as threats to 
democracy, will only increase, as will the costs of preventing spillovers into 
the industrial world. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several opportunities on deck for the Clinton Administration and 
other leaders to create strategies for global economic integration and growth 
that will benefit rich and poor countries. The World Population Conference 
meets in Cairo this September and will highlight the need for new approaches to 
slowing population (and therefore work-force) growth. Next March, world leaders 
will assemble in Copenhagen for a summit on social development. Finally, 
employment throughout the world could be increased by the next round of trade 
liberalization negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
 In an increasingly global economy, interdependence is the key to success; the 
Clinton Administration recognized this when it remained firm on NAFTA and GATT. 
It is obvious that economic growth in this country and others will depend on 
similar, outward-looking strategies.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: BRINGING MALTHUS UP TO DATE; TODAY'S 
INTELLECTUAL OVERLORDS ECHO THE 19TH-CENTURY ECONOMIST ON MAKING THE WRETCHED 
MORE SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem with the row over Louis Farrakhan and the deplorable views of his 
aide is that it focuses attention on the wrong target. American Jews aren't in 
any danger from the Nation of Islam. In fact, as a group liable to persecution, 
they aren't in any danger at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole uproar is fraudulent, rearing a vast mountain out of a tiny 
molehill; just another way of hyping Israeli bond drives. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are potential mass murderers in our midst. They don't wear swastika 
armbands. Many of them are policy-makers, opinion-formers and respected members 
of the polity. Liberal foundations -- particularly environmentally oriented 
ones -- are top-heavy with them. They are Malthusians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the town of Chico the other day, a woman who said she was head of the 
Population Committee of the Sierra Club in California asked why I was so hard 
on Malthus. Why was I discounting the menace of overpopulation? 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Robert Malthus was an English economist of the early capitalist era. 
Read him and it will save you a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, 
Progressive Policy Review, the New Republic and almost every other journal of 
neoliberal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Malthus believed that the overbreeding poor would inevitably outstrip the 
means of subsistence. Attempts to alleviate poverty and misery only make things 
worse; the misery of the lower classes is the consequence of a natural law that 
functions "absolutely independent of all human regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Malthus felt quite differently about the more privileged sectors. Whereas the 
lower classes overbreed, the upper classes regulate their numbers, fearing that 
excessive reproduction will damage their station. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political economist, Malthus had to reconcile his theories of population 
with the problem of effective demand. Who were the consumers necessary to keep 
the system turning over? Malthus loathed the poor and rejected the idea of 
increased purchasing power among the laboring classes, arguing that under a 
system of private property, "the only effectual demand for produce must come 
from the owners of property," and that these affluent underbreeders would spare 
the otherwise inevitable visitation of misery on their own sector of mankind 
and secure "to a portion of society the leisure necessary for the progress of 
the arts and sciences," thus conferring on society "a most significant 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 For Malthus, the poor -- excepting workers necessary for production -- are 
dispensable and should not be assisted in any way. Consumption -- the exercise 
of effective demand -- is mostly the purview of the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel from Malthus to another English thinker, Cambridge philosopher and 
historian Ernest Gellner, whose speech on "Nationalism and the New World 
Order," offered at a 1993 conference on "Emerging Norms of Justified 
Intervention," appeared in the February bulletin of the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Gellner advances the foggy proposition that human society has been dominated 
by three types of motivation: honor, interest and salvation. Concerning us here 
is salvation, which Gellner defines as the idea of perfecting an industrial 
economy through the establishment of righteousness on Earth -- in other words, 
the just society.  
</P>
<P>
 According to this eminent thinker, salvationism has conclusively failed. All 
that remains for the human project is the establishment of a world government 
"to combat ecological threats and those posed by terrorism" and the formation 
of "a kind of International of Consumerist Unbelievers." In sum, a world police 
force plus Malthus' gentry, attending to the all-important work of circulating 
commodities. This adequately represents the thought of today's intellectual 
overlords. In Malthus' era, the answer to the problem of the poor was 
definitively given when the British did nothing to alleviate the starving to 
death of about 1 million Irish peasants in the mid-1840s. The welfare reformers 
of today have essentially the same perspective, for no "reform" is possible 
within the terms of capitalism, so there won't be any, aside from endeavoring 
to make life worse for the wretched. For openers: linking welfare to sterility. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Malthus and to Gellner is despised "salvationism" -- meaning 
that a society has to care for all its people, the "surplus poor" as well as 
the elites. Desperate people produce more babies than secure ones. Meanwhile, 
give me the single teen-age mom every time, making her rebellious, entirely 
rational choice.

 Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets was suspended by the NBA for one game 
Monday for hitting referee Bill Spooner in the stomach with an open hand during 
Sunday night's game in Phoenix.

 Olajuwon struck Spooner, apparently accidentally, while gesturing to protest

 "Spooner felt a shot in the solar plexus," said Darrell Garretson, NBA

 Guibert is considered Cuba's best basketball prospect. He left the Cuban 
national team during the 1993 regional athletic championships in Puerto Rico. 
In seven games, he averaged 14.9 points and 6.9 rebounds while leading his team

 Babe Ruth's 1930-31 contract, which netted him a then-record $80,000, sold for 
$29,900 at auction on Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that contract that inspired what was perhaps Ruth's greatest line. 
</P>
<P>
 After he had signed it, he was asked by reporters why he should be earning 
$5,000 more than President Herbert Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a better year," Ruth said.

CLIPPERS CAN'T KEEP PACE AGAIN 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To gauge the Clippers' success after five games of this six-game Eastern trip, 
one need look only at Ron Harper's numbers in the box score. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who was averaging 20.9 points, finished with four points on one-of-11 
shooting in a 126-93 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Monday night. The Clippers 
have lost four games during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, who had scored 30 or more points in six of his previous 
nine games, was able to lead the Clippers with only 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers' Reggie Miller, on the other hand, made all five of his three-point 
attempts in the first half as Indiana took a 66-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller ended a four-game shooting slump during which he made only 15-of-40 
field-goal attempts (37.5%). He finished with 22 points, including making five 
of six three-pointers and seven of 11 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep myself more spread out on the floor," Miller said. "When I 
do, it opens it up for the guys inside, and my defender had to come out with 
me. Harper tried to double down, and when he did, it gave me free looks from 
three-(point range)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins said the pace was set early. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go up against a good team like Indiana, you've got to come out ready 
to play, and we didn't tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rik Smits led seven Pacers scoring in double figures with 27 points, one shy 
of his season high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did a good job of coming out aggressive early," he said. "The 
last few games we were losing, we dug a hole for ourselves early. Tonight we 
came out aggressive and stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-foot-4 center, who started slowly, made 12 of 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches said with Elmore (Spencer, the Clippers' center), you have to 
move him a little because he's a little bit slow reacting," Smits said.

23 IS SUPERSONICS' LUCKY NUMBER IN 111-97 VICTORY

 Gary Payton scored 23 points and the Seattle SuperSonics forced 23 turnovers 
Monday night in beating the Denver Nuggets, 111-97, at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics shot under 40% for the third time this season but their 
defense carried them to their fifth straight victory and 14th in their last 17 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPhonso Ellis led the Nuggets with 20 points on 10-for-16 shooting. Dikembe 
Mutombo had 21 rebounds and nine points for the Nuggets, who had their 
four-game win streak end. Seattle converted 34 of 43 free throws to the 
Nuggets' 20 of 31.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday, the Milwaukee Bucks. Tonight, the Minnesota Timberwolves. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is almost as though Don King had lined up the tomato cans for Magic 
Johnson's first two coaching assignments at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 More will be known about the impact of Coach Johnson on the Lakers Thursday 
when they play the SuperSonics in Seattle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But, already, count the dean of NBA assistant coaches, Bill Bertka, among the 
impressed. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is such a dominating presence," Bertka said after the Lakers' 110-101 
victory over the Bucks. "Remember the way he used to dribble the ball with one 
hand and give directions with the other? Well, it was the same thing most of 
the night except that he didn't have a ball. He was animated. He was really 
into the game." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The game lasted 2 1/2 hours, which was 45 minutes less than the first practice 
session conducted by Johnson on Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He was great working on the basics, one on one with the players," said 
Bertka, in his 22nd season as an NBA assistant. "What a wonderful opportunity 
it is for them to have someone who is able to demonstrate the intricacies that 
make the big picture." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of Johnson's pregame talk with reporters was that the emphasis would 
be on defense. Then the Lakers went out and held Milwaukee to an opponent 
season low of 14 points in the first quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, the Bucks' 41 points were the most scored by a Laker opponent in a 
fourth quarter this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The questions: Will Johnson-coached teams have to pace themselves better? Did 
the marathon Saturday practice take too much out of them? Did fatigue set in 
Sunday because the Lakers aren't in the kind of shape they should be this time 
of the year? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Magic is younger than three of his players -- James Edwards, Kurt Rambis and 
Dan Schayes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best-conditioned Laker might be assistant coach Michael Cooper, who looks as 
though he hasn't put on an ounce since his playing days. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Count Cooper among the possible successors, if, as conventional wisdom 
suggests, Magic doesn't return as coach next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Detroit Piston forward Terry Mills and George Foreman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Roy Tarpley, who is playing in Greece, has applied for reinstatement to the 
NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Further evidence that the number of thoroughbred racing dates should be cut 
down in the Southland: only 61 horses, an average of fewer than seven a race, 
ran Sunday at Santa Anita. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse Award-winning trainer Bobby Frankel might run Eagle Eye in the Santa 
Anita Derby on April 9 if the colt, who in his last race defeated Soul Of The 
Matter, performs well in the Baldwin Stakes on Wednesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was unusual enough that a full brother and sister, Pirate's Revenge and 
Echo Of Yesterday, won races on the same card Saturday at Santa Anita. But the 
next day, Royal Issue and his full sister, Miss Inn Zone, each ran second. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Swift beat Rod Jett in the 110-meter hurdles at the Stanford 
Invitational. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow must really feel wanted by the Angels. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Jordan, who probably was going to be traded by the Philadelphia 
Phillies, is starting at first base in place of John Kruk and tearing up the 
Grapefruit League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Luis Tiant will be a pitching coach for the Dodgers' Great Falls, Mont., 
franchise in the Pioneer League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe El Tiante can teach Chan Ho Park some tricks with his delivery before 
the Dodgers break camp at Vero Beach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tim McCarver is getting more exposure on CBS in commercials than when the 
network televised an occasional baseball game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if Jim McMahon rejoins his old Brigham Young quarterback 
coach, Mike Holmgren, at Green Bay. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Never has a quarterback who has done less in the National Football League 
brought more on the trade market over the years than Jeff George. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Name Game: They have been the Racine, Chicago, St. Louis, Phoenix and now 
Arizona Cardinals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Troy Aikman would be absolutely delighted to have Barry Switzer, his 
coach at Oklahoma before he transferred to UCLA, replace Jimmy Johnson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Few have contributed as much to high school sports in Southern California as 
former athlete, coach and administrator Kenny Fagans, who died Saturday at 84.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; MONSON WHETS HER APPETITE FOR SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it's the wheat. More likely it's hard work and sound coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Monson is allergic to so many foods -- wheat, oats, yeast, chicken, 
dairy products, eggs, squash and nuts, to name a few -- that sneaking a Wheat 
Thin without suffering an adverse reaction is reason to rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Monson has plenty of reasons to celebrate: small steps in the 
kitchen and huge strides on the track, where she has become Irvine's top 
distance runner as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished eighth in the Big West Conference during cross-country season and 
has trimmed 36 seconds off her best time in the 3,000 meters (9 minutes 53.7 
seconds); almost 30 seconds off her personal best in the 5,000 (17:28.29), and 
lowered her best time in the 1,500 by 11 seconds (4:41.10). 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine's first five track meets this year, she won the 3,000 all three 
times she ran it, the 5,000 the one time she entered and finished second and 
fourth in the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conference rankings aren't out, but you can safely say she's in the top 
three in each of those events," Coach Vince O'Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson drew some notice as a sophomore at Claremont High, but didn't progress 
much after that. She chose Irvine over Washington and Idaho and O'Boyle has 
benefited from all that pent-up potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a different coach after her sophomore year and he was basically a 
sprint coach," O'Boyle said, "She didn't have the strength or knowledge to 
improve as a junior and senior. She had no idea about pace. She would just go 
right to the front every time. And she wasn't a very good finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she's already learned a lot because she's dying to learn. She's developed 
a good sense of pace and she's closing races well now. And she's just scraping 
the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Monson says O'Boyle has helped her with technique and race savvy, but his 
training program has allowed her to reach a new level of fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, we had a very low-mileage program and we trained with the 800 
runners," she said. "I'd run a two-mile and when the mile hit, there was 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vince's program is considered low-mileage on this level, but I'm running way 
more than I ever did in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 And ever so willingly, O'Boyle will tell you with wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give them a workout to do on their own and Laura will say, 'So we run 
for an hour on Saturday and 30 minutes on Sunday, right?' and I'll know that 
those two things will be done," he said. "With everybody else, you just hope 
they do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got that naivete, but she's very, very tough. She won't quit on 
anything. Over Christmas vacation, she followed her program exactly. And when 
an athlete comes to you in really great shape, it's our job as teachers to make 
sure she's prepared for the big steps." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, a leap. And all it took was dedication, good advice . . . and 
soon maybe a spoonful of the Breakfast of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 (Hold the milk, though.) 
</P>

 Ouch patrol: The men's tennis team, picked No. 25 in the nation in the 
preseason Intercollegiate Tennis Assn. poll, has slipped to 7-8, losing close 
matches to USC, UCLA, Cal and Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's No. 2 singles player, Fred Bach, has been hampered by a hamstring 
injury and No. 4 Carlos Bustos has tendinitis in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries really hurt when you play as tough a schedule as we play," Coach 
Steve Clark said. "We have some depth, but it's mostly young talent."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; KINGS SLAM THE DOOR ON THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To borrow a phrase or two from Laker announcer Chick Hearn, the Kings' season 
is in the refrigerator. The door's shut, the lights are out, the eggs are 
cooling, the butter's getting hard and the Jell-O's jiggling. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is over. Their playoff hopes evaporated Sunday, when they lost to 
Vancouver and fell 10 points behind San Jose for the last Western Conference 
playoff berth with nine games to play. The Sharks, showing character when it 
counted, were 3-0-1 on a tough trip last week. They have eight games left, 
including five at home. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Mighty Ducks, their door is still open, but only a crack. They're 
eight points out with eight games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the back burner," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said recently. "But we might 
have to get popped in the microwave." 
</P>
<P>
 Quick heating probably won't save the Ducks, but their season is still a 
success because so much less was expected of them in their debut than was 
expected from the Kings, who were Stanley Cup finalists last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are a young, enthusiastic, hard-working team with excellent 
prospects in Paul Kariya -- the fourth pick in last year's draft -- and whoever 
they choose as the second pick in this year's draft. Their coach, Ron Wilson, 
and general manager, Jack Ferreira, respect one another and work well together. 
They have stable ownership, a showcase arena and a cohesive organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are Wayne Gretzky and Kelly Hrudey and whoever else feels like 
playing that night. Their coach, Barry Melrose, and general manager Nick 
Beverley, snipe at one another. They allowed Darryl Sydor, a talented young 
defenseman, to regress this season and put too much pressure on Rob Blake, 
another youngster. Their defensive play is a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely did they show the urgency that fueled their playoff drive last spring. 
They always had excuses for losses and projected the attitude that it's a long 
season and there was plenty of time to start a winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore, there isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 From owner Bruce McNall on down, changes are likely next season. Beverley and 
President Roy Mlakar are primary candidates for dismissal and Melrose isn't 
safe either. He will probably get a grace period to prove which was the fluke, 
this season's dismal performance or last spring's run to the final, but unless 
he figures out how to motivate and lead this complacent, rudderless team, he 
won't last long. PLAYOFF DERBY 
</P>
<P>
 In the Eastern Conference, the expansion Florida Panthers have regained a 
small lead over the Philadelphia Flyers for the final spot. The edge there goes 
to the Panthers, based on the season-long excellence of goaltenders John 
Vanbiesbrouck and Mark Fitzpatrick. The Flyers' offense is more explosive, but 
good goaltending will win playoff games -- and games that determine playoff 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals are holding onto seventh place, mostly by default. The 
New York Islanders are too soft to challenge and the Quebec Nordiques started 
their surge too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The real jockeying is for the top seedings. The New Jersey Devils, probably 
the best-kept secret in the NHL this season, on Sunday tied the New York 
Rangers for the top point total at 99. They're 12-1-3 over the last month under 
first-year Coach Jacques Lemaire, who obviously learned something about winning 
during his years with the Canadiens. WOE IS HE 
</P>
<P>
 Banks are clamoring for money they say he owes them, he's trying to sell a 
majority interest in his hockey team and he is quoted in a "Vanity Fair" 
article as saying that he smuggled some of the ancient coins that formed the 
basis of his financial empire. What's next for King owner McNall? 
</P>
<P>
 Losing his position as chairman of the NHL's Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's term expires in June, so he will probably just decline to run for 
reelection. It's a perfect way for him to exit somewhat gracefully, given his 
financial entanglements and the concern among NHL officials that he couldn't be 
an effective chairman while owning as little as 35% of his own club. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman intended to discuss McNall's intentions last week 
when the two flew to New York for a board meeting but McNall fell asleep and 
the conversation was postponed. Expect Bettman to reschedule it soon. RAGING 
RANGERS 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Keenan's imprint was unmistakably stamped on all five trades the 
Rangers made last week. General Manager Neil Smith said forwards Tony Amonte 
and Mike Gartner "had no nastiness to them," and the players he got, Craig 
MacTavish, Stephane Matteau and Brian Noonan "have nastiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't he already have enough nastiness, with Keenan there? 
</P>
<P>
 "(Keenan) is running everything," traded forward Phil Bourque said. "It's his 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 The deals seem to back that up. Matteau and Noonan played for Keenan in 
Chicago, and Keenan praised MacTavish two years ago for his performance in a 
playoff series against the Keenan-coached Blackhawks. He also wanted players 
who have won Stanley Cup rings and he now has seven who won jewelry in Edmonton 
-- but how relevant are rings won seven years ago? The Rangers are 
significantly older -- Anderson is 33 and MacTavish 35 -- and probably less 
skillful. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't win the Cup this season, look for Smith to take the fall because 
Keenan is in his first season and Smith has had five seasons to win. Smith has 
assembled incredible talent, but the Rangers have always found a way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bourque of Keenan, "I'd love to knock him out of the playoffs again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bourque had that pleasure two years ago, when he played for the Pittsburgh 
Penguins and defeated Keenan's Blackhawks in the final. SLAPSHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials in Buffalo believe there's no connection between 
past blackmail attempts against players from the former Soviet Union and the 
Russian man who was arrested outside the Sabres' locker room Saturday and 
charged with threatening to shoot and stab Buffalo right wing Alexander Mogilny 
unless Mogilny paid him $150,000. Sergey Pavlosky was charged with 
second-degree attempted grand larceny. . . . Last week was a bad one for Phil 
Bourque and Ray Bourque, who are not related. First, the Rangers traded Phil to 
the lowly Ottawa Senators, the best argument against further expansion. Then 
Ray, the Bruins' four-time Norris Trophy winner, sprained his right knee. He's 
not expected back until the playoffs.

 The latest relocation-expansion rumor: Ted Turner of Atlanta Braves and WTBS 
fame reportedly will buy the Hartford Whalers and move them to Atlanta, a 
market the NHL would love to re-enter. . . . Blackhawk goalie Ed Belfour missed 
a game because of an injury last Thursday for the first time in his career. 
Belfour has a muscle strain in his left leg, but it's not serious.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: KEEPING TRACK OF HIM IS EASY

 Jim Bush is wandering around a track again this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, in his fourth year as coach at USC, has been track-side somewhere in 
this city for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What is new, though, is that Bush, 67, apparently has recovered from prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's condition was diagnosed on Feb. 15 and he was told that immediate 
surgery would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 His first inclination was to wait until after the track season.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't show up there when I don't feel good, how do I expect my athletes 
to show up?" Bush argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But his wife, Francoise, and the doctors insisted, and a compromise was 
reached. Bush was allowed to postpone the surgery for a week -- until after the 
track banquet and the first meet of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 21, two days after the Long Beach Relays, Bush underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 He coached from his bed for the next three weeks -- watching videotapes and 
talking to athletes over the telephone -- before returning to the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he now realizes it was probably foolish to return so quickly, he 
said, simply, "The kids needed me." 
</P>
<P>
 And he needed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do love coaching," Bush said. "It's my whole life. It's all I've ever 
wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush coached UCLA from 1965-84, leading the Bruins to five NCAA championships 
and three second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next five years as the conditioning coach for the Dodgers, the 
Raiders and the Clippers before becoming a volunteer assistant coach at USC in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He took over the USC program two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bush has received more awards than anyone can shake a baton at, he 
knows there are those who want him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponents tell everybody I'm too old and I'm quitting, but they are full 
of baloney," Bush said. "I'm either going to die here or they are going to have 
to fire me." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Bush would figure as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have one speed and that's all out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be why he has had three operations, including the surgery for 
cancer, in the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, he fell off his jet ski at Lake Tahoe and suffered a knee injury, 
which required surgery. A month later, he had more surgery to remove cartilage 
in his jaw, which had been bothering him since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering all that, it may amaze some that Bush is back at the track.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a tough, old son of a gun," he said. "Next year, I will be meaner -- and 
more determined -- than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing new about that, either.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Balazs Kiss, who won the NCAA title in the hammer throw last season as a 
freshman, returns to lead USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans hope to improve on last season's third-place finish in the Pacific 
10 Conference meet and 18th-place finish at the NCAA meet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is well on its way to running away with its third-consecutive Pac-10 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins also finished fourth in the NCAA indoor meet at Indianapolis March 
11-12. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is led by its throwers, four of whom are capable of putting the shot more 
than 60 feet. Bob Larsen, 10-year veteran UCLA coach, said that gives the 
Bruins the best group of shotputters in collegiate history. 
</P>
<P>
 They are led by John Godina, who won the event at the NCAA indoor meet with a 
mark of 65-8 3/4. That tied his personal best, which he set last year when he 
was second in the NCAA outdoor meet.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Bolden, who took over the UCLA women's track team at the end of last 
season from nine-year Coach Bobby Kersee, has had her hands full this season, 
learning how to be a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching the athletes is the easy part for Bolden, who was Kersee's assistant 
the last two years. Bolden was a five-time All-American at UCLA from 1981-83. 
She won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. 400-meter relay team in the 1984 
Olympics here and placed fourth in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficult part about being a head coach, Bolden said, is the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 She relaxes by visiting the family business, the 27th Street Bakery, in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery, which specializes in sweet-potato pies, has been in Bolden's 
family for 40 years. It kept its doors open after the 1992 Los Angeles riots 
despite having lost 25% of its customers because so many surrounding businesses 
had been burned or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA in-season athletes, the bakery's goods are off limits because they 
are too fattening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are hoping to repeat as conference champions and to improve on last 
season's third-place finish at the NCAA meet.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year's star, two-time national champion shotputter Dawn Dumble, will 
red-shirt this season to save her senior year of eligibility for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will be led by freshman Amy Acuff, who won the NCAA indoor national 
high jump title earlier this month with a mark of 6 feet 2 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The USC women's track team, which placed third last season at the Pac-10 meet, 
will get assists this season from basketball players Lisa Leslie and Karleen 
Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, a 6-5 senior who was voted the Naismith national player of the year, 
and Shields, a 5-7 junior guard, led USC to the NCAA Mideast Region final this 
weekend in Fayetteville, Ark., where the Trojans lost to Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie and Shields are expected to join the track team in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie high-jumped for four years at Morningside High, winning the 1990 
Southern Section Division 2-A title. She will compete in the high jump and long 
jump for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Shields earned all-state honors as a senior at Snyder High in Texas in 1986. 
She will compete in the long jump and triple jump for the Trojans.

NHL ROUNDUP; CANADIENS WIN TO AVERT SWEEP AT HOME BY SENATORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul DiPietro and Gilbert Dionne, recent residents of Coach Jacques Demers' 
doghouse, emerged as the stars of the Montreal Canadiens' 3-2 victory over the 
Ottawa Senators on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPietro tied the score at 10:27 of the third period on a pass from Dionne, 
and Dionne scored with 24 seconds left after DiPietro won a faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens avoided the humiliation of being swept at home by Ottawa this 
season. The Senators had won the two previous games at Montreal's Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Both got more than their usual ice time after center John LeClair left the 
game because of bruised ribs in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who don't get a lot of ice time did a big job," said Demers, who 
coached his 800th NHL game. "When LeClair got hurt, we had to change up the 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Dionne's goal was his first in 11 games and gave him 18 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did me a lot of good to get that goal," Dionne said. "It wasn't good that 
I had gone 11 games without scoring, but what really bothered me was that I had 
dropped to minus-7." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Bellows scored in the first period for Montreal, which ended a 
three-game winless run and moved into a tie for first place with Pittsburgh in 
the Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Murray and Evgeny Davydov scored for Ottawa, which is last overall in the 
26-team league. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 5, Florida 4 -- Dave Gagner scored twice as the Stars took control with 
four consecutive goals in the second period at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Doug Zmolek and wing Russ Courtnall also scored in the second 
period as Dallas turned a 2-1 deficit into a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss prevented the expansion Panthers from moving into sole possession of 
seventh place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, Toronto 2 -- Murray Craven's goal with 63 seconds left in 
overtime lifted the Canucks at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs' Wendel Clark scored his 41st goal with 27 seconds left in 
regulation to tie it.

 With so much attention focused on Arizona's Khalid Reeves and Damon 
Stoudamire, Florida's backcourt of Craig Brown and Dan Cross have been somewhat 
overlooked.

<P>
 How do they stack up?

 Here is one coach's appraisal: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking anything away from Florida's two kids, because I think they're 
two of the more underrated players around," said Boston College's Jim O'Brien. 
"But those two guys from Arizona are terrific. (The Florida) kids may be close 
to them, and maybe the thing that separates them is an attitude. The guys from 
Arizona have a little more of a reputation. Sometimes, with a reputation, goes 
a little bit of an attitude that makes you a little bit better."

 Williamson, a 6-foot-7, 245-pound sophomore who starts for Arkansas, is known 
as "The Big Nasty." The snake is "Little Nasty."

 Coach Nolan Richardson prefers the player.

 "The Big Nasty is our inside offense," Richardson said. "Pound for pound, he 
may be the strongest basketball player in the world. Not the state, the world."

 Not much of an encore by Askia Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas State senior, coming off a 62-point game against Fresno State in 
the quarterfinals, managed only 17 points Monday night as the Wildcats lost to 
Vanderbilt, 82-76. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodores (20-11) advanced to Wednesday night's final against Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy McCaffrey scored 28 points and Ronnie McMahan 27, and each helped guard 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been challenged to guard the best off-guard on the other team all year," 
McMahan said. "I just tried to crowd him, and I thought we did a good job 
containing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, McCaffrey and McMahan freed themselves for jump shots or went 
around the defense to score on drives through the lane. And when they weren't 
scoring, center Chris Lawson was. He finished with 14 points and combined with 
McCaffrey and McMahan to score 46 of Vanderbilt's 50 points after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanova 66, Siena 58 -- Kerry Kittles scored 21 points and the Wildcats held 
on after taking a big early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanova (19-12) opened a 13-point lead in the first eight minutes, taking 
advantage of Siena's jitters before a partisan crowd of 16,978. It was the 
largest NIT crowd at Madison Square Garden since the 1981 championship game 
between Tulsa and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After Siena (24-8) cut the deficit to seven with four minutes left, Villanova 
scored eight of its final 10 points from the free throw line and kept the 
Saints at least six points behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Williams scored 15 for Villanova, which won for the 13th time in 16 
games after starting the season 6-9.

 With a secretary and a small office, J. Kenneth Fagans built the CIF Southern 
Section into one of the country's largest and most powerful high school 
athletic associations. 
</P>
<P>
 When he retired as commissioner in 1975 after 21 years, the section had grown 
from 218 schools to 458. The number of sports had expanded from 11 for boys to 
22 for boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny oversaw the largest high school athletic expansion this state has ever 
seen, and he didn't have a lot of help early on," said Thomas Byrnes, CIF 
commissioner. "He did his job with an innovation not often seen on this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrnes, who was hired by Fagans as a section administrator in 1973, was 
saddened by the news of his former boss' death over the weekend. Fagans 
suffered a massive heart attack Saturday night at Hoag Memorial Hospital in 
Newport Beach. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Davis, CIF associate commissioner, said Fagans stayed in power for so 
long because he surrounded himself with successful colleagues who were not 
afraid to offer opinions or criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers Fagans as the man who helped accelerate the growth of girls' 
sports. The Southern Section held the first girls' athletic event in the state, 
a swimming invitational at Beverly Hills High in 1970, two years before Title 
IX was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed in change, and he was not afraid to make the necessary moves," 
she said. "He always stayed a step ahead of everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring, Fagans stayed active in the Southern Section. He was a member 
of its alumni committee and wrote a column in the newsletter. As his health 
began deteriorating, he gradually cut back. He was too sick to attend the State 
basketball tournament, his favorite event, in Oakland earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagans was a basketball star at Huntington Park High and Oregon State. He 
later coached the sport at Compton High, where his teams won 53 consecutive 
games from 1950-53. He was an assistant principal at Compton Centennial before 
joining the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny Fagans was the CIF, and that is how those of us who worked with him 
will remember him," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner.

 Mark Paredes, who resigned as football coach and athletic director at La 
Puente Bishop Amat last week, said he had been considering a change for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sent out about one resume a year for the last several years," he said. 
"I'm slow to change, but I felt this was the right move for me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Paredes, 41, will leave in June to become the coach at Riverside North. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been at Bishop Amat for 18 years, the last eight as football coach. He 
has an 84-14 record and has won eight league titles and a Southern Section 
title. The Lancers were 15-0 in 1992, setting a state record for most victories 
in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Paredes said the high visibility of the program was not a factor in his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always let the program speak for itself," he said. "But this decision 
seems to be shocking everyone but me. It's something I've often thought about." 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made concerning a successor. Paredes said he will sit 
down with the school's administrators in the coming weeks to discuss the 
options. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Prep baseball in Southern California is among the best in the country. A 
half-dozen local schools have been mentioned in various preseason national 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Simi Valley is the team mentioned most often. The Pioneers were 
No. 1 much of last season before being upset by Anaheim Esperanza in the 
Southern Section Division I final, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Scyphers' program is so solid that although only two experienced 
seniors return, Simi Valley is expected to contend for a section championship. 
Back are right-handed pitcher Bill Scheffels, who was 11-2 with a 1.17 
earned-run average last year, and third baseman Ryan Hankins, who batted .500, 
drove in 57 runs and hit 12 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Organized baseball's amateur draft in June figures to involve many local 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list is Brett Nista, an infielder from Laguna Hills. The 
senior, who already has signed with UCLA, batted .430, had 29 RBIs and 11 home 
runs, and stole 16 bases in 16 tries last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another prospect is Jaret Wright of Anaheim Katella. The right-handed pitcher 
was 4-3 with a 3.01 ERA last season, but his fastball has been clocked at 94 
m.p.h, The 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior also has the size scouts like. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who had 80 strikeouts and hit seven home runs as a junior, is the son 
of former Angel Clyde Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top prospects at catcher is Jeremy Booth of Beverly Hills. Booth, 
6-5 and 230, batted .562 and had a fielding average of .991 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player to watch is Derek Nicholson of West Torrance. The shortstop 
batted .520 and had five triples and 16 doubles last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura High, the defending Southern Section Division I 
champion in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters, is sitting out this track season to 
concentrate on her studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, a junior, is academically eligible to compete, according to her 
coach, Bill Duley. But Duley said her grades did not meet her parents' 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing third in the 1,600 at the State meet in 1992, Skieresz was 
expected to contend for the title last season. But she contracted mononucleosis 
before a qualifying meet and did not run. She is a two-time Division I state 
champion in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, there is no Marion Jones to watch during the 
track season. The state's all-time sprint leader, who won nine individual 
titles while at Oxnard Rio Mesa and Thousand Oaks, is in her first year at 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 And things are returning to normal at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the telephone calls and the interviews wear on you," said Art Green, 
Thousand Oaks' coach. "And that's nothing against the kid, but it does take a 
toll on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Green said he has a young team that could compete for a Marmonte League title. 
For a change, however, the Lancers' top runner is not a sprinter. Sophomore Kim 
Mortensen runs the 1,600 and 3,200. She placed 10th in the Foot Locker West 
regional cross-country meet last December. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The City Section may have a new football playoff format next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Football Coaches Assn., which represents the section's 49 high 
schools, is proposing that teams not be designated as Division 4-A or 3-A until 
the regular season is complete. Placement then would be based on record and 
strength of schedule, with tougher teams in 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, each of the six conference champions automatically would in 
the 4-A bracket and the remaining 10 teams would be chosen subjectively. Formal 
ratification is expected at the section's Interscholastic Athletic Committee 
meeting in May. Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Nicole Erickson of Brea-Olinda and center Olympia Scott of Playa del Rey 
St. Bernard will represent California in the third Kodak All-American girls' 
basketball game on April 16 at Jackson, Tenn. Guards Timicha Kirby of Lynwood 
and Mimi McKinney of Palos Verdes Peninsula were selected as alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schuster, the football coach at Azusa the last nine years, is the new 
coach at Corona del Mar. He replaces Dave Holland, who guided the Sea Kings to 
two Southern Section titles in 20 years. . . . Shane Wiley is the new football 
coach at Riverside Poly, replacing Dan Armstrong who stepped down after one 
season. A Poly assistant the last three years, Wiley, 26, becomes one of the 
Southland's youngest coaches. . . . Jim Brownfield, longtime football and 
girls' track coach at Pasadena Muir, will be honored at a retirement dinner and 
roast Friday night in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team finished the season No. 1 in USA Today. 
The Ladycats (33-0) extended their winning streak to 54 by defeating San Jose 
Archbishop Mitty for the State Division III title on March 19, 54-44. 
Meanwhile, Crenshaw (29-2) finished No. 3 in the boys' basketball poll after 
beating Carmichael Jesuit for its sixth State Division I title in 12 years, 
89-79.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; OSUNA ACQUIRED IN TRADE WITH ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers acquired left-handed reliever Al Osuna from the Houston Astros for 
minor league pitcher James Daspit on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance to get a pitcher at a position (at which) we didn't have 
much depth," Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading contender to be the sole left-hander in the bullpen had been Gary 
Wayne, who has a 0.69 earned-run average in 13 spring innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna, 28, from Inglewood, started 1993 in the minors and finished the season 
with the Astros, going 1-1 with a 3.20 earned-run average in 44 major league 
games. In 12 appearances for Houston this spring, Osuna was 1-1 with a 4.50 
ERA, with seven walks in 12 innings.  
</P>
<P>
 His most effective season was his rookie year, 1991, when he went 7-6 with 12 
saves and a 3.42 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna, who will make $375,000 this season, was expected to arrive in Vero 
Beach, Fla., this morning in time for the Dodgers' game against the Astros, and 
Manager Tom Lasorda said Osuna might pitch against his old club.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Osuna was involved in an exchange with Darryl Strawberry, who took 
offense to some statements by Osuna. Strawberry then made derogatory remarks 
about Osuna and promptly saw three of Osuna's pitches whistling past his head 
in a game on Sept. 12 that year. An at-bat later, Strawberry hit a home run off 
Osuna to win the game in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna discounted the incident with Strawberry as "competitive nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Daspit, 24, a 6-foot-7 right-hander, was 3-8 with a 4.43 ERA at double-A San 
Antonio last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza hit his eighth home run of the spring in the first inning, a 
two-run shot against the Yankees' Jim Abbott in the Dodgers' 8-4 exhibition 
loss at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. . . . Right fielder Raul Mondesi got his seventh 
assist of Grapefruit League play when he caught Paul O'Neill taking a big a 
turn around first base after getting a single. . . . . Kevin Gross struggled 
again, giving up five runs and seven hits in four innings against New York. In 
three spring starts, Gross has given up 16 earned runs in 14 innings -- a 10.29 
ERA. Gross has one scheduled start left this spring, and both Lasorda and 
Claire suggested they were concerned about Gross' readiness to start the season 
in the rotation. TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LEITER IS EXPECTED TO BE FIFTH STARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Leiter, who was out of a job two weeks ago, has earned a spot on the 
Angels' opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will guarantee his $300,000 salary at noon today, and he is 
expected to become the fifth starter in the rotation, allowing the Angels to 
send rookie Brian Anderson to triple-A Vancouver for experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter yielded four hits and three runs, two earned, in 4 2/3 innings in the 
Angels' 9-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners at Tempe, Ariz., Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to keep Leiter sets the pitching staff, but the Angels still are 
tinkering with the rest of their roster. They signed utility infielder Rex 
Hudler and hope to acquire second baseman Harold Reynolds from the San Diego 
Padres today for a minor league pitcher, perhaps Hilly Hathaway. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided they will release reliever Lee Guetterman, and either trade or 
release infielders Torey Lovullo and Mike Brumley. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers also must decide whether to keep rookie outfielder Jim 
Edmonds as a defensive replacement on his bench or first baseman J.T. Snow. The 
roster must be set by 9 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, saying that everyone involved should feel like a failure, optioned 
pitcher Russ Springer to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "When I called him in I told him, 'To me, this is a failure for 
all of us. I feel I failed. (Pitching coach) Chuck Hernandez feels he failed. 
Whitey Herzog, who made the trade, feels he failed. And you should feel that 
you failed.' It's a shame we have to send the best arm in camp back to the 
minors, again." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, one of three players acquired in the Jim Abbott trade of a year ago, 
was 0-2 with a 14.34 ERA this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler says he couldn't be any happier finishing his professional career 
playing for the Angels. 
</P>

 "I was originally planning to stay over there two or three years," Hudler, 33,

 Pitcher Joe Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery in February, is 
scheduled to make his spring training debut Wednesday against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. He also might pitch again in the Freeway Series against the Dodgers 
this weekend. The Angels plan to send him to Class-A Lake Elsinore to open the 
season, and after two or three starts will decide whether to bring him back.

 Third baseman Damion Easley played in his third consecutive game without sore 
shins. Easley played in only 73 games last season because of shin splints that 
eventually required surgery. He went four for four and scored three runs and is 
leading the team with a .391 batting average and eight stolen bases.

 Left-handed reliever Craig Lefferts, whose guaranteed contract saved him from 
being released 10 days ago, has done a turnaround. He pitched 2 1/3 hitless 
innings and struck out three. He has earned a spot on the team, Rodgers said. .

 Rookie J.R. Phillips lost his bid to take over Will Clark's first base job, 
becoming one of five players cut by the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants reduced their roster to 26, optioning Phillips and pitcher Tony 
Menendez to triple-A Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips lost out to veteran Todd Benzinger despite batting .327 this spring 
and driving in a team-high 17 runs. Phillips also had seven extra-base hits, 
including three homers, in 49 at-bats and was voted the top newcomer in camp.

</P>
<P>
 Dennis Boucher followed and didn't give up a hit in three innings. Butch Henry 
gave up one hit in the next two innings, and Mel Rojas picked up the save with 
a scoreless ninth.

 The Braves' Steve Avery, scheduled to pitch five innings, left after two 
because of a sore muscle. . . . Baltimore purchased Lonnie Smith's minor league

TROTMAN HAS BETTER IDEA FOR FORD; CARS: AUTO MAKER'S NEW CHAIRMAN IS EXPECTED 
TO PUSH TO COMBINE EUROPEAN AND U.S. OPERATIONS INTO A SINGLE UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman may soon promote a new generation of 
managers who will try to combine Ford's massive U.S. and European automotive 
operations into a single global unit, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trotman, Ford's first foreign-born chairman, aims to leave his mark on the 
auto maker by breaking down barriers between the operations. But the task may 
take years to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 The British native has often talked of "draining the Atlantic" with satellite 
links and common engineering systems, and has vowed to eliminate duplication of 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what form such a combination would take, but analysts say it 
would likely mean a shake-up of management and elimination of some 
administrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's bound to be some consolidation when this is announced over the next 
couple of months," said one source close to the company. Ford had 166,943 U.S. 
employees in 1993 and 99,527 in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Reorganization plans may be announced internally in April, when Trotman plans 
to discuss Ford's global strategy with the company's top 400 managers at a 
meeting in Toronto. Ford spokeswoman Judith Muhlberg said the meeting is held 
every four years, but she declined to discuss its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has already taken globalization steps, and this week will introduce its 
Ford Contour sedan, a product of its $6-billion "world car" program that 
developed a single mid-size car platform for both Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say intense rivalries between Ford's engineering centers in 
Dearborn, Mich.; Dunton, England, and Cologne, Germany, inflated the car's cost 
and stretched out its development time to six years -- twice the current 
industry benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Trotman vigorously defends Ford's investment in the project, but analysts said 
that, at the very least, he must slash costs of future "world car" programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets the chance to prove that  
</P>
<P>
 everything he is doing today works when they're going through the next 
downturn" in 1997 or 1998, said Lehman Bros. analyst Joseph Phillippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said it is also time for Trotman, who became chairman nearly five 
months ago, to announce a new management team to carry out his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still operating under a structure set up by his predecessor, Harold 
Poling, and has not yet named a new chief for Ford's global automotive units, 
known as the Ford Automotive Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "His grace period is up," said Eugene Jennings, professor emeritus of 
management at Michigan State University. "It is time that Trotman move the 
right people into the right places to achieve, among other things, a 
globalization of his resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who advises corporate chief executives, said Trotman will likely 
turn to younger managers with international experience to break down internal 
"fiefdoms." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way Ford can go global without a major management shake-up," 
Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Ford's vice chairmen, Allan Gilmour and Louis Ross, who vied 
with Trotman for the top job last year, may be asked to retire soon to make way 
for the new team. Ross is chief technical officer, while Gilmour heads finance 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Top candidates to head the Ford Automotive Group include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ed Hagenlocker, 54, the executive vice president of North American 
Automotive Operations who spearheaded Ford's aggressive expansion in the U.S. 
truck market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jacques Nasser, 46, who has led a major cost-cutting drive as chairman of 
Ford of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * W. Wayne Booker, 59, executive vice president of international automotive 
operations, who has strengthened ties with Mazda Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates for promotion are James Donaldson, 51, vice president and 
general manager of Truck Operations; Kenneth Kohrs, 55, vice president of North 
American Car Product Development; and Oscar Marx, 55, vice president of 
worldwide automotive components operations.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; SMALL STOCKS DIVE; BOND YIELDS EASE

<P>
 Stocks closed broadly lower Monday in a selloff led by smaller issues and 
other recent market leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, long-term yields slipped from Friday's 10-month highs, as 
oil and other commodity prices tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market had a rough day as selling that had clipped blue-chips on 
Friday spilled into smaller stocks. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller issues dove 10.95 points, or 1.4%, to 772.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average, which fell a total of 95 points last Thursday and 
Friday, continued to give ground early Monday, and by midday the index was off 
more than 46 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But buyers returned later in the day, and the Dow closed down 12.38 points at 
3,762.35. That is just slightly above where it finished 1993, at 3,754.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said blue chips were pulled up by a recovery in the bond market. The 
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, which crossed the 7% level Friday for the 
first time since last May, eased to 6.97% at the close, as falling commodity 
prices dampened inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the stock market's weakness was pervasive. Losers outnumbered winners 
by 12 to 5 on New York Stock Exchange and by 19 to 8 on Nasdaq. Volume, 
however, was only moderate at 287 million shares on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Streeters say the stock market's bearish turn last week reflected rising 
interest rates and a host of political concerns, including the widening reach 
of the Clinton Administration's Whitewater scandal, the assassination of 
Mexico's probable future president and saber-rattling by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts say that if long-term bond yields can hold below the 7% 
level, the stock market could mount a new rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that the bond market is trying to settle down, and stocks are 
probably completing this selloff," said Peter Canelo, chief investment 
strategist at NatWest Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street got an unexpected windfall of good news in plummeting commodity 
prices Monday. Higher commodity prices recently have fanned inflation worries, 
helping to push interest rates up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, oil sank more than $1 a barrel after OPEC failed to agree on new 
production cuts. And the Commodity Research Bureau index of key commodities, 
which hit a four-year high last week, slid 3.19 points or 1.4% to 227.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Metals were among commodities hit by selling Monday. Gold futures for current 
delivery lost $3 to $388 an ounce on the Comex; silver fell 10.2 cents to 
$5.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nasdaq market was slammed by a selloff in technology stocks, many of 
which had been market leaders this year. Losers included KLA Instruments, off 5 
1/8 to 34 5/8; Lotus Development, off 3 to 73 1/4; Xircom, down 2 1/4 to 22 
1/2; Merisel, off 1 5/8 to 18 3/4; and America On-Line, down 3 1/8 to 81 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among bigger tech stocks hit by profit-taking, Computer Associates dropped 3 
1/8 to 32 7/8, Texas Instruments fell 1 3/4 to 78 1/2 and Micron Technology 
lost 2 7/8 to 82 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial issues also were lower. PPG Industries fell 2 1/8 to 74 3/4, 
Kennametal dove 2 1/4 to 53 5/8, Caterpillar fell 2 5/8 to 114 and Inland Steel 
was off 1 1/8 to 32 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy-related stocks dropped with oil's price. Chevron sank 1 1/4 to 88 
1/4, Atlantic Richfield tumbled 3 to 98, Halliburton was off 1 3/8 to 31 and 
Enron dropped 1 3/8 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brokerage stocks lost ground on fears about the bull market's longevity. 
Merrill Lynch fell 7/8 to 39 1/8, Schwab sank 1 to 29 3/8 and Dean Witter 
slumped 1 3/8 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the up side, beaten-down utility stocks got a sudden boost from the drop 
in interest rates and from lower oil prices. Commonwealth Edison surged 1 1/4 
to 26 1/2, Houston Industries gained 3/4 to 36 7/8 and Peoples Energy added 1/2 
to 29 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some food issues also rallied. Campbell Soup gained 1 3/4 to 40, Quaker Oats 
added 1 to 63 and Kellogg was up 5/8 to 50 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City stocks slumped again on investor nervousness 
over who will be named by the ruling PRI party to replace slain presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The Bolsa index dropped 74.63 points to 
2,446.15. NYSE-traded Telmex shares fell 1 7/8 to 60 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei average closed up 105.31 points at 
19,941.79, while Frankfurt's DAX index jumped 31.36 points to 2,161.42. In 
London, the FTSE-100 index was up 0.5 point to 3,129.5.

<P>
 Blue-chip stocks slid for a third straight session Monday, with weakness in 
oil and technology stocks jarring a market already skittish over the recent 
jump in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 12.38 points at 3,762.35 after 
recovering from an early setback of more than 46 points to a low for the year 
of 3,728.96. The index started trading this year at 3,754.09. 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield fell to 6.97% from 
Friday's 7.01%. Friday was the first time in 10 months that the long-bond yield 
had closed above 7%. The long-bond's price, which moves in the opposite 
direction, rose 15/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The closely watched Dow average has fallen more than 106 points since 
Thursday, as investors worried that a rise in interest rates would cripple the 
economy. Political worries about the Whitewater affair and tension on the 
Korean Peninsula also unnerved investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 12 to 5 
on New York Stock Exchange volume totaling 287.36 million shares, down from 
Friday's 249.68 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 There was much weakness among the smaller capitalization issues. The Nasdaq 
composite index fell 10.95 points to end at 772.50, pressured by weakness in 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poors index of 500 stocks 
fell 0.58 to 460.00, while the NYSE's composite index fell 0.79 to 255.50. At 
the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 6.22 to 462.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the intra-day recovery in the stock market followed the decline 
in long-term interest rates from Friday's 10-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices managed their modest gains Monday despite a sharp decline in 
commodity prices, which did little to reassure market participants nervous over 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The advance in the fixed-income market was cooled by heightened bearishness 
ahead of key employment figures due out on the Good Friday holiday, when most 
U.S. bond markets are closed, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil stocks tumbled after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was 
unable to agree on production cuts to boost oil prices. May crude oil plunged 
$1.05 to $14.08 a barrel on the New York Mer, nearing its five-year low of less 
than $14, reached late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices fell domestically after finishing mixed overseas. On the New York 
Comex, gold for current delivery closed at $388 an ounce, off $3 from Friday. 
Silver fell 10.2 cents to $5.679 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar rose against most European currencies but 
fell to its lowest level in more than four months against the lira, which 
gained after a conservative party emerged as the likely victor in Italian 
national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors similarly ignored higher share prices abroad. Japan's 225-share 
Nikkei average closed ahead 105.31 points at 19,941.79 points, while in 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended at 2,161.42, up 31.36 points. 
London's Financial Times 100-share average finished up a fraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stock prices tumbled on investor nervousness over who will be named by 
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party to replace slain presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The Bolsa index ended 74.63 points lower at 
2,446.15. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * ARCO fell 3 to 98, Chevron lost 1 1/4 to 88 1/4, and Texaco tumbled 1 1/8 to 
64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer Associates lost 3 1/8 to 32 7/8 on fears that an upcoming mainframe 
launch by IBM could pressure its mainframe software prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software stocks were weak, including Microsoft, down 1 1/8 to 86 3/8, and 
Lotus Development, off 3 to 73 1/4. Among other high-tech stocks, Intel dropped 
1 1/8 to 68 5/8, Oracle shed 1 1/8 to 32 1/8, Integrated Development fell 3 1/8 
to 27 1/4 and Micron Technology lost 2 7/8 to 82 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grumman jumped 1 5/8 to 64 7/8 after saying it wants a competitive bidding 
process for the company, which led to speculation of higher bids from suitors 
Northrop and Martin Marietta. Northrop dropped 1 3/8 to 42 3/4, and Martin 
Marietta rose 3/4 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many stocks sensitive to the economic cycles also fell sharply on the NYSE, 
with Caterpillar losing 2 5/8 to 114. Those issues, along with technology 
stocks, have seen a steady advance in recent months.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; FINDING GIST OF GENIUS PROVES AN ELUSIVE GOAL; THE 
LAST IMPRESARIO: THE LIFE, TIMES AND LEGACY OF SOL HUROK BY HARLOW ROBINSON ; 
VIKING $24.95, 538 PAGES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A master of self-invention, Sol Hurok remains an enigmatic figure even after 
Harlow Robinson's exhaustive account of his subject's astonishing career, "The 
Last Impresario: The Life, Times and Legacy of Sol Hurok." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the author is reasonably certain that Hurok was born in the small 
Ukrainian town of Pogar in 1888, emigrated to America in 1906 and had, within a 
mere five years, achieved a modest success supplying performers for various 
public events, reasonably certain are the operative words. 
</P>
<P>
 The only absolutes in this diligent biography are the accounts of the great 
performers he introduced to America under the magical heading of "Sol Hurok 
Presents." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everything else about the man is open to discussion, even the 
location of his birthplace, "a town of no importance" on the Sudost River in 
Ukraine. "Or was it Ukraine?" Robinson asks, doubtful even after he made a 
pilgrimage there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hurok delighted in blurring the facts of his early years, revising 
everything from his precise birth date to the number of his brothers and 
sisters (18 in all, 9 of whom survived), we do know that the original family 
name was Gurkov, changed, like so many others, by immigration officers who 
found Hurok more manageable.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the cursory formalities were completed -- at Castle Garden, as Hurok 
said, or Ellis Island, which seems more likely, because Castle Garden was the 
site of the New York Aquarium by 1896 -- the young man from Pogar (either 14 or 
18) was already transformed into Sol Hurok, which is really all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1908, he married Tamara Shapiro, the mother of his only child, Ruth Hurok 
Lief, who contributed to this project but admitted that she has never been sure 
if her parents were married in Russia or America.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Hurok divorced Tamara and married Emma Perper, a glamorous Russian 
cabaret performer who was both a widow and a divorcee. But even the details of 
Hurok's second marriage "remain murky, like so many details of his private 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One must admire Robinson's perseverance in the face of such confusion. A less 
determined biographer might have abandoned Hurok and chosen a subject with a 
more demonstrable history.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the author soldiers on, qualifying all disputable statements about 
Hurok with conditionals, tiptoeing around personal information as if Hurok's 
life were booby-trapped, which in a sense, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 When 20th Century Fox made the movie of his life, "Tonight We Sing," Hurok 
insisted that the script established immediately "that it is the story of a 
successful man." A chronicle of professional triumphs, the film was 
entertaining but hardly informative. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of Robinson's research and interviews with scores of celebrities 
who knew Hurok and were his clients, this book, like the film, inevitably 
becomes a list of the great impresario's presentations.  
</P>
<P>
 That list, however, is unparalleled, including Anna Pavlova, the first dancer 
to arouse America's interest in ballet, and the Russian operatic sensation 
Chaliapin, both captured by Hurok early in his career.  
</P>
<P>
 Later he would introduce Isaac Stern, Arthur Rubenstein, Marian Anderson, Jan 
Peerce, Shostakovich, Rostropovich and scores of other justly celebrated 
musicians and dancers.  
</P>
<P>
 His early success with Pavlova encouraged Hurok to import Margot Fonteyn and 
Rudolf Nureyev. That triumph with classical ballet encouraged him to present 
the innovative dancers Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham and Agnes de Mille. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enamored of the art form of dance, Hurok was solely responsible for the U.S. 
appearances of the Ballet Russe, the Bolshoi, the Kirov and, eventually, for 
bringing the entire Moiseyev ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Emboldened by the reception these performers received, he also attempted to 
interest U.S. audiences in national theater groups and opera companies, 
although the response was less ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1925, Hurok declared bankruptcy after losing substantial sums on 
Chaliapin's opera company and Moscow's Hambima theater. But as Hurok's friend 
Jan Peerce commented, the Huroks of this world wind up "on their bottoms higher 
than most people ever rose." 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy may have caused Hurok to miss a few beats, but he soon 
rebounded, providing high culture to a country in the depths of the Depression. 
Throughout the next three decades until his death in 1974 -- the single 
indisputable date in this remarkable life -- Hurok continued to amaze and 
delight the American public. 
</P>
<P>
 If "The Last Impresario" is the literary version of a formula biopic, that can 
hardly be helped. Aside from Hurok's persistent Russian accent, love of luxury 
and genius for self-promotion, his story becomes a record of "and then he 
presented . . . " -- with little genuine insight into the elusive character of 
the man who made it all happen.

 Palestinian and Israeli negotiators return to the table today in Cairo, hoping

Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.

<P>
 Negotiators failed to agree last week after marathon talks on the Palestine 
Liberation Organization's demand for Palestinian police patrols, international 
observers and curbs on arms for Jewish settlers in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But if closure can be reached today, both sides say they can move quickly 
toward implementing the declaration of principles for Palestinian autonomy 
reached last fall.

NEXT STEP; MEXICO'S PRI AT CRISIS POINT: WILL IT CHOOSE DEMOCRACY?; COLOSIO'S 
KILLING AND THE CHIAPAS REVOLT HAVE SHAKEN THE POLITICAL JUGGERNAUT AS NEVER 
BEFORE.

<P>
 The last time a virtual president was assassinated in Mexico, the course of 
the country's political history was changed forever.  
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1928. A religious fanatic, gaining access by impersonating a 
cartoonist, shot and killed President-elect Alvaro Obregon. To guarantee the 
ruling elite's hold on power in the wake of Obregon's murder, strongman 
Plutarco Elias Calles the next year decreed into existence the vast, 
all-consuming political party that has governed Mexico ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who as presidential 
candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was the heir 
apparent to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has once again plunged Mexico 
into the kind of pivotal crisis that could spell long-sought political progress 
-- or political disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's death in Tijuana at the hands of a young gunman is the most shocking 
in a series of recent events that have driven wedges into the solidarity of the 
PRI, as the ruling party is known. They have exposed a vicious internal debate 
and underscored the failure of the party to adopt truly democratic reforms. 
Still reeling from a bloody peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, 
the PRI, and the party-state system through which it has controlled Mexico for 
65 years, are under threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within the party, the voice of dissent has swelled as never before as 
young, disaffected members are breaking ranks and challenging the hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior party leaders, struggling to contain the crisis, are emphasizing the 
party's position as the one Mexican institution that has traditionally 
guaranteed stability and order. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the PRI, there is loyalty," Party Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana said last 
week. "There is loyalty to the ideals of democracy and liberty that the party 
proposes. There is loyalty to the president of the republic, Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, as the keeper of national trust and guarantor of rule of law and 
justice."  
</P>
<P>
 After years of lip service to the need for democracy, the trauma of the murder 
of Colosio may be the catalyst that forces the PRI to change, analysts say. But 
some observers say it is just as likely that the party, besieged and fearful of 
facing a disgruntled electorate on a level playing field, may instead close 
ranks and retrench. The drama will be played out in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a profound crisis that does not seem to have any alternative for the 
governing group other than an authoritarian hardening, or an acceptance that 
Mexico must move toward democracy," said political scientist Luis Javier 
Garrido, a prominent critic of the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party in 1929, and its name was 
changed to the current Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1946. From the 
outset, the party was designed to incorporate -- in some cases, co-opt -- 
hundreds of tiny parties and movements that emerged from Mexico's 1910 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving the banners of social justice and anti-imperialism, the PRI became an 
organization based on tightly controlled sectors -- labor, peasant farmers, 
bureaucrats and, until the 1940s, the army -- where members are kept in line 
through a paternalistic system of patronage, where corruption flourishes and 
where decisions are made at the top with little input from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to a sophisticated system of what observers call brazen vote 
fraud, the PRI has won every national election and most regional elections 
since 1929. The Congress, the judiciary system and most of the press are 
controlled or at least heavily influenced by the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the single most anti-democratic tendency of the party is the 
presidential succession. Each president, as he nears the end of his six-year 
term, names an heir apparent. And each time, that man is elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Colosio, then, was not just the elimination of a candidate but 
the murder of the man everyone expected to be the next president. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Mexico for many years readily accepted the system, sacrificing 
participatory democracy for a semblance of stability and peace. But that part 
of the equation -- stability and peace -- seemed to dissolve this year when 
rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army seized a string of towns in 
Chiapas, demanding justice and social equity for some of Mexico's most 
impoverished people. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the myths of a "modern Mexico" -- the myths that Salinas used to 
catapult Mexico into partnership with the United States and Canada in the 
world's largest trading bloc -- were dashed. The credibility of Salinas, and 
the PRI, were called into question, deepening an already festering crisis 
caused by opposition in many circles to Salinas' free-market economic policies 
and the persistent cry for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, say analysts, simple reform may not be enough. A New Chorus for Change  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, economist Luis Rubio said, must "build a new political system based on 
radically different assumptions. The current political system is based on the 
objective of stability and governability on the basis of control. We need 
stability and governability on the basis of participation." 
</P>
<P>
 People who hold political office must be made accountable, he said. The 
political process must be completely redefined, eliminating the privileges that 
the political class traditionally has enjoyed, and new parties, based on 
ideologies rather than on factions, should be created and patterned after 
parties in most Western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Rubio and other analysts said, defusing the crisis this time 
will require concrete steps toward democratization, not the largely empty 
political promises that Salinas has made while keeping his focus on economic 
reform since his 1988 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Salinas has already had two dramatic warnings to remind him that 
democracy is the best way to attenuate the costs of destabilization. There may 
not be a third chance," said Carlos Ramirez, an editor of the independent El 
Financiero newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of Colosio represents a political challenge of enormous magnitude. 
It is not about rebuilding the popularity of a government that sees its happy 
world crumbling into pieces. This is about advancing in the construction of a 
political system that restores the faith of the Mexican people." 
</P>
<P>
 The calls for reform within the PRI and, by extension, throughout Mexican 
political society, are not new. There have always been fledgling reform 
movements that are allowed to go just so far, before they are bought off, 
co-opted or crushed. They struggle against the "dinosaurs" of the party, the 
traditional sectors such as the decision-making National Political Committee, 
which fight any erosion of their considerable power. 
</P>
<P>
 The central agenda of the dissidents has not changed much: separation of party 
from state; clean elections; internal consultation on candidates for public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The first dissident movement within the PRI was formed in August, 1986, by 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of a revered former president, Lazaro Cardenas, 
who is remembered for nationalization of the oil industry and massive 
agricultural reform that gave land to landless peasants. The younger Cardenas 
advocated change from within, but, utterly frustrated, resigned from the party 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Cardenas challenged Salinas, the PRI's candidate, in 
presidential elections that many Mexicans believe Salinas won only through 
widespread fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas has since formed his own party, the leftist Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, and will again compete against the PRI candidate in the August 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cardenas left the PRI, the banner of internal dissent was taken up by 
Rodolfo Gonzalez Guevara, who in late 1987 formed the Critical Current faction 
within the PRI. Three years later, he too left, giving up on the notion of 
democracy inside the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 As PRI chairman in 1990, Colosio proposed a radical reorganization of the 
party, eliminating the power-based factions and encouraging individual party 
memberships that could incorporate new groups that do not fit into the existing 
PRI structure.  
</P>
<P>
 He framed the reform as a matter of survival: In the four decades since the 
last significant party restructuring, most Mexicans have moved from the farm to 
the cities, the unionized share of the work force has dropped, and Salinas' 
free-market policies are creating a new class of entrepreneurs. The PRI, 
heavily weighted toward official unions and peasant farmers, no longer 
reflected Mexican society. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor and peasant leaders, whose power is based on steep pyramids of the 
traditional hierarchy, blocked the changes. Even the top-down attempt to change 
achieved only a nominal strengthening of the state-level party organizations, 
which are controlled by local bosses tied to longtime PRI leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 The push for reform was then assumed by a group of mostly young PRI militants. 
Taking advantage of the taint on the Salinas presidency because of his 
questioned electoral victory, the new movement, called Democracia 2000, became 
vocal advocates of greater participation. They vowed not to desert but to fight 
from within. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people who want to get into politics in Mexico and change this country 
have two options: the PRI, and the PRI," said Josue Romero, a member of the 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts culminated last October and November, just before Salinas named 
Colosio as the PRI candidate, when they staged rallies in the public plazas of 
about 500 cities and towns across the country, agitating for honest elections 
and popular participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, said Ramiro de la Rosa, political action secretary of Democracia 2000, 
the harassment and death threats began. Fidel Velazquez, the 93-year-old labor 
leader and one of the most rigid party hard-liners, demanded their expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Rosa, 25, was not deterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why haven't they expelled us?" he asked over coffee at a Sanborn's across the 
street from the mammoth PRI headquarters. "Because it would expose them. It 
would show that they don't want to change. They know that if they expel us, we 
would laugh. We would name names. Are the corrupt ones going to expel us?" The 
Troubles Within PRI 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the rapid unraveling of the PRI is the evaporation of its vaunted 
party discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the lapses reflect the effort to incorporate into the PRI new groups 
that seem to be natural constituencies because they have benefited from the 
Salinas Administration's free-market policies. However, those new prospects 
often do not share the longtime members' standards of loyalty and appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, PRI stalwarts hosted a dinner for prominent 
businessmen who had purchased formerly government-owned companies or had other 
financial dealings with the government. They were asked to contribute millions 
of dollars each to a fund that would become an endowment for campaign 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of coughing up the cash, several infuriated dinner guests leaked 
the story to the press, setting off a scandal that forced the party chairman to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend away from discipline is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 Militants are breaking rank in unprecedented numbers and with unprecedented 
fervor, first with the Zapatista rebellion and now with the Colosio murder. 
They openly criticize. They challenge. Some even go so far as to publicly blame 
the Salinas government for the assassination, suggesting Colosio's purported 
insistence on honest elections may have cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of pluralism and democracy, and the lack of respect for what a party 
is, have produced this whole situation of violence, which will not end here," 
de la Rosa said energetically, ignoring his companions' admonitions to tone 
down his comments.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the beginning of a long night for this country, a night that can be 
stopped if Salinas can be made to understand that it is no longer a matter of 
simply fulfilling his will in Mexico, but allowing the will of the people of 
Mexico to be fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The tumult within the party was evident again over the weekend. Flying in the 
face of the traditional selection process, party rank-and-file and mid-level 
leaders began to talk publicly about who they wanted to see as the next 
presidential candidate. Democracia 2000 began demanding that a convention be 
held to name the candidate.  
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, the party hierarchy issued a statement "disauthorizing" any 
statements by anybody connected with the PRI. Democracia 2000 responded, 
issuing its own "disauthorization" of the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rift within the party was aired before Colosio's death. Manuel Camacho 
Solis, a former Mexico City mayor passed over by Salinas as the PRI candidate, 
was named by the president as a special mediator to handle the Zapatista 
uprising. Camacho Solis' success in that position fueled speculation that he 
would try an independent bid for the presidency, conjecture that increased when 
Camacho Solis refused to toe the party line and publicly support Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Camacho Solis relented, saying he would not run for president. His 
announcement came one day before Colosio's killing, and many party stalwarts 
are very resentful of his reticence. He was booed when he appeared at Colosio's 
wake -- regrettable, say supporters, because Camacho Solis, like Colosio, 
backed democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform-minded Priistas admit that they have not gotten very far. Under 
Salinas, there has been just a smattering of democratizing measures. The party 
statutes were changed in 1988, when Colosio headed the PRI, to allow some 
popular consultation on the selection of local candidates. And just last week, 
Congress passed a package of electoral reforms that raises fines for fraud and 
reduces PRI influence on the committee that oversees elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in both these cases and others, dissidents see the changes as largely 
cosmetic. The divisions and emotions within the party now appear to run so 
deep, analysts say, simple cosmetics may no longer do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 "In six years of work . . . we have failed in making the PRI change, that is 
true," said de la Rosa. "Where we have not failed is in helping make civil 
society stronger and better informed. People don't swallow the lies so easily 
any more."

THE WEEK AHEAD: BRASILIA; THE MILITARY SHADOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil on Thursday marks the 30th anniversary of the military coup that 
ushered in 21 years of authoritarian rule by a succession of five army 
generals. 
</P>
<P>
 As the date approaches, Brazilian media have been reviewing the controversial 
coup and 1964-1985 military regime with a flurry of analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 The recollections have coincided with a confrontation between civilian 
President Itamar Franco and Brazil's lower house of congress and supreme court. 
The disagreement is over the date when congressional and judicial salaries 
should be readjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Military ministers have weighed into the dispute and some retired officers 
have suggested that Franco shut down the congress. While analysts do not expect 
military intervention, the episode is a reminder that men in uniform still cast 
a long shadow over Brazil.

ETHNIC DISCORD; UPSURGE IN MILITANT ATTACKS WORRIES FOREIGNERS IN EGYPT; 
CLAIMING ISLAM AS A MOTIVE, RADICALS TARGET TOURISTS AND BANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is the kind of Saturday afternoon spring dreams are made of -- lilacs 
sprouting along the roadside, the whiff of hot dogs from a makeshift stand. The 
Little League kids from Kodak are ahead by two runs; the thin and gloomy young 
pitcher from Sperry Sun International gets pulled. Parents heave a sigh of 
boredom in the stands as, at the edge of the playing field, a mosque begins 
droning the afternoon call to Muslim prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 This Little League game is being played in Egypt, where a new surge of Islamic 
militancy has made innocuous activities such as ballgames and cruises along the 
Nile sometimes seem an unnecessary risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's adult softball practice in the southern Cairo suburb of Maadi was 
canceled when the U.S. Embassy warned Americans to stay indoors after weekly 
high prayers. The British school has indefinitely put off field trips to Upper 
Egypt and the Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo. The president of the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Egypt checks underneath his car for bombs before he gets 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairo's Yugoslav Serb community -- part of a group that is uneasy everywhere 
in the Middle East since Serbs began fighting Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
is especially edgy. A Serb was murdered in his Cairo apartment last year, and 
another recently left his embassy to find a note in his car. "We know who you 
are," it said. "Go away." 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of anti-Israeli demonstrations in Cairo after the massacre of about 30 
Palestinians in a West Bank mosque has jangled the nerves of the roughly 
100,000 foreigners of all nationalities living in Egypt, especially coming on 
the heels of a new warning from Islamic militants that foreign tourists and 
investors must either leave Egypt and withdraw their support for the government 
of President Hosni Mubarak, or die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone's holding their breath," said Gina Rae Speer, a Texan who 
has lived in Egypt since the early 1980s. "It's gotten so that now I don't even 
want to go out on the streets. . . . If things don't improve in the next year, 
I will think about leaving -- after living here for 11 years, and liking it 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
 A young Slovenian mother at the Little League game expressed the growing sense 
of uncertainty among foreigners when she stared absently at the youngsters 
warming up on the field. "Where is safe? What is safe?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign residents are not the only ones concerned. Tourism has plummeted, 
costing the country more than $1 billion in lost revenue, and the United 
Nations has expressed concern about sponsoring a conference on world population 
in Cairo in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian officials say that nearly two years after an upsurge in Islamic 
violence began in the dusty farming villages of southern Egypt, the arrest of 
thousands of suspected extremists and the execution of more than two dozen 
militants -- all seeking to overthrow Mubarak's government and install an 
Islamic state -- have brought the problem under control. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last few weeks have brought an unnerving increase in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the militant stronghold of Asyut in southern Egypt, several police officers 
are killed every week -- sometimes one a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Small bombs have gone off at a number of Cairo banks, apparently to discourage 
foreign investment and to protest the payment of bank interest in contravention 
of Islamic law, which regards interest as usurious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist ships and buses cruising past the lush date groves and barley fields 
that line the banks of the Nile in southern and central Egypt have been shot at 
on several occasions by militants, who then run back into the fields and 
winding village streets to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Four passenger trains running from Cairo to tourist destinations in the south 
have been attacked in the past two weeks, with six foreigners and 17 Egyptians 
wounded in hails of gunfire and in the explosion of a small bomb planted on one 
of the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The underground Gamaa al Islamiya, or Islamic Group, said it launched the 
attacks to protest the recent death sentences issued against conspirators in a 
plot to assassinate Mubarak, and also as part of its continuing campaign 
against foreign tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tourists should leave the country so as not to lose their lives amid the 
raging confrontation between the Gamaa and the oppressive regime in Egypt," the 
group said in a statement faxed to news agencies, elaborating on a previous 
statement in which it warned all embassies, consulates and business people to 
advise tourists and investors to leave Egypt. "The next attacks will be 
extremely ferocious and strong," it cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now impossible to enter a luxury hotel in Cairo without walking through 
a metal detector, particularly since a young musician dismissed by the 
government as mentally unstable and not linked to the Islamic movement walked 
into the elegant Semiramis Hotel in October and shot several diners in a 
restaurant. He was reportedly angered about the plight of Muslims in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign companies have taken down outside signs and implemented strict 
security procedures at job sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere in traditionally friendly Egypt, one of the world's foremost 
tourist destinations and America's premier Arab ally in the Middle East, is 
increasingly being compared to that in Algeria, where Islamic violence has left 
more than two dozen foreigners dead since mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Egyptians are not known to have the brutal nature attributed to many 
Algerians, but as the last two years have shown, there are radical elements in 
Egypt willing to shoot foreigners for the sake of their cause," wrote a 
columnist in the English-language Middle East Times. "Egypt is a much more 
cosmopolitan place than Algeria, and this should be a protection for foreigners 
living here. But precautions should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy sponsored a town hall meeting last month to answer questions 
from the American community and advised avoiding certain areas, remaining 
inconspicuous and "paying particular attention to any indication of 
surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert O'Brien, the embassy's senior security officer, was quoted as saying in 
the off-the-record session that the Gamaa's recent warnings have been "much 
more explicit" than previous threats. "They have no credibility unless they 
fulfill this threat. That is my concern," O'Brien said, adding, "This is a safe 
place to live, but it could be changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, people are being more careful. "Before, my kids would go out, and 
they might tell me where they are going and they might not. Now, I make sure I 
know where they are," said one American businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Though increasingly watchful, few foreigners are panicking. New foreign 
investment may be discouraged, seriously threatening Egypt's economic 
restructuring program, but banks and businesses already here say they have no 
plans to change their operations as a result of the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreigners say they believe they have nothing to fear from the majority 
of Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media writing stories about all this does a real disservice to Egypt, 
because it brings the country to its knees. It's not any different from what 
goes on in the U.S.," said one American businessman, a resident of Egypt for 
the past four years. "I feel safer here than I would in Harlem or Miami Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Americans said they have been approached apologetically by their 
Egyptian neighbors, who deplore extremists'activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there's an act perpetrated here, the Egyptians will run after the guy 
who did it, whereas in Algeria they'll just stand there and watch," said James 
Pringle, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "As president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, I am not prepared 
whatsoever to tell an investor that the security situation in Egypt is unsafe, 
go elsewhere. Absolutely not. If you look at the sheer number of foreigners who 
have been killed in Egypt, it doesn't amount to one bad day in Washington or 
New York or Miami," Pringle said.

 It was hard to imagine feeling threatened by Spase Shuplinovsky, the slightly 
scruffy, middle-age co-president of the Assn. for the Protection and Spreading 
of Truth about Alexander the Great. 
</P>
<P>
 An eccentric, undoubtedly. But almost unbelievably, conflicting theories about 
a history going back two millennia have brewed up a volatile cocktail of 
threats for this small, landlocked country now known to the world as the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.  
</P>
<P>
 Shuplinovky's coffee grew cold at a Skopje cafe as he argued endlessly from a 
heavily annotated, dog-eared Croatian translation of ancient Greek chronicles. 
His thesis was that Alexander the Great was Macedonian, not a Greek. Whether he 
was spreading truth or delusion, he certainly hit the mark by summing up, 
"Balkan history cannot be digested." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring tables took no notice of his talk. Few of Macedonia's 2 million 
people may have heard of Shuplinovsky or his 135-member association. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the majority ethnic community would agree with him that they are 
now ethnic Macedonians: Orthodox Christians, Slavs, but not Bulgarians or 
Serbs. Just Macedonians. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is totally indigestible for neighboring Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks believe that the name renews Slavic claims on historic Macedonia, a 
large part of which is now the northern Greek province of Macedonia and 
populated mostly by ethnic Greeks. Athens has therefore applied maximum 
diplomatic pressure. On Feb. 16, Greece defied its NATO and European allies to 
impose a near-total economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting crisis is crippling the fragile Macedonian economy and may stoke 
unrest in the local ethnic Albanian Muslim minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats fear that any destabilization of Macedonia could suck greedy 
regional states into a new Balkan war just as hopes are rising for an end to 
the Bosnian conflict to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The Macedonian question, according to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, is 
still "an abscess in the heart of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Macedonian government has reacted with the cool that has been its 
trademark since 1991, when it chose independence instead of life in the 
Serb-dominated rump state of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia was once the poorest republic in Yugoslavia, but its careful 
management and civilized approach matches that of much richer Slovenia. And 
unlike Slovenia, the Skopje government also contrived to avoid all armed 
conflict with Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate and measured leadership by President Kiro Gligorov, a 77-year-old 
former Yugoslav bureaucrat, has helped keep Macedonia miraculously clear of all 
recent Balkan violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The factors that could lead to a spreading conflict are very complex. So far 
there is nothing," Defense Minister Vlado Popovski said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Popovski, a former law professor, knows that Macedonia has been at the 
crossroads of more wars than most people can count in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiff-backed Yugoslav generals used to monitor an extraordinary three-way 
microcosm of the Cold War hemming in Macedonia: the Warsaw Pact's Bulgaria, 
NATO member Greece and Maoist Albania. Ideologies may have softened, but they 
and Serbia still make an awkward group of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "To escape from the claws of the hawks we may have to run. . . . We must hope 
that the strength of any potential attack would be balanced by other pretenders 
(to our territory)," Popovski said. 
</P>
<P>
 His country has no other option, with what he said was an army of just 15,000 
men, an armored brigade with no tanks and 40 air force pilots with no 
warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonia can count on some friends to stop it from becoming the next Balkan 
domino to fall. Acting with rare foresight, the United States and Western 
countries decided early in the Yugoslav crisis to protect Macedonia by 
pre-positioning U.N. peacekeepers on its border with Serbia.  
</P>
<P>
 An initial U.S. contingent of 300 arrived last July to join a mainly Nordic 
battalion of 1,000 troops. Their number may soon rise to 500. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Macedonians feel still stronger now that 60 countries have recognized their 
independence. Seven European Union states took the step in December, and the 
United States followed in February, although it stopped short of establishing 
full diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition government has so far papered over divisions between Macedonian 
Slavs and ethnic Albanians. And while Athens sponsored demonstrations against 
Macedonia's use of national symbols claimed exclusively by Greece, Skopje 
remained quiet.  
</P>
<P>
 "People here would rather have a beer than a fight," one local journalist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiethnic atmosphere that inspired the term Salade Macedoine can still 
be found in the capital's Greek-style bars, Central European cake shops and 
Italian espresso cafes. The domes and minarets of a dozen Ottoman Turkish 
mosques rise over the low tiled roofs of the old town. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish Ambassador Suha Noyan said the small remaining Turkish minority is the 
best-treated in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've not seen any violent signs of nationalism. It is possible to talk of 
harmony," he said. "They don't live intermingled, but they live together. 
Unless there is outside pressure, nothing will happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside enemies can press on two weak points -- the Albanians and the economy, 
which had 229% inflation last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek embargo could be devastating to Macedonia's hopes of fulfilling 
conditions attached to International Monetary Fund loans it just signed. The 
economy was already hard-pressed by the international sanctions against its 
former main trading partner, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece will also suffer losses from the blockade it has imposed. About 500,000 
Macedonians used to holiday on Aegean Sea beaches in northern Greece. Port 
transit fees came to $120 million a year, Macedonian officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlocked Macedonia is still in a tough corner. Between 50% and 70% of 
Macedonia's trade went through northern Greece, including almost all of its oil 
supplies. Within a week, thousands of workers were out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't suppose this would happen," Economics Minister Petrus Stephanov 
said. "It will be very hard. . . . Standards of living will decline." 
</P>
<P>
 That could worsen relations between Macedonia's ethnic Slavs and Albanians. 
The latter are the descendants of the ancient Illyrians, who textbooks say have 
threatened Macedonia since the time of Philip of Macedon, father of Alexander 
the Great. Villages near the border are suffering from bandit-style looting 
raids from poverty-stricken Albania. But a worse problem is a cultural divide 
inside Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albanians are the biggest real problem of Macedonia," said Zoran Popovski, 
the ethnic Macedonian manager of a luxury clothes shop in downtown Skopje. 
"They smuggle, they are unemployed, they want work, schools, autonomous areas, 
a state within a state. They have large families. There is illegal immigration 
from Albania." 
</P>
<P>
 Servet Avziu, a senior Albanian minister in Macedonia's coalition government, 
spoke carefully as he tried to explain away a growing split between impatient 
radicals in Albanian-dominated western Macedonia and his moderate approach.  
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment we live better (than Albanians elsewhere in the Balkans) 
because we managed to maintain the peace in Macedonia. The people in power know 
what peace means and the price of peace," Avziu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most worrying of all, he said, is a possible spillover of unrest in the ethnic 
Albanian province of Kosovo in neighboring Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "War in Kosovo means a Balkan war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until some crisis happens, Macedonia's balancing act will doubtless continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Greek and Macedonian flags and coinage will go on with a war of symbols from 
the ancients. A curious standoff will continue on the Greek-Macedonian border, 
where signs on both sides tell visitors, "Welcome to Macedonia."

MARKET SCENE; CUBANS TASTING CAPITALISM -- BUT IT'S JUST AN APPETIZER; SELLING 
FOOD IS NOW LEGAL, WITH LIMITS. A LIVELY BLACK MARKET PROVIDES EVERYTHING FROM 
CARS TO CIGARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If an old man of the sea catches a big fish, who gets to keep it? Ernest 
Hemingway had his old man give it up to the predators of the deep, but in 
today's Cuba it belongs to Fidel Castro, at least by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Castro regime's regulations, any fish caught in Cuban waters 
by Cubans belongs to the government. It cannot be processed or sold privately, 
even though recent reforms permit private enterprise in a few fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations are a matter of great distress to Chincho Calacon, by Cuban 
standards an old man at 63 but also a man of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Calacon is one of a handful of defiant Cubans challenging Castro's rigid 
economic system, under which nearly everybody works for the state in one way or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 His way is, with some friends, to fish illegally for marlin and other large 
fish from old tractor-tire inner tubes, using only a plastic line and their 
hands. No poles, no gaffs, no nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get a proper license either to operate a boat or to fish, Calacon 
and three or four associates have joined the black market, which for dollars -- 
lots of them -- will provide almost anything that the Castro regime either 
can't or won't, at least not at a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
 The black market purveys satellite TV, automobiles, tomatoes, pills to 
increase sexual potency, teen-age girls (or boys), cigars, single-malt Scotch 
whisky and anything else that comes to mind, including a good meal. 
</P>
<P>
 His urge or need to acquire dollars sends Calacon out of Havana Harbor in the 
black sky before dawn several days a week, towing the oversized inner tubes 
behind a tiny rowboat powered by a small, sputtering motor. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour of so of stomach-churning roller-coasting through the whitecaps 
of the harbor and into the open sea, Calacon has his associates clamber into 
the inner tubes and toss out their lines, holding the spools in their leathery 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent trip, a young man -- Hector, he called himself -- got a hit on 
his line after bobbing about for just under two hours. Very carefully he pulled 
in the fish, hand over hand on the plastic line. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a small marlin, and it was not clubbed or gaffed for fear of attracting 
sharks that were sensed but not seen in the water. Instead, when the exhausted 
prey was tugged close, the other men paddled over and helped haul the fish onto 
Hector's inner tube. He held it against his chest while it suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
 After another hour, the little armada gathered itself and returned to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Calacon cut up the fish and began selling the pieces on the Malecon, Havana's 
bay front. In short order, he sold about 15 pounds of marlin at $3 a pound. 
U.S. currency only, no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The old man, whose last legitimate job was in a bicycle assembly plant now 
closed for lack of parts, argues that he is not a maceta , as the black 
marketeers are called here. The word literally means flowerpot and is used 
contemptuously to describe people as members of the idle rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am doing what the government said we could do," the wire-thin, 
tensile-strong Calacon said on the way in from the fishing trip. "I am an et 
cetera, not a maceta ." 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd experiment in free enterprise, Castro last year approved as part of 
a limited reform program a list of self-employment activities that could charge 
in dollars and make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 140 such categories approved, including the sale of "light foods 
(drinks, sandwiches, candies, et cetera)." 
</P>
<P>
 Calacon's objections to the contrary, in government eyes the private catching 
and selling of fish is not "et cetera," and therefore illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Calacon has been permitted to operate with only minor "move it 
along" types of harassment, presumably because he is small time and no threat 
to Communist market theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lurking either within the "et cetera" clause or close in its shadow are 
other small activities, including private restaurants, places with one or two 
tables in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, these dining rooms, known as paladares , are the most prominent of 
the little businesses that have sprung up since last year's reforms. They are 
popular because they provide food found not even in the expensive restaurants 
limited to tourists. In addition, the paladares are cheap, at least for 
foreigners with dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain romanticism to the point of myth has built up about these 
restaurants as places where rare and wonderfully prepared food can be enjoyed 
with champagne and other European wines in an atmosphere of linen, soft 
lighting and strolling musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps such oases of culinary delight existed in Havana in the two or three 
months before Castro recently cracked down on the paladares . But recent visits 
to four private restaurants touted as the city's best found something more 
musty than mythic. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the lot, arranged through the help of a government functionary, 
was in an old mansion in Miramar, the neighborhood that once housed the 
pre-Castro elite and now serves diplomats, foreign business people and Castro's 
favored few. 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor was brought in through a side garden after an exchange of coded 
knocks on a gate. The dining table was on a veranda next to a kitchen. The 
stars above looked three-dimensional, the breeze wafted and the Chopin etudes 
on the CD player sounded enchanting. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor was in the second of three sittings that night, each given 90 
minutes to eat. Before the meal was served, the owner-chef asked for drink 
orders, apologizing for having only one single-malt Scotch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not accustomed to a big selection," he said, "but I've put in an order 
for three more brands. Is there one you would particularly like?" 
</P>
<P>
 The menu was limited to one selection arranged in advance by the go-between. 
This night it was cold asparagus with a hollandaise sauce as an appetizer, a 
salad of tomatoes and sliced onions, broiled snapper with steamed carrots and 
baby potatoes. Dessert was a choice of fresh fruit or cake. 
</P>
<P>
 A Spanish sparkling wine was offered along with three Spanish still wines. The 
meal was capped with a choice of five Cuban cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill for four people came to $76, U.S. currency, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand evening, except. The asparagus was canned and tinny tasting, the 
onions soggy, the snapper dry and overcooked, the fruit limited to orange 
slices and the $8 cigar stale. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other restaurants were worse, ranging in entrees from stringy 
chicken (no breasts, only thighs and wings), chewy -- thin steaks, faux Chinese 
noodles, boiled fish bits and soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days after the September announcement that some free enterprise 
would be permitted, the paladares spread quickly; some estimates reached 2,000 
in Havana alone despite the indifferent food, inexperienced cooks and waiters 
and, for Cubans, high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was such enthusiasm in the first few weeks that even American 
diplomats were eating in paladares , as were ranking Communist Party and 
government officials. One private restaurant was large enough to feed 100 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 That caught Castro's attention and brought a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 When restaurants are small, he told the National Assembly of Personal Power in 
December, "I really do not think that one or two tables (in someone's home) 
will affect socialism. However, a man with 25 tables and 100 chairs is 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently. That restaurant was shut down and its owner put in jail. Others 
were treated less harshly, but the effect was serious. The guesses now are that 
only a few hundred paladares are operating. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came down to it, they couldn't really let free enterprise develop, 
even in someone's dining room," said one diplomat.

THE PARTY AND THE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), under various names, has 
dominated Mexican politics since 1929. * PHILOSOPHY: In theory, the party's 
principles are those of the Mexican Revolution, including land reform, social 
welfarism, economic nationalism and an independent foreign policy. * 
ORGANIZATION: The party has three wings. The agrarian sector is mainly 
edjidatarios , or communal-farm peasants. The labor sector is dominated by 
urban workers in the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). The popular sector 
includes professionals, small farm owners, small businesses, and civil 
servants. HISTORY: 1928: Alvaro Obregon, Mexico's last military caudillo , is 
assassinated. President Plutarco Elias Calles begins to organize a political 
party. * 1929: The Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR), or National 
Revolutionary party, is created in Queretaro as a coalition of several parties 
that backed the Mexican Revolution. * 1938: Party is renamed Partido de la 
Revolution Mexicana (PRM), or Party of the Mexican Revolution, and organized 
into four sectors: agrarian, labor, popular and military. The military sector 
is eliminated in 1940. * 1946: Party is renamed the Partido Revolucionario 
Institucional (PRI), or Instituional Revolutionary Party. * 1983: After decades 
of victories, the party suffers losses to opposition Partido Accion Nacional 
(PAN), or National Action party, in elections in state capitals of Durango and 
Chihuahua. * 1985: The PRI sweeps state governorships and Federal Chamber of 
Deputies seats amid charges of fraud. PAN supporters and police clash 
violently. * 1988: Dissident faction in the PRI, the Corriente Democratica 
(CD), forms an electorial alliance with a new left-wing coalition. Its 
presidential candidate, CD leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, loses to PRI's Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, amid widespread fraud charges. But for the first time, the 
PRI loses seats in the Senate. * 1989: The PRI loses elections in 52 of the 113 
municipalities contested to the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), 
composed of the CD and left-wing parties and led by Cardenas. The PRD, claiming 
it won 62, occupies contested town halls. * 1990-91: The PRI makes many gains 
in state, local and congressional elections as the government's economic 
reforms prove popular. The PRD charges fraud, and newly elected PRI governors 
in Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi are eventually replaced with interim 
governors pending new elections. * 1992: The PRI wins most elections in 14 
states, but PAN wins the governorship of Chihuahua. The PRI governor of 
Michoacan, whose election was disputed, temporarily resigns. * January, 1993: 
PRD supporters clash with security forces while protesting alleged PRI fraud in 
municipal elections in Michoacan and Oaxaca states. * November, 1993: Salinas 
appoints Luis Donaldo Colosio as the PRI candidate for elections in August, 
1994. * March, 1994: Colosio is assassinated during a campaign rally in 
Tijuana. * ELECTION RECORD: The PRI's margin of victory has declined in recent 
presidential elections. * Votes for PRI in presidential elections 1934: 98.2% 
1940: 93.9 1946: 77.9 1952: 74.3 1958: 90.4 1964: 88.8 1970: 83.3 1976: 93.6 
1982: 71.0 1988: 50.7 * In 1958-82, includes votes for two other parties that 
regularly endorsed the PRI's candidate. In 1988, the parties backed opposition 
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. The PRI ran virtually unopposed because PAN 
opposition party failed to nominate a candidate. * SOURCES: Encyclopedia of

System in Transition" by Wayne A. Cornelius and Ann L. Craig; Europe World

THE PRI'S COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two major parties besides the PRI plus several smaller ones that are 
running presidential candidates in Mexico's August elections. NATIONAL ACTION 
PARTY (PAN) 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate: Diego Fernandez de Cevallos 
</P>
<P>
 The rightist PAN is Mexico's oldest opposition party.It was founded in 1939 by 
a coalition of Roman Catholic activists, large landowners and upper-class 
families, who rejected government anti-clericalism and feared that 
then-President Lazaro Cardenas was trying to create a socialist state. PAN 
espouses Catholic social doctrine with emphasis on the family, private 
enterprise and democratization. It has won three state governorships during the 
Salinas administration: Baja California, Guanajuato and Chihuahua. DEMOCRATIC 
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY (PRD) 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate: Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of popular former President Lazaro Cardenas, broke 
from the PRI in 1987 to lead a broad opposition coalition as candidate for the 
presidency in 1988. He was in the lead when the vote tallying computer system 
went down; later, Salinas was declared the winner. Afterward, Cardenas formed 
the leftist PRD, which appeals for the ideals of the 1910 Revolution -- social 
support, land reform and democracy -- that it believes the PRI has abandoned. 
The party tends to attract peasants and the urban poor, as well as some 
intellectuals. SMALLER PARTIES 
</P>
<P>
 Six other political parties have launched candidates for the presidency, but 
none has a realistic chance of winning. They are the Worker's Party, Mexican 
Green Ecology Party, Mexican Democratic Party, Authentic Mexican Revolutionary 
Party, National Revolutionary Cardenist Front Party and Popular Socialist 
Party.

MARKET FOCUS; PORTUGAL AT SEA OVER RULINGS THAT THREATEN FISHING INDUSTRY; 
'THERE'S HARDLY ANYWHERE LEFT FOR OUR BOATS TO FISH,' THEY PROTEST. HUNDREDS OF 
BOATS HAVE LEFT SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the wry smile of an old sea dog, Jose Ramalheira recalls the long-gone 
days of adventure when he sailed in Portugal's White Fleet of nearly 100 mainly 
wooden fishing boats in the dangerous but rich Atlantic waters off North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the white-haired sailor's heyday, captains who brought their vessels back 
loaded to the gunwales with cod were treated to the public adulation reserved 
today for soccer stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all that has changed. Portugal's oceangoing fishing fleet, deprived of its 
traditional fishing grounds by treaties and regulations, is in decline, some 
say terminally. Working with outdated equipment closer to home, coastal 
fishermen here fear the might of neighboring Spain's armada, the largest in the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 New EU regulations and cheaper, frozen fish sold by their Iberian cousins 
sometimes mean once-proud Portuguese fishermen are mothballing their boats or 
dumping their catches back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, with a 525-mile-long coastline, for centuries depended on seafaring 
to survive. Its pioneering navigators began charting the Atlantic before 
Christopher Columbus was born. The sea, its conquest and the harvesting of its 
fish have become cornerstones of Portugal's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've fished those North Atlantic waters for 400 years," said 67-year-old 
Ramalheira at his home in this small northern fishing town. "For centuries our 
boats would sail away; some would come back, others wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The captain, who retired in 1988, first took to the sea after World War II 
when 90% of Portugal's fishing fleet was still made up of wooden boats. By the 
mid-1950s, most of the wooden vessels had been replaced by iron ships. They 
sailed about 60 to 80 at a time with the Gil Eanes, a ship carrying supplies, 
surgeons and even a chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world of the captains in those days was like the world of soccer stars 
today, a world of rising and falling stars," Ramalheira said. "A successful 
individual would be admired, even envied, as if he had entered Olympus like a 
god." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how fishermen would vie with each other to set records: who could 
stay at sea longest, who could bring home the most bacalao -- dried, salted 
codfish. Over the centuries, bacalao became Portugal's national dish and lately 
the country's second most expensive import category after oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But then fishing disputes between the United States and South American nations 
and between Britain and Iceland prompted greater protection of national 
territorial waters. Canada and Iceland have virtually closed their seas to 
Portuguese ships to allow codfish stocks to replenish. And the Gil Eanes is 
rusting away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's hardly anywhere left for our boats to fish," said Helder Luzio of 
TBC, a bacalao processing firm near Ilhavo. At TBC's quayside, a woman was 
still spreading out salted cod in the sun to dry, but the vessels unloading are 
now more likely to be refrigerator ships than trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Portuguese ate 105,000 tons of bacalao last year, but caught only 16,000 tons 
of it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 100 or so trawlers Portugal had registered before joining the 
then-European Community in 1986, 16 are left. TBC buys most of its cod -- known 
as the Portuguese mother's "faithful friend" because it is inexpensive and can 
be used in a reputed 1,002 recipes -- from Norwegian fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a recent deal between the EU and Norway, Portuguese and Spanish 
fishermen, whose fishing activities off Norway are strictly limited, should be 
able to catch an extra 5,000 tons of cod a year there if the Scandinavian 
nation joins the EU in 1995 as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But fishermen predict that will not be enough to reverse the decline of 
Portugal's ailing fleet. "Our fleet has its days numbered," Ramalheira said. 
"Before (the year) 2000, we'll probably have no more trawlers left fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some sort of miracle that is going to save our long-range fleet," 
agreed Jorge Beirao Reis, president of the Industrial Fishermen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, Portugal's coastal fishermen face different problems, but the 
results are similar. The EU policy of streamlining its members' fishing fleets 
has brought about $408 million of Brussels-regulated investment to Portugal's 
fishing industry over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the cash has been used to slash fleet strength. More than 400 
Portuguese fishing boats have been decommissioned since 1986, including 166 in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are still about 34,000 registered fishermen in 125 communities along the 
coast, many of them working part time to supplement income from farming or 
other jobs. Eighty-six percent of the 14,000 registered boats are small (under 
29 feet long) and underpowered, according to a report by the Portuguese 
Ministry of the Sea. The prows of the brightly colored small boats still are 
painted with eyes to ward off danger at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But their main fear is competition from Spain. Last year, Portuguese boats 
threw their catches back into the sea in a series of protests against what they 
claimed were price-dumping practices by the Spanish fishing fleet, which is 
more modern and, with more than 20,000 vessels, the EU's largest.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the advent of the single European market last year, dozens of small, 
neighborhood deep-freeze stores have sprung up in Lisbon selling mainly Spanish 
frozen fish at lower prices than fresh fish at the riverside ribeira market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is not competition, but unfair competition," Sea Ministry 
spokesman Manuel Janes said. "There have been imports of substandard fish 
placed on the market at unrealistic prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Janes added that Portugal had succeeded, in negotiations with the EU, in 
preventing a full opening of its territorial waters to the Spanish fleet in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when the last fishing barriers were supposed to be dropped under the 
two countries' EU membership deals. Reeling In Less Portugal's annual fish

MONEY STILL IS THERE, BUT FEW NOW PASS 'GO'; PRO FOOTBALL: CAPONOMICS, THE 
SCIENCE OF WINNING WITHIN NEW SALARY LIMITS, TAKES TOLL ON THE VETERANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It first appeared late last month, in the form of numbers and dollar signs, 
coldly typed across bottom lines throughout the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and players looked at it, shivered, then turned quickly away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can it really be this bad?" they wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they realized, it could hardly be any worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is known as the salary cap. It has spread like a plague. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans fell victim to it first, players who had survived years of on-field 
wars only to realize they were no match for the power of this numbers crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Mann. Duane Bickett. The entire starting wide receiver corps of the 
Indianapolis Colts. All were released to make room under the $34.2 million 
allotted each team. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it went after stars, the untouchables, those with big contracts and 
plenty of leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 One day John Elway was the hottest quarterback in the game. The next, he was 
offering to take a pay cut so the Denver Broncos could sign others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Lott did the same thing, with one appreciable difference. The New York 
Jets took Lott at his word. The plague cost him $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it struck teams, championship teams with strong foundations, knocking 
them down with the flick of a number. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills will be forced to pursue a fifth consecutive Super Bowl 
appearance this year without their best offensive lineman and their best 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for the salary cap, both Howard Ballard and Nate Odomes would 
still be in Buffalo today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the plague even outdid its own unforgiving, indiscriminate 
self. 
</P>
<P>
 It wiped out an entire practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, classrooms have been empty and fields deserted at the San 
Francisco 49ers' training site because, forced to pay players' per-diem under 
the salary cap, the richest team in football has not had enough money to open 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the union remind players of the 51% increase in salaries last 
season, and promise that the cap won't be so crazy once everyone understands 
how it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just seeing general managers and agents trying to adjust," said Mike 
Duberstein, director of research. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these players might be cut anyway, it's just happening earlier now. 
And a lot are being told to hang around until their teams can make room." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as many had predicted last year, when the players' union agreed to a 
salary cap so they could get free agency, last spring's wealth has been 
replaced by this spring's worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of who is getting a new job and a raise has been replaced by talk about 
who has been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Langhorne of the Colts got fired. All he did last year was set a 
franchise record with 85 catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gibson got fired. He had been a starting linebacker for the Detroit 
Lions every season since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Scott Mersereau and defensive back Clifford Hicks, both solid 
veterans, were fired by the New York Jets on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offense? They happened to have salaries which, combined, came within a 
few dollars of the salary the Jets had promised Donald Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, former Pittsburgh Steeler defensive end, signed with the Jets for a cap 
number of $1.167 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mersereau and Hicks, scheduled to make a combined $1.125 million, were cut the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new system has forced those in our office to come up with a new word, 
caponomics, " agent Leigh Steinberg said. "With that word has come some tough 
times for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 More players have changed teams this year than last year at this time, 42-40. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, honeymoon time for this new union contract, players were 
changing teams because they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, standout safety Louis Oliver has gone from the contending Miami 
Dolphins to the Cincinnati Bengals only because the Dolphins decided that they 
could sign former Ram Michael Stewart and save $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging Redskins needed to save much more than that, so Mann hasn't been the 
only casualty. Carl Banks and Tim McGee, two of their touted free-agent 
signings last year, were also cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bostic, the last original Hog offensive lineman, was forced to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been very difficult," said Charley Casserly, Redskin general 
manager. "You do some things you hate to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It is going to be even tougher after the draft, when each team will have new 
players who will be wanting contracts that will force even more veterans out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The draft has become extremely important for one reason -- cheaper players," 
said Dick Steinberg, Jets' vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if your favorite team can even participate in the draft. Under cap 
rules, each team must have $108,000 available for each player drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources estimate that if the draft were conducted this week, some teams would 
have to cut more veterans before they could pick one player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing goes against your inner being," said John Butler, Bill 
general manager who is considered one of the game's best scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler says he enjoys developing talent, and keeping that talent together, 
because he remembers what is was like to have heroes as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still hope there exists a place where somebody can come in and play 10 
years and be somebody's hero," Butler said. "But I don't think that place 
exists anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said it hurts to remember Ballard and Odomes, both Pro Bowl starters, 
saying they wanted to stay in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 But to pay Ballard a fair salary, Butler said, he would have had to cut 10 
other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always guys you drop every year, but Ballard and Odomes are 
certainly not those kind of guys," Butler said. "This hurts. It really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Caponomics has also hurt the Los Angeles teams, although neither has lost a 
key player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have managed the cap better than most. Anybody notice that when 
they kept Tim Brown for $11 million, no big-name player lost his job? 
</P>
<P>
 But now they will almost certainly have to solve their running back problems 
through the draft if they are to remain under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we made that offer to Tim, we figured, we win either way," said Wade 
Phillips, the Broncos' coach whose team forced the Raiders' hand by negotiating 
with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lost their practice facility, it figures the Rams could also lose their 
only locker room stability, veteran tackle Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater wants to end his 18-year career here, but after making $1.1 million 
last year, he may be looking at more than a 50% pay cut. No wonder he is 
visiting the Atlanta Falcons this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game has become Monopoly -- you only have so much money to play with, and 
that money determines everything you do," said Jim Miller, vice president of 
the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no surprise that the Jacksonville Jaguars announced last week that they 
have hired former management guru John Jones for a single task: 
</P>
<P>
 Figure out the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 And the plague continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of Warren Moon being traded because the Houston Oilers cannot afford two 
$3-million quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Camarillo, Pro Bowl punter, being cut by the Arizona Cardinals because 
Coach Buddy Ryan says, "Hell, why pay somebody $900,000 when you can get 
somebody else for $275,000?" 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that Greg Davis, standout Cardinal kicker, needed to ask a 
question before agreeing to a recent interview? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to know one thing first," he said. "Do I still have my job?"

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL FOUR; CLAWING THEIR WAY BACK UP; 
ARIZONA'S WILDCATS HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE THIS YEAR AFTER TWO SEASONS OF 
FAILURE IN THE NCAA TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What do we need to know about the Arizona Wildcats in the Final Four? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the best thing about Arizona the warm feelings between the coach and 
reporters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy we're going to Charlotte," Coach Lute Olson said. "I'm not happy 
some of those people are going with us. I'm bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the best thing about Arizona the way the players respect each other's words 
and thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 "Listening to Reggie Geary talk is like 24-hour talk radio on fuzz," Joseph 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the best thing about Arizona a highly developed sense of humility? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're on our game, no one can stay with us," Geary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the best thing about Arizona that the players know why it is so very 
important to be punctual? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up an hour before I need to so I can iron my clothes," said Damon 
Stoudamire, known to his teammates as "Iron Man." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Arizona, consistently colorful, suddenly talkative and 
finally in the Final Four again, the place where they can practice their 
we-don't-get-any-respect speech before a much larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been six years and two consecutive first-round NCAA tournament defeats 
since Olson's Wildcats last appeared in a Final Four and some of Arizona's 
critics in Tucson have taken aim and scored big hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's payback time for Arizona (29-5) with a Final Four semifinal Saturday 
against Arkansas. When Arizona dusted off Missouri to win the West Regional 
title Saturday at the Sports Arena, 92-72, both Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves, 
his running mate in the backcourt, addressed the subject of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this does stop our doubters, but who knows?" Stoudamire said. "This 
might not do anything for our rep, but it doesn't make any difference because 
come next Saturday, there will be only four teams (playing) in Charlotte and 
we're one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since they have to play Arkansas, they also may be the first team to leave 
Charlotte, but it's probably best not to underestimate the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not difficult to see it is done, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona has three guards, two forwards and no center. It has a guard who 
doesn't score and a forward who gets out-rebounded by the guy standing next to 
him who is two inches smaller and weighs 56 pounds less. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a team that has more tattoos than players who help coming off the bench. 
All five starters have played between 930 minutes and 1,126 minutes and no one 
off the bench has played more than 450. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona's 20-point blowout of Missouri, not one substitute played more than 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Wildcats are one player in foul trouble away from disaster, it's 
important to note that the things they do right are devastatingly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Stoudamire and Reeves clearly are the best 1-2 punch of any 
backcourt among the Final Four. Against Missouri, they combined for 63 of 
Arizona's 92 points and played all but two minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 They score consistently, but differently. Stoudamire is a spot-up jump-shooter 
and Reeves is much more effective off the dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest are strictly complementary players offensively, especially the 
6-foot-10, 257-pound Blair, who looks sturdy, and the 6-8, 200-pound Ray Owes, 
who looks thin, a one-iron with hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Owes said appearances are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at me and think I'm weak," he said. "I guess I like to surprise 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 A nice surprise would have been for Owes to make a shot against Missouri, 
which he failed to do in 10 attempts. But scoring is not his job on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Third guard Geary leads the defense, in which Owes and Blair also do the grunt 
work, while Stoudamire and Reeves go for steals. Apparently it's an equitable 
division of labor because Arizona has been shutting teams down. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola of Maryland had 55 points and Virginia had 58 against Arizona in the 
first two tournament games, Louisville got 70 and lost by 12, then Missouri got 
72, lost by 20 and basically blamed itself afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Geary was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's four games in a row where the other team has been off," he said. "Gee, 
it couldn't be our defense, could it? Naw, couldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Geary, who took Missouri's Melvin Booker out of the game, said there is a 
reason Arizona is successful defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of guys who can fly around and do things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also got a lot of guys who can flap their mouths pretty well. 
Although this isn't all that unusual in the college game these days, it does 
seem odd in that Olson isn't exactly Dick Vitale with a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson jealously protects his blandness. When the Associated Press reported 
that Olson had cursed Cal Coach Todd Bozeman during a game, Olson called AP 
headquarters in New York to deny the report, then went on nearly every 
sports-talk radio station that had a signal to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are a different matter. From Stoudamire to Geary to Blair, the 
Wildcats like to talk nearly as much as they like, well, to fly around and do 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 The pecking order, as far as the mouth work goes, seems to be Geary, Blair and 
Stoudamire, with Geary and Blair far out front. And Geary says it isn't even 
close with Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still king of the talk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said it might be time to make a change at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of player who is always talking -- I mean always, " he said. 
"And to everybody. To me, it's, 'J.B., get the ball. J.B., get the rebound.' 
Then he'll throw you the ball and say, 'J.B., dunk it.' Unreal. Like I don't 
know how to dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I get sick of it. I can imagine how the other team feels." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, no matter who says what or how anybody in that pesky media 
brigade feels, the Wildcats are in the Final Four. Tattoos, attitudes and all, 
it's Arizona's time to take the entire act to Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a formidable lineup -- Olson with his white hair, Blair with his three 
tattoos, Reeves with his glide move, Geary with his ongoing conversations and 
Stoudamire with his freshly ironed socks and sharply creased T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year it seemed like we didn't even go to the tournament, we were out so 
quick," Blair said. "This is our chance."

NO EXCUSES THIS TIME; RANGERS SAY THEY HAVE THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER DESPITE 
CONTROVERSIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What to mention first about the Texas Rangers? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The free-agent signing of Will Clark, much to the chagrin of former first 
baseman Rafael Palmeiro? Palmeiro continues to demean Clark, deride the Rangers 
for their handling of his contract talks and suggest that, without his 
leadership, the club could be hurt by ethnic cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The attempt by Jose Canseco to regain his superstar form after "two years 
of physical and mental deterioration" left him suicidal? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The retirement of Nolan Ryan and the imminent opening of the Ballpark at 
Arlington, the Rangers' new home and an architectural clone of Camden Yards? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The impact of realignment, which moves the Chicago White Sox to the 
American League's Central Division and leaves the Rangers to face only the 
Angels, Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics in the West? 
</P>
<P>
 Texas management believes those things all play together, and that the bottom 
line is, as Manager Kevin Kennedy put it, "We no longer have any excuses for 
not winning the division (title). I say that because I mean it, and because I 
want to create a mind-set with the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Said General Manager Tom Grieve: "I think we can win and will win. I think 
every team in the division believes it has a better chance without the White 
Sox, but I think we'd win even if the division was the same. We have the best 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 The '93 Rangers made a sustained run before finishing eight games behind the 
White Sox despite only five victories by Ryan, the absence of Canseco after 
June 19, the inability of Julio Franco to play 18 games and the absence of home 
run king Juan Gonzalez from nine September games, including three in Chicago, 
because of a strained lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 The lingering promise of last season is underscored by a 55-37 record after 
July 24, when Kennedy, in his first season as a big league manager, stopped 
trying to coddle his players and reacted to a 2-8 trip by calling a three-hour 
workout on a day off, then ordering the now-you-see-them, now-you-don't Canseco 
and Franco to get back in the lineup or be put on the disabled list. Both were. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, who blew out his elbow pitching in Boston on May 29, never returned, 
but a chastised Franco came back from a pulled leg muscle and batted .311 while 
playing 95 of the final 98 games before joining the White Sox as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited too long to assert myself," Kennedy said. "It won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, he said, citing the lessons of his rookie season, would he allow a 
position player to pitch again, no matter how loudly or persistently he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco delivered 33 pitches after talking his way into the eighth inning of a 
15-1 loss to the Red Sox only four days after he had headed a fly ball over the 
fence for a home run in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I embarrassed myself, the team and the manager," he said of the incidents. 
"But what happened in Boston really turned out to be a blessing, I think. It 
was like losing a battle but winning the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "My elbow had been hurting for two years, and so had my shoulder, but without 
being forced to, I never would have had surgery. The doctors determined that in 
compensating for the shoulder, I hurt the elbow long before I pitched that 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 On July 9, a tendon was removed from Canseco's left wrist and used to replace 
the torn ligament in his right elbow. Canseco now says his hitting, legs and 
back are 100%, and his arm is 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still five months short," he said. "As soon as my arm is ready, I'll be 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco will open the season as the designated hitter, replacing Franco. Chris 
James, Gary Redus and rookie Rusty Greer will share right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his statistics for 60 games last season projected to a solid 27 
homers and 124 runs for a full season, Canseco said, "I know I have to 
re-establish myself and prove I can be the player I was. I wasn't into it 
physically or mentally for the last two years, but my priorities are in order 
now. The game is No. 1 for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He had to come to grips, he said, with the three-year process of separation, 
reconciliation and ultimate divorce from his wife, Esther. It was all so 
overwhelmingly painful, he said, that it took away his identity and left him 
with suicidal thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have feelings for her and will always miss her, but I realize now 
that life goes on, that I have other responsibilities," he said, acknowledging 
that he has been in therapy and that he worked with physical "technicians" from 
Miami University during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is a crossroads, I'm as prepared as I can be, and I'm getting 
better," he said. "More importantly, I'm happy. For a time, I didn't think that 
would be possible again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grieve: "Jose seems stronger, healthier and more focused on baseball. He 
seems to have used his time away productively." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers led the league in home runs and were third in runs despite the 
half-year absence of Canseco in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro picked up the slack with his best season, hitting 37 homers with 105 
RBIs. Clark, in turn, hit only 14 homers with the San Francisco Giants and 
drove in 73 runs for a second consecutive season while hampered again by leg 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries and his declining numbers of the last two years prompted the 
Giants to offer only three years at $15 million. Clark agreed to a five-year, 
$30-million contract with the Rangers on Nov. 22, only a few hours after the 
Baltimore Orioles had abruptly ended talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole owner Peter Angelos has said he refused to go to $30 million for Clark 
because of the injury risk and because Clark's recent statistics don't compare 
with those of Palmeiro, who signed a five-year, $30.35-million contract with 
the Orioles on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Which team really wanted which first baseman is a bit murky, but Palmeiro 
continues to say that the Rangers never intended to re-sign him, that they 
low-bridged an offer in order to upset him and force him elsewhere with the 
idea they would then sign Clark as a marketing tool to replace the retired Ryan 
in the Anglo community.  
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt because I felt that I had carried the Rangers for four months, had 
kept them in the race," the Cuban-born Palmeiro said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They treated me with no respect. There was no appreciation for what I did for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro has apologized for deriding Clark's ability on the day his former 
Mississippi State teammate signed with the Rangers -- "If he's worth $30 
million, then I'm worth $40 million" was only part of his tirade -- but he 
rekindled it in an interview with The Times, saying Clark simply can't fill his 
leadership void among the clubhouse cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to identify the cliques except to say they were divided along 
Latino and Anglo lines, that there was a potential for friction and that he was 
regarded as a leader who could cope with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I gather, the guys were upset the team didn't sign me because they 
know whatever I did and said came from the heart," Palmeiro said, adding that 
Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez were sure to miss him because they were like 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they'll have to deal with their problems themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gonzalez and Rodriguez said they admired Palmeiro as a player and friend, 
but they declined to discuss his value as a leader and said they knew nothing 
about cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ranger who is close to Gonzalez and Rodriguez said neither needed Palmeiro 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafy could be a silent leader, but the truth is he needed Juan and Ivan . . . 
more than they needed him . . .," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Grieve: "Rafael underestimates the maturity of our young Latin players. 
They don't need someone's shoulder to lean on or cry on, and I think they would 
be offended to know someone may think they can't be successful without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no fear about our team's ability to function well internally without 
Rafael, which is not to say he isn't a good guy or wasn't important to us on 
and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he's as good a player as Will and we made every effort to sign him. 
He was the first choice of every person in our organization. I mean, we went 
after Will only when it looked like we might end up with neither one, and we 
couldn't risk that. 
</P>
<P>
 "A left-handed power hitter was our No. 1 priority, particularly in the new 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for marketing, no one can replace Ryan, and it's ludicrous to think that's 
why we signed Will. A winning team is the best marketing vehicle there is, and 
we felt Will could help us win. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this has been dragged through the dirt to the point where it's a 
non-issue, but obviously Rafael is having a difficult time adjusting to his new 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad. He has a great contract with a great team, and he'll be better 
off when he can begin concentrating on his new team rather than his old team." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who passed a Ranger physical before he signed, will bat third, with 
Gonzalez, Canseco and third baseman Dean Palmer behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Giant is among the first to reach the clubhouse in the morning and 
the last to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "No drill is too mundane for him," Kennedy said of Clark and his potential for 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager is hopeful that Gonzalez, at 24, is also ready to show leadership. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers demonstrated their faith by giving him a seven-year, 
$45.45-million contract, although there was muttering among the players about 
the important games Gonzalez sat out last September, when Kennedy was on the 
verge of suspending him for also skipping a therapy session in Seattle because 
he overslept. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're asking Juan to do is what his job and status entails . . . to be 
the leader in the sense of complying with the team and going about his business 
in a professional and diligent way," Kennedy said. "I've seen money change 
people. It's up to me and the coaches to keep Juan on track." 
</P>
<P>
 With all of the offensive potential, with the likelihood that sellout crowds 
in the new stadium will provide a shot of inspiration, with the possibility 
that Ryan provided more of a distraction than a contribution during his final 
year -- with all of that, the team's chances in the weakened West may hinge on 
suspect pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Honeycutt and Jay Howell were signed to keep Tom Henke and Matt Whiteside 
company in the bullpen, but it's the rotation, after Kevin Brown and Kenny 
Rogers, that seems shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Pavlik, a 12-game winner last year, is sidelined until mid-April at the 
earliest because of a rotator-cuff problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Armstrong was 22-45 over the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hurst, limited to five games last year because of shoulder problems, was 
headed for a starting berth until the shoulder flared up again, leaving him in 
limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Helling, the Rangers' No. 1 draft pick in 1992, might have to be pushed 
into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're talking about the American and National league All-Star teams, 
everyone has pitching concerns," Grieve said. "Every time you read a capsule on 
this team or that team, it's looking for a fourth or fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a strong nucleus. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. It's 
comparable, and it won't prevent us from winning."

LOW POST, HIGH POST, STRAY POST; USC'S MILLER CRITICIZED FOR READING OPPONENT'S 
LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller, already among the most cordially disliked basketball coaches 
for taking the USC women's job, has now been accused of purloining mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently a scouting report on Miller's USC women's basketball team fell into 
the wrong hands last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it happened: 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Ayres, the women's coach at Cal State Fullerton, was asked by her 
former boss, Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt, to scout USC's first two NCAA 
tournament games in Los Angeles, against Portland and George Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Ayres hand-wrote a five-page report on Miller's team and took it with her to 
Fayetteville, Ark., site of last week's Mideast NCAA regional tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Apparently believing that Tennessee was staying at the Fayetteville Hilton -- 
it was really USC's hotel -- Ayres put Summitt's name on an envelope, put her 
report in it and handed it, unsealed, the story goes, to a Hilton desk clerk 
for delivery to Summitt. 
</P>
<P>
 For two days the scouting report lay at the front desk. Finally, a clerk 
observed that no one named Summitt was registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Further noting that the envelope was unsealed, the clerk opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see . . . looks like a bunch of basketball stuff . . . SC this, SC that 
. . . Miller this, Miller that . . . Hmmm.  
</P>
<P>
 Must be for Cheryl Miller, the clerk figured and eventually handed it to her.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller read it -- with growing interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts:  
</P>
<P>
 -- "USC does not match up (with Tennessee) personnel-wise or coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Cheryl works the crowd and the officials -- the men (USC assistants Fred 
Williams and Frank Scott) make the adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Anytime (Jody) Anton is in, take it right at her. She cannot defend 
against penetration and does a poor job in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It can be a 20-point difference, Pat. You clearly have the No. 1 team. Go 
get 'em!" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1-ranked Tennessee lost to Louisiana Tech last Thursday, rendering the 
scouting report unnecessary, even if Ayres had been successful in delivering it 
to the right coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Louisiana Tech knocked USC out of the tournament Saturday, 75-66, ending 
Miller's rookie season.  
</P>
<P>
 Ayres, who was on Summitt's staff during the 1989-90 season, was asked about 
the report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was personal mail and it was unethical for Cheryl to have read it," she 
said. "I have no other comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was unavailable for comment Monday, but Summitt had plenty to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed that Cheryl Miller would open a letter addressed to 
me," Summitt said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am upset. Cheryl Miller should be calling Pat Summitt and explaining why 
she opened my mail. It doesn't matter what was in it.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's called keeping your nose out of other people's business.  
</P>
<P>
 "If someone handed me an envelope with Cheryl Miller's name on it, I'd see to 
it that Cheryl Miller got it. If there'd been a stamp on that envelope, I'd 
press charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "How anyone can justify reading my mail -- it's beyond my imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said that Miller had run into Ayres Friday, before Ayres knew Miller had 
seen the scouting report.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott recalled, "They talked in a friendly way, then Cheryl said, 'Oh, by the 
way -- that was a good scouting report you did on us. Some day you might be a 
good coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres' two Cal State Fullerton teams have gone 8-19 and 5-22. Miller was 26-4.

JIM MURRAY: SHE HAS FOUND PEACE OF MIND ON THE GREENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was not too many years ago, she was the brightest light on the women's 
tour. Even the name helped. Muffin Spencer-Devlin. No Mary Smith here. A bona 
fide marquee name. With a hyphen yet. 
</P>
<P>
 She was tall, willowy, pretty. She looked like what she had been, wanted to be 
-- a showgirl. She was as uninhibited as a kitten. She wisecracked her way 
around 18 holes. Reporters loved her. Her competitors were amused by her. 
</P>
<P>
 She hit the ball as purely as anyone on the circuit. She had won three 
tournaments by her fifth full year. The future looked as wide-open as a 
par-five in west Texas. Muffin was a star.  
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't really set out to be a golf star. A Hollywood star would have been 
more like it. She didn't want to be Betsy Rawls, she wanted to be Bette Davis. 
She didn't even play golf in college. "I drank beer and partied and popped 
pills and waited to be 'discovered,' " she says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the smiles and antics was a demon she had to cope with and only she 
knew about -- a manic-depressive side to her nature that periodically 
threatened to take over her life.  
</P>
<P>
 Muffin -- her real name is Helene -- grew up on Long Island and golf had only 
been a casual thing. Acting was going to be her profession.  
</P>
<P>
 She took the name of her father, but hyphenated it with that of a beloved 
stepfather who indulged Muffin in most of her fantasies, including college in 
Florida, at Rollins.  
</P>
<P>
 Early on, she had manic-depressive episodes, including periodic commitments 
for treatment and, at one time, had been prescribed lithium carbonate.  
</P>
<P>
 She lived with it, but it not only dulled her appreciation of life, it made 
her feel "as if I were standing on the other side of a screen door watching 
myself go through the motions. I felt like a zombie." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls she "put up with this for 13 years. I stayed away from things that 
were bad -- no caffeine, no alcohol, shopped for food in health stores." 
</P>
<P>
 This pretty much kept the balance -- until a real estate deal in San Francisco 
went sour.  
</P>
<P>
 "I went into a deep depression. I couldn't find my way out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Prozac was prescribed.  
</P>
<P>
 Her game became as erratic as her life. Until, finally, there was a trip to 
Europe. Muffin's life became a series of out-of-bounds shots -- on and off the 
course.  
</P>
<P>
 She didn't exactly insult the Queen Mother. She did the next-worst thing, 
though. She insulted the commissioner of women's golf in Europe. Muffin chewed 
him out in language more suited to a truck driver or ferry-boat captain. She 
got up at a banquet, insulted the guests and proclaimed she was an American and 
didn't have to take this. She had slipped into a manic-depressive state.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, she arrived at the first tee of the tournament in England and 
was told she had been disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted to fight it but before she could, a concerned friend whisked her to 
a London clinic, where they recognized her symptoms.  
</P>
<P>
 Muffin thought her career was over. She dropped off the tour for five months.  
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, you would have to think the golf tour is the worst place 
for a manic-depressive. Eight-foot putts can produce manic depression in even 
the most stable of human beings -- mania when sunk and depression when left a 
foot short. Every shot can produce its own form of mental illness. All athletes 
live in dread of failure, but golfers can get it every other shot. As Churchill 
said, the game is played "with implements ill-suited to the purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 And, because the game is so cerebral and depends so explicitly on 
self-confidence, it would seem the human mind is one of those ill-suited 
implements. A golf green would seem to be the worst place in the world for 
anyone who has an uncertain psyche. You're always a putt away from a 
straitjacket. You don't play the game, you serve it.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Muffin Spencer-Devlin says, simply, "Golf saved my life." She found, of 
all things, a serenity of purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 For most players, golf is about as serene as a night in Dracula's castle. But 
for Muffin, it has had a stabilizing effect. 
</P>
<P>
 She's never going to be Bette Davis -- or Betsy Rawls, either. But she has 
found a regimen of vitamins, amino acids, proper diet and plenty of sleep and 
regular workouts laid out for her by Dr. Priscilla Slagle, and they have 
regulated her episodes of disorder. A golf course is the perfect place to be 
for her -- even when the eight-footers come up 18 inches short, Muffin says.  
</P>
<P>
 She didn't win the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament last week. But she shot a 
respectable 74-75-72-71 -- 292, outscoring such superstars as Betsy King, Amy 
Alcott and JoAnne Carner, not to mention last year's winner, Helen Alfredsson. 
All in all, a good week for the brand Muffin. And she made $3,029, giving her 
more than $22,000 for the year to date -- a heartening three-month total 
considering she made only $35,070 all last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Golf is the best of all treatments for psychic disability. You not only don't 
pay for it, it pays you.

CORKUM, DUCKS' TOP SCORER, OUT FOR SEASON AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, the Mighty Ducks' leading scorer, underwent successful surgery to 
repair a ruptured tendon in his right foot on Monday. He is expected to be in a 
cast for one month and to resume skating in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum's anterior tibialis tendon was cut by a skate blade during a collision 
in the third period of the Ducks' 3-2 overtime victory over Philadelphia on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only three Ducks to play in all 76 games, Corkum had 23 goals and 28 
assists. He had never scored more than the 10 points he had last season for the 
Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad to finish like that after the season he had," Coach Ron Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov, sidelined because of elbow and hamstring injuries, probably 
will replace Corkum in the lineup. If Semenov isn't ready, the Ducks might call 
up either Jarrod Skalde or Lonnie Loach from San Diego.

VALLEY / VENTURA ROUNDUP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Fullmer, one of the Montreal Expos' top prospects and a former standout 
hitter at Montclair Prep, might miss the 1994 season because of a recurring 
right shoulder injury, said Kent Qualls, Montreal's director of minor league 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer is scheduled to be examined Wednesday by the club's team physician in 
Montreal, Qualls said.Fullmer said he also plans to see noted orthopedist Dr. 
Frank Jobe next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he's going to have to have surgery of some type," Qualls said. 
"(Missing the season) is a possibility I couldn't rule out. We are hoping for 
the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer, a third baseman, said he had been bothered by shoulder problems since 
last summer and the pain finally became so bad that he underwent a magnetic 
resonance imaging exam last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer, 19, was selected by the Expos in the second round of the amateur 
draft last June. He signed for a $417,500 bonus, the largest ever awarded to a 
second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball America magazine recently ranked him the fourth-best prospect in the 
Expos' system and the 67th-best prospect in baseball. JEFF FLETCHER

WOMEN'S COACH WHO SAID THE MEN COMMITTED VIOLATIONS IS FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pam Bowers, who reported possible violations in the men's basketball program 
at Baylor, was fired Monday as women's basketball coach at Baylor after 15 
years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers' complaints contributed to an investigation that resulted in the 
suspension of four players for the 1993-94 season. The Southwest Conference and 
Baylor are to announce Thursday the status of the investigations into the 
eligibility of the four, all of whom transferred from junior colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are Jason Ervin, Tyrone Davis, Shannon Brantley and Marcus 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers had a record of 168-257 at Baylor, including 13-14 last season -- 4-10 
in the SWC.

RAMS LOSE TIGHT END CARTER TO HOUSTON OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have lost tight end Pat Carter to the Oilers, but will talk today 
about the possibility of increasing efforts to sign Houston wide receiver 
Haywood Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Williams, Carter's agent, said the Oilers and the tight end have reached 
an agreement on a one-year, $1.1-million contract, and that he expects Carter 
to sign Wednesday with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have told me that they consider Pat one of the best blocking tight 
ends in the league," Williams said. "But Pat wants to catch the ball and I 
don't think the Rams will give him that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter earned $370,000 last season as the Rams' starting tight end, but will 
sign for $262,000 and a $500,000 signing bonus. Additional incentives will 
provide him with the opportunity to earn $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have had Jeffires at the top of their wish list for wide receivers, 
but backed away upon hearing his salary demands of $2 million a year. Jeffires, 
however, has been running out of options. The Broncos signed Charger Anthony 
Miller, the Redskins are courting the Rams' Henry Ellard and the Oilers have 
serious salary cap concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be time now to see if we can get something going with Jeffires," 
said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. 
</P>

THRILL IS GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN; FORMER GIANT CLARK QUICKLY MAKES HIS 
PRESENCE KNOWN WITH THE RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 8:30 on a recent spring morning, Will Clark slowly put on the blue and 
white uniform of the Texas Rangers and said, "I thought I'd be in black and 
orange forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Color him sad, bitter, angry? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above, said the former first baseman of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have great memories," he said of nine years in the Giants' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left on good terms and have only good things to say. I was treated well, 
but it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers signed free agent Clark to a five-year, $30-million contract when 
the Giants, clearly skeptical of his physical status after two subpar seasons, 
offered only three years at $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't exactly a secret that I was trying to get a deal done out of spring 
training (in '93), but I should have seen through their response from the 
start," Clark said of the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were never very aggressive, and when the season ended it was kind of 
'Take it or leave it.' I guess it was more of a surprise to me than anything, 
considering how I had helped provide a foundation for the franchise to build on 
(after losing 100 games in 1985), and how I had never complained about my last 
contract, even though it was outdated almost from the time I signed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Groin and knee injuries restricted Clark to 144 games in 1992, when he hit 16 
homers and drove in 73 runs with a .300 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 A knee injury in '93 limited him to 132 games. He hit 14 homers, drove in 73 
runs again and batted .283. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant General Manager Bob Quinn has said he was not prepared to offer five 
years based on what the club had seen of Clark in the last two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scuffled the last two years, but I've never used injuries as an excuse and 
still won't," Clark said. "Everyday players play with injuries, but the fact 
is, whenever I got hot I couldn't stay hot because my whole support frame was 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't plant or turn. That's why I hit a lot of balls to left field last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark worked with conditioning expert Mackie Shilstone during the winter and 
said he is confident of returning to his All-Star form, citing his .379 average 
over his final 58 at-bats last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm washed up by any stretch," Clark said, dismissing Quinn's 
doubt. "I think any doubt was removed in September. If you throw out the first 
month or so of last season, I had a very solid year. I don't doubt my ability 
to hit as well as ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles apparently did. He refused to go 
to $30 million and pulled out of negotiations with Clark at the 11th hour, 
ultimately signing Rafael Palmeiro to a five-year, $30.35-million contract 
after Clark had signed with Palmeiro's Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro, who had wanted to return to Texas, derided Clark's ability and 
ethics and later made a tepid apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, however, has refused to trade insults with his former Mississippi State 
teammate, saying only that Palmeiro's comments seemed like sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more shocked than anything," Clark said. "I had to wonder where he was 
coming from. I mean, a free agent is just that -- free to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, there will be statistical comparisons with Palmeiro, but Clark 
said: "I'm here to win -- that's what I'm about -- and if everyone has a 
typical year, we have a very good chance to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark will bat third in a powerful lineup. Manager Kevin Kennedy said Clark is 
already providing leadership by example and contributing to open dialogue in 
the clubhouse, where he has always been known as "the Shrill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants seemed to doubt, however, that he could become "the Thrill" again, 
but Clark said of his former team, "I hear they're still not sure who's going 
to bat third or play first base."

 JAIL BIRDS: Federal wildlife biologists have adopted their own law: One strike 
and you're out. Biologists have decided to capture the three California condors 
that recently returned to Ventura County and cage them at the Los Angeles Zoo 
(B1). . . . Biologists say it's for their own good. They moved the giant 
vultures from the Sespe Condor Sanctuary to a more remote spot in Santa Barbara 
County after four others died of man-made causes. The truant trio, given to 
perching on power lines, will be held in isolation away from the other 71 
condors in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 STABLE SKIES: The death toll continues to mount from the deadly twisters that 
ripped across the Southeast on Palm Sunday (A22). . . . Local meteorologists 
said that Ventura County gets an occasional report of a mild tornado, but the 
moist, cool air from the chilly Pacific dominates our weather and prevents the 
extreme temperature changes that trigger thunderstorms and tornadoes. 
"Sometimes we curse the marine layer for all of the fog it brings," said Rea 
Strange of Pacific Weather Analysis. "But it also protects us." 
</P>
<P>
 LIVING TREASURE: She is well known as Ojai's romantic free spirit with 
wrinkles. Now, Beatrice Wood, the 101-year-old artist and pottery designer, is 
being honored across the state as a California Living Treasure. . . . Gov. Pete 
Wilson on Friday awarded Wood for her artistry and her unquenchable spirit. 
Wood continues her practice of working at least 4 1/2 hours each day with clay. 
"When you get really old," Wood said, "the ability to work is a great gift." 
</P>
<P>
 CHANGING TIDE: Clamshell Buildings Inc., which provided movable shelters for 
U. S. helicopters during the Gulf War, has brought in a new top executive so 
the co-founders of the Ventura company can go their own ways (Valley Business, 
Page 12). . . . One co-founder is headed off to Europe, and the other will stay 
on as a consultant. The company's new chief executive, Sanford Waddell, is, of 
course, as happy as a mollusk: "It is the most fun in an office setting I can 
recall."

PROLIFIC MYSTERY WRITER MARGARET MILLAR DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Millar, the prolific author of more than 25 psychological mystery 
novels and two-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Award, has died. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Millar died Saturday in her Santa Barbara home, her sister, Dorothy 
Schlagel, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mystery Writers of America gave Mrs. Millar her first Poe Award in 1956 
for her novel "Beast in View" and her second in 1983 for "Banshee." The 
organization, which she served as president from 1957 to 1958, also gave her 
its Grand Master Award for life achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born "Maggie" Sturm Millar was the widow of Kenneth Millar, 
better known as Ross Macdonald, the mystery writer who created the series of 
novels and films based on fictional detective Lew Archer. Macdonald, who first 
wrote about Archer in 1949, died 11 years ago of Alzheimer's disease. The 
couple's only child, Linda, died earlier of an embolism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millars, who frequently described themselves as "bookends," met as high 
school debaters in their native Kitchener, Canada. Their first stories -- hers 
was called "Impromptu" and his "The South Sea Soup Co." -- were published in 
1931 in their high school magazine, the Grumbler. It was one of the few times 
their works appeared together in print. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending the University of Toronto, the two married in 1938. She 
settled them in Santa Barbara -- known as Santa Felicia in many of her novels 
and by various Spanish names in his -- during World War II while he was serving 
in the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grew up in Kitchener, where you had to pass the slaughterhouse on 
the way to school every day, Santa Barbara was paradise," she said in a 1983 
interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, who also earned a Poe Award, chose a pseudonym because she 
achieved recognition as the writer named Millar first. 
</P>
<P>
 "By going on ahead and breaking trail," her husband wrote of their intertwined 
careers, "she helped to make it possible for me to become a novelist, as 
perhaps her life with me had helped to make it possible for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Millar wrote her first book, "The Invisible Worm" published in 1941, when 
she was bedridden with a heart condition after their daughter's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, not even legal blindness slowed Maggie Millar's prolific output, 
although it did prompt her to switch from writing longhand to dictating into a 
tape recorder, and then typing the transcript. Eventually, she used a tape 
system that fed back the work in white letters on a black background, which she 
could read. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered from macular degeneration, which a series of laser surgeries 
failed to correct, and had only peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I couldn't write now I'd probably go off my rocker. Writing keeps me sane 
-- or as sane as I am," she told The Times with her characteristic good humor 
in 1982, when her vision difficulties and her husband's Alzheimer's disease 
were full-blown. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence was never a problem for the woman who made her mark as a novelist 
married to a novelist decades before women's liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my space. I just assumed I had it," she said in 1983. "I probably 
would have had an argument if I'd been married to some macho type. But Ken was 
a civilized man." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for her tightly written, elegantly constructed, witty books, Mrs. Millar 
wrote such psychological thrillers as "The Devil Loves Me" in 1942, "Fire Will 
Freeze" in 1944, "Do Evil in Return" in 1950, "An Air That Kills" in 1957, "A 
Stranger in My Grave" in 1961, "The Murder of Miranda" in 1979 and "Mermaid" in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Banshee," about the murder of a little girl in a California avocado 
orchard, was published in 1983, Times reviewer Judith Szarka noted: 
</P>
<P>
 "This mystery does not make the heart pound with tension, but it entertains 
and charms with humor and compassion. (Mrs.) Millar, a prolific mystery writer 
. . . reaffirms her reputation as a doyenne of the genre." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Charles Champlin, comparing the writing of Macdonald and Mrs. 
Millar, commented after Mrs. Millar published "Mermaid": 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the single quality linking the work of husband and wife, beyond the 
setting of Southern California and the detection story form, is their clear and 
copious compassion for their imagined characters as tokens (the reader senses) 
for real-life figures caught in somewhat comparable dramas that are neither 
imaginary nor satisfactorily soluble." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mrs. Millar's books and for her service in such organizations as the 
National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, she was honored as a Times Woman 
of the Year in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite avocations included court-watching in the historic Santa Barbara 
County Courthouse, a prime source of material for her murder mysteries, and 
entertaining friends of all ages -- provided they were careful of their attire 
and their grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Canadian part of me," she explained with a chuckle. "One should 
dress properly and have at least a nodding acquaintance with the English 
language."

EUGENE IONESCO; GODFATHER OF THEATER OF ABSURD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eugene Ionesco, the Romanian-born playwright who was considered the godfather 
of the theater of the absurd and wrote the genre's best-known work, "The 
Rhinoceros," died Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco, who had recently suffered from bronchitis, died in his Paris home 
during a post-lunch nap, his wife, Rodika, said. For many years, he had had 
arthrosis, a disease of joint deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco often referred to the body of plays that peaked with "Rhinoceros" as 
theater of "derision" or the "improbable" rather than the more popular tag 
"absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 As with his other classics -- "The Bald Soprano," "The Lesson," "The Chairs," 
"Exit the King" and "Jack or the Submission" -- a dominant theme of 
"Rhinoceros" was the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Produced first in France, Germany, England, Poland, and Japan, "Rhinoceros" 
moved to Broadway in 1961 starring Eli Wallach and Zero Mostel. It was made 
into a popular movie in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 An allegory protesting totalitarianism, "Rhinoceros" involves townsfolk in a 
French village on a quiet Sunday morning who hear that a rhinoceros is charging 
through the streets. Illustrating that ordinary people find it difficult to 
resist the extraordinary, all the characters -- except the publisher's clerk, 
played in America by Wallach -- eventually turn into rhinoceroses. 
</P>
<P>
 When the play opened in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1959, there were 58 curtain 
calls. Over the years, critics interpreted it as anti-Hitler, anti-Peronist, 
anti-Communist, anti-Leftist and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first thought of the rhinoceros image during the war (World War II), as I 
watched Romanian statesmen and politicians and later French intellectuals 
accommodate themselves to Hitler's way of thinking," Ionesco said in a 1985 
interview. "They might say something like, 'Well, of course the Nazis are 
terrible, terrible people, but you know, you must credit them with their good 
points.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And you wanted to say to them: 'But don't you see, if you start granting them 
a good point here, a good point there, eventually you will concede everything 
to them.' Which is exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they looked upon you as an alarmist, then a nuisance, finally an enemy to 
be run down. They looked like they wanted to lower their heads and charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco said that he was equally hostile to socialism on the political left 
and Nazism on the political right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only things I have ever been hostile to," he told another interviewer 
trying to pin political labels on him, "were stupidity and the violation of 
human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Slatina, Romania, Ionesco spent his early childhood in Paris. He 
returned to Romania until his colleagues' bow to Adolf Hitler prompted him to 
flee permanently to France. Eventually, he became a French citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supreme trick of mass insanity is that it persuades you that the only 
abnormal person is the one who refuses to join in the madness of others, the 
one who tries vainly to resist," he said in a 1983 discussion of "Rhinoceros" 
and other works based on his World War II observations. "We will never 
understand totalitarianism if we do not understand that people rarely have the 
strength to be uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco worked as a professor of French in Romania, and then for a publishing 
house when he moved to France. When Ionesco decided to transform his views on 
the absurdity of life into plays, his devoted wife helped support them by 
working in a lawyer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics were initially unimpressed when Ionesco's first play, "The 
Bald Soprano," premiered on May 11, 1950, word of mouth prompted a surge in 
ticket sales. Ionesco was so encouraged he decided to devote all his time to 
writing plays as fast as he could turn them out. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1952 production of "The Chairs," Ionesco was winning praise from Samuel 
Beckett and others who were to become his colleagues in the theater of the 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his plays were increasingly translated into many languages and 
performed worldwide, finding special success in the United States, Ionesco 
worked solely in French. After his only child, Marie-France, grew up, she 
frequently traveled with him as translator for his interviews and remarks to 
theater audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an infirmity I regret," he once told former Times theater critic Sylvie 
Drake when she asked -- in French -- why he never spoke or wrote in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only read English," he said. "I can ask a policeman for directions, but 
I don't understand his reply." 
</P>
<P>
 His aborted attempt to learn English spurred him into playwriting -- "The Bald 
Soprano" includes such dialogue from his grammar book as "the ceiling is up, 
the floor is down." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco always emphasized that he did not set out to be a playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have preferred becoming a saint," he would say with tongue only 
slightly in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I was very young, someone explained that saints were not concerned 
with fame -- and that gave me pause because I was not entirely indifferent to 
fame." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco said he became a writer because literature seemed the surest path out 
of "abhorrent anonymity." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trappings of fame he achieved were entry into the Academie Francaise 
in 1970, the Ingersoll Foundation's annual T.S. Eliot Award for Creative 
Writing in 1985, and a commendation from the Los Angeles Theater Alliance in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco was frequently described as a "pessoptimist" because of his 
contradictory swings between amusing, highly optimistic commentaries and a 
truly pessimistic outlook on the world condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In his frequent visits to Los Angeles during his later years, he charmed 
theater goers and students with upbeat comments such as: "I love life, in spite 
of everything. I have in me a life force stronger than despair. I have a good 
appetite. I love beautiful country." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake once described Ionesco's physical appearance as "a cross between a 
serene Buddha and a mischievous Alfred Hitchcock," and he often demonstrated 
Hitchcock's dry wit in his work and words. 
</P>
<P>
 But critic Martin Esslin, credited with coining the phrase "theater of the 
absurd," frequently told of his early encounter with Ionesco backstage when 
"The Bald Soprano" first attracted attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your husband must be a very happy man," Esslin said to Madame Ionesco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, monsieur, he is very sad," she replied, despite the play's evident 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would he be sad?" asked an uncomprehending Esslin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," she said, revealing the playwright's fundamental fear, "he is 
afraid to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionesco frequently tried to explain that seeming contradiction by saying he 
feared death because he so loved life, including his literary success, "despite 
all the horrors and suffering that exist in it." Many people who believe in God 
as he did, may fear facing God and also love the world too much to leave it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright continued to try new ventures well into his 70s, writing a 
novel, "The Hermit" which became the play "A Hell of a Mess." He also began 
sketching and painting watercolors, and did well enough that his work was 
exhibited in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing, painting, virtually everything he did, was a spiritual quest, Ionesco 
explained in 1988, shortly after his nonfiction book, "The Intermittent Quest," 
was published. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I tell myself that the world is a huge practical joke God has 
played on humanity and that the only solution is to join in the game, to play 
and to laugh no matter what, in spite of mounting catastrophes and cadavers," 
he said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, alas, not able to laugh all the time and I very quickly slump back into 
what constitutes the average of my days: sadness, anxiety, the emptiness of 
this world where only love and art will have allowed me to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's anguishing," he emphasized in the interview, "is to ask myself: 'Who 
put me here?' At the same time, I'm afraid to get out. I don't know if I'll 
find anything on the other side."

LYDIA LANE; BEAUTY COLUMN FEATURED STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lydia Lane, a syndicated beauty columnist also known for her aid to war 
veterans, has died at the age of 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Lane, the widow of Austin W. Young, died Sunday night in her sleep in her 
Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
 A columnist for the Los Angeles Times and its now-defunct sister paper, the 
Los Angeles Mirror, from 1938 to 1980, Miss Lane characteristically interviewed 
Hollywood film stars and other beautiful women and wrote about their secrets 
for controlling weight or enhancing their hair, skin or makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 In her column, titled simply "Beauty," Miss Lane relayed such bits of wisdom 
as actress Faye Dunaway's advice to use a sauna to purify one's complexion, 
actress Alexis Smith's suggestion that positive thinking is the best approach 
to dieting, and actress Tina Louise's adage that a daily headstand and other 
exercise assured youthful beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Lane's column was syndicated by The Times to 387 newspapers, said her 
friend and former syndicate editor, Patrick McHugh, and was the leading feature 
in 1951 when Mirror Enterprises Syndicate (now Los Angeles Times Syndicate) was 
in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to writing about celebrities, Miss Lane often persuaded them to 
join her in visiting hospitalized armed forces veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Veterans Administration honored Miss Lane for her work with armed services 
patients, which began during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Lane, whose real name was Audrey Young, was widowed two years ago, and 
had no children. At her request, there will be no services.

 An Oxnard refinery that for years leaked oil into ecologically sensitive 
wetlands agreed Monday to clean up its mess and install safety measures to make 
sure it never happens again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenby Inc., doing business as Oxnard Refinery and Chase Production, signed an 
agreement with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency that requires it to 
commit to long-term cleanup and submit an initial plan within 21 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The company admitted spilling at least 10,000 gallons of oil into a ditch 
leading to Mugu Lagoon, an EPA spokesman said. Under the agreement, it has 90 
days from the time EPA approves the plan to finish the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials, including Chief Executive Officer Morley Chase, refused to 
discuss the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the spill and the EPA agreement were referred to company 
lawyers, who said that the initial cleanup has been completed and that studies 
are under way to identify the source of the leaks -- reported a year ago -- and 
develop a long-term remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're unaware of any ongoing release," said Michael Francis, a Los 
Angeles-based attorney for Tenby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea of any persistent release from production operations or the 
refinery operations," he said. "It is hoped that these measures will prevent 
any future occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators said the agreement, hashed out since details of the leak 
were uncovered last year by state Fish and Game wardens, would ensure that the 
company takes responsibility for the pollution and its cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the agreement announced Monday, federal officials said they are 
still working to evaluate the full extent of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can safely say it's more than 10,000 gallons, but how much more we don't 
know," said David Schmidt, a spokesman for the EPA's Western regional office in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to require the full cleanup -- no matter how big it is," he 
said. "There are provisions in the agreement that call for reopening the scope 
of the work if it turns out to be more than what they are promising to do 
within the first 90 days." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game wardens first discovered the oil spill a year ago after 
someone reported seeing oil sheens leading to Mugu Lagoon, a sensitive 
saltwater habitat for a variety of species. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese said damage from the spill has been 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found were skeletal remains from crayfish and mosquito fish, and a 
general absence of fish and wildlife," Reese said. "It looked like it had been 
a chronic problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the EPA, however, Reese said his inspectors have yet to determine the 
extent of the ground-water and above-ground contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it became apparent that the problem was a lot more complex," he 
said. "It will require long-term monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement announced Monday is separate from a civil suit filed against 
Tenby and its chief executive officer by the Ventura County district attorney's 
office earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are some of the same remedies we're seeking," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gregory W. Brose, who prosecutes environmental offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's been agreed to in the federal case, we are obviously glad," Brose 
said. "But that doesn't mean the state's civil case has no further (bearing)." 
</P>
<P>
 Brose alleges in the civil suit that Tenby and Chase illegally discharged an 
unspecified amount of petroleum products into state waters at least four years 
ago, and that the company engaged in improper business practices in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what we've alleged is that there's been some negligence in allowing 
the releases to occur," Brose said. "That's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Superior Court lawsuit specifically alleges that two 
separate oil tanks leaked into the ditch, as did oil from a flow line and pipe 
casings from a particular oil well. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks a judge to grant a permanent injunction preventing the 
company from further polluting the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unlawful conduct and acts of the defendants in violation of the law . . . 
demonstrate the necessity and legal basis for granting injunctive relief and 
imposition of civil penalties," the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, the Tenby attorney, said his clients have already installed a series 
of measures to prevent further spills, including a set of dams and oil-water 
separators that will better control the product flow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the work plan being drafted will further identify particular problem 
spots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assessment is intended to ensure that there are no pipelines or tanks 
that are leaking," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even EPA officials, who could impose strict fines and penalties if the 
agreement is not adhered to, acknowledge that they do not yet know what 
specifically caused the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really need to do is go out there and investigate the sources of the 
oil," said EPA attorney Lisa Castanon, who is handling the case. "We know it's 
getting into the ditch, but we don't know what the source is."

JURY ORDERS DEATH PENALTY FOR SATTIEWHITE IN OXNARD KILLING; COURTS: HE HAD 
BEEN CONVICTED OF SHOOTING A MOTHER OF FOUR. DEFENSE SOUGHT A LIFE TERM, 
CLAIMING THAT HE WAS ABUSED AND HAS THE MIND OF A CHILD.

<P>
 A jury Monday condemned a convicted Oxnard murderer to death for the fatal 
shooting of a 30-year-old mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher James Sattiewhite, 24, becomes the eighth Ventura County defendant 
to face death in the gas chamber since California reinstated capital punishment 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous court appearances in which he displayed little emotion, 
Sattiewhite seemed on the verge of crying after Superior Court Judge Lawrence 
Storch announced the death verdict to the silence of a hushed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As tears welled in his eyes, he nervously tapped his fingers on the defense 
table and stroked his beard. Shaking his head in apparent disbelief, he rocked 
back and forth in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 After the proceeding, Sattiewhite remained glued to his chair as his attorneys 
tried to coax him to leave the courtroom. Lawyer Willard P. Wiksell later 
explained that his client, who was described in court as being childlike, was 
both astonished and frightened by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to die. He just doesn't want to go to Death Row," Wiksell 
said. "He's dejected and has lost hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite eventually stood and walked to a holding cell, flashing a brief 
smile to a supporter in the courtroom's gallery before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was done," Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia M. Murphy declared. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wiksell, visibly dejected himself, said he thought that the defense had 
provided the jury with adequate reason to spare Sattiewhite's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed," Wiksell said later. "I think there was a mitigating 
factor. There's no dispute that he has the mind of a 12-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite shot Genoveva Gonzales in the head three times Jan. 26, 1992, and 
left her body in a drainage ditch along Arnold Road in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the murder occurred after Sattiewhite inadvertently called 
out the name of an accomplice who had kidnaped and raped Gonzales. The killing 
was necessary to prevent the woman from identifying her assailants, according 
to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's verdict ended three days of deliberations for the jury, the same 
panel that convicted Sattiewhite of murder Feb. 24. Just moments before voting 
to condemn the defendant, jurors heard a reading of the riveting testimony of a 
woman whom Sattiewhite had previously been convicted of raping. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, that was a key factor" in the verdict, Murphy said, referring 
to Sattiewhite's being previously convicted of a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're never happy when somebody is given the death penalty," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn, co-prosecutor on the case. "You are never happy 
when society has to impose its greatest penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said prosecutors are satisfied that they were able to avenge the 
Gonzales murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors refused to be interviewed and exited the courthouse through a back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch set sentencing April 25. At that time, he will also rule on a defense 
motion to reduce the verdict to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said he expects Storch to uphold the verdict of death, noting that no 
Ventura County judge has ever reversed such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell made the motion for the reduced verdict. "Chris Sattiewhite will get a 
fair shake from Judge Storch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Ventura County defendant to receive a verdict of death was former 
day-care aide Gregory Scott Smith. He was tried in October, 1991, for killing 
8-year-old Paul Bailly of Northridge and burning the boy's body. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's next death penalty trial is set Aug. 1. Mark Scott Thornton will 
be tried for last summer's slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, who was 
killed after a carjacking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have called the Gonzales murder one of the most senseless crimes 
to hit the area in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 They told the jury that Sattiewhite is a "vicious predator" who acted out a 
childhood fantasy when he killed the woman. Sattiewhite had told a psychologist 
that as a child, he often dreamed of killing for the thrill of seeing if he 
could get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also said Sattiewhite was a gang member who enjoyed carrying a gun 
and holding victims at bay while they were raped by his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys asked for mercy, saying Sattiewhite is a former abused child 
who suffers from a lifelong brain defect and has problems distinguishing right 
from wrong. They argued that a sentence of life in prison was more than 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that due to his mental defect, Sattiewhite was easily 
manipulated by accomplices in both the Gonzales rape-murder and the previous 
rape, which occurred at Oxnard Beach in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys never minimized Gonzales' death, saying their client 
committed a terrible crime. But they pointed out that the victim had a drug 
conviction and claimed that she was a prostitute who was hoping to trade sex 
for drugs the day she died. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Wiksell wondered whether he should have used a less elaborate 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only look at the crime, it is a death penalty case," he conceded. "But 
if you look at the crime and (Sattiewhite), it's a life-in-prison case. Maybe I 
should have just told the jury that."

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS MOUNT; ELECTIONS: RECENT FINANCE REPORTS 
SHOW SUCH DONATIONS ALREADY AIDING CAMPAIGNS OF THE COUNTY'S LEGISLATIVE 
CANDIDATES VYING IN THE JUNE PRIMARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although the June 7 primary is still two months away, tens of thousands of 
dollars in special interest contributions have already begun flowing into 
legislative races in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for a state Senate seat, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) has raised $89,735 since Jan. 1, more than both of the 
Republicans who hope to oppose him in November, according to recent finance 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosted by contributions of $23,000 from family members, Republican candidate 
Brooks Firestone far exceeded the fund-raising efforts of both Democrats vying 
for their party's nomination in the race for O'Connell's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 And Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) raised $23,361 from various business 
interests, while his Democratic opponent, Dorothy Maron, has yet to begin 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've got an uphill fight," Maron said. "But I'm going to fight. . . . 
If I have to, I'll put my inheritance in this." 
</P>
<P>
 In statewide races, state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a candidate for 
lieutenant governor, raised $89,874 since the beginning of the year, and former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who is running for state 
controller, collected $125,284. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, O'Connell, 42, was the most successful at raising political cash among 
local candidates. He is seeking the position being vacated by retiring state 
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) in a district that covers Ventura, Santa 
Paula, Ojai and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The $89,735 O'Connell raised in the past three months lifted the total amount 
of contributions to $316,821. Contributions of $1,000 or more came from, among 
others, the American Insurance Assn., Amgen Inc., Blue Cross of California, the 
California Bankers Assn. and the Trial Lawyers PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Steve MacElvaine, a 49-year-old cattle rancher and former 
San Luis Obispo County supervisor, raised more than twice the amount raised by 
GOP challenger Steve Decker, 50, a Santa Barbara real estate investor. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine reported $38,316 in contributions, including a $15,000 personal 
loan and $2,000 from the Lincoln Club of Santa Barbara. Decker raised $19,249, 
throwing $8,750 of his own money into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the three candidates vying to replace O'Connell in the 35th Assembly 
District, Firestone significantly outpaced Democratic opponents Bob Ream, 27, 
and Mindy Lorenz, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's parents gave a second contribution of $20,000, pushing the 
Republican's total campaign contributions to $95,850. Unlike federal 
candidates, state candidates have no limit on the size of contributions they 
can receive. Entertainer Bob Hope also contributed $1,000 to Firestone's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy," said Brandon Edwards, a Firestone aide. "But we know we 
have to do better because the winner of the Democratic primary will be able to 
tap into money from the Democratic caucus." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the candidate's father, Leonard Firestone, plans to make any further 
contributions, Edwards said simply that "he wants to see Brooks do well and he 
wants to help him. He's very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said former President Gerald Ford will participate in a Firestone 
fund-raiser in Santa Ynez on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Ream reported $32,065 in contributions, including two 
$5,000 contributions each from his mother Melva and the Gold Coast District 
Council of Carpenters PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, Lorenz raised $23,083. But she said she is undeterred. "We're 
exactly where we want to be," she said. "We're just beginning to hit our 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Takasugi's contributions of $23,361 raised the total amount in his 
campaign war chest to $59,333. He received contributions of $1,000 or more from 
the California Restaurant Assn., the California Bankers Assn. and the 
California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi. 71, is seeking reelection in the 37th Assembly District, which 
extends from Oxnard to Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maron has yet to raise any money, Takasugi spokesman Tab Berg said 
the assemblyman will not try to coast to reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never taken anyone lightly," Berg said. "That's why he is successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying she plans to run a strictly grass-roots campaign, Maron accused 
Takasugi of being beholden to big business because of the large amounts of PAC 
money he has received. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berg refuted this, saying, "A lot of organizations have given money 
because Nao has demonstrated that he is committed to restoring business and the 
economy in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance statements were not immediately available for Assemblywoman 
Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills). Her 38th Assembly District covers Simi 
Valley, Fillmore and portions of the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of her two Democratic challengers -- Simi Valley attorney Donald Allan 
Cocquyt, 37, and UCLA student Josh Arce, 18 -- raised the minimum $1,000 
required to file a finance report.

CAMPAIGN TARGETS BID TO EXPAND HOSPITAL; VENTURA: IN A LETTER TO EMPLOYEES, 
ADMINISTRATORS AT PRIVATE COMMUNITY MEMORIAL TRY TO RALLY SUPPORT AGAINST NEW 
WING FOR NEARBY PUBLIC FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After calling for an easing of tensions three weeks ago, a private Ventura 
hospital has enlisted its workers to mount an aggressive grass-roots campaign 
to kill a planned $30-million wing at the county hospital three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at private Community Memorial Hospital have asked employees to 
rally friends and neighbors against renovation and expansion of Ventura County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter mailed to about 800 Community Memorial employees last week also asks 
workers to tell the County Board of Supervisors that the new wing would waste 
taxpayers' money while positioning the county to compete for private patients, 
not just treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 105,000-square-foot wing could siphon off patients from Community 
Memorial and eventually lead to the closing of one of Ventura's two hospitals, 
says a fact sheet mailed to workers by Community's executive director, Michael 
D. Bakst. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the county proceeds with their expansion plans, the supply of beds and 
facilities will increase, and frankly, someone will go out of business," 
according to Bakst's sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Monday that they see errors in Bakst's fact sheet, 
especially a suggestion that the new outpatient wing would provide overnight 
hospital beds. It would not, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also noted what they see as a contradiction between Community Memorial's 
public call for calm discussion between the two hospitals on health care needs 
-- a proposal revealed in newspaper ads -- and the hospital's behind-the-scenes 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly shades the credibility of their public offer to cooperate," 
said Phillipp K. Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the exact opposite of what they offered in their paid advertisement," 
Wessels said. "I think they're trying to protect their own interests. I don't 
think they care about the best needs of the county overall." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials argue that they need to replace a hodgepodge of dilapidated 
clinics and must act now or miss a strong chance at 70% state reimbursement. 
They also maintain that they have no plans to compete for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But county supervisors, who approved the hospital wing in concept in 1993, 
have responded to a spate of new questions on the project by agreeing to clear 
the air at a hearing, tentatively scheduled April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said there are plenty of unanswered questions that supervisors need to 
address. He said his employee letter is a non-issue meant to distract attention 
from whether the county really needs to spend $30 million on a new wing and $8 
million more on a medical center parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "To go off on a tangent about what I wrote to my employees is obscuring the 
real issue, which is the county's own lack of responsiveness to questions that 
we have raised," Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new wing is not needed and is far too costly for its size. A 
Community Memorial expansion three-fourths the size cost only $16.5 million, he 
said. The county's new wing could also weaken the community's health-care 
system by financially undermining Community Memorial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst emphasized that the county has not studied alternatives to the costly 
project, such as leasing space in existing medical buildings or perhaps even at 
Community Hospital. He also challenged Wessels' comments on Bakst's letter to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's none of his business," Bakst said. "I think it's audacious and 
inappropriate for any aspect of county government to try and question me about 
what I communicate with my employees." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, whose district includes Ventura, requested a copy 
of Community Memorial's fact sheet Monday morning, but Bakst said he turned 
down the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I declined," he said. "We are not an arm of county government." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst said he sees nothing inconsistent with rallying his employees while 
calling for the hospitals to jointly hire a nationally known consultant to 
define local health care needs and recommend how they can best be met. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to oppose this building as a waste of taxpayers' money," 
Bakst said. But if the consultant were to find the wing is needed, he said he 
would drop his opposition.

EDUCATORS MOVE TO CURB VIOLENCE AT AREA SCHOOLS; SAFETY: OFFICIALS IN THOUSAND 
OAKS AND SIMI VALLEY TAKE THE STEPS IN THE WAKE OF RECENT ATTACKS, INCLUDING 
THE SLAYING OF A BOY, 14.

<P>
 Seeking to bolster campus security, officials in two east Ventura County 
school districts are taking steps to curb crime in the wake of recent violence 
involving students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, students returning from spring break next week will have an 
anonymous way to turn in peers who break the rules, while in Simi Valley, 
school officials plan to hire more adults to supervise campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs encouraging Thousand Oaks students to "Keep Our Schools Safe" have been 
posted at all Conejo Valley Unified School District campuses, directing 
students to call a national toll-free number with information on brewing 
fights, drug deals or other crimes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot line operators at the nonprofit WeTip program contact police, fire or 
school officials with the information, said Carole Klein, program manager of 
22-year-old WeTip, now used in hundreds of schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It prevents schools from seeing a lot of crime," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley Unified School District, officials Monday began 
interviewing unemployed adults who would be paid through a federal grant to 
supervise hallways and talk to students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be advantageous to have additional paid adults on campus 
helping students improve safety," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts by school officials come after fights involving students from both 
districts ended tragically. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, 14-year-old Chad Hubbard died Feb. 1 from a stabbing after 
school, allegedly by a Valley View Junior High classmate. In Thousand Oaks, a 
fight planned off-campus after school -- two days after the Simi Valley 
incident -- erupted in gunfire that left two Westlake High School students 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley school board member Bill Henry said other school districts have 
had success in intervening in conflict and crime on campus through the WeTip 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will do any harm and it may do some good," he said. 
</P>

 The youth relations assistants to be hired at Simi Valley schools would remain 
through Sept. 30 and have the summer off, Wolford said. The jobs were made 
available as part of a $2.2-million Department of Labor grant to the Ventura 
County Job Training Policy Council, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs will be offered primarily to those who lost employment because of the 
earthquake, said John Absmeier, director of the Simi Valley school district's 
classified personnel. The county agency approached the school district with the 
offer of paid employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope that one assistant at each elementary school, three at 
the junior highs and four at the high schools will help avert trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, these people can be the eyes and the ears for the principal, so if 
anything is brewing, they'll hear it and see it," Absmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because school ends in 11 weeks, Simi Valley officials said they are working 
to fill the jobs as quickly as possible.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRM SETTLES SUIT OVER SALES TACTICS

<P>
 An authorized dealer of AT & T products has agreed to settle a lawsuit that 
claimed its representatives used unfair tactics to sell home-security systems 
to elderly residents in Ventura County and across the state, prosecutors said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250,000 settlement with Glendale-based Ideal Systems Inc. comes four 
weeks after prosecutors reached a similar agreement with AT & T. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors said AT & T knowingly let Ideal salespeople falsely 
identify themselves as employees of the giant telecommunications company.Ideal 
pressured many senior citizens into buying products at inflated prices, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors announced March 1 that AT & T had agreed to settle a civil lawsuit 
by paying $1.25 million. The suit alleged that AT & T knew that Ideal employees 
were falsely identifying themselves and did not halt the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is the largest in the history of the district attorney's 
office, prosecutors said. They also said more than 400 elderly customers 
throughout California, including about 75 in Ventura County, complained of 
being the victims of heavy-handed sales tactics by representatives from Ideal 
and other authorized AT & T dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The average customer spent $5,000 on the equipment, which also included 
medical-alert systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also announced Monday that Garden Grove-based Tri-Ed Inc. -- an AT 
& T distributor -- has agreed to a similar settlement of $25,000. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRE DEPT. PANEL ASKS FOR MORE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delayed by the recent resignation of their chairman, members of a citizens 
committee examining problems in the Ventura County Fire Department say they 
need more time to finish their study. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, set up by the Board of Supervisors after a county audit found waste 
in the department, will ask county officials today to extend its deadline until 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Members said problems arose several weeks ago when chairman Bill Esty quit as 
a sign of support for Fire Chief George Lund. Lund, frustrated over the 
county's decision to exclude the department from Proposition 172 funding, 
announced that he would retire at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It set us back a little," said Simi Valley Councilwoman Sandi Webb, one of a 
dozen people serving on the committee. "You wind up spending a lot of time 
discussing that kind of stuff instead of the other issues." Webb said she 
believed that the group, which has been meeting twice a month, could conclude 
its work in a few more sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors established the committee in October after the 
auditor-controller's office concluded that the department was top-heavy with 
managers, spent too much on overtime and was lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members had originally picked two dozen people representing every area 
of the county to serve on the committee. So far, only half have participated in 
the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors asked the group to identify ways to make the department more 
efficient and report back with their findings by April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county officials say they are considering hiring a consultant to 
help find a replacement for Lund, who retires Thursday. In the meantime, Robert 
Holaway, deputy fire chief, is in line to serve as interim chief, officials 
said. TINA DAUNT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FAMILY WILL RESTORE LOCAL MEETING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime Ojai family has agreed to do what the city could never afford: 
restore a century old, one-room house that for generations has served as a 
local meeting room for Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Janice Prairie, whose community roots go back five generations, 
received permission from the Ojai City Council last week to purchase the "Girl 
Scout House," a wooden bungalow at 301 Lion St. 
</P>
<P>
 "In private ownership, we can afford the building an opportunity to survive a 
few more years," said Dennis Prairie, who spent the past year negotiating the 
purchase from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically going to be a little busy work project for my wife and me to 
see if we can bring a little life back to it."  
</P>
<P>
 The Prairies, who both work for the U. S. Postal Service, live next door to 
the Girl Scout House. The building, which has a leaky roof and electrical 
problems, was built by the Thacher family and served as the town library for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to sit in the middle of the Arcade," Dennis Prairie said. "Then when 
they got a new library, they moved it to Montgomery Street, and later it was 
relocated to where it is now." Until the mid-1980s, the structure was used as a 
meeting place for local Girl Scouts.  
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was there as a Girl Scout, and her mother also used the facility as a 
little girl," said Prairie, who agreed to buy the house and lot for $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council approved the purchase agreement with little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Steve Olsen said he hopes to once again offer the house to community 
organizations for use as a town hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we'll make it available to some of these small civic groups that 
need a place to meet," he said. "It would be a nice place to have some meetings 
for organizations that can't afford other facilities." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE MONEY FROM PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manzanita School students will soon enjoy repaved basketball courts and 
Sequoia Intermediate athletes will play on spruced-up baseball diamonds under 
an agreement to funnel Thousand Oaks redevelopment funds to both schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council has added both Manzanita and Sequoia to a list 
of three other schools that receive money from a Newbury Park redevelopment 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the schools divvy up about $50,000 from the Redevelopment Agency, 
which collects money for local improvement projects through property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Past projects have included re-roofing the gym and adding two basketball 
courts at Redwood Intermediate School, and painting wood trim on several 
schools, said Sarah Hart, assistant superintendent for the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't big-ticket items, but they're extra projects that there's no 
(other) funding for," Hart said. "Each year, we go through and pick a project 
here, a project there." 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for redevelopment money, a school must demonstrate that 5% of 
its students come from the redevelopment project area, which encompasses an 
irregularly shaped region around Newbury Road extending from the Borchard Road 
exit of the Ventura Freeway to Haigh Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is studying whether Newbury Park High School and Walnut School 
meet the 5% guideline and may be eligible for redevelopment funds. STEPHANIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL BACKS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday backed a six-year, $117-million list of 
capital improvement projects that includes a new sewage treatment plant, water 
wells and a bike path between Ventura and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously adopted the city's capital improvement program, which 
sets forth 111 projects that would improve or maintain the city's roads, water 
and sewer system, and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the council vote, three residents came forward during a public hearing 
to urge the council not to siphon off any of the $3.8 million set aside for a 
proposed public swimming pool. Council members reassured them that they were 
not considering such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, council members gave tentative approval to the list with 
little discussion. A final vote on the program is scheduled in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Among improvements included in the program are sewage and sanitation projects 
totaling about $28.5 million and the new treatment plant, estimated to cost 
$8.9 million. About $6.1 million would go toward improvements to the city's 
parks and other recreation facilities, including $1.8 million to construct a 
5.5-mile-long Ventura River bike trail, $1.7 million for future park projects 
and $495,000 for replacing playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $117 million to fund the projects comes from several sources, including 
sales, property and gas taxes, developer contributions, and sewer and water 
fees. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; 18-YEAR-OLD TO BE ARRAIGNED IN SLAYING 
</P>

<P>
 An 18-year-old Port Hueneme man is scheduled to be arraigned today in 
connection with a gang-related gunfight Sunday afternoon that left a 
15-year-old boy dead, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Perez and a 15-year-old Oxnard boy were arrested minutes after Cesar 
Rueney Mata was fatally wounded in front of the Tradewinds Market on North 
Ventura Road in Port Hueneme, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was shot in the groin during the gunfight and treated at Ventura County 
Medical Center. He was later transferred to the infirmary at the Ventura County 
Jail and was being held Monday in lieu of $250,000 bail, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court at 1:30 p.m. 
today for arraignment. The 15-year-old, whose name was not released because of 
his age, was being held in Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Sgt. Jerry Beck said investigators are still searching for 
witnesses to the 4:15 p.m. incident. He said about 30 to 40 people were milling 
about the busy market, which is across the street from a park, when the 
shooting occurred. "We know there were a lot of people that saw this and for 
whatever reason didn't want to come up to the police," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the shooting apparently erupted when three members of a gang 
confronted two members of a rival gang. Witnesses said they did not hear an 
argument or gang slogans being shouted before shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said the three confronted the two, pulled out a gun and started 
shooting. Then the other group pulled out a gun and fired back," Beck said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; 7 WOMEN TO BE HONORED TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Paula will honor seven of its most prominent women tonight in the city's 
first women's history night celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's second oldest city will celebrate the achievements of Eleanor 
Crouch, Santa Paula's first woman mayor; Gwen Dewey, an aviator; Celia Diaz, a 
local businesswoman; Angela Dominguez, a longtime activist for the 
Mexican-American community; Dorothy Pinkerton, former principal at Glen City 
School; Dorcas Thille, a rancher, and Grace Sharp Thille, Santa Paula's first 
woman doctor who died in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers say the dinner and ceremony at the Masonic Temple in Santa 
Paula will not only highlight the women's achievements, but give girls in the 
community something to which they can aspire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two daughters and I'd like for them to see that women are doing things 
and are being honored for the extraordinary things they are doing," said 
Wanette Jauregui, a Santa Paula Elementary School District board member and one 
of the event organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jauregui said she and fellow school board member Janet Grant had talked about 
holding such an event for the past few years, but never got around to 
organizing it until last month. They rushed to hold the celebration in March 
because it is Women's History Month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $15 per person, with all proceeds 
going to support Santa Paula High School Grad Nite '94. For information, call 
Grant at 525-4968 or Jauregui at 525-4527. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; EMERGENCY TRAINING PROGRAM CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley city officials will consider adopting a program to train residents 
to assist each other during disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neighborhood Emergency Response program, proposed by resident Tim Hodge, 
would tap into neighborhood associations and crime-watch groups, offering free 
training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, search-and-rescue and other 
emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people's homes are destroyed and damaged, they might not be able to take 
care of all their needs individually," said Hodge, who is considering running 
for the City Council in November. "This program would make it easier for them 
to get help because people would know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodge said county firefighters have agreed to provide training in CPR and 
other emergency responses free. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton praised the plan and asked city staff to prepare a report 
for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this can only help when there's an earthquake or other type of 
disaster," Stratton said. "It sounds like a great idea."

HOPES FOR CLEANUP BOAT RUN AGROUND; OIL: ALL THAT SEPARATES A SIMI VALLEY 
INVENTOR AND HIS DREAM OF A NEW, LESS COSTLY WAY TO MOP UP SPILLS IS MONEY FOR 
PROTOTYPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident John Bartha knew that there had to be a better way to 
separate oil from water after reading about the painstakingly difficult and 
expensive way crews tried to mop up the enormous oil spill caused by the Exxon 
Valdez in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hopeless on the Exxon spill that my cousin and I came up with a 
way," said Bartha, a Hungarian-born engineer. "We said, 'There has to be 
something better than broomsticks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to find a more effective cleanup method led Bartha to theorize that 
the molecular similarities between oil and hot wax would cause the two 
substances to bond together and then make for easy removal after the wax had 
solidified in cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started experimenting and every time it was like, 'It works, it works, 
there must be something wrong,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time and repeated testing, Bartha came to terms with the potential of his 
idea -- both personal and financial -- and designed a $10-million, 
self-sufficient, seagoing vessel containing all the equipment necessary to mop 
up spills for about $385 a gallon. He says that is a cost dramatically less 
than the roughly $20,000 a gallon spent using existing technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was the last bright spot for Bartha. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since developing his patented process, the first-time inventor 
has sent hundreds of letters to government officials and private companies in a 
bid to raise enough money to build the prototype vessel. He has yet to raise a 
dime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to sell the idea to the government and the public and 
gotten nowhere fast," he said. "I'm just saying, 'Here's a solution for a 
billion-dollar headache, take it.' They all like it. They all say it's 
interesting technology, but no money." 
</P>
<P>
 He has written to Vice President Al Gore, California Gov. Pete Wilson, U. S. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the U. S. Coast Guard, and myriad other public 
and private officials and groups in search of funding -- all to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 An April 14 letter from Gore in response to Bartha's proposal is typical of 
the reactions he gets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate being informed in this way," Gore wrote. "The information you 
provided certainly appears to contain ideas that merit careful attention. I 
will retain this material for future consideration as the President and I work 
on related policies and programs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bartha considers such letters nothing more than a one-page brush-off. "They're 
patting me on the shoulder; that's all there is to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Onstad, general manager for the Marine Spill Response Corp.'s Southwest 
region, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to find any support writing governors and congressmen; that's 
futile," Onstad said. "They'll be polite, but in all the years I've been in 
this business, I've never seen any new product given any advantage because of 
political pressure. What he has to do is get inside the spill response 
community, write papers for the oil spill conferences and things of that 
nature, and create interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartha said he has tried to do just that. But he said he has come across great 
reluctance on the part of some officials to review his written proposal. And 
without a working prototype, few are willing to even consider his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Onstad said that, chemically, the process will work, but that 
whether Bartha can actually use it to clean up an oil spill remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to look at the whole system, not just the idea of spraying hot wax on 
oil," Onstad said. "What's the concept, and has he really done anything in 
terms of containing and cleaning up oil spills? What he has done is change the 
form of the oil from a liquid to a solid. Then what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Onstad also said the bulk of the limited dollars available for research and 
development on oil spill cleanup is usually routed toward improving the tools 
used in existing technology, not taking a chance on a new, theoretical 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartha has also failed to win any financial support from another potential 
source, the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hiltabrand, a senior environmental scientist for the Coast Guard, said 
Bartha's idea has merit, but is unlikely to be taken seriously until Bartha 
finds some way to build his $10-million prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the concept will work; we have no problem with that," Hiltabrand 
said. "But we need to see something more than words on a paper. We need a 
prototype demonstration before we would start looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch so far has been in raising the capital necessary to make that 
possible, and even Hiltabrand sympathized with the limited availability of 
public research money in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the inventor and Hiltabrand agree that the financing needed to build the 
first boat will most likely come from private enterprise, such as investors 
willing to take a chance on the strength of an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to get some movie stars to go in with him on this or something," 
Hiltabrand said. "The concept will work, but he's got to get the funds to build 
the boat, and that's not going to be easy to do."' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another critical question is whether Bartha can reproduce results achieved in 
a small back-yard pool in the rolling, unpredictable ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may not be able to pick it up," Hiltabrand said of oil on the open ocean. 
"What I would want to see is this thing working out at sea. If he could 
demonstrate it in something other than a swimming pool, build a small boat, we 
would probably send a representative to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartha said he is sure that his patented technology works. He just wishes that 
he could find someone with money who shares that vision. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his choice of vessel, a 125-foot, catamaran-type boat, is inherently 
stable and will allow the oil to be sprayed with wax and collected between the 
hulls even in choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just something I fantasized about," Bartha said. "These are very 
stable surface boats. . . . I'm not redesigning the wheel. I'm just putting in 
a system that will do my wax." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his system, hot wax would be sprayed on the oil between the hulls; both 
substances would solidify together in seconds, and a separator would filter out 
the oil and reuse the wax over and over again, while the oil is bagged for easy 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartha said that one of his boats could remove 140,000 gallons of oil in 24 
hours, and that only three such boats would have cleaned up the Valdez spill in 
about a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for him, Bartha's calculations have remained merely theoretical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite frustrating that an idea like this, simple, very straightforward 
and something that's needed, is not taking place, or at least takes so much 
time," Bartha said. "People who are friendly say, 'Well, Graham Bell -- it took 
him two years to get his phone working and today we can't do without it.' "

HELP MAKE A DENT IN KITTEN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here we are, almost knee-deep in another kitten season. More than half the 
calls we get at Adopt A Pet (a canine rescue group) are cat-related during the 
kitten season. Why don't people realize there is a simple solution to the 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Who does it hurt when you don't spray or neuter your cat? Me! It hurts me 
when, after the 40th call of the day, trying to give the best advice I can to 
people who have unwanted kittens, I answer the phone to someone who angrily 
accuses me of not caring, wanting to know what I think I'm being paid for (I'm 
a volunteer). 
</P>
<P>
 Who does it hurt? Neighbors who find litters of kittens deposited on their 
front doorstep or abandoned under their house and are now forced to make a 
decision that the irresponsible owner couldn't make. Since there are 45 cats 
born for each person in the United States, there are not enough homes 
available. So this kind soul has sleepless nights, while the irresponsible 
owner sleeps peacefully in the erroneous belief that the kittens will have 
found good homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Who does it hurt? The public pocketbook. For every 11 cats that get into the 
pound, only one makes it out alive. An estimated $35 is spent to handle each 
animal in the pound, including overhead, housing, feeding and lethal injection. 
By taking advantage of spay/neuter assistance, your cat's surgery can cost half 
that price. Since Ventura County animal control euthanized an estimated 5,356 
cats last year, this means $187,460 was spent just to kill cats. Is this 
acceptable to you? 
</P>
<P>
 Who does it hurt the most? The 3-day-old kitten who dies slowly of starvation 
under a bush. The cats that become coyote food in our hillsides. The cats given 
away in front of supermarkets to "good homes" but are abandoned shortly after. 
The cats that suffer for hours after being hit by cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Please save this letter and show it to a neighbor or friend who is harboring 
an unaltered cat. Help make a difference before the next kitten season arrives.

RESPECT WILDLIFE

 This letter concerns the article "The Fur Flies" on March 16.Kathleen Adams 
has lived on Silver Spur Court for 13 years. Her neighbors, except for the 
Hecht family, support her efforts to care for the squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hechts should be the ones to move out of the neighborhood, not Mrs. Adams. 
She should be able to live there and care for the squirrels in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 We must respect the wildlife, especially when neighborhoods have encroached on 
their territory.

RV RESORT PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a business owner for more than 30 years. I am an RV owner and 
advocate. It occurs to me that the city of Port Hueneme should consider buying 
the Hubbard RV resort in Ventura.This may be the perfect opportunity and 
solution for our county. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1, it's built and permitted. We can buy it for pennies on the dollar and 
save Port Hueneme $4 million and restore local property values, netting more 
property tax for our city. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, it's smack dab on U. S. 101 -- a proven Mecca for tourists. How many 
people do you know outside Ventura County who have ever heard of Port Hueneme? 
</P>
<P>
 And, it's by the beach. The fragile marine environment at Hueneme and Ormond 
Beach would not be sacrificed. Also, it's not next to odor- and noise-producing 
facilities, nor beachfront residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hueneme's purchase of the Hubbard RV park would save Ventura's 
taxpayers money because they won't have to subsidize it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a win-win proposition for Ventura's taxpayers, Port Hueneme's RV 
advocates and opponents.

HELICOPTER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read about Sheriff Larry Carpenter's suspension of Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department helicopter pilot Chris Spangenberg. Chris' dedication to helping 
others has been demonstrated both in his service to his country flying 
dangerous rescue missions in Vietnam and in search-and-rescue missions for 
Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easier for Chris to have used his vast flying experience to 
land himself a high-paying corporate job -- that's what most of us would do. 
Instead, he has put himself at risk by flying in the worst weather (high winds, 
rain, firestorms and low clouds) to rescue those of us who get lost in the 
mountains, become the victims of a car or plane crash, or get trapped by 
swollen rivers or fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, accidents occur for one reason or another. It's easy to Monday 
morning quarterback the reason why fire engulfed the sheriff's Bell Long Ranger 
helicopter while Chris Spangenberg was on duty. I am quite willing to wait for 
the National Transportation Safety Board to rule on the cause of the accident. 
If the board finds gross error on his part, that's one thing. But if it was one 
of life's unpredictable accidents, then I call on Sheriff Carpenter to put 
Chris Spangenberg back into the Ventura County sheriff's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 People who put others first, risking their own safety, are hard to find. They 
are the heroes among us.

RESPECTED CITY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why can't you write something nice about someone without feeling the need to 
denigrate them in some way? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of your article on Ventura City Clerk Barbara Kam (March 14) portrays a 
hard-working city official who does an excellent job and is well-respected by 
all.Why did you feel the need to publish the comments of one person who has a 
political ax to grind? 
</P>
<P>
 If there were more people in government like Barbara Kam, you would have far 
less to write about. She has always viewed the citizen as a customer who merits 
the highest degree of respect and service. She had this view long before it 
became fashionable to refer to the taxpayers in such terms.

BARGAIN IN METROLINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best bargain in Ventura County is Metrolink. All aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Borh noted in an article he wrote that "each time your car's odometer 
rolls over another mile, it costs you 38.7 cents -- assuming you drive an 
American-made sedan about 15,000 miles a year." 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred-mile commute adds up to show what a great bargain Metrolink truly 
is. It's also a great way to fight the traffic.

 John F. Walker Jr., managing partner of the prestigious Los Angeles law firm, 
Latham & Watkins, said he will step down by the end of the year and resume 
practice. Walker's decision, announced last week at a firm retreat, came as a 
surprise to many of the firm's partners.He assumed the position in October, 
1987, shepherding the firm through substantial changes in the legal profession 
and at the firm itself. . . . Teamsters members, by a 3-1 margin, turned down 
the 25% hike that had been proposed by their president to save the union's 
nearly bankrupt strike fund, a spokesman said. The vote casts a shadow over the 
future of the struggling union, whose membership is steadily declining. . . . 
Kemper Corp. said it urged its shareholders to reject General Electrics 
proposed $2.2-billion takeover, but did not rule out a merger at a price 
higher. . . . Trans World Airlines said it hired Reno Air's chief executive, 
Jeffrey Erickson, to be the carrier's new president and chief operating 
officer. . . . A consortium led by GTE Corp. signed the first of an expected 
two-part agreement with the government of Argentina to provide cellular 
telephone service in the interior of the country.

 T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.50%, down from 3.61% last 
week. Another $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.85%, down from 3.90%.The three-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they sold for 3.40% on Feb. 28. The six-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they averaged 3.75% on March 7. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors -- 3.58% for three-month bills with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,911.50 and 3.98% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,805.40. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction:

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: PERFORMING A PHYSICAL ON YOUR FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now is an ideal time to take the pulse of your business. This quick checkup is 
designed to help small-business owners figure out where they are and where 
they're headed for the rest of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 You're in a good position to look ahead, because you've spent time and money 
looking back to prepare your 1993 tax return. With your financial picture fresh 
in your mind, take a few minutes to consider other key aspects of your 
company's health. 
</P>
<P>
 This checkup is divided into three sections. The first section is for business 
owners or managers to complete. The second section includes questions for your 
banker, accountant and insurance agent. The third part includes questions to 
share with your employees. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no right or wrong answers, your responses will help determine 
the strengths and weaknesses of your particular business and pinpoint areas 
where action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete Part One, all you need is a quiet place to work, preferably 
without interruptions from telephone calls, pagers or fax machines. You'll also 
need a blank, lined note pad and a pen or pencil. Don't labor over the answers; 
the first thought that comes to mind is usually the most truthful. Part 1 
</P>
<P>
 Ask yourself: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Is my business doing better or worse financially than it was at this time 
last year? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Have we gained any new clients or customers in the last three months? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Have we lost any clients or customers in the last three months? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Have we hired, fired or laid off any employees in the last three months? 
</P>
<P>
 5. When was the last time anyone on my staff met with our major clients or 
customers? 
</P>
<P>
 6. When was the last time we called on any prospective clients or customers? 
</P>
<P>
 7. What would happen to my business if our major client or customer went 
bankrupt, died or took his or her business elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 8. Do we have any new products or services to offer? 
</P>
<P>
 9. Do customers owe us more than $1,000? $5,000? $10,000? 
</P>
<P>
 10. What are we doing to collect the money we're owed? 
</P>
<P>
 11. What have we done recently to attract attention to our business? Have we 
advertised? Sent out a newsletter? Hosted a charity event? Part 2 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some questions to ask your banker: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Do you have any new products or services to help my business run more 
smoothly? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Can I increase my commercial credit line? 
</P>
<P>
 3. If I need one, what can I do to obtain a commercial credit line? 
</P>
<P>
 4. How can the money I have on deposit in your bank work harder for me? 
</P>
<P>
 To ask your accountant: 
</P>
<P>
 1. What new tax strategies can we work on for 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Can I take advantage of the increased office equipment deduction? (It 
increased from $10,000 to $17,500.) 
</P>
<P>
 3. If we're not already using a computerized bookkeeping system, what software 
do you recommend for my business? Can someone at your firm help select the 
software, install it and train my employees to use it? 
</P>
<P>
 4. What can I do to minimize my state and federal taxes this year? 
</P>
<P>
 To ask your insurance agent: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Are my business and inventory adequately covered against fire, thefts and 
natural disasters? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Should I purchase a business interruption policy? 
</P>
<P>
 3. What kind of personal disability policy is best for me? 
</P>
<P>
 4. How much life insurance do I have? Should I buy more? 
</P>
<P>
 5. If I rely heavily on a top manager, should I purchase a 'key person' 
insurance policy to cover him or her? 
</P>
<P>
 6. What can we do to reduce our workers' compensation insurance premiums? 
</P>
<P>
 7. Are my business vehicles adequately covered? Can we reduce the coverage on 
older vehicles or ones that never leave the property? Part 3 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the answers and responses you've collected from yourself and your key 
advisers, it's time to sit down with your employees. If possible, get away from 
your business for a few hours. Reserve a room at a local restaurant. Find a 
picnic table in a nearby park or reserve a room in a club or recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't get away, hire a temporary worker to answer the telephones for a 
few hours. If your business is too big to close down for a few hours, create a 
committee of representatives from every department to participate in this quick 
checkup. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by asking everyone what could be done to make their particular jobs 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could help them do their jobs better? 
</P>
<P>
 What kinds of office equipment, computers or communications equipment are 
needed to boost productivity? 
</P>
<P>
 What's going wrong that we can fix right away? 
</P>
<P>
 Put together a few short- and long-term goals. Short-term ones can be as 
simple as cleaning up the office, painting the lunchroom or beginning a simple 
office recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term goals might be landing a new client or customer, renegotiating the 
prices paid for major supplies, setting up a new training program or moving 
into a new space. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your employees to tell you what your customers are saying about your 
business. Remember, your employees are on the front lines every day and often 
have the best solutions to your toughest business problems. 
</P>
<P>

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SLUGGERS IN THE GAME OF LEGAL HARDBALL

 When companies tied to the Rev. Pat Robertson and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon did 
battle over the Nostalgia Network last year, neither got what they wanted. 
Robertson's International Family Entertainment lost its $40-million bid to 
expand its media empire, while Moon's Concept Communications subsequently saw 
Nostalgia dropped by a key New York cable provider. 
</P>
<P>
 The fates were kinder to Tiger Communications Co., a small investor group led 
by Los Angeles lawyer Terry Christensen. Eighteen months after purchasing 27% 
of Nostalgia's shares, Tiger pulled out in time to make a tidy $4.5-million 
profit on its $7-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought a stake in Nostalgia to take it into strategic alliances," says 
Christensen, whose group initially backed Robertson in the battle. "By the time 
it was over we said, 'To hell with it' and sold it to the surviving bickerer." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of unfettered aggressiveness has won Christensen's law firm clients 
ranging from MGM Grand owner Kirk Kerkorian and Capital Cities/ABC to the city 
of Los Angeles, which is using Christensen, White, Miller, Fink & Jacobs as 
co-counsel in the Rodney King case. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation is the group's forte. It was Christensen, White partner Patricia L. 
Glaser who won a staggering $8.9-million court judgment -- later reduced to 
$7.4 million -- against actress Kim Basinger last year for backing out of 
"Boxing Helena." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen and Glaser have since turned their attention to the legal 
free-for-all that pits former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer owner Kerkorian against its 
current owner, Credit Lyonnais. 
</P>
<P>
 The French bank claims Kerkorian misrepresented the studio's financial 
well-being when Giancarlo Parretti bought it for $1.3 billion in 1990. Credit 
Lyonnais subsequently seized the studio, which it must sell by 1997, when 
Parretti defaulted on his loan. Kerkorian has countersued, claiming an array of 
illegal activities by the bank. The case, set for a June trial in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, is something of a personal crusade for Christensen and Glaser, 
who feel personally indebted to Kerkorian for launching their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, 53, has served as Kerkorian's personal attorney for two decades 
and ran his Tracinda Corp. from 1986 to 1988. Christensen, White was formed out 
of a feud that developed when Christensen tried to return from Tracinda to his 
old firm, Wyman, Bautzer. 
</P>
<P>
 From a base of 12 lawyers, the firm now numbers 70 and brought in $30 million 
gross revenue last year. Entertainment accounts for only 25% of its business 
but tends to generate the most heat. Christensen, White helped secure a 
lucrative CBS deal for "Murphy Brown" producers Diane English and Joel 
Shukovsky. Other entertainment clients include Paramount Pictures, Sony 
Pictures, Warner Bros. Records, Island World, Richard Pryor and David Permut 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very good at what they do in all areas of law, though obviously 
litigation is one of their strengths," says Permut. "There's not a lawyer in 
town who's as tenacious as Patty (Glaser)." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, White doesn't always come out on top. It represented Kerkorian 
and his Tracinda Corp. in 1990, when they paid a $30-million settlement to MGM 
shareholders who claimed they were shortchanged on the value of their stock. In 
typical Christensen, White fashion, however, the firm went with a vengeance 
after insurers who balked at paying the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the money that our client advanced, shall we say, we got back," 
Christensen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, White also represented producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber in 
their legally protracted move from Warner Bros. to Sony Pictures Entertainment 
in 1989. Peters says he was so impressed with Christensen that he lobbied to 
have him named chief operating officer at Sony, a job that went to Alan J. 
Levine. "He's a very, very, very smart guy," Peters says. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart and ruthless, say critics who decry Christensen, White's viperish 
devotion to victory. They've been called greedy and mean-spirited. Basinger, in 
particular, became so flustered during cross-examination by Glaser that she 
repeatedly referred to her as "Ms. Glacier." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christensen says popularity within the legal community is not a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard it all before," he says. "We are tough and we can be, I guess, 
ruthless. But it's always within the bounds of honesty, and I think that's why 
courts respect us." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, White also benefits from close ties to city government. The firm 
was a major supporter of Mayor Richard Riordan's campaign. After his victory, 
Christensen was asked to head a task force on automating and upgrading 
procedures at the city attorney's office. The group's report, which includes 
cost-cutting recommendations, will be made soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Christensen continues to seek out more lucrative opportunities for 
himself and his investment partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say we're very entrepreneurial," he says with a smile.

 INTERMISSION TIME: Move over Ginzu knives, diet fads and exercise equipment -- 
the Mighty Ducks have become the first professional sports team to join the 
home shopping fray. . . . Between periods of two recent televised games, the 
team revealed "The Mighty Ducks Home Shopping Network," directly selling pucks 
and autographed hockey sticks commemorating the team's inaugural season. Prices 
ranged from $20 to $350. Says Ducks spokesman Bill Robertson: "We think this is 
a good way to highlight what inaugural season collectibles are available."

 LESS GREEN: A brighter season for the California Angels? One thing that won't 
be brighter: The grass. . . . Anaheim Stadium manager Greg Smith says the new 
grass -- Tifway II instead of Santa Ana Bermuda -- will be great, but not as 
deep a green in color. Says Smith: "Normally this is our big stress time 
wondering if it's going to take root. But it's going crazy. It's wonderful."

 REASON TO WALK: College presidents are supposed to do community things, like 
support local walkathons. But Philip Westin, president of Golden West College, 
has a special reason to challenge other colleges to support the April 23 March 
of Dimes Walk America event in Orange County. . . . Westin was a victim of 
polio at age 5 and recovered. The March of Dimes paid all his medical bills. 
"The only reason I'm walking today is because of the March of Dimes," Westin 
says.

 FAMILY FEUD? Claire and Anthony Maglica may not be household names, but the 
Court TV cable network finds their courtroom feud in Santa Ana, scheduled to go 
all week, intriguing enough for live coverage. The Anaheim Hills couple lived 
together 23 years, were never married. Now that they've split, Claire is suing. 
. . . She contends she's entitled to a good share of a reported $300-million 
flashlight business he's built. . . . Cable systems in Orange County do not run 
Court TV, but it's available to anyone with a satellite dish.

THE TWO FACES OF AN ACCUSED ASSASSIN; VIOLENCE: MEXICAN OFFICIALS CALL MARIO 
ABURTO MARTINEZ A KILLER. BUT HIS FATHER, WHO WORKS IN SAN PEDRO, SAYS: 'MY SON 
IS INNOCENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To Mexican authorities, Mario Aburto Martinez is a coldblooded killer: an 
apparent fanatic, possibly deranged, who may have schemed about shooting Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the front-runner for the Mexican presidency, before 
assassinating the candidate in a Tijuana neighborhood last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But to friends and relatives in San Pedro, the tough harbor neighborhood where 
Aburto lived intermittently in recent years, the suspect is someone else: a 
hard-working, serious and intelligent young man who seems an unlikely candidate 
to be Mexico's most notorious assassin since the post-revolutionary period more 
than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although offering no proof, relatives and others who know Aburto said in 
interviews Monday that Mexican authorities are using the 23-year-old suspect as 
a fall guy -- an allegation that has been heatedly denied by officials in 
Mexico, where such conspiracy theories are also gaining currency. Relatives 
speculate that conspirators may have manipulated Aburto to go to the scene and 
become an unwilling participant in a broader plot -- perhaps after threatening 
to harm family members in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is innocent," said a distraught Ruben Aburto, 47, father of the 
accused assassin, during an interview Monday at a San Pedro automobile repair 
shop owned by a relative. "I feel that there are others involved in this who 
are really responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mexican authorities said that a security guard may have aided the 
gunman, giving added credence to theories that Colosio's death may have 
resulted from a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's father and a brother, Rafael Aburto, agreed to be interviewed 
Monday in what they characterized as an effort to counter a smear campaign. No 
relatives have been able to speak with the suspect since his arrest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to unmask what the government is doing to my son," said the father, a 
furniture factory employee who says he has been unable to work or think 
straight since his son's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to news reports and official allegations in Mexico, relatives said 
the suspect had no interest in politics, knew nothing about guns, and was a 
member of no grass-roots organizations, religious groups or Los Angeles-based 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother would settle something with words, not with arms," said Rafael 
Aburto, 24, the eldest of the six Aburto siblings.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Aburto insane, relatives say. "He has always been very smart and very 
responsible," Ruben Aburto said of his son, who, he said, saved his earnings 
and helped support his family in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mexican officials, Mario Aburto Martinez has confessed to 
shooting Colosio -- the presidential candidate of Mexico's long-governing 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI -- during a campaign stop in 
Tijuana last Wednesday. Aburto told interrogators that he intended to wound the 
candidate in a twisted effort to draw attention to his pacifist views. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, polls have shown that most people doubt that Aburto acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Mexican law enforcement authorities have painted an 
increasingly bizarre portrait of Aburto, depicting him as a misguided zealot 
who may have considered assassinating President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
during his 1988 electoral campaign. Reportedly, Aburto's possessions include a 
notebook containing a drawing showing Aburto's spirit entering the body of 
Colosio, who was headed to almost certain victory in the Aug. 21 presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Pedro, those who knew Aburto dispute the emerging portrait of a 
disturbed young man who purchased a revolver in recent weeks and went to a 
firing range to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is a peaceful boy and a good worker," said the accused killer's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed remorse to Colosio's family and said he last saw his son two 
weeks ago in Tijuana, where Mario had built a home with earnings gained during 
a yearlong stint as a furniture worker in Torrance during 1989-90 and 
subsequent employment in Tijuana factories. He seemed normal then, the father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for politics, Aburto's kin said it is absurd to cast him as some kind of 
activist or pacifist. They professed no knowledge of the suspect's supposed 
writings on pacifism. However, Aburto did reportedly attempt to publish some of 
his tracts in Spanish-language publications in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, relatives described Aburto as a young man who worked hard, enjoyed 
female companionship, liked to dance and occasionally had a few beers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto was a native of La Riconada, a village that is part of the municipality 
of Zamora in Mexico's central Michoacan state. He is one of six offspring of 
Ruben Aburto and Maria Luisa Martinez. The family moved to Tijuana when Aburto 
was about 15, relatives said, a northward exodus common among Mexican families. 
The father has worked intermittently in the United States since the early 
1970s, initially finding employment in the tuna canneries of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Aburto returned to Tijuana from San Pedro in 1990, relatives said. He 
visited San Pedro on occasion since then. 
</P>
<P>
 For the accused assassin's father, who shares a cramped one-bedroom flat in a 
run-down housing complex with another Mexican family, word of his son's arrest 
came as he was preparing dinner Wednesday. The father said he watched the news 
of Colosio's assassination on television, and then gasped in horror as he 
recognized his son being pummeled by security guards and others who grabbed him 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was such a shock for me, I wanted to die," the father said Monday 
evening. "I almost fainted. I recognized my son, but I couldn't hardly believe 
that it was him." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the family has been in crisis. Mexican police detained his wife 
and three youngest children in Tijuana. He contends that they were tortured and 
otherwise mistreated -- allegations denied by Mexican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he, Rafael, and another son, Ruben Jr. 21 -- all of whom live in 
San Pedro -- say they are afraid to go back to Mexico or speak to Mexican 
consular authorities in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials have hinted that the father is wanted on a murder charge 
from more than 20 years ago in Michoacan -- a charge the father contends has 
been dismissed.

ACLU SAYS 83% OF POLICE LIVE OUTSIDE L.A.; LAPD: STUDY IS FIRST OF ITS KIND. IT 
SAYS THE RESULTS SUPPORT CONTENTION THAT OFFICERS HAVE LITTLE CONNECTION TO 
AREAS THEY SERVE. POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE DISPUTES THAT CONCLUSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union, in a report scheduled for release today, 
has concluded that 83.1% of Los Angeles police officers live outside the city 
limits, a finding that department critics say bolsters the longstanding 
characterization of the LAPD as an occupying army whose officers have little 
connection to the communities they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades, the Los Angeles Police Department has been criticized by 
mainstream police administrators, LAPD officials, the public and political 
activists as an army of occupation, comprised mostly of white suburbanites, 
whose members have little stake in Los Angeles," the ACLU report states. "It 
has long been assumed that a majority of LAPD officers do not reside in the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU of Southern California study is the first to comprehensively examine 
that assumption. Its conclusions are contained in a 33-page report entitled 
"From the Outside In," scheduled for release at a news conference today. The 
report was compiled using data provided by the Police Department, which last 
year gave the ACLU a computer printout of the ZIP codes of all 7,658 LAPD 
officers. Names and street addresses were not included. 
</P>
<P>
 The report raises questions about the LAPD's attempts to develop a more 
community-oriented style of policing when so many of its officers live outside 
the city. It makes a number of recommendations for encouraging officers to 
relocate within Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to concluding that the vast majority of police officers live 
outside Los Angeles, the ACLU study found that the communities in which large 
numbers of officers live are predominantly white and suburban. A total of 293 
LAPD officers live in Simi Valley, while fewer than 200 live in the area 
covered by the department's Central Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The racial and ethnic diversity in which officers and their families reside, 
socialize and go about their personal routines generally bear little 
resemblance to the city the officers police," the report states. Although 
police officers and department officials generally attribute the residential 
patterns to officers searching for affordable housing, the ACLU report 
questions that conclusion, noting that a number of Los Angeles neighborhoods 
have cheaper housing prices than the communities in which many LAPD officers 
reside. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU findings are accompanied by a number of recommendations, including 
proposals for salary incentives, rental subsidies and low- and no-interest 
mortgage loans to lure officers into living in the city. The report does not 
call for a residency requirement, which is used by many metropolitan 
governments across the country but is barred in California by a 1974 amendment 
to the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular note is a Columbia, S.C., program that gives officers 
low-interest housing loans if they agree to live in low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods. That program, which the ACLU recommends that Los Angeles 
consider emulating, gives police officers affordable places to live and at the 
same time is intended to strengthen ties between officers and the communities 
they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garfield, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, 
bristled at the suggestion that LAPD officers do not have strong ties to the 
city they are sworn to protect and serve. But Garfield said the league, which 
represents rank-and-file police officers, would support incentives to encourage 
city residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league is in favor of low-interest loans to help police officers live in 
the city," Garfield said. "A lot of officers have asked about these types of 
programs and would like to be a part of them." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the council's Public Safety 
Committee, greeted the findings cautiously, saying that "in the best of all 
possible worlds, it would be wonderful to have all officers live within the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 But budget shortfalls have made funding for the department scarce, and Chick 
said she did not consider new programs for encouraging residency a high 
priority compared to other pressing department concerns. "On a list of my top 
20 items, this is way down for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Stephen Yagman, a lawyer and vocal critic of the LAPD, said 
officers should be required to live in the city. "The ACLU statistics support 
the opinion that I've long held, that the LAPD is an occupying force," Yagman 
said. "They are significantly alienated from the city, and the services they 
provide are not consumer friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the ACLU compares Los Angeles to other major cities and 
concludes that many other governments have far higher percentages of police 
officers living within the city limits. In New York, officers are required 
either to live inside the city or in one of the six surrounding counties. 
Fifty-nine percent of all New York police officers live in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of officers in the LAPD upper ranks also live outside Los 
Angeles, according to the ACLU. Although Police Chief Willie L. Williams lives 
in the city, six of the nine officers whose rank is deputy chief or higher live 
outside Los Angeles. Three of the LAPD's 12 commanders live in the city, the 
ACLU reported.

 Escalating his campaign against federal sentencing laws, U.S. District Judge 
Terry J. Hatter Jr. on Monday refused a request to reconsider the 4 1/2-year 
prison term he gave to a onetime narcotics dealer who has become a community 
activist in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office had asked Hatter to review the sentence because it 
was half the time defendant Bobbie Marshall had agreed to serve in a plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's refusal, inviting a confrontation with the executive branch of 
government, is one of several instances in which he has challenged federal 
sentencing laws, which he considers too rigid. He told Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in 
a public forum last year that young, white federal prosecutors were making 
their reputations on the backs of minority defendants, comments that angered 
many federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hatter sentenced Marshall earlier this month, the judge said he thought 
even 4 1/2 years was too severe under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter praised Marshall, 41, for turning his life around during the past four 
years and emerging as an anti-drug, anti-violence advocate who played a key 
role in the city's efforts to maintain calm after verdicts in the second Rodney 
G. King beating trial and the Reginald O. Denny beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have done wonders in the community," Hatter said, crediting Marshall with 
helping young men from minority groups avoid the "spiral of crime in which you 
found yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 He lamented that "justice can't be completely done" because politicians have 
restricted the power of judges to act independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter was referring to the fact that federal sentencing laws passed in the 
1980s restricted the discretion of judges to tailor sentences to fit individual 
circumstances. Congress enacted the laws after expressing concern that there 
was too much inconsistency in sentences given to individuals who had committed 
similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March 7 sentencing hearing, Hatter also took the rare step of 
expressing the hope that the government would not appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madison, treading as lightly as he 
could, told Hatter that the government respectfully disagreed with his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said that Hatter was obliged, under a federal appeals court ruling, to 
impose the "agreed upon nine-year sentence," which was part of a plea agreement 
that included the dropping of four other 1989 drug charges. Otherwise, Madison 
contended, the entire agreement should be voided and Marshall should go to 
trial, where he would face a possible sentence of 24 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hatter would not budge, saying such an action would be unfair to Marshall. 
"It's the court, if anyone, who is outside the law, not the defendant," Hatter 
said. He also formally dismissed the four remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter told Madison that if the government wants to challenge his decision, 
the appropriate action for the U.S. attorney's office is to follow its normal 
procedure and ask the U.S. solicitor general for permission to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we'll see whether this Justice Department is (as rigid) as the one we 
had the last 12 years" under Presidents Reagan and Bush, Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said the government's decision to hold fast for the nine-year term had 
been made after he consulted with U.S. Atty. Nora Manella and Richard Drooyan, 
the chief of the office's criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he would consult with them again on whether to appeal 
Hatter's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. attorney's office took a close look at this case," Manella said. "We 
worked out an agreement that was suitable to both sides and faithful to the 
sentencing guidelines. We will have to look at this (Hatter's decision) and see 
what our alternatives are." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella and Madison noted that this is an unusual case. Marshall was arrested 
in May, 1989, and charged with dealing drugs near a Pacoima schoolyard under a 
special federal statute that mandates stiff prison terms for such crimes. 
Marshall had three state convictions between 1977 and 1987 for selling 
marijuana and for possessing PCP and crack cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Marshall, who is African American, and several other 
defendants filed papers alleging that the U.S. attorney's office was 
selectively prosecuting blacks and Latinos under the schoolyard law. Two years 
later, Marshall and three other minority defendants pleaded guilty on the eve 
of a hearing at which a bevy of local and federal law enforcement officials, 
including Robert C. Bonner Jr., then chief of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, were scheduled to testify on the allegations of selective 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, who had been out on bail since March, 1990, received a 14-year term. 
By that time, he was involved in community service work and consistently tested 
drug-free. Hatter postponed his sentencing for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Marshall's defense lawyer, Denise Meyer, sent a letter to Reno 
urging her to reconsider the 14-year sentence, praising Marshall as a "model of 
rehabilitation and leadership that the criminal justice system rarely sees and 
should reward." Attached to Meyer's letter were other letters of praise from 
community leaders, including one from Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office and Meyer renegotiated Marshall's plea arrangement 
and on the morning of March 7 agreed to a nine-year term, setting the stage for 
Hatter's decision to hand down a more lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that the judge recognized he has the power to sentence and 
not the prosecutor," Meyer said after Monday's hearing. "Even though it was a 
binding plea agreement, it doesn't mean that the judge doesn't retain 
jurisdiction to decide on a fair and just sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's decision in the Marshall case is not the first time he has imposed a 
sentence lighter than prosecutors sought. But he also has meted out severe 
sentences in narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he sentenced two men to life terms, without possibility of parole, 
after they were convicted of being the leaders of a ring that was broken with 
the seizure of a record 21.4 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse. "This is a 
case that cries out for the maximum sentence," Hatter said. "Society must be 
protected as best it can."

A LIFE-AND-DEATH IRONY; SHOT 3 TIMES, A DOCTOR PONDERS HIS CAREER HELPING LIVES 
BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had been a long labor and, in the end, the doctor opted for a Cesarean 
section. The procedure went well. The baby was healthy, the mother was happy. 
"It was a boy," the doctor recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another night for Dr. Paul Hackmeyer, clinical chief of obstetrics at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He remembers thinking he might get home in time 
for "the second feature." Maybe his wife had saved him some popcorn. These 
family movie nights had become more important since the earthquake forced them 
out of their damaged Sherman Oaks home. Now the Hackmeyers were in a rented 
house in North Hollywood, but they could still pick up a couple of videos and 
snuggle in bed with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived home just after midnight March 20. The 41-year-old doctor parked in 
the driveway and stepped out of his car to lock the gate on the chain-link 
fence that surrounds the house. As he reached for the chain, he said, "I became 
aware there was something out there" on the other side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shadowy forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so instantaneous. All I knew was I needed to lock this gate and I 
needed to run. . . . And as I turned, I remember  
</P>
<P>
 hearing them say, 'Don't run!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first bullet pierced his left forearm. The second ripped through his right 
thigh. "I never saw the flash. I never saw the gun." Paul Hackmeyer was running 
for the gap between his and his wife's cars, hoping to shield himself. He 
remembers the third shot as louder than the first two, probably because of the 
damage it did. This bullet entered the side of his torso, tearing through his 
lungs and liver before exiting his chest at a point near his heart. "If it had 
gotten a little bit more to the left, that would have been it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, who has helped in the births of thousands of children, is acutely 
aware of the irony of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do for a living is to preserve life . . . I make life-and-death 
decisions," he says. "Just as this guy made a life-and-death decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman pulled the trigger, Hackmeyer surmises, in anger because a robbery 
attempt had been frustrated. Police say no suspects are in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer is sitting in his back yard with his collection of bonsai trees, 
home again after a week in Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. The news on 
this day is that two Marymount College students shot in a carjacking outside a 
San Pedro supermarket have died of their wounds. "That could have been me," 
Hackmeyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 His manner is gracious, his smile easy. He is at once affable, witty and 
contemplative. Often, he says, people assume he feels anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is more accurate is that I'm saddened by how far our society has broken 
down. I've seen it over a lifetime -- how far the family has broken down. That 
good old Americana doesn't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a Boston native, the son of a radio ad salesman and a mother who died 
when he was 17. Hackmeyer remembers that, upon his mother's death, his older 
brother, who is mentally retarded, raised a simple question: "Who is going to 
wash my back?" 
</P>
<P>
 With some embarrassment, Hackmeyer admits that his own thoughts became 
similarly mundane with his own life in jeopardy. As he was being rushed into 
surgery, the last thing he said to his wife Nancy was to remember to water his 
bonsai trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had been something more meaningful," he says, "like 'Take care of 
my children,' or 'I'll see you in the next life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They have known each other 20 years and have been married for 15. They met 
while Hackmeyer was a student at Brandeis University, and Nancy Marutani, a 
Philadelphia native, was a student at Boston University, preparing for a career 
in law. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary of the cold winters, the doctor and the lawyer decided to stake their 
claim in California. In time there were two girls and then a boy. Brenna is 8, 
Casey 6 and Jonathan 2. Their dad performed the deliveries. In other ways, life 
was good as well. The Hackmeyers made many friends. And Paul excelled at his 
work, establishing a private practice while rising to a position of respect and 
responsibility at Cedars-Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before the quake, long before the shooting, the Hackmeyers found 
themselves questioning whether Los Angeles, with all its problems, was worth 
it. Fear of crime prompted the doctor to purchase a gun for home protection and 
learn how to use it. He made the purchase with ambivalence, acknowledging the 
painful thought that his own children might find it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Hackmeyers could resolve their own debate over whether to stay in 
Los Angeles, the quake forced them to relocate to a neighborhood a few miles 
northeast of their Sherman Oaks home. Real estate agents say Valley Village, 
just north of Studio City, is the most desirable neighborhood in North 
Hollywood, a place where many homes have been valued at more than $500,000. But 
as in other affluent neighborhoods, crime has become a constant concern. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night he was shot, Hackmeyer did not lose consciousness. "I'm not sure 
if that's good or bad," he says. His memories, he says, are a surreal series of 
black-and-white images. He cannot say why he knew he should lock the gate and 
try to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers calling for his wife, but she was unable to hear his voice. A 
neighbor was the first to find him. Another saw a car leaving the area. After 
Nancy came outside and discovered her husband, the children wanted to come 
outside too. Later, Nancy and the children piled into a police car to follow 
the ambulance to the hospital. The Hackmeyers expressed praise for the response 
of paramedics, the Holy Cross staff and the Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 His recovery seems to be going well, he says, although the drainage of fluid 
from his liver into a plastic sack at his side indicates that more surgery may 
be necessary. He spoke of how good it was to be home, to sit in the back yard 
and feel the sunshine and the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Brenna was with friends at Disneyland, while Casey and Jonathan 
romped around the back yard. Hackmeyer says he worries about the long-term 
effects on his children. Brenna has been brave and helped look after Jonathan, 
who is too young to comprehend what has happened. Casey, who had seemed 
standoffish on her hospital visits, now helps bandage her father's leg wound. 
</P>
<P>
 When he used a euphemism in her presence, making a reference to the time 
"daddy got sick," Casey was quick to correct him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not sick," the 6-year-old said. "You got shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting, Hackmeyer says, did not resolve the question of whether they 
should leave Los Angeles and all its troubles. As he put it to one friend, 
"Where do we go? Petaluma?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the sense that nowhere is truly safe isn't the only reason the question 
remains open. Dr. Hackmeyer's office estimates that more than 1,000 cards, 
phone calls and bouquets have been sent -- all reminders of roots that have 
been put down. Colleagues at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center have established two 
funds to help the family cope with the financial strain caused by the quake and 
the shooting. The contractor repairing their Sherman Oaks home put up 
high-powered security lights on the rental at no charge. Dr. Sanford Tisherman 
and his wife, Flora, who are Jonathan's godparents, hired a security firm to 
patrol the house.  
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer is especially touched that many former patients sent get-well cards 
that included pictures of the children he delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 It reminds the movie buff in him of the happy ending of "It's a Wonderful 
Life," with him in the Jimmy Stewart role. "I count my blessings," he says. 
"There's been such an outpouring from everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will the Hackmeyers soon forget the scene of domestic reality that woke 
Paul up on his first morning back home: Brenna standing in front of TV, singing 
along with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers; Casey screaming at her to move so 
she could see the TV; and Jonathan, having just discovered how to remove his 
own diapers, leaving an odiferous trail . 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . and I'm looking at this chaos, thinking 'Thank God, I'm home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor says this without a trace of sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he adds, "is what it's all about."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; PAROLEE TO 
STAND TRIAL IN STRING OF CHILD RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A parolee charged with raping children in Pacoima and Inglewood was ordered 
Monday to stand trial on 20 felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding an often-delayed preliminary hearing that started Dec. 22, San 
Fernando Municipal Judge Roy M. Carstairs ruled that there is a strong 
suspicion that Robert Lee Donaldson terrorized children in a Pacoima 
neighborhood -- the same area where he raped a boy in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson, 34, is charged with rape, sodomy and lewd acts. The Pacoima attacks 
on two girls occurred Sept. 21 and 22 on Van Nuys Boulevard near Borden Avenue. 
Two other girls were assaulted in separate incidents three blocks apart on Oct. 
11 and Oct. 18 in Inglewood, where police said Donaldson was stalking another 
child when he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey said the attacks in which Donaldson is 
charged had a striking similarity. The victims were from 9 to 16, and they were 
all walking alone to school. 
</P>
<P>
 After his conviction for raping a 15-year-old boy in May, 1982, Donaldson 
served more than 10 years in prison. He was paroled a year ago.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; MOTIVE 
STILL UNKNOWN IN FATAL SHOOTING OF 2 AT CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities were still searching for a motive Monday into a shooting that left 
two people dead and two others -- including a teen-age girl -- critically 
wounded at a Monterey Park restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived at the Cafe Mirage, a Chinese restaurant and karaoke bar, 
about 1:40 a.m. Sunday and found Cuong Van Ly, 20, of Monterey Park dead at the 
scene, said Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Diane Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Namtu Trang, 31, also of Monterey Park, was taken to Monterey Park 
Hospital, where he died of gunshot wounds, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Fong, 31, of Monterey Park, and Ahn Lee Dan, 16, of Upland are in 
critical condition at area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hect said an argument preceded the shootings at the cafe in the Monterey Park 
Mall in the 400 block of South Atlantic Boulevard, an area not known for 
serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several patrons at the restaurant started arguing, it escalated into a 
fistfight and then one person started brandishing a handgun," Hecht said. "What 
started the fight is unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested a suspect, but he was released after questioning. No other 
arrests have been made.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 72,000 
BUILDINGS REPORTED AFFECTED BY EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake affected 72,000 buildings in Los Angeles, 11,000 of 
which sustained moderate to major damage, a city official said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 A more accurate damage assessment is expected in mid-April, when city 
officials release a preliminary report and recommend changes in building codes 
and seismic reinforcement requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of damage to wood-frame structures -- apartment houses and 
homes -- because the epicenter was directly underneath a very dense residential 
area," said Karl Deppe, an assistant deputy building superintendent.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the earthquake displaced hundreds of thousands of people from 34,500 
residential units, including 2,000 single-family homes, Deppe told the Los 
Angeles City Council's Public Safety Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 About 500 apartment buildings sustained moderate to severe damage, Deppe said. 
About 40 collapsed, including the Northridge Meadows apartment building where 
16 people died. Most multi-residential buildings that were destroyed had 
garages and carports on the first floor. A task force of structural engineers 
is studying a recommendation to require retrofitting of those buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were also a couple of hundred older homes that came off their 
foundations," Deppe said. Ten hillside homes were destroyed. Besides a garage 
at Cal State Northridge, the temblor brought down 18 parking structures.

IN INTERNATIONAL COCAINE SMUGGLING CASE 
</P>

 Two men linked to an international drug smuggling ring were convicted in Los 
Angeles federal court Monday of conspiring to distribute more than $400 million 
worth of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Landivar Lopez, 31, and Jesus Teofilo Tavizon, 50, were arrested May 
15, 1991, in conjunction with the seizure of 3,300 pounds of the drug, the FBI

3 CONDORS WITH BAD HABITS FACE CAPTURE, RETURN TO ZOO; WILDLIFE: THE BIRDS HAVE 
RETURNED TO SESPE SANCTUARY WHERE FOUR OTHERS HAVE DIED IN CLASHES WITH 
CIVILIZATION. SIX REMAIN IN REMOTE CANYON NORTH OF OJAI. 
</P>

<P>
 Three wayward California condors are targeted for capture early today in the 
Sespe Condor Sanctuary and are to be returnd to the Los Angeles Zoo -- most 
likely never to fly free again. 
</P>
<P>
 The three birds, first released in the sanctuary in December, 1992, were 
removed to a remote Santa Barbara County canyon last November after four other 
condors died in a year-long series of clashes with civilization in the Sespe 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three left the remote Lion Canyon area March 14 and flew to Sespe, 
where they have resumed the same bad habits that got four of the endangered 
birds killed, including roosting on power lines and visiting populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal wildlife biologists had hoped that hunger would drive the vultures 
back to Lion Canyon, where they were fed calf carcasses. Five younger birds and 
an older one that were released there with the three wandering birds last 
November have remained in the canyon, about 35 miles north of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sespe birds, believed not to have eaten in two weeks, will be lured with 
carrion to enable biologists to cast nets over them as they feed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're dealing with birds that were just going to sit there and 
starve, in addition to going back to roosting on power poles," said Marc M. 
Weitzel, project leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife condor recovery program. 
The three birds probably will become part of the breeding stock for the captive 
breeding program at the Los Angeles Zoo, where they were born before they were 
released into the wild, Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and members of the Condor Recovery Team, a nationwide group of scientists, 
decided not to give the birds another chance in Lion Canyon for fear they would 
teach bad habits to younger birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fear is that the older birds would go back to the Sespe again and that 
the younger birds would tag along," Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzel said the move to return the birds to the zoo is not seen as a setback 
to the $15-million, 12-year condor recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most difficult phase of the reintroduction process -- 
establishing a core population in the wild," Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Kiff, head biologist on the recovery team that captured the last of the 
giant vultures in the wild on Easter in 1987 and released the first condor bred 
in captivity in 1992, agreed with the team's decision to bring in the three 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the process," he said. "If these birds have bad learned 
behavior, let's keep trying until we get a flock of birds out there that don't 
develop those habits."  
</P>
<P>
 There are now 71 California condors in captivity at three breeding centers -- 
the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos and a facility in Boise, Ida. -- and nine 
released birds still in the wild, for a total of 80. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's . . . three times more birds than we had when we brought the last one 
in in 1987," Kiff said. "That's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 And the 81st condor is expected to have hatched by today, said Mike Wallace, 
curator of conservation and science at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said that by bringing the three birds back to the zoo, biologists can 
release three others into the wild late next fall, along with a new batch of 
five or more birds already set for release. 
</P>
<P>
 The first condor to be killed in the wild died in October, 1992, after 
drinking anti-freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next 13 months, three more birds, all males, died in collisions 
with power poles or by electrocution from power lines.

SANTA MONICA TANGLES WITH HOMELESS ISSUE; SHELTER: CITY IS WEIGHING 
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSIENTS IN THE FACE OF GROWING COMPLAINTS BY RESIDENTS. 
CURBING PANHANDLING AND CONFISCATING SHOPPING CARTS ARE AMONG THE PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new plan to get tough on the homeless in Santa Monica by, among other 
things, confiscating shopping carts and curtailing panhandling, will be 
considered by the City Council at a special meeting tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposals were put forward last week by council members Asha Greenberg and 
Robert T. Holbrook, who said they are beset by constant complaints from the 
public about the intractable transient problem in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore their point, dozens of Santa Monica residents showed up at last 
week's council meeting to demand relief from what they described as intolerable 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insane to let the least fortunate members of society . . . dictate your 
lifestyle," said resident Adriana Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm living in Sarajevo," said resident David Brown, who added 
that he is kept awake by the noise of homeless people pushing rattling shopping 
carts through the alley under his bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been especially scornful of a female transient who has been 
defecating on the Roosevelt Elementary School lawn in full view of pupils. A 
vagrant also recently wandered into the first-graders' bathroom at the school, 
sending screaming children scattering for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a symbol of the city decaying," Roosevelt parent Clare Osowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, like other cities, has been grappling with its homeless problems 
for years. More than two years ago, it became the first city in the nation to 
enact a multifaceted plan to manage its large transient population. The "tough 
love" approach combines strict regulations on the conduct of the homeless with 
social services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, critics say squeamish enforcement of the regulations has made the 
much-vaunted program a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a public safety crisis in our city," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of an ineffective measure, Greenberg said, is the law passed last 
year to close city parks after midnight. It included an exception for anyone 
found sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt last year to clean up unsanitary conditions in Lincoln Park 
north of Wilshire Boulevard, police went in, after giving notice, and 
confiscated the belongings of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the goods were tagged and stored for retrieval by their owners, social 
service workers and homeless advocates blasted the sweep as inhumane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfavorable court rulings have also stymied city efforts. A federal judge last 
year said the ordinance banning meals programs in parks was unconstitutional, 
and another law prohibiting encampments in parks is also being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 How far the council goes at tonight's meeting will in part depend on the 
advice of a new city attorney, Marsha Jones Moutrie, who replaced former City 
Atty. Robert M. Myers. He was ousted in 1991 over his unwillingness to write 
and enforce ordinances that restrict homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have vowed to place an initiative on the November ballot to 
gain more restrictions. With three council seats up for grabs, that is 
something the liberal majority, which controls the council by a 5-2 margin, 
would like to avoid.  
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Holbrook's ideas include a law prohibiting panhandling at night. 
They also want to restrict panhandling on the bustling Third Street Promenade 
to designated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as legally protected free speech, panhandling cannot be outlawed and 
there is some question about the legality of the proposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element in the proposal involves enforcing a law confiscating stolen 
grocery carts -- in which homeless people stash their belongings all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members also want to repeal the exception in the park closure law 
for those who are sleeping and to make social service agencies accountable for 
their clients.

MAN HELD IN DEATH OF CHILD AND BEATINGS OF TWO OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three young children were brutally beaten -- and one of them died -- during 
what police describe as a "night of torture" last week at an apartment in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother's boyfriend, Lamar King, 26, was being held Monday at the Los 
Angeles County Jail on charges of murder and injuring children.Police said no 
charges have been filed against the mother, who on the night of the attack was 
at a hospital being treated for an illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs neighbors in the apartment building in the 3600 block of West 102nd 
Street said they heard banging and thumping above them for almost two hours on 
the night of March 22, but paid little attention because such sounds were 
common, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Estella Navarrette Martinez called them after she was released 
from the hospital the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in that bedroom . . . it was terrible," Inglewood Police Sgt. 
William Thompson said Monday. "That someone that young could be put through 
something like that, it was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the severely bruised body of Martiniano Hernandez, 2, was found 
in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been struck in the face and the head with shoes, and perhaps with a 
broomstick," the sergeant said. "He was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy's 4-year-old brother and 1-year-old sister were covered 
with bruises. "The 4-year-old looked worse than the dead child," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving children were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center, where they were treated for their injuries before being placed in 
foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that many of their injuries had been inflicted some time ago," 
Thompson said. " . . . He'd been putting these kids through some pretty 
significant torture."

SOLOMONIC RULING SPLITS SPERM OF DEAD MAN; COURTS: THREE OF 15 VIALS GO TO THE 
LATE LAWYER'S GIRLFRIEND, WHO WANTS TO CONCEIVE A BABY. THE MAN'S GROWN 
CHILDREN BATTLED HER CLAIM FOR 2 1/2 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Monday that a woman whose longtime 
boyfriend willed her vials of his sperm is entitled to 20% of the fluid, now 
stored in a Westside sperm bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is not to legislate good taste but uphold and interpret the law," 
Judge Arnold Gold told the assembled parties in what has become a bitter as 
well as precedent-setting 2 1/2-year struggle between the girlfriend and the 
grown children of the late William E. Kane, a Malibu attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Hecht, 39, will get three of the 15 vials in accordance with the 
judge's interpretation of an estate settlement agreement reached a couple of 
months after Kane's suicide in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement did not specifically mention the sperm, so it was put aside as 
the parties battled over whether frozen sperm could be considered part of a 
man's estate. Last June, a state Court of Appeal ruled that it could. In 
September, the California Supreme Court let that decision stand. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove any possibility that the distribution of the vials could be seen as 
an infringement upon the children's right to an allowance from the estate 
before it is finally settled, the judge ordered Hecht to pay into the estate 
the monetary value of the sperm: $60. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is one baby," Hecht said tearfully after the judge's decision. 
"One vial might do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each side has lashed out at the other in the case. Hecht and her attorneys 
contend that Kane's children did not want to share their portion of the estate 
with any future half-siblings -- although she has said she would not make any 
claims on behalf of a child. Kane's children say that they oppose the award of 
the sperm to Hecht only because, they allege, she was aware for several weeks 
of their father's desire to kill himself and did nothing to stop him from 
carrying out his intentions in a Las Vegas hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a money issue," said Sandra Irwin, the Kane children's attorney, 
after the judge's decision. Irwin, who is also their mother, was divorced from 
Kane 19 years ago. "It's a moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht -- who was not in Las Vegas at the time of Kane's death -- has 
steadfastly maintained that she did all she could to prevent him from killing 
himself, and police have cleared her of any criminal wrongdoing in the death.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES ADDED IN LIBEL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica Superior Court jury Monday recommended that a Bakersfield 
farmer be awarded more than $1.1 million in damages because a tabloid newspaper 
identified him as the real assassin of Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would go to Khalid Khawar, who was standing next to Kennedy on the 
night he was killed at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968.The Globe, a supermarket 
tabloid, printed a story in which conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow said 
Khawar, not Sirhan Sirhan, was the true assassin. The story was based on a book 
by Morrow, who claimed that Khawar's weapon was a gun disguised as a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury award came in two phases. Friday, the jury awarded Khawar a $675,000 
libel judgment because of injury to his reputation and emotional distress. 
Monday, the jury awarded $500,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Globe, Terry Raskyn, said the jury's award was only a 
recommendation and that there was hope that Judge Richard Harris would reject 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the story, the Globe ran a photograph of Kennedy taken the night he 
was killed. In the photo, a large black arrow pointed out Khawar, who had 
recently graduated from college, identifying him as the assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over yet," Raskyn said. She said the Globe hoped the judge would 
overturn the award because the jury had found the story accurately recounted 
the book's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Pizzulli, one of Khawar's lawyers, said he did not believe the judge 
will change the award after he reviews the case April 15. The Globe said it 
will appeal if the award is upheld.

HEALTH WATCH; A BLOOD BANK WITH ONLY ONE ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to donate blood . . . to yourself? Studies indicate that an estimated 10% 
of patients scheduled for elective surgery show up several weeks before surgery 
and give blood that is then earmarked for them. Two or more units of autologous 
-- your own -- blood can be donated in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend toward self-donation is driven by several forces, primarily safety 
-- despite the fact that the American blood supply has never been safer because 
of careful screening that can detect infectious agents, most notably the 
viruses for hepatitis and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 While AIDS gets the most publicity, the risk of hepatitis is higher. But that 
danger has been reduced by routine testing for the most widespread hepatitis

 Autologous blood also eliminates the small risk that a patient may have a 
damaging reaction to blood from a different donor. 
</P>
<P>
 And autologous blood reduces the overall demand in the community blood supply. 
One study showed that only 13% of surgery patients who donated blood in advance 
required blood from other donors, compared to 74% of patients who did not. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if you don't need all your blood during surgery? Well, you'll end up 
doing a good deed -- the blood will be donated to others.

 Nothing to Sneeze At: Birds are tweeting, flowers are blooming and you are 
blowing your nose, rubbing those eyes, sneezing big time and wishing you were 
anywhere but in Allergyville. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty million Americans suffer from seasonal allergies. And for them, spring's 
bloom -- which produces millions of the airborne pollen that aggravate allergy 
symptoms -- can be agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
 So, this free brochure might be just for you. "Health in Bloom: A Guide to 
Gardening With Allergies" provides tips for creating an allergy-friendly 
environment, controlling symptoms and avoiding the performance-impairing 
effects allergy medications can cause.

 Drinking Problems: Now we're quoting a college student on "20/20," which 
reported that 5-plus alcoholic drinks are the norm for one sitting during 
Spring Break festivities: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the coolest thing in the world. It transformed me from a shy kid into a 
party dude." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, according to various reports, other "transformations" have 
occurred with college students drinking, a student activity that is on the 
rise: 
</P>
<P>
 * Forty percent of students who use alcohol binge to "let off steam" or "just 
to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 * Some black out three or four times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands are hurt; hundreds are killed and, during a 12-month period, 12 
died of alcohol poisoning.

 RESPECT: Los Angeles magazine takes a look at the Valley and likes what it 
sees. The April issue lists 300 reasons why people shouldn't leave L. A., 
citing Valley attractions such as Norman's Rare Guitars in Reseda, Atlas 
Sausage Kitchen in Burbank and CityWalk in Universal City. . . . "In the 
Valley, you get all the amenities of the city without the aggravation," says 
Managing Editor Helene Goldsen.

 STAYING ALIVE: Dr. Paul Hackmeyer thought he knew all about the thin line 
between life and death. He was wrong. Last week, Hackmeyer, clinical chief of 
obstetrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was shot three times outside his 
rented North Hollywood home. . . . Lucky to be alive, he's not bitter. "I'm 
saddened by how far our society has broken down," he says (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 A TAXING TASK: April is almost here, which means only one thing: It's tax 
time, the busiest period for services such as Triple Check Income Tax Service 
in Burbank. . . . The new tax forms (above) are confusing, and accountants say 
even they can't figure them all out. See Valley Business, Pages 4, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 TROUBLE IN CHINA: The idea of a change in Clinton Administration policy toward 
China over human rights issues worries many Valley businesses. Clinton is 
considering whether to revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status. "If you 
really want to attack communism, you do it with free enterprise," says Steven 
Nichols, chairman of K-Swiss Inc., a Chatsworth marketer of sneakers. "I don't 
want to defend China, but we're out of our mind not to do business with them 
every day." See Valley Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 CAR FUTURE: Imagine a day when a computer chip in your car might help you 
avoid an accident. Imagine no more. It could happen, and pretty soon. Calstart, 
a Burbank consortium, showed the prototype of a device Monday that might 
prevent crashes and ease bottlenecks (B1). . . . "I envision the cars of the 
future just bristling with these radars," said one engineer. Michael Arkush

ARCO ENTERS BRAVE NEW ERA; PRESIDENT MIKE R. BOWLIN TAKES HELM AS NEW CEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entering an era of inevitable change, the board of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
voted Monday to promote Arco President and Chief Operating Officer Mike R. 
Bowlin, 51, to chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 1, Bowlin will succeed Lodwrick M. Cook, 65, one of the most 
visible U.S. oil company executives, as CEO. Cook will remain chairman of the 
board for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlin -- widely praised in the industry as a capable and personable executive 
-- had been the heir apparent for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 He will lead Arco -- an oil company more sensitive than most to the torments 
of low crude prices -- into a world in which prices may stay low far into the 
future. At the same time, he will preside over the decline in the Alaskan 
production that has been the company's mainstay for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very solid," said J. Robinson West, president and CEO of Petroleum 
Finance Co., a Washington, D.C., consulting firm. "He has broad experience. And 
Mike is very good with people. He's a good listener." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy A. Anderson, a former Lockheed Corp. chairman who served on Arco's board 
from 1986 to 1992, watched Bowlin's progress with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very believable, very credible," Anderson said, "and in a big company 
such as Arco, that's extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlin, who joined Arco in 1969 as a personnel representative, faces as 
formidable a set of challenges as those that met Cook when he took over the 
nation's seventh-largest oil company in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 While Arco's Alaskan production was heading toward its peak as Cook became 
CEO, oil prices -- once expected to surpass $80 a barrel -- surprised the world 
by careening to a low of $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco's board approved Bowlin's promotion as oil prices were falling again 
Monday -- this time in response to failure by the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries to cut production and stabilize prices. 
</P>
<P>
 West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell $1.14 Monday to $13.98 
a barrel. And oil company stocks fell with it. Despite positive reaction to 
Arco's orderly succession, the company's shares closed at $98, down $3 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts noted that Bowlin has been a key executive -- as vice 
president and then president of Arco International Oil and Gas Co. -- in Arco's 
shift to new oil finds in the North Sea, Indonesia and, lately, offshore China. 
Disappointing test wells in Alaska last year are likely only to accelerate 
Arco's investments in overseas production, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arco has operated in California (marketing and refining) very skillfully, but 
they're going to have to develop new income-generating assets in their 
portfolio," said West, of Petroleum Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlin confirmed Monday that beyond developing foreign oil, the company is 
actively looking at overseas refining and marketing, particularly in Asia. In 
addition, Arco is interested in providing coal -- possibly from vast Chinese 
coal deposits -- and natural gas for electric power production. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a time to stop and think about our business," Bowlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tough financial times will probably reduce another highly visible Arco 
presence, Bowlin said -- its corporate giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will always continue to have an interest in helping the communities in 
which we live and work. That is a longstanding tradition," Bowlin said. "But 
having said that, as our profits have declined, we have already begun a decline 
in our corporate contributions." Arco Foundation giving peaked at $36 million 
in 1983 and had fallen to $17 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlin, described by many as more reserved than Cook, said Cook would likely 
continue for the next year as Arco's most prominent executive in community 
affairs. Cook was recently named chairman of Rebuild L.A., the private-sector 
group charged with revitalizing economically depressed parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bowlin will concentrate on the company. And there is much to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestically, Arco is carrying out a painful restructuring of its Lower 48 gas 
and oil operations, the kind of belt-tightening that virtually all other U.S. 
oil companies have had to do. Announced last fall, Arco's latest pullback has 
cut 1,300 jobs and resulted in a $450-million charge in 1993's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies have moved faster, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw other companies like Chevron and BP come out earlier and do this, and 
they had earlier results that were significant," notes Holly Gustafson, a 
Washington-based energy analyst with NatWest Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowlin concedes that Arco spent five years preparing to restructure its U.S. 
operations. "But I think we have it right now," he said. Cook's Tour 
</P>
<P>
 Lodwrick M. Cook became CEO of Atlantic Richfield Co. in late 1985. His tenure 
has been marked by low oil prices and the spectre of expensive environmental 
regulation. Some key points in the Cook era:  
</P>
<P>
 1985-87: Completed a restructuring of the company. All refining and marketing 
assets in the eastern United States were sold, transforming Arco into an 
exclusively West Coast gasoline marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
 1987-present: Emphasized international activities focusing on oil, gas, coal 
and chemical development in countries such as China, Indonesia, the United 
Kingdom and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 1989: Pioneered cleaner burning "emission-control" gasolines. 
</P>
<P>
 1990: Arco posts record $2 billion profit. 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Launches another restructuring of oil and gas operations in Lower 48 
states. Company still in process of cutting 900-1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 1994: Arco says restructuring will cost more than expected; takes $450 
million charge against fourth quarter 1993 earnings.

MATTEL INC. BUYS KRANSCO TO BECOME TOP U.S. TOY MAKER; RETAIL: THE DEAL WILL 
ADD HULA HOOPS, FRISBEES AND MOREY BOOGIE BOARDS TO THE EL SEGUNDO-BASED 
COMPANY'S LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Barbie, that swinging California girl who has outlasted dozens of fads with 
nary a wrinkle to show for it, can now claim the granddaddy of all fads, the 
Hula Hoop, as another of her many accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Barbie's maker, Mattel Inc., bought Kransco, the San Francisco 
company that makes Wham-O brand Hula Hoops and Frisbees, Morey Boogie boards 
and the increasingly popular Power Wheels ride-on toys. The acquisition, for an 
undisclosed price, will add $175 million in sales annually and crown El 
Segundo-based Mattel as the nation's top toy maker. The deal is expected to 
close May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Only eight months ago, Mattel bought Fisher-Price Inc. and at the end of 1993, 
Mattel and Hasbro, maker of GI Joe, were neck-and-neck in sales volume, at $2.7 
billion each. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kransco is small -- with about a fourth of the sales of Fisher-Price -- 
it brings several top-selling brand names to Mattel's already formidable and 
category-leading product lineup. At the same time, it further diversifies 
Mattel's sales, which are typically dependent on Barbie and holiday gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hula Hoop is still considered the California craze by which all other 
crazes are measured. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple toy, a wide plastic ring that its user rotates around the waist, 
hips, neck or knees, was introduced in 1958 by the two entrepreneurial Southern 
Californians who had founded Wham-O 10 years earlier and had sold their first 
Frisbees just one year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first spring and summer, the Hula Hoop gyrated and wobbled its way to 
unit sales of 25 million. By the next year, Americans had bought more than 100 
million Hula Hoops and other knockoff versions. Kransco bought Wham-O in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hula Hoop has staged a revival in popularity about every seven to eight 
years -- all seemingly without much push from its makers. The latest, most 
significant revival came in 1989-90 when a Hula Hoopster became a popular guest 
of Johnny Carson's on the Tonight Show and sales more than doubled their 
typical yearly volume of a million. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mattel plans to put its considerable marketing and international 
distribution muscle behind the Frisbee, Boogie board and other Kransco toys, 
the company could be the beneficiary of another unintentional hoop boom: The 
Hula Hoop has a central role in the current Tim Robbins movie, "The Hudsucker 
Proxy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel and Kransco have had a decade-long relationship; one of Kransco's Power 
Wheels cars carries the Barbie label and look. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Wheels line of battery-operated toys, which sell from about $180 for 
the basic model to more than $350 for its Porsche line, is the real jewel in 
the Kransco toy box. It accounts for about 80% of the company's sales and holds 
a commanding 80% to 90% of the burgeoning market for such toys, said analyst 
Sean P. McGowan of the Gerard Klauer Mattison investment firm in New York.

LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM JAPAN'S MOVE; TRADE: AUTO PARTS AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS 
MAY BENEFIT FROM THE MARKET-OPENING MEASURES, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Automotive suppliers may sell more parts and heavy-construction firms may get 
a better crack at major projects, but in general the new package of 
market-opening measures unveiled in Tokyo early today will have negligible 
impact on California firms and other U.S. companies seeking inroads into Japan, 
industry representatives and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key elements of the still-ambiguous program is a government pledge 
to "facilitate" the local purchase of parts by Japanese auto plants overseas 
and the expansion of imports of foreign autos and parts into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government procurement sector, the plan calls for establishment 
procedures to disseminate information on large-scale telecommunication projects 
and medical equipment purchases at least 90 days before public calls for bids. 
Collusion and bid-rigging by Japanese firms privy to project specifications 
before public announcements have been among the main complaints of foreign 
construction firms seeking business there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government did not say what information would be made available early 
or whether it would liberalize the Byzantine system of qualifications for 
non-Japanese bidders. It also said it would wait until June before deciding 
whether, or by how much, to expand its public works budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything depends on what information they release 90 days before," said 
James McNulty, senior vice president of Ralph M. Parsons Co., a Pasadena-based 
heavy-construction firm active in the Japanese market through a series of joint 
ventures with Japanese building firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to know there's a project out there, but what about 
information about bidding criteria?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before the government's announcement, Japanese auto makers separately on 
Monday said they would set higher goals for purchases of U.S.-made parts. 
Toyota Motor Corp., for example, said it plans to increase total purchases of 
U.S.-made parts to $6.45 billion in fiscal 1996 from $4.43 billion in fiscal 
1992. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. similarly said it would purchase about $2 billion 
worth of U.S. parts in fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these figures, however, are plans, not promises, and are dependent on 
stronger sales and improved competitiveness by U.S. suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, this would have a modest impact on this industry," said George 
Peterson, president of AutoPacific Group Inc., a Santa Ana-based automotive 
marketing and consulting firm. The plan, he said, is "more than a token 
response" to American government pressure to open up the Japanese market but 
"not an open-arms response considering the fact that U.S. parts are cheaper 
than Japanese parts." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Japan's proposals were greeted coolly by industry representatives 
who have long awaited a significant liberalization in Japanese trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the American Electronics Assn., a key high-tech industry trade 
group, criticized Japan for not proposing specific actions to boost imports of 
U.S. equipment. The industry has complained that the Japanese government's 
procurement practices exclude outsiders, particularly those selling 
telecommunications gear and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, spokeswoman Debra Waggoner noted that the "rhetoric coming out of 
Japan the last two weeks has really lowered everyone's expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 "Patience is running out among the American medical manufacturers who are 
intensely interested in seeing results," said David Anast, publisher of the 
Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 Others said that the lack of quantifiable import goals in today's package 
typified Japan's practice of making vague and unenforceable promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 20-year history of U.S.-Japan trade relations is marked by promises 
unkept with no numerical guideposts," said Michael C. Maibach, a Washington 
lobbyist for semiconductor giant Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some industrialists said they saw some reason for optimism in the 
government program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a positive step," said McNulty of the Parsons Corp. 
</P>

White contributed to this report.

GRUMMAN SETS DEADLINE FOR TAKEOVER BIDS; DEFENSE: MARTIN MARIETTA AND NORTHROP 
ARE NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE UNTIL THURSDAY TO MAKE ONE LAST OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grumman Corp., seeking to avoid a drawn-out takeover fight, formally put 
itself on the auction block Monday and told rival bidders Northrop Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. to quickly make their best offers for the defense 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Northrop and Martin Marietta, Grumman Chairman Renso L. 
Caporali asked for the final sealed bids by Thursday afternoon, and said that 
the directors hope to choose the winner this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grumman's proposal to simplify matters also raised questions about whether 
the company is conducting the bidding fairly and equitably. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa promptly criticized Grumman's plan. In a return 
letter to Caporali, Kresa noted that Northrop currently has the higher pending 
bid for Grumman, yet "is now being asked to bid against a purely hypothetical 
price increase" from Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop has a bid of $60 a share, or $2.04 billion, pending for Grumman. 
Martin Marietta had earlier offered $55 a share, or $1.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa also asserted that one final round of offers could "prematurely cut off 
potential bidding and potentially deprive (Grumman) stockholders" of getting 
the best price for their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Northrop is considering a lawsuit to block Grumman's plan, Northrop 
spokesman Tony Cantafio said: "We're keeping our options open." 
</P>
<P>
 Caporali clearly hopes to avoid a repeat of such battles as that for Paramount 
Communications, though he didn't mention Paramount in his letters. Viacom and 
QVC spent five months wrangling for the entertainment company before Viacom 
emerged the victor last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Caporali said one last round of bids would prevent a prolonged 
fight for Grumman that carries such risks as "disruption to the company's 
business" and "overall uncertainty" for its employees, customers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Caporali sent his letter only to Northrop and Martin Marietta, 
his request for final proposals is designed to prompt any would-be third suitor 
to surface with a formal offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman "is implicitly saying that anybody that had been watching and waiting, 
this is that opportunity (to bid) and they better take it," said Jerry 
Cantwell, an analyst at the securities firm Lionheart Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other defense firms have been mentioned as possibly making late bids 
for Grumman, including Lockheed Corp., GM Hughes Electronics Corp. and Boeing 
Co. All have declined to comment on the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Caporali said that if Northrop and Martin Marietta make their last bids by 
Thursday as requested, they will effectively agree "to be bound by" Grumman's 
auction rules -- presumably meaning they cannot return later with revised 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if another bidder wanted to weigh in with an offer after Thursday, it's 
doubtful Grumman's rules would be able to head that off, said one source 
involved in the Grumman fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman executives did not return calls requesting comment. Martin Marietta 
said it is reviewing its options, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman, a Bethpage, N.Y.-based defense-electronics contractor, announced on 
March 7 that it agreed to be bought by Martin Marietta, a Bethesda, Md.-based 
company that is one of the nation's largest defense firms. Los Angeles-based 
Northrop, maker of the B-2 stealth bomber, then launched its unwelcome tender 
offer of $60 a share March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northrop, the fact that it currently has a higher bid could be academic, 
because the stock market is valuing Grumman at more than $64 a share -- a price 
both Northrop and Martin will be under pressure to match or exceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman's stock closed Monday at $64.875 a share, up $1.625, in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. Northrop dropped $1.375 to $42.75, and Martin rose 
75 cents to $46 a share, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 But analyst Lior Bregman of Oppenheimer & Co. warned that Wall Street could be 
in for a shock. Just because the market anticipates a winning bid of $65 or 
more doesn't mean it will happen. The "the market can also disappoint."

HYATT OWNERS SUE TRUMP FOR $100 MILLION; REAL ESTATE: THEY CONTEND THE 
DEVELOPER DID NOT PAY HIS SHARE FOR RENOVATIONS TO A JOINTLY OWNED NEW YORK 
HOTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling the start of a messy divorce in what thus far has been one of the 
most profitable marriages in the hotel and real estate business, the owners of 
Hyatt Hotels on Monday sued Donald Trump for $100 million, alleging that he has 
deliberately blocked renovations of their jointly owned New York Grand Hyatt 
hotel in order to get concessions to alleviate his financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Trump has refused to put up his half of the cost of a proposed 
$37-million renovation of the building, the suit alleges, the Grand Hyatt has 
deteriorated physically, lost its competitive position in relation to other 
first-class hotels in Manhattan and been downgraded by a leading tourist rating 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump responded to the lawsuit Monday with a blast of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyatt is merely trying to cover up their total incompetence in the running of 
the Grand Hyatt," he said in an interview. "Never before in my career have I 
witnessed such gross mismanagement. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit against Trump and two of his banks was filed in federal court in 
Manhattan by Refco Properties, Trump's 50% partner in the Grand Hyatt. Refco is 
a holding of the Pritzker family of Chicago, the owners of Hyatt Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 It also charges that Trump threatened to disparage Hyatt's management of the 
Grand and other hotels if the company did not award him the concessions he 
sought -- including cash payments, the plaintiffs allege. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the suit says Trump secretly ceded his interest in the Grand 
Hyatt to Bankers Trust Co. and Chemical Bank, two of his leading creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 That move, an apparent violation of his partnership agreement with Hyatt, left 
Hyatt in the uneasy position of having two sets of partners: Trump, who had a 
veto over management plans but no financial interest in the outcome, and the 
banks, which had a financial interest but no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit marks what could be a definitive split between Trump and his first 
major partners in New York real estate, the highly respected Pritzkers. The 
building at the core of the dispute was a landmark in the real estate 
renaissance of Manhattan in the 1970s -- and, not coincidentally, the 
foundation of Trump's own rise as New York's designer-label developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump bought the Commodore Hotel, then a derelict property in the heart of a 
virtual slum neighborhood, in 1978. In partnership with Hyatt, he sheathed it 
in chrome and green glass, extracted a 40-year, $60-million tax-abatement 
agreement from New York City and reopened it in 1981 as the Grand Hyatt. New 
York's economic recovery coincided with its renovation, making Trump look like 
a genius and inspiring one critic to cavil that "Donald Trump's best ally has 
been the business cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 He followed that project with such high-profile developments as Trump Tower 
and Trump Plaza in Manhattan and three casino-hotels in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990s recession, however, Trump was forced to seek bankruptcy 
protection for the casinos and the Plaza Hotel in New York; creditors seized 
half-interests in those properties in return for restructuring their punishing 
debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the Pritzkers said Monday that the family now fears the Grand 
Hyatt may become a victim of Trump's continuing difficulties with his bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the hotel is a pawn in a bigger struggle between Trump and his 
banks," said Howard Schiffman, a Washington-based lawyer for Refco. "That's 
what's made the hotel stalemate. We've come to the point in time where the 
hotel is losing its competitive edge." 
</P>
<P>
 What brought matters to a boil, both sides say, was Hyatt's conclusion in 1990 
that the hotel needed at least $24 million in renovations to remain 
competitive. The partnership agreement required Trump to put up half the money, 
the Pritzkers contend. They say he was initially in favor of the renovations 
but in November, 1990, changed his mind, saying he was "no longer in a 
financial position" to put up the money. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Trump contends the Hyatt demand was specifically designed to 
force him out of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in my deepest problems, they came to me and said, 'We want to 
renovate the hotel,' instead of holding off a little," Trump said Monday.

 BofA to Buy a Midwest Mortgage Company: Bank of America said it will acquire 
United Mortgage Corp. of Bloomington, Minn.The purchase price was not disclosed 
but a BofA spokesman said it was "not material" in terms of the bank's 
resources. The deal is designed to give BofA entry into the mortgage business 
in Florida and 15 Midwestern states. United Mortage holds a loan servicing 
portfolio of $4 billion, about 10% of BofA's existing portfolio, and last year 
originated about $1.9 billion in loans, about 20% of BofA's total of $10.6 
billion. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be 
completed in the third quarter of this year.

SALES OF CD-ROMS SOARED AT THE END OF 1993; TECHNOLOGY: FALLING PRICES FOR 
COMPUTERS, CD-ROM DRIVES DROVE HOLIDAY SOFTWARE SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marking the long-awaited coming of age for CD-ROMs, the Software Publisher's 
Assn. is expected to announce today that sales soared in the fourth quarter of 
1993 as this fledgling personal computer medium became one of the "must haves" 
of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey of 62 publishers, CD-ROM sales totaled $102 million in 
the October-December period, equaling the combined sales for the prior three 
quarters of 1993. Total revenues for 1993 came to $202 million. Unit sales for 
the quarter came to just more than 4 million compact discs, while sales for the 
year totaled 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors and entrepreneurs who have held out hope the hype surrounding 
the multimedia discs would someday become reality, the numbers are proof the 
promise of CD-ROMs has finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Christmas of 1993 we were all sort of hedging our bets," said Ann 
Winblad, whose Silicon Valley venture capital firm has invested in several 
CD-ROM developers. But falling prices for computers and CD-ROM drives drove 
software sales well beyond expectations last Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROMs, shiny discs that can hold up to 70 times as much data as a regular 
floppy disk, cost about $1 to press and $1 to package, vastly less than a game 
cartridge or the several floppy disks it takes to equal one CD-ROM. And, with 
approximately half of all personal computers now being sold with CD-ROM drives, 
many software manufacturers are considering abandoning the traditional -- and 
easily pirated -- diskette. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several CD-ROM publishers said the numbers did not reflect the full 
extent of the growth in the business, since many of the smaller publishers are 
not members of the trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen much more support in the marketplace for our CD-ROM titles than 
our projections anticipated," said Justin Heber, executive vice president of 
Irvine-based Virgin Interactive Entertainment. "We have a very big commitment 
to CD-based entertainment software, and we're seeing signs that it's beginning 
to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kotick, chairman of Los Angeles-based Activision said in 1995 his firm 
expects 75% of its revenue to come from CD-ROM, up from 20% in 1993 and less 
than 10% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This sales boom has also fueled a takeover and investment craze in CD-ROM 
developers. Virgin last week canceled a public offering because of what company 
officials said were investment propositions that needed to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The association said about half of the CD-ROMs sold in 1993 were "bundled" 
with the sale of a CD-ROM drive or computer. But for the third and fourth 
quarters, more discs were sold individually through retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important trend we noticed is that people are for the first time 
beginning to buy CDs rather than just getting them when they buy their 
computer," said Ken Wasch, executive director of the trade association.

OIL, GAS FUTURES PLUNGE ON OPEC DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crude oil and gasoline futures prices plunged on Monday after the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries left production targets unchanged and 
virtually assured a continued glut of oil this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The OPEC decision was widely expected and many in the oil market were shocked 
that prices fell so dramatically. Light sweet crude oil for near-term delivery 
settled $1.05 lower at $14.08 after dropping as much as $1.23 during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thought this had already been instilled in the market. Apparently 
not," Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover Inc., in Bronxville, N.Y., 
said of the OPEC decision. "It looks like more people thought OPEC was ready to 
cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices had moved higher in recent days, partly on talk from OPEC oil ministers 
that the cartel might be able to manage a production cut. Indeed, a majority of 
OPEC ministers were in favor of tighter output, but powerhouse Saudi Arabia 
blocked the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's drop returned crude oil prices to near the five-year lows first 
reached late last year when OPEC similarly left production steady for the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indications ahead of the meeting that OPEC would consider a 
1-million-barrel-per-day cut in production in the April-June quarter. That was 
the cut sought by most of the cartel's 12 members during the weekend meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the support of Saudi Arabia, any cut by the 11 other members would 
be largely ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil ministers did agree to hold the pumping steady for the next nine 
months as they wait for economic growth and cold-weather heating needs in the 
Northern hemisphere to lift demand. 
</P>
<P>
 During warmer months, oil demand in general slackens. However, summer driving 
sends more people to gasoline pumps and gasoline futures prices typically rise 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, unleaded gasoline futures for delivery next month settled down 
3.17 cents per gallon at 43.31 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Home 
heating oil for next-month delivery settled at 43.76 cents a gallon, down 2.52 
cents.

48 CALIFORNIA FIRMS RANK IN FORTUNE 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, California edged out New York as home to more of the 
nation's 500 biggest industrial companies than any other state, Fortune 
magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
 California is home to 48 companies in the 1993 edition of the magazine's 
annual ranking of the top 500 corporations, with previous leader New York 
falling to third with 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the California-based companies joining the Fortune 500 are: Solectron, 
based in Milpitas; Synoptics Communications, Santa Clara; Cisco Systems, Menlo 
Park, and 3Com, Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest California-based company on the list is Chevron of San Francisco, 
which fell to 11th from 8th the previous year. It was followed by 
Hewlett-Packard of Palo Alto, which rose to 19th from 24th. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Southern California-based company was Atlantic Richfield of Los 
Angeles, unchanged at No. 22. It was followed by Lockheed of Calabasas, up to 
35th from 45th, and Rockwell International of Seal Beach, down to 45th from 
43rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, after losing money in 1992, the Fortune 500 as a group earned $62.6 
billion in 1993 while slashing thousands of jobs, Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit figure would be enough to wipe out the 1993 U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune attributed the improvement largely to "American industry's steady, 
relentless drive to raise productivity, improve quality and boost 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping were a decline in long-term interest rates that lowered the cost 
of borrowing, a broad pickup in the U.S. economy and the expensive Japanese 
yen, which made U.S.-built products ranging from cars to computers more 
affordable than comparable Japanese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement didn't benefit the U.S. job picture, however. Total employment 
among the 500 fell for the ninth straight year, to 11.5 million from 11.8 
million. The trend confirms a pattern of dwindling employment opportunities as 
businesses get more efficient with fewer workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune said the earnings improvement was especially significant because it 
was achieved despite stagnant growth in sales.

 Ford Recalls 96,300 F-Series Trucks: Owners of the 1990 and 1991 models with 
7.5-liter engines are being contacted by Detroit-based Ford Motor Co. to bring 
their vehicles in to replace fuel return tubes for free, because of a 
potentially dangerous fuel-line defect that could result in a fire. The 
voluntary recall includes 6,000 vehicles in Canada and about 9% of the total 
number of F-series pickups sold in those years, a Ford spokeswoman said. At 
least one fire has been reported, although Ford said it knows of no injuries or 
traffic accidents that have resulted from the defect.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: WILL 'LION' BAMM BAMM 'FLINTSTONES'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fred Flintstone has a lion on his tail. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the world's most famous caveman has been prepackaged as the 
summer's movie and merchandising hit in the upcoming Universal Pictures film, 
"The Flintstones." But there are rumblings from the licensing world that "The 
Lion King," an animated Disney film about a lion cub that becomes king, could 
give "Flintstones" a rumble in the merchandising jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes down to this: Will kids be more enamored by a product like the 
Fred Flintstone doll that -- when squeezed -- shouts a raucous "Yabba dabba 
do!" Or will they be more enchanted with a plush lion cub from "Lion King" that 
-- when petted -- utters a regal roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers only have so much money to buy licensed merchandise," said Karen 
Raugust, editor of the Licensing Letter. She expects merchandise sales from one 
of the films to "rise to the top at the expense of the other." Because much of 
the Flintstone merchandise is linked to the live-action film instead of the 
animated cartoon show, the Flintstone merchandise is "a little bit riskier," 
she said. At stake are millions -- and perhaps billions -- of dollars in 
merchandise sales. Executives at MCA/Universal Merchandising say their goal is 
for Flintstone merchandise -- from key chains to satin jackets -- to surpass 
the $1 billion in product sales already registered by their recent 
merchandising hit "Jurassic Park." Disney executives declined to comment about 
"Lion King" product sales, but experts say sales could match -- or surpass -- 
the estimated $1 billion that Disney has taken in for such films as "Little 
Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Flintstones" has more than 100 licensees compared to fewer than 50 for 
"Lion King," Raugust said "Lion King" has one important thing in its favor: 
Disney's track record in merchandising its animated films. Of course, Steven 
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, which is producing "Flintstones," also has a 
long line of merchandising successes. 
</P>
<P>
 But most kids love cartoons, so products attached to animated films, such as 
"Lion King" often outsell those linked to live-action films, say licensing 
executives. Sure, there are notable exceptions -- "E.T." and "Batman," for 
instance -- but live-action films such as "Dick Tracy" and "Popeye" failed to 
move much product. 
</P>
<P>
 And while "The Flintstones" is generally expected to be a box office smash, 
some question whether that will automatically translate into massive 
merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about Flintstone merchandise," said Lee Weinblatt, 
president of the marketing research firm Pretesting Co. "People who favor the 
Flintstones are mostly older. But do Mom and Dad really want a set of 
Flintstone place mats?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the merchandise from the Flintstone film will look like the characters 
from the movie -- and not the cartoon series. Some marketing experts say kids 
in particular would probably rather have the real Fred Flintstone's face on 
their T-shirt than that of John Goodman -- co-star of the TV show "Roseanne" -- 
who plays Fred Flintstone in the upcoming film. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling is, John Goodman's picture should not be on the merchandise," 
said Harry Clark Noyes, president of the marketing research firm Psychological 
Motivation. "The movie is soon gone, but the character Fred Flintstone will be 
around long after that. Besides, not many people are going to the film to see 
John Goodman. They are going to see Fred Flintstone." 
</P>
<P>
 But executives at MCA insist Goodman's face will make the Flintstone 
merchandise especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the role John Goodman was born to play," said Linda Berkeley, senior 
vice president of MCA/Universal Merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will see the movie and want to take some of the fun home with them" in 
the form of merchandise, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If "The Flintstones" has one thing in its favor, it's timing. The film opens 
nationwide May 27, several weeks before the June 15 premiere of Disney's "Lion 
King." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Southern California's largest makers of plush toys and plastic 
figurines have very different opinions about which film will sell the most 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you, at the retail level this will be the biggest Disney feature 
of them all," said Melvin Grossman, chairman of Aurora Hills-based Applause 
Inc., which is making merchandise tied to "Lion King." "Based on orders from 
retailers, we recently doubled production," said Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Solomon, chairman of Woodland Hills-based Dakin Inc., said he thinks 
the appeal of "Lion King" is limited to "a very young audience." So his firm 
will instead make Flintstone products, which he says will appeal to people of 
all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food giants McDonald's and Burger King have picked their favorites too. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's is betting on Flintstones with its first-ever worldwide promotion, 
including Flintstone "Happy Meals" for kids and collector glasses for 
grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Burger King is putting its money on "Lion King," with promotions from "Lion 
King" kids' meals to "King-sized" meals targeting adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of picking sides, some major merchandisers are convinced both will win 
big. Mattel, for example, is making toy lines tied to both films. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like you can point to one film and say, that's the one that will 
come out on top," said Jill Barad, president of Mattel Inc. Mattel expects to 
post combined toy sales exceeding $100 million from the two movies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Gibson Greetings, a Cincinnati maker of greeting cards and party 
goods, will make products -- including cards, wrapping paper and paper napkins 
-- linked to both films. 
</P>
<P>
 Which will sell better? "That all depends on which movie does better at the 
box office," said Steve Kosmalski, senior vice president at Gibson. "But longer 
life spans go with animated films. They have a longer-lasting sentimentality. 
Just ask Mickey Mouse." Briefly . . .

COMPANY TOWN; MCA'S POLLOCK SIGNS LONG-TERM CONTRACT BROADENING HIS ROLE; 
ENTERTAINMENT: THE COMPANY'S MOTION PICTURE GROUP CHAIRMAN IS GIVEN NEW 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After months of talks, Tom Pollock, as expected, reached a long-term agreement 
to stay on as chairman of MCA's Motion Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the agreement Monday, MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg said 
that Pollock has been given new responsibilities under his arrangement -- 
believed to be about three years in length -- aimed at giving Pollock a broader 
role in influencing the direction of the Universal City-based entertainment 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Left unsaid in the announcement was any word on the status of production chief 
Casey Silver, although he is widely expected to stay. Pollock said in an 
interview that he can't comment on Silver's situation now. 
</P>
<P>
 One message of Pollock's renewal is clearly aimed at reassuring Hollywood that 
management remains stable at MCA and its units, one of which is Universal 
Pictures, overseen by Pollock. Company officials made a special point of noting 
that Pollock's regime now ranks third in length among Hollywood's major 
studios, behind the executive teams leading Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business, it is stability that yields long-term relationships with 
talent, and long-term relationships with talent is what yields good movies," 
Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs MCA seriously considered anyone else for the job. Talks 
are believed to have taken so long because Pollock, 50, wanted more 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock's announcement came just days after MCA announced that its music 
chief, Al Teller, has agreed to a new contract. Insiders speculate that similar 
announcements are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive stability has become a valuable commodity lately in Hollywood, where 
projects are developed years in advance. Uncertainty among management has been 
a problem at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where some top executives have 
recently departed, and at Paramount Communications, which was hurt by months of 
turmoil caused by the $12-billion takeover battle eventually won by Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stability is viewed as an asset today. The most successful studios have been 
Warner Bros. and Disney for a number of years. There's a perception that 
endless musical chairs works to the disadvantage of the creativity of a 
company," said entertainment lawyer David Colden. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers added that the stability also would be important should MCA's 
parent, Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial, decide that it wants to sell a 
portion of MCA, whose value is considered to have soared well beyond its 
$6.6-billion acquisition price in the wake of the Paramount takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock's desire for additional responsibilities has been well known, with 
early speculation that he wanted such areas as home video under his domain. 
Pollock's agreement now appears to be aimed more toward including an 
understanding that he will play a larger role in deciding where MCA is going as 
a company as well as taking on additional foreign duties. One specific duty MCA 
said Pollock will take on is assuming Sheinberg's seat on the board of 
Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon Corp. theater chain. MCA owns 42.8% of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA's film group is coming off a banner year thanks to the extraordinary year 
for director Steven Spielberg, whose "Jurassic Park" has grossed a record $884 
million worldwide. Pollock said plans are in the works for a "Jurassic Park" 
sequel produced by Spielberg, although it is uncertain if Spielberg will 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's "Schindler's List," which just won the Oscar for best picture, 
also has emerged as a commercial success, grossing $68 million domestically so 
far and more than $100 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have said Spielberg's successes masked what otherwise was a 
disappointing film slate for Pollock. But Pollock counters that Universal's 
film operation would have been profitable even without "Jurassic Park."

 Interactive: Former Silicon Graphics Inc. technology wizard Carol Peters and 
Hollywood producer Jeff Apple ("In the Line of Fire") have formed a new media 
company to develop interactive television programming for children. Dubbed 
daVinci Time & Space, the company's goal is to create an interactive 
environment for kids that could contain dozens of games, educational 
experiences, linear movies or TV shows, and advertising from a variety of 
sources -- a kind of electronic Disneyland.At a time when most interactive 
media start-ups are focusing on CD-ROMs or on-line services, where a market 
already exists, daVinci managed to raise nearly $5 million from venture 
capitalists to concentrate solely on the less tangible goal of next-generation 
interactive television. Peters, who developed Silicon Graphics' popular Indigo 
computer, directs daVinci's engineering efforts from an office in San Mateo. 
Apple oversees the creative end from Los Angeles. The two keep in touch via 
(what else?) video conferencing over high-speed phone lines. AMY HARMON

WINNERS BUILD SUPPORT FOR HOMEAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prominent members of the Orange County building community were the stars of 
"Hooray for Hollywood," a fashion show/benefit for HomeAid, the local Building 
Industry Assn.'s nonprofit program to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Building industry luminaries and their families joined professional models on 
the runway to show off spring styles from Saks Fifth Avenue in South Coast 
Plaza, Costa Mesa, and the Red Balloon in Fashion Island Newport Beach before a 
crowd of 400 whooping and hollering spectators. The gala, held Saturday at the 
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, cost $100 per person and raised about $50,000 for 
HomeAid. That's Entertainment 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted people to feel they were going to the Academy Awards," said 
Donna-Marie Acker, event chairwoman, who carried out the Hollywood theme 
dreamed up by committee member Angela Tippell. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were seated at tables draped in black with towering crystal vases 
filled with Easter lilies. After a dinner of chicken breast with papaya and 
macadamia nuts, the show began with models emerging from the back of the 
ballroom in sparkling evening wear and sauntering up to the stage like stars on 
their way to the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur models hammed it up on the runway in true Hollywood tradition. A 
dozen turned up in denim and performed a country-Western line dance to the tune 
of "Achy Breaky Heart," with Jay Blakslee of the Chicago Title Co. decked out 
in leather like a would-be Billy Ray Cyrus. 
</P>
<P>
 For the finale, event sponsor Disneyland brought out "Beauty and the Beast" 
characters Belle and her beast for a waltz to their theme song. Then, while "Be 
Our Guest" played over the loudspeakers, waiters marched into the ballroom 
bearing trays of ice cream and strawberries. Hope for the Homeless 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of the BIA started HomeAid in 1989 to alleviate the 
homeless problem by erecting or refurbishing shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a fund-raiser that would appeal to the BIA membership," said Julie 
Brinkerhoff-Jacobs, HomeAid co-founder. "We're fortunate that everyone from 
carpet salesmen to plumbers to architects can share their knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 By drawing on the materials, time, skill and money of builders and craftsmen, 
HomeAid has completed 15 shelter projects -- an addition of 300 beds 
county-wide. The shelters are designed to help the "transitionally homeless" 
get back on their feet, said Bob Albertson, president and chairman of HomeAid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are people who have had a catastrophic event in their life" such as a 
job loss or illness, Albertson said. Most pay a minimal amount to stay at the 
shelters so they can save money and move to a permanent home. The average 
length of stay is one to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid does not run the shelters -- that's the job of nonprofit care 
providers. House of Hope, a 48-bed shelter in Orange run by the Orange County 
Rescue Mission, is HomeAid's latest and largest project. Salute to the Stars 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Sherrin received the HomeAid Rainbow of Hope Award for her commitment 
to the homeless. Sherrin founded the Precious Life Shelter, a home for pregnant 
women, which was expanded to serve 18 women with help from HomeAid in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a 22-piece Marine Corps marching band delivered a special 
performance in honor of Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley for his 
efforts on behalf of the homeless. Riley and Anthony Moiso, president and CEO 
of the Santa Margarita Co., were the event's honorary chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests included: John Moschitta Jr., master of ceremonies; Bart Hansen, 
HomeAid co-founder and BIA president, and wife Tannah; Brenda Silvey, event 
co-chairwoman; Michael Lennon, HomeAid executive director; Gen. Paul 
Fratarangelo, USMC, and wife Andrea; models Don and Kate Moe, Donna Varner, 
Kristine Parker, Desiree Larivee, David and Val Celestin and Mike Dickenson; 
Jenifer Moody, Andrea Bertrand, Michele Mendoza and Mary Anne Mang. KATHRYN

PROPERTY VALUES: SLOWING EXODUS FROM STATE A POSITIVE SIGN FOR REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer Dean and Marcia Arnold sold their Granada Hills home and made 
their move to what they thought would be paradise in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 For $198,000, the Arnolds bought a 3,000-square-foot home with a swimming pool 
in a park-like setting. The neighborhood was pristine and the public schools 
were excellent. "It seemed to be the place we really wanted to raise out 
children," Dean Arnold recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year later, the Arnolds are moving back, and they are searching 
for a home in Woodland Hills. "Most people think we're crazy," said Dean, 
formerly a hospital media coordinator. "We didn't really appreciate a lot of 
the things we had in Los Angeles -- the diversity, culture and ability to find 
just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia has already moved back and is living in an apartment in Woodland Hills. 
"She felt a bit confined," Dean said. "We happen to be in a white, Bible-belt 
pocket of Denver," he said. "To get bagels, we have to drive to the other side 
of town." 
</P>
<P>
 While California continues to lose population to states such as Arizona, 
Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, statistics indicate that the outflow 
is decreasing. And, a growing number of families such as the Arnolds are coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 While California had a net outflow of between 11,000 and 12,000 residents for 
each of the last three months of 1993, the net outflow to other states has been 
dropping dramatically in 1994, said Elizabeth Hoag, research manager for the 
California Department of Finance Demographic Research Unit in Sacramento. The 
net outflow for the first two months of this year -- based on driver license 
records -- averaged just 5,500 residents a month from California. While that's 
still negative, it represents an improvement. "It could be the beginning of a 
trend," Hoag said. "We'll keep watching and see." 
</P>
<P>
 How many people are coming to or leaving California -- and Los Angeles 
particularly -- has a serious impact on property values. If the exodus out of 
the area begins to slow considerably, this could help to buoy real estate 
prices in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County. But it's too early to 
tell for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've bottomed out on the trend of people leaving Los Angeles," said 
Steve Komorous, vice president of sales and marketing at King Relocation 
Services in Santa Fe Springs, which is an agent for United Van Lines. His 
company moved one family from Van Nuys to Portland, Ore., last year; now, 
they're moving back to Sherman Oaks. Komorous said the family just couldn't get 
used to the slower pace of life up north. "They told me it was like a time 
warp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Komorous recalled, most California moving 
companies did 70% of their interstate business moving people into Southern 
California, and only 30% of their business was outbound from Southern 
California. In the early 1990s, the percentages were completely reversed, with 
movers doing about 70% of their business helping people leave Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several months, the percentages have begun to balance out, 
Komorous said. About 40% of his business is coming from inbound moves. "Things 
are coming back slowly," he said. "By the end of this year I predict our ratio 
of inbound to outbound moves will be 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Howe, director of relocation services at the West Los Angeles office 
of Jon Douglas Co., is also beginning to see an increasing number of returning 
Angelenos. Howe recalled one family that moved to a small town in Idaho and 
decided recently to return to Los Angeles. Another woman moved from Ventura 
County to South Carolina, Howe said. After getting bored with the South, she is 
in the process of moving back to Camarillo. Yet another of Howe's clients who 
moved to Portland is trying to come back but still needs to get a job and a 
house here. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jon Douglas is doing more outbound than inbound business, Howe said, "I 
don't think things are as grim here as people think. When most people seriously 
evaluate whether they should move from Los Angeles, they realize it's not so 
bad here." 
</P>
<P>
 "There seem to be a lot more out-of-state cars on the freeways -- and they're 
not all tourists," remarked Jack Kyser,chief economist for the Economic 
Development Corp. of Los Angeles County and a Glendale resident. "Yes, housing 
may be cheaper in other states, but you have higher utility costs and you need 
more of a wardrobe to deal with the change of seasons," Kyser said. 
California's recent economic problems and natural disasters have prompted many 
people to talk about leaving, Kyser said. "But, more people talk about moving 
than actually do it."

KING RE-ENACTS BEATING AT TRIAL OF SUIT AGAINST CITY; COURTS: 'I COULD HEAR MY 
BONES CRUNCHING,' HE TELLS JURORS. HE SAYS HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE AS OFFICERS 
HIT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 A soft-spoken Rodney G. King got down on a courtroom floor Monday, re-enacted 
portions of his 1991 beating by police and told jurors: "I felt like I had been 
raped." 
</P>
<P>
 As batons smashed into his head, he recalled, "I felt like I had lost half of 
my face. . . . I could hear my bones crunching every time the baton hit me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like throwing an egg and hearing the shell crack," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers hogtied him and dragged him to the side of the road, "I felt 
like a cow that was waiting to be slaughtered, like a piece of meat," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just so scared," he continued. "I felt like I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 King was testifying in his lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles for damages 
stemming from his March 3, 1991, beating by four Los Angeles police officers. 
He is asking for $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who is black, was beaten by the white officers after a traffic stop in 
Lake View Terrace. The beating was videotaped by a resident and broadcast 
widely, prompting an investigation of police brutality around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were acquitted of nearly all assault charges in a 1992 state 
trial, whose verdicts sparked three days of rioting in Los Angeles. Two of the 
officers were convicted last year in federal court of violating King's civil 
rights and were sentenced to 30 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has admitted liability, but jurors have been asked to set a damage 
figure. In the second phase of the trial, they will try to allocate blame to 
individual defendants, including former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and the 
four officers, for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who rejected the city's $1.25-million settlement offer, was asked 
whether he felt the beating was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling that this happens all the time," he said. "I just happened to 
run into the wrong pack of dogs, police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to recount what happened, King, 28, recalled an evening that began in 
celebration of his winning back his job with a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very proud of myself for having got back with my company," said King, 
who had served time in prison for robbery. He admitted drinking too much beer 
and champagne that night and said he tried to elude a police traffic stop 
because he feared going back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When police caught up with him, he said, he tried to comply with orders to get 
down on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by his lawyer, Milton Grimes, King left the witness stand 
twice and got onto the floor to show jurors the position he was in when struck 
by police batons and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as his mouth filled with blood, he heard police yell, "We're 
gonna kill you, nigger!. Run!" He said he ran to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had been raped (of) my decency and manhood," he said quietly. 
"I heard them say 'nigger, nigger' and 'killer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "How did you feel?" Grimes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very scared for my life," King said. "I knew they were going to try to kill 
me when they started saying 'nigger' and 'killer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At last year's federal trial, King made the same claims but later said he was 
not sure about the racial remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have testified in the current trial that King suffered injuries that 
could have killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 King said his wounds were psychological as well as physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I had been stripped of my decency and my will as a human being," 
he said. "I felt helpless. I felt scared, confused and very weak." 
</P>
<P>
 In his only allusion to the political impact of the case, he said: "I felt I 
had landed somewhere in the world not in the United States. The officers, the 
words, the racial slurs they were using that night, I thought I was somewhere 
else, not here."

OFFICIAL'S DEATH RULED A RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. official Fred Woodruff died last year in the republic of Georgia in "a 
random act of violence," the State Department said Monday, responding to 
questions about whether his death was connected to accused CIA spy Aldrich H. 
Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. investigation concluded that Woodruff's highway death last year in the 
former Soviet republic "was not politically motivated," State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodruff is believed to have been a CIA agent. CIA Director R. James Woolsey 
flew to Tbilisi to bring home his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, accused with his wife, Rosario, of conspiracy to commit espionage, has 
been reported by several news organizations to have visited Georgia in July, a 
month before Woodruff was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodruff was shot in the head while traveling with three Georgian 
acquaintances. Anzor Sharmaidze, whose car had stalled, has confessed to firing 
at Woodruff's vehicle when it did not stop for him, McCurry said. He was 
sentenced to 15 years at hard labor.

NEW CALL FOR INQUIRY INTO DEATH OF DEPUTY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: BLACK COMMUNITY 
GROUPS SAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST PROBE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT SHOOTING OF 
DARRYN LEROY ROBINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local black leaders on Monday reiterated their demand for a federal inquiry 
into the death of Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, saying the district 
attorney's investigation has actually raised more questions than it has 
answered about the Christmas Day shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene M. Wheeler, a spokesman for a coalition of black community groups, said 
the lack of explanation in 13 important aspects of the incident is compelling 
enough to justify a full-scale investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information we have, including information from the district attorney's 
office, doesn't answer questions as much as it raises them," said Wheeler, who 
is president of 100 Black Men of Orange County. "How can we as intelligent 
people, whether you're black, white, Asian or Latino, accept the mishandling of 
a serious case by our elected officials?" 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the strangest incidents in Sheriff's Department history, authorities 
say that Deputy Brian P. Scanlan accidentally shot Robins in the head with his 
service pistol as they were re-enacting a traffic stop behind a Lake Forest 
shopping center.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Scanlan's 9-millimeter handgun was loaded despite regulations 
requiring that only unloaded weapons be used for training purposes.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the investigation, a coalition of minority groups, including the 
100 Black Men of Orange County, have closely monitored the situation, 
questioning whether race may have played a part in the handling of the 
investigation. Robins was black; Scanlan, who remains on paid leave, is white. 
</P>
<P>
 These groups have pushed repeatedly for independent investigations of the 
shooting, and late last week they sent a formal letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno asking for such an inquiry. Wheeler said an answer has not been received. 
</P>
<P>
 The repeated requests for federal authorities to step in elicited a swift 
response Monday from law enforcement representatives and officials who have 
been close to the Robins case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We conducted a fair, impartial and complete investigation of the matter," 
said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans, the second in command of the 
district attorney's office. "We presented the case to a grand jury. Our 
investigative files were made available to the public, and the file is also 
available for any other governmental agency that wants to review it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors said they requested that an involuntary manslaughter 
charge be filed against Scanlan because of gross negligence, the Orange County 
Grand Jury last week declined to indict the veteran officer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of black civic leaders, Sheriff Brad Gates also asked the state 
attorney general's office to look into the death independent of local 
authorities. The agency declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are never going to be satisfied with anything," said Bob 
MacLeod, general manager of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, which 
represents 1,300 deputies. "If Moses came down from the mountain and said that 
this was a fair investigation, that the shooting was accidental and that it was 
not racially motivated, they would argue with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler responded: "Our dispute is not with the sheriff's association. We have 
no intentions of being diverted by some statement that Mr. MacLeod might make. 
Our issues are not with him. They are much bigger than his organization." 
</P>
<P>
 After local black leaders reviewed law enforcement records related to Robins' 
death, Wheeler said, there were a number of questions that still need to be 
answered before any conclusions can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they say, it was never explained why Scanlan, a training officer, 
was using a loaded gun for a training exercise; why he put out an emergency 
broadcast saying the shooting happened during a felony car stop; why a deputy 
"tampered" with evidence by removing and uncocking Scanlan's weapon at the 
scene; and why investigators failed to properly check out a tip alleging that 
the shooting was deliberate and perhaps racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Wheeler said that reports made available to the public do not 
contain the statements of a sheriff's deputy who might have shed light on the 
relationship between Robins and Scanlan. The district attorney's report notes 
that 12 of 13 deputies told investigators that there was never any tension 
between Scanlan and Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears there was a dissenting opinion," Wheeler said. "We don't know what 
he said, but it looks like there could have been someone saying something 
completely different than the other 12 deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans declined to comment on the coalition's specific concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, black leaders renewed their earlier criticism that the district 
attorney's investigation was not independent of the Sheriff's Department. 
Records related to the inquiry show that sheriff's deputies were allowed to sit 
in on virtually all the interrogations conducted by the district attorney, 
despite assurances by Gates that his department would remain removed from the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is compelling enough to warrant another investigation," Wheeler said. 
"Because we now have information that we did not have before, our suspicions 
about impartiality have been confirmed. The sheriff and the district attorney 
are intertwined." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates and the district attorney have said that the presence of deputies at 
interviews did not compromise the integrity or the independence of the district 
attorney's investigation.

STATE LAWYERS SEEK GIONIS CASE REVIEW; LAW: REQUEST DISPUTES ALLEGED JUDICIAL 
ERROR, PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT CITED IN LAST RULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State lawyers on Monday asked the California Supreme Court to review a lower 
court's decision reversing the convictions of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, who was 
found guilty of orchestrating an attack on the daughter of actor John Wayne 
during a bitter child custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 26-page document filed in San Diego, the state attorney general's office 
disputed an alleged judicial error and alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the 
case, and stressed evidence of Gionis' guilt in the Oct. 3, 1988, attack on 
Aissa Wayne and her boyfriend, Roger Luby. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana overturned the 1992 convictions 
last month, finding that the trial judge improperly allowed incriminating 
testimony from a family law attorney who once represented Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court also took former prosecutor Jeoffrey L. Robinson to task 
for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" on Gionis' defense attorney 
Bruce Cutler, who is known for his flamboyant style and his defense of New York 
mobster John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking the state's highest court to accept the case, attorneys for the 
state said the appellate court's 3-0 decision undermines the independence of 
the judge who presided over the trial and has created several novel legal 
issues worthy of review. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a denial of basic fairness to permit a prosecutor to be publicly 
condemned and a conviction reversed without an avenue of review for an abuse of 
discretion," according to the state's petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis' defense attorney, William J. Kopeny, said he had not yet reviewed the 
documents but wants the high court to reject the request based on evidence of 
misconduct.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very weak case," Kopeny said, adding that the lack of evidence 
highlights the need for the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's request is the latest legal step in one of the more 
unusual, and sensational, cases ever to be heard in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A first trial for Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon, ended in a mistrial. During a 
second trial in 1992, he was convicted of four felony counts stemming from the 
shocking attack on Wayne and Luby outside Luby's Newport Beach estate. Gionis 
was sentenced to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne was tied up and thrown face first onto a garage floor, causing head 
injuries. The two attackers pistol-whipped Luby and slashed his Achilles' 
tendons before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged Gionis hired the attackers to get revenge on his estranged 
wife in the midst of a heated custody dispute over their young daughter, 
Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense appealed, and in a Feb. 18 decision the appellate court -- in a 
rare move -- overturned the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson told jurors in closing arguments that it is a defense attorney's 
"duty to lie, conceal, distort and slander everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court, which had criticized Robinson's trial tactics in the 
past, ruled that the prosecutor's comments alone were grounds for a reversal in 
a case based on weak circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office contended in court documents that the testimony 
by attorney John Lueck, who testified that Gionis made threatening remarks 
about Wayne, did not violate attorney-client privileges since Lueck made it 
clear he would not represent Gionis. The attorney general also noted that the 
trial judge ruled the statements did not violate attorney-client privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 In reasoning their dismissal, the appellate court justices ruled it was 
possible that Lueck's testimony sealed the jury's guilty verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's statements regarding Cutler were also proper, given Cutler's 
conduct during the trial, according to state prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite overwhelming evidence of guilt, the appellate court reversed a 
conviction for prosecutorial misconduct, which it alone concluded existed," 
state prosecutors stated in court records. "If a defense counsel chose to 
engage in histrionics in defense of his client, the prosecution should be 
permitted to note the tactic and diffuse the effect on the jury."

JUDGE OKS 'CLUB HOMELESS' EVICTIONS; COURTS: TRANSIENTS IN ELABORATE CAMP UNDER 
FREEWAY MAY BE FORCED OUT BY WEEK'S END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Citing safety and sanitation concerns, a judge ruled Monday that Caltrans 
officials can evict more than 20 transients who took up residence beneath the 
San Diego Freeway in Huntington Beach in an elaborate, furnished encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas paves the 
way for Caltrans workers to force homeless men and women off the public 
property dubbed "Club Homeless." The evictions could come later this week, 
Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Don Wilson, 59, the ruling means he will have to move from the plot of 
land he has called home for the past three years since falling on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to do now, where I can go," said Wilson, who 
called the judge a "jerk" outside of court. "Is this justice? I don't think 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation was slapped with a lawsuit earlier this 
year after Caltrans workers tried to roust those who had erected makeshift 
homes near the freeway's Beach Boulevard off-ramp. Several of the quarters had 
furnished living areas. One man's site even had a kitchen equipped with a stove 
and stocked spice rack. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing marks the latest legal clash over the homeless problem in Orange 
County, where some officials estimate there are more than 10,000 homeless 
people but just over 300 shelter beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials want the area cleared so they can proceed with maintenance 
and gardening projects. The eviction notices also followed complaints about 
crime in the area that some attributed to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and other homeless people claimed that unidentified Caltrans workers 
have known about their encampments for years, and even gave permission for them 
to live there if they did not cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Paul M. Gray, who represents the homeless, said Caltrans should be 
responsible for finding the homeless a new place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no other place to go, to live, to sleep," he told Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Glenn Mueller, who represented Caltrans, disputed those claims. 
He said Caltrans officials only learned of the encampments a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller cited safety concerns, since the transients are close to fast-moving 
cars on the freeway, and also noted that area lacks running water and toilet 
facilities. The transients relieve themselves in an open-pit latrine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also concerns that the encampments create a fire hazard. Earlier 
this month, authorities believe a fire was deliberately set at a neighboring 
homeless site just hours after a judge issued a temporary order prohibiting 
Caltrans from evicting the homeless from the encampment until Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials have tried to proceed with the evictions as "humanely" as 
possible, Orem said. The homeless have been given information about 52 county 
shelters and organizations that can assist them, she said.

2 KILLED AS DRIVER RUNS RED LIGHT; CRASH: FATHER OF SIX AND A DAUGHTER DIE WHEN 
FLEEING MOTORIST'S PICKUP SMASHES INTO THEIR CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Santa Ana father of six and one of his teen-age daughters were killed Monday 
when a driver fleeing another crash went through a red light at 50 m.p.h. and 
broadsided their car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Contreras Jr., 34, died instantly. Christine Contreras, 14, died hours 
later at UC Irvine Medical Center. A second passenger, Contreras' niece, 
sustained a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's deputies, Candido Diaguerro Castrejon, 28, of Anaheim 
was driving his pickup west on Katella Avenue just after midnight when he had a 
minor collision with a car at Gilbert Street. He then sped off, with the victim 
of the first accident in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Two blocks later, at Magnolia and Katella avenues, Castrejon sped through a 
red light and collided with Contreras' car, said Orange County sheriff's 
spokesman Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Castrejon tried to run, but the driver from the first accident quickly caught 
him, Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Castrejon was treated for a chin cut and booked at Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. A sheriff's spokesman said he also had 
failed a field sobriety test. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Garcia, the manager of a Taco Bell near the accident, said, "I heard 
the tires and the impact." She called 911 and rushed outside, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She saw the surviving girl climb out the back window of the car. Garcia gave 
her a store jacket to keep warm. The girl said the other people in the car were 
her uncle and her cousin, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was telling me she didn't know where she was. She was asking me what 
happened; where was she. She was crying. I tried to not let her go into deeper 
shock. I tried to keep her warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Reina Contreras, 14, of Garden Grove, was listed in good condition Monday 
night at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, a manager at a screw distribution company in Orange, leaves five 
other children, ranging in age from 2 to 17, and his wife, Antonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have been together for 20 years, recently moved into a house 
from a small apartment in Santa Ana, fulfilling their lifelong dream of having 
more space for their family, Antonia Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to work a lot. He never wanted to stay home even when he was sick. 
He always wanted to provide a good life for all his children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine, an eighth-grader at Spurgeon Junior High, was an energetic 
teen-ager who was "very outgoing, loved to talk to friends on the phone and 
loved to dance," her mother said tearfully in the couple's bedroom, surrounded 
by her children and other family members. "Her dream was to be a model one 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Asif Merchant, 38, co-owner of United Screw of California where Contreras 
worked, said he was "a warm and hard-working man who was knowledgeable and 
reliable. He always cared for his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant said his company is contributing money to help the family cover the 
burial fees.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm most worried for my kids," Antonia Contreras said. "The children must now 
live without a dad." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said donations may be sent to Antonia Contreras, 2810 W. Saint 
Gertrude Place, Santa Ana, Calif. 92704.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: SANTA ANA; 2 INMATES ALLEGE DEPUTIES BEAT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two County Jail prisoners alleged that they received broken bones and other 
injuries following beatings by sheriff's deputies while the prisoners were 
confined to disciplinary isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court, attorney and inmate rights 
advocate Dick Herman charged that one prisoner's jaw and elbow were broken and 
another had a metal, surgical pin forcibly removed from his injured hand in 
tangles with guards during the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing nothing that speaks well for the county," Herman said. "All of 
these injuries could be avoided. Neither the guards nor the prisoners are Boy 
Scouts. We acknowledge that. But this is excessive punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Assistant Sheriff John (Rocky) Hewitt said the 
incidents were investigated by the department and the allegations were found to 
be without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman "simply does not have the right to make false allegations as if they 
were true," Hewitt said. "We just simply do not tolerate inappropriate behavior 
by our staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman said the beatings of prisoners Cole Weddleton and Andrew Lesky occurred 
at the county's Intake/Release Center in Santa Ana and were alleged to be, in 
part, "retaliation" for prior complaints the inmates had made to their 
attorneys about jail conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said the incidents violate terms of a 1978 federal court order 
that continues to provide a standard for inmate care and treatment in the 
county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's complaint alleged that guards broke Weddleton's elbow, and while his 
arm was in a splint, "the 155-pound diabetic was subdued by a group of 
200-pound guards" who repeatedly struck Weddleton in the face with closed 
fists. In the later incident, Weddleton's jaw was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesky reportedly received injuries in a separate confrontation with guards, 
requiring him to wear a neck collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt refuted the attorney's claims, saying that Weddleton refused to 
cooperate with guards while being returned to his cell. During the standoff, 
Hewitt said, Weddleton reportedly told guards that they would have to 
"physically" force him in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lesky's case, Hewitt said the prisoner has a history of fabricating medical 
complaints and was not mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the alleged beatings, Weddleton and Lesky were assigned to 
"permanent disciplinary isolation status" along with a third inmate, James 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddleton was convicted of grand theft, drug and parole violation charges and 
was transferred to state prison last week. Lesky is awaiting trial on burglary 
and probation violation charges. Reynolds is awaiting trial on attempted 
murder, aggravated mayhem and parole violation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt said all three were assigned to disciplinary isolation for failing to 
abide by a variety of jail rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports of violence are the first formal complaints since September, when 
state prison officials found that a proliferation of street gang members in the 
Central Jail had caused an increase in violence among inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, officials warned that the problem was "significant" and "will 
occur with increasing frequency and ferocity in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the violent incidents recorded in the study did not involve inmate 
attacks against jail guards or guard attacks on inmates. KEVIN JOHNSON

 Someone discovered the container of muriatic acid about 8:15 a.m., prompting 
officials to close the Crown Valley Parkway on-ramp to northbound Interstate 5, 
CHP Officer Robert Polzin said. Smoke was coming from the container, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; WATER PUMP PROJECT OPPOSITION 
REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some residents continue to oppose construction of a water pumping station at 
Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary School, despite a decision to move the proposed 
well away from nearby homes. The wells would provide water to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing before the Fountain Valley School District Board of 
Trustees last week, some residents said the pump station should not be built on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern is locating it on a piece of property used for education 
purposes," resident Judi Willhite said. "There are other sites in the district 
(where) this could be placed." 
</P>
<P>
 Willhite said the pump station could pose safety hazards to children and added 
that she believes the ground water table should not be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to take action on the proposal at their April 14 
meeting. The district is expected to earn $20,000 a year if trustees approve an 
agreement with Newport Beach to dig the wells, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At recent meetings, residents living next to the school raised concerns over 
noise and vibrations, worrying that their property values could decline if the 
pump station is built. The original proposed site for the wells was at the 
southwest corner of the school, about 35 feet from three homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a attempt to ease those concerns, district officials now have proposed that 
the two wells be drilled on the eastern border of the school site, near a 
church on Magnolia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it appeased some of them, but some people still aren't going to be 
happy," Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said of the new location. 
"They don't want it there, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said he is satisfied that noise and safety concerns have been 
well-addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Larry R. Crandall also said the new location is a suitable solution. 
"I think it's a more sound decision to go to this place on the school grounds 
because it is away from residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Keenan, property chairman of the First Baptist Church-Fountain 
Valley-Huntington Beach, said church officials are not against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Keenan said, the church would prefer that the pump station be built 
elsewhere on the school site, because the new location would interfere with 
plans to expand the church parking lot. He said the church would like to buy a 
portion of the school property to expand its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan also said he has met with Newport Beach officials regarding a proposed 
easement agreement to provide access to the well site from the church 
driveway.DEBRA CANO

the three-member Merit Commission, which reviews disciplinary actions against 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Anji D. Clemens, an assistant principal at Westminster High School, represents 
educators, and Randy Hill, pastor of the First Nazarene Church, represents the 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other residents had also applied for the post, which was vacated when 
Earl French, a member for the past three years, resigned last month after he 
was appointed to the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote on Arnold became unanimous when Councilman Frank G. Fry withdrew his 
nomination of another applicant and decided to support Arnold. Mayor Charles V. 
Smith and council members Tony Lam, Craig Schweisinger and Charmayne S. Bohman 
voted for Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members serve for two years but may be reappointed. Each is paid $25 per 
meeting, up to a maximum of $600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is authorized to conduct public hearings and submit its findings to 
the council, according to City Atty. Richard Jones. During hearings, the 
employee may have an attorney and call witnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook was terminated in February for alleged grand theft and driving a fire 
truck with a suspended driver's license. He has denied the charges and appealed 
to the Merit Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook wants non-binding arbitration, which he claims the firefighters 
contract provides. City officials said the Merit Commission is the proper forum 
and have denied his arbitration request. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, Gilbrook's lawyer, said the case could eventually end up in 
court.BERT ELJERA

 Sponsored by the university's Albert Schweitzer Institute, the concert begins 
at 8 p.m. at the Chapman Chapel at the corner of West Maple Avenue and South 
Grand Street in Orange.

co-director of the Schweitzer Institute and organizer of the benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman Chamber Players, the university's resident chamber ensemble, will 
perform classical pieces from Beethoven and Mozart and other composers.

 Four City Council candidates will face off at a forum Wednesday sponsored by 
the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 During the scheduled 1 1/2-hour event, which starts at 7 p.m. in the City 
Council chambers, the candidates will answer questions from a three-member 
panel, as well as from the audience, on issues related to the April 12 
municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Charles Puckett and Leslie Anne Pontious and challengers 
Michael J. Doyle and Tracy Worley are running for two seats on the council.

<P>
 "It's a community service exercise on the part of the chamber to create the 
most enlightened (voting) public that we possibly can," said Thomas Brennan, 
executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said the panel members are Diane Welch, Vic Gorham and Lou Bone, who 
are all members of the chamber's governmental affairs committee.

<P>
 Fire officials are seeking leads in an arson fire at a day-care center, one of 
two fires Sunday in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire at Kindercare, 25261 Paseo de Alicia, in Laguna Hills, broke out 
about 3 p.m. in a 200-square-foot commercial building. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but damage to the outside of the building was estimated at 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is being called an arson, and officials are asking anyone with 
possible leads to call (714) 744-0400. 
</P>
<P>
 The second fire happened about 8 p.m. in a house at 31171 Casa Grande Drive in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the residents were home, no one was injured, and firefighters 
extinguished the fire in about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners had been preparing to sell their home and had amassed some 
cardboard boxes in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a light bulb there caught the boxes on fire, and it spread 
throughout the house, causing more than $110,000 in damage to the structure and 
contents. ELAINE TASSY

<P>
 How to deal with the traffic problems caused by reconstruction of the El Toro 
"Y" freeway interchange will be discussed at a community forum Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembled at the open house will be several county transportation officials 
who are overseeing the 2 1/2-year, $105-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will take place at Design Center South, 23811 Aliso Creek Road, at 
5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority's goal "is to make the construction 
period as painless as possible for South County residents and businesses," said 
Doug Eberhardt, the agency's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to keep everyone well-informed throughout the construction period." 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-minute video giving an overview of the project will be shown, and 
transportation officials will explain how to use a construction hot line to get 
current information on construction activity. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials will answer questions and offer tips on how to deal with 
freeway traffic during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about express bus and commuter rail schedules will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Orange County Chambers of Commerce is working with the county to 
help ease the pressure the freeway project will place on area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "These open houses are a great opportunity for residents, employers and 
merchants to learn how the construction project will affect them," said Kate 
Keena, executive director of the regional chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of advance notice will allow people who live, work and shop along 
the corridor time to study alternative transportation options and develop 
marketing strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the meeting, call the chamber at (714) 837-3000 or 
OCTA at (714) 560-5597. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: ANAHEIM; COUNCILMAN PICKLER HURT IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler, who is running for the state Assembly, was in stable 
condition Monday at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana after a weekend car 
accident left him with two broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler, 72, suffered a broken right thighbone, which required surgery, and a 
broken left knee when his Cadillac struck a light pole Saturday.Police said he 
was swerving to miss a car that turned in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hospital interview Monday, Pickler said his injuries will not deter him 
from running for Garden Grove Republican Curt Pringle's 68th District Assembly 
seat or fulfilling the remainder of his council term, which expires in 
November. Pickler is seeking the district's Democratic nomination in June's 
primary against Linda Kay Rigney of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to let a little thing like this slow me down," said Pickler, a 
retired businessman who has been on the council since 1982. "I'll be out of 
here in a week, and I'll be in a wheelchair for a while. I won't be able to 
knock on doors (for the Assembly race) like I wanted to, but I'll get somebody 
to drive me around. I just need to be able to sit behind a desk to get the 
things done that I need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler was driving west on Orange Avenue at 12:28 p.m. Saturday when an 
eastbound car driven by Karrie Ann Huss, 18, of Anaheim, turned left onto 
Western Avenue in front of Pickler's car, Anaheim Police Lt. Ray Welch said. 
When Pickler swerved, Huss' car clipped his, causing him to lose control and 
hit the pole, Welch said. Huss was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 No citations have been issued, and the accident is still being investigated, 
Welch said.TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: COSTA MESA; MOM SCHOOL 
PATROL MAY GET RADIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of mothers who patrol schoolyards and bus stops may soon have portable 
radios to help them guard against gangs and ensure swifter response from 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Weichman, a realtor and member of the local Coalition for Responsible 
Government, said his group has raised more than $900 to buy three portable 
radios and a base station. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program started in November, about 20 mothers patrol spots near 
schools and bus stops at various times throughout the day when children are 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see some improvement," said Roy Alvarado, a counselor who helped start the 
patrol group, known as Madres Costa Mesa. "The kids seem to behave themselves 
better when they see the mothers around." 
</P>
<P>
 Weichman said he received an offer to buy a used set of radios for $800, and 
he plans to examine them today. He said many people have donated money to help 
the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said the women should be able to alert police more quickly with the 
radios. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would not be intervening," Alvarado said. "They would be reporting 
anything out of the ordinary to the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the danger of gangs, the patrol groups have spotted traffic problems 
around the schools, including inadequate signs and dangerous drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wanting to donate money for the radios can call Weichman at (714) 
241-4532.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS HINT AT JOB ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve a three-year wage agreement 
with Orange County sheriff's deputies today, while county firefighters hint at 
possible job actions as contract negotiations crawl toward their ninth month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're angry and frustrated," said Dallas Jones, president of the Orange 
County Firefighters Assn."I think we're just a few weeks away from either 
reaching an agreement or taking some other action. Anything is possible at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the 450-member association has been working without a contract 
since July but declined to disclose details about the union's requests. An 
official familiar with the discussions, however, said the firefighters were 
asking for a 12% wage increase over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials were offering a 6% increase over the same period of time, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have not met since Feb. 17. The next negotiating session has 
been scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, two units of sheriff's deputies staged separate sickouts 
in protest of their protracted contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, supervisors are expected to approve a three-year work agreement, 
providing deputies with 3.5% raises in each of the last two years. Deputies 
tentatively approved the contract in a vote last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he hoped that the agreement with the deputies would move officials 
closer to a deal with the firefighters.KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; SWITCH TO COUNTY FIRE SERVICE 
DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county proposal made public Monday for fire protection in Buena Park could 
save the cash-strapped city $500,000 a year, but it would also eliminate one of 
the city's four engine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those predictions come as the city considers the prospect of eliminating its 
own independent fire department and contracting with the county for service. 
The Orange County Fire Department would absorb the city's 61 Fire Department 
employees into its own staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its final proposal, the county suggested two separate options 
Monday for executing the merger. Both would cut an engine company at 
headquarters. But the first proposal would increase the city's one truck 
company to four firefighters at a cost of $4.7 million, while the second would 
keep the company at its current level of three firefighters at a cost of $4.4 
million. The truck company has aerial and rescue equipment; engine companies 
have basic firefighting equipment, including hoses, water and pump. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Fire Department's budget is estimated at $5.1 million, but 
Finance Director Greg Beaubien said that the budgeted figure may grow higher 
than projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reservations by some city officials about the idea of contracting with 
the county, Fire Chief Herb R. Jewell gave his endorsement Monday to the 
county's first proposal, including the addition of one firefighter at the truck 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan, he said, "would provide the city of Buena Park with an adequate 
level of fire protection services within the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit by decreasing revenues, city officials agreed to look at cost-cutting 
alternatives to provide fire protection services to the community. Last May, 
city officials asked the county to examine how much it would cost Buena Park to 
contract for fire protection services. 
</P>
<P>
 Community meetings will be held April 4 and 18 at 6 p.m. in the City Council 
chambers to discuss the issue. The council isn't expected to make a decision 
until May. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as that meeting approaches, Beaubien said the estimated $500,000 cost 
savings could change. That estimate "is by no means a hard and fast number," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien also said the city is preparing its own estimate of how much it might 
save by relying on the county for fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders said Monday that they want more public input on the proposal 
before a decision is made, and one council member is opposed to the city giving 
up its own department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don R. Griffin said that the city and its residents would lose if 
the county takes over fire protection services. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that city will definitely lose control of its own abilities to 
make decisions, control costs and to make adjustments" for the community's 
needs, Griffin said. "I feel that the proposal by the county is a reduction to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone, meanwhile, said that "if there are significant savings, 
then I owe it to the public to take a serious look. But money won't be the 
final determiner for me. Protection of our citizens has got to be the No. 1 
issue. I've got to know that our existing personnel are being treated fair." 
</P>
<P>
 A member of Buena Park Firemen's Assn., who asked to remain anonymous, said 
Monday that many of the department's firefighters favor the switch to the 
county. With the exception of several high-ranking fire officials, all of the 
department's employees would switch over to the county fire department at their 
current ranks under the county plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty fair offer from an employee point of view," the union 
official said. "It's a practical proposal." DEBRA CANO

<P>
 The school board tonight will kick off a major fund-raising drive aimed at 
collecting $7 million to improve high-technology curricula in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's Foundation for the Future will target both corporations and 
individuals for contributions during a three-year campaign designed by a 
private fund-raising firm.The Irvine Co. already has agreed to donate $3 
million, and Dimension Cable will give $700,000 in cash and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members said the campaign will provide the Irvine Unified School 
District with money and materials it cannot currently afford in an era of 
cost-cutting. The three goals of the fund-raising effort are to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Give students more hands-on experience with high-technology items like 
computers and give them the tools to successfully use the latest technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * Train teachers so that they can effectively provide high-technology 
instruction to students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decide how to test students on the new high-tech skills they are taught.

 A man was arrested here early Monday after allegedly robbing another man of 
his car in Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacking occurred about 11:30 Sunday night, when Gregory Prophet, 19, 
allegedly approached a 20-year-old man at an In-N-Out Burgers restaurant at 600 
S. Brookhurst in Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prophet, whom police say was armed with a knife, started an argument with 
Trevor Williams and managed to get him out of his 1993 Black Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
 After Anaheim police sent out a countywide radio bulletin, Prophet was found 
in the Honda and arrested by Huntington Beach police in a Circle K parking lot 
on Bolsa Chica Street about 1:50 a.m. He was taken to Huntington Beach City 
Jail, where he was booked for suspected carjacking and armed robbery.ELAINE

 A house painter has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend's 
22-month-old child, Newport Beach police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, 32, was arrested Sunday in Costa Mesa, a day after he had 
been released on $10,000 bail.He initially had been arrested on suspicion of 
corporal punishment of Tyler Jaeger, the only child of Karey Jaeger, 22, of 
Newport Beach. But an autopsy found abnormal hemorrhage of the child's liver 
and pancreas due to infliction of a blunt instrument, said Sgt. John Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback is being held without bail and will be arraigned Wednesday in 
Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The child had been recovering from a previous head injury when Laudenback 
brought him to Hoag Hospital Friday with a fractured skull.  
</P>
<P>
 A memorial fund has been set up by Jaeger and her parents, Don and Gayle, at 
the Bank of America in Glendora to defray medical and funeral costs and to help 
the special-education children she teaches, said Don Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought it would be neat to help out the only kids she has left," he said 
of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to the Tyler Jaeger Memorial Fund can be made to Bank of 
America, 115 W. Foothill Blvd., Glendora, Calif. 91741.

SHOOTING REFLECTS CHANGE IN CAFE TRADITION, SOME SAY; CRIME: POLICE SAY THERE 
IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR EARLIER STATEMENT THAT THE WESTMINSTER ATTACK, 
WHICH LEFT 1 DEAD, WAS GANG-RELATED.

<P>
 For years, the coffee shops in Little Saigon were neighborhood haunts where 
elders, poets and everyday people met to swap stories over cups of chilled 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a weekend shooting at the Cafe Mozart that left one young man dead 
and three other people wounded, some in the Vietnamese community fear that the 
traditional gathering places are attracting a different kind of customer. "Now 
you go into a lot of the coffee shops and most of the people don't have a job, 
no skills and are very depressed -- especially young people," said Andrew 
Hoang, spokesman for the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster. "It 
just takes a few seconds for someone to think about pulling a gun . . . because 
someone is staring at their girlfriend or they had some argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before midnight Saturday, two gunmen strode into the crowded Cafe Mozart 
at 7915 Westminster Blvd. and opened fire. Le Quan Nguyen, 20, of Garden Grove, 
was killed. A 16-year-old boy, whom police did not identify, was shot in the 
back and is paralyzed. He remains in critical condition at Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center. Two 19-year-old women, one shot in the elbow and the other in 
the knee, were treated at Garden Grove Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suspects remained at large Monday and there were no new developments in 
the case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was initially characterized by police as gang-related because of 
the method of attack and the absence of an obvious motive. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, authorities acknowledged that they had no hard evidence to 
support that claim. According to Police Lt. Mike Schliskey, ) police announced 
that the shooting was gang-related based upon a statement by the 16-year-old 
victim, who told investigators he thought one of the attackers might have been 
a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could very possibly be rival gangs involved, but we don't know at this 
point," Schliskey said Monday. Most of the 18 witnesses -- including the 
victims themselves -- have refused to cooperate with investigators, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tony Lam, a member of the city's Partnership in Crime Prevention 
Task Force, disputed authorities' earlier assertion that the attack was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is merely speculation based on hearsay from the boy himself," Lam said. 
"Until I get hard evidence, I can't draw the conclusion that it was 
gang-related." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said he believes the city's gang problem is decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an isolated case," he said. "These were young, uncontrolled 
people working on hot temperament."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; AN APPEAL WITH LITTLE APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California appears perilously close to throwing good money after bad in 
appealing a $1.35-million judgment in a wrongful-termination suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office said it will appeal last month's Superior Court 
jury award to former Cal State Fullerton volleyball Coach Jim Huffman. The 
state also was ordered to pay $300,000 to Huffman's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying facts in the case make it easy to see how the jury reached its 
decision. And the problem with any appeal is that a judgment accrues interest 
at 7% a year, meaning the state is now running a bill of nearly $10,000 a month 
in this case. Huffman's lawyers said their fees could grow by $200,000 by the 
time the appeal is settled. If the state lost again, it would have to pay that 
bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman coached the women's volleyball team for three years, but in January of 
1992 the school announced it was dropping the sport. Huffman and others quickly 
filed suit against the university, contending it was discriminating against 
women and thus violating state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 20, 1992, a Friday, a Superior Court judge ordered the university to 
reinstate the program. On March 23, a Monday, the school fired Huffman. At the 
trial, one witness testified that on the day the court ordered the sport 
reinstated, the university's vice president for academic affairs said the 
school must "get rid of" Huffman because he had caused so much aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 The university said it had decided to dismiss Huffman months earlier but 
delayed action to let him and the sport leave campus together, in an effort to 
make the termination less of a stigma for Huffman. However, a juror said the 
university produced no "paper trail" to back up its argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State University system is strapped for cash and has been raising 
student fees. The interest expense in this case would cover tuition for a good 
number of students. A school spokesman said the decision on appealing is up to 
the attorney general's office. However, both should look at this matter again 
and decide whether simple fairness, plus fiscal prudence, indicate it is time 
to pay the penalty.

MOTHER GUILTY OF OFFERING BRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Buena Park mother has pleaded guilty to two felony counts of attempting to 
bribe and intimidating witnesses against her sons in separate gang-related 
robbery and sexual assault cases, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Trinidad Rodarte, 43, offered one woman $500 in June, 1993, to retract 
her identification of Lino Rodarte, 21, as one of several gang members who 
robbed a pizza delivery man, said Deputy Dist. Atty.John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was offered money to come to court and change her identification, 
basically to say she was now unsure," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second, unrelated incident, Maria Rodarte was charged with intimidating a 
victim between December, 1990, and January, 1991, into changing her testimony 
against Raul Rodarte, 24, who was accused of robbery and sexual assault, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lino Rodarte later pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to 160 days in 
jail, he said. The sexual assault case against Raul Rodarte was dropped when 
the victim refused to cooperate because she feared for her family's safety, but 
Rodarte is currently serving a prison term for his role in a drive-by shooting, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Rodarte, who entered her guilty plea Friday, faces a maximum term of 
three years and eight months in prison when she is sentenced May 30. However, a 
judge who has reviewed her case indicated that he will not sentence Rodarte to 
more than one year in jail and three years' probation, he said.

NIRVANA? OR NOWHERESVILLE?; LIFESTYLE: PARENTS MOVED TO THE FOOTHILLS FOR

<P>
 It's Friday night and Ryan (Red) Walker of Rancho Santa Margarita is faced 
with the same question that's on the minds of many South County foothill 
community teen-agers come the weekend: What's there to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing -- not anywhere close," said the 17-year-old Trabuco Hills High 
School student, seated with a handful of his buddies at a table in front of a 
coffee shop in the Trabuco Hills Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The strip shopping center in northern Mission Viejo, nearly five miles from 
the heart of Rancho Santa Margarita, is the closest thing to night life for 
foothill community teen-agers who otherwise must drive even farther out of the 
area for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 16-year-old Kendra Kofro, whose family moved to Rancho Santa Margarita 
six years ago: "The community is all based on young families and children." But 
for teen-agers, "there's nothing to do really. We were just in Longs 
(drugstore) deciding what to do. We'll probably just go to somebody's house or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of South County's foothill communities -- which include Rancho Santa 
Margarita, Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and 
Robinson Ranch -- may overwhelmingly view their area as a favorable place to 
live (82%, according to The Times Orange County Poll). But the same rural 
isolation that their parents relish is, for many teen-agers, the area's major 
drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 As Coto de Caza resident Bill Cowdrey, 34, put it: "I love it because there's 
nothing to do. It's peaceful, and that's why the kids don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem of bored teen-agers is one that the suburbs have always 
struggled with," said Times pollster Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine urban 
sociologist.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem, however, is given short shrift by foothill community adults. A 
scant 3% of poll respondents named the lack of activities for teens as the 
biggest problem facing their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But while teen-agers may grumble about having nothing to do, their elders 
overwhelmingly view the South County foothill communities as an ideal place to 
raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the area is one that prides itself on being family-oriented, and there 
are numerous organized sporting activities for children -- witness the nearly 
3,000 foothill community parents and children who turned out at a Rancho Santa 
Margarita park on a recent Saturday morning for the opening day of Little 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a community that's set up for families," said Craig Lipus, 38, of 
Portola Hills, waiting for his 10-year-old son, Garrett, to parade by. "It's 
like everybody has two kids and either a Volvo wagon or a Suburban." 
</P>
<P>
 With a laugh, the father of three added: "I just bought a Suburban last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Are there many activities for younger children living in the 5,000-acre 
master-planned "urban village" of Rancho Santa Margarita? 
</P>
<P>
 "Scads," said Phyllis Spruill, a Rancho Santa Margarita mother of two young 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably too much," added her husband, James, with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do it all," agreed his wife. "There are lots of opportunities for 
parents to get involved with their children. That's one of the assets I see out 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly nine in 10 poll respondents strongly agree the foothill communities are 
a good place to raise children. Residents are far more positive about the 
area's suitability for kids than people living in South County (56%) or North 
County (36%) are about their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with that view, foothill community residents are much more likely than 
the rest of the county to be raising children. Fifty-four percent of households 
have children at home, compared to 43% countywide.  
</P>
<P>
 Living in a more rural community, added James Spruill, "gives you more of a 
sense of security than in larger cities."  
</P>
<P>
 About half of foothill community residents, according to the Times poll, are 
convinced that their neighborhoods are separate and distinct from the rest of 
the county and safe from crime and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill community residents also are considerably more secure about their 
children's safety at school or in their neighborhoods than are residents 
countywide. Only 13% say they worry "a great deal" about their children 
becoming crime victims at school or in their neighborhoods. Countywide, 43% 
worry a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the foothill communities have reason to feel more secure. They 
live in an area where crime, when it does occur, typically amounts to no more 
than residential and property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 For "as many people (who) are living out there, the crime rate is really 
rather low," said Sheriff's Department Sgt. Larry Jones, who knows of no gangs 
in any of the foothill communities, and other than a few isolated incidents of 
graffiti, he is not aware of any problems with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean they don't get into mischief.  
</P>
<P>
 Coto de Caza resident Cowdrey said he has noticed a growing problem with 
vandalism to public facilities within his gated community. "I haven't seen 
graffiti, but they break light bulbs, knock over (structures) and have damaged 
the golf course on occasion." And, he said, someone "drove a four-wheel (drive) 
vehicle onto the greens a year or so ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowdrey emphasizes that "we have some great teens, but I think that inactivity 
can get them in trouble. They don't have a lot of positive things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Thompson, 43, a Rancho Santa Margarita father of two, laments the lack 
of things for teen-agers to do. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his 14-year-old daughter is involved in Explorer Scouts and takes 
classes at a martial arts school one night a week, "but there's really no place 
kids can go here except Taco Bell or Burger King." 
</P>
<P>
 Kofro, a sophomore at Trabuco Hills High School, said she would like to see a 
miniature golf course in Rancho Santa Margarita. Or a bowling alley. Or just "a 
place to hang out, like a Family Fun Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of entertainment for Rancho Santa Margarita and other foothill 
community teens prompts many of them to head to the Trabuco Hills Center and 
the adjacent Portola Plaza in northern Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, though, they are under the watchful eye of uniformed security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a recent Friday night was uneventful, the two centers have a history 
of attracting throngs of teen-agers who don't always go unnoticed by adult 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Complains Portola Hills resident Lipus: "I have a problem when I drive through 
(Portola Plaza) and there are 20 of them sitting in their cars smoking 
cigarettes and you ask them to move and they look at you and say something 
rude." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sheriff's Department Lt. Dan Martini, who lives near the two shopping 
centers, said the "sometimes rude" teen-agers sitting outside Diedrich's 
coffeehouse make him and his wife so uncomfortable they have started going to a 
different coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taco Bell in Portola Plaza has been the flash point of many of the 
problems at the two centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the natural draw because of the (low) price of their food," said 
Sheriff's patrol Sgt. Fred Lisanti, who is assigned to Mission Viejo Police 
Services. "What happens is you get a lot of kids who go there who are not doing 
anything wrong, but then you get the 5% or 10% who appear to be bad kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some fights, minors drinking alcohol, and there have been some 
allegations of sales of narcotics and that kind of stuff occurring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lisanti said the problems in the two shopping centers have decreased 
dramatically over the past five months since the hiring of security guards, 
stricter enforcement and the presence of the Delta Unit, a special Sheriff's 
Department undercover unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Martini acknowledges that the situation has improved, he emphasizes 
that it has yet to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It irritates me to hear kids tell me, 'We don't have anything else to do' and 
'This is the only place we have to go,' " he said. "What it tells me is maybe 
in that child's mind that's true, but to me it's something the parents need to 
be aware of if there's that lack of recreation. Maybe it's a matter of 
transporting them to the right location to get them involved in the right 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Ranch teen-agers can at least look forward to a 24-screen AMC movie 
theater opening in the first part of 1995 in the community's new Towne Centre, 
and a cinema complex is also planned for the ongoing development of Rancho 
Santa Margarita's Town Center throughout the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no current plans either for a Family Fun Center type of facility 
or an indoor teen center in Rancho Santa Margarita, according to Santa 
Margarita Co. spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they haven't ruled out a teen center, she said, they have found in 
looking at youth centers in other communities that while the centers provide 
activities for teens, they also may attract problems. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid creating a potentially troublesome "congregation point" for 
teen-agers, she said, they have found that the key is not necessarily providing 
a place but activities and programs for teens. 
</P>
<P>
 And the best way to do that, she said, seems to be community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rancho Santa Margarita, she said, most teen activities such as dances, 
athletics, clubs and holiday events are offered through the schools, churches, 
the YMCA and the Community Activities and Service Assn., or CASA, a volunteer 
group that organizes local events. 
</P>
<P>
 South County's new foothill communities, of course, don't own the franchise on 
teens with little to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The suburbs, pollster Baldassare said, "tend to do much better at creating 
environments for families with young children than for adolescents, and this is 
because many of the amenities which teens would like nearby tend to be just the 
kind which older suburb residents try to keep away because they bring noise and 
traffic and crime and other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of things to do for teen-agers, Baldassare said, "puts special 
pressures on high schools and other institutions to take up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 And if teen-agers don't find good things to do in the neighborhoods, 
Baldassare said, "chances are they're going to go elsewhere and that could lead 
to problems with gangs or getting into other sorts of trouble. But this is an 
area the suburbs have been criticized for as long I've studied them: what to do 
with teens."

 MONDAY: The recession had a crushing impact on residents, who saw their home 
values drop, and on many developers, who had to restructure their plans.

 TODAY: Families are flocking to the new suburbs, where parents praise the many 
activities for youngsters. But for the teens, there's not much to do.

 Far more residents in Orange County's suburban frontier see their communities 
as good places to raise children than do residents elsewhere in the county. 
They also feel more secure about their children's safety. However, North County

PERSONAL HEALTH; HIGH COST LIMITS USE OF NORPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a product that was supposed to represent the best new contraceptive in 
more than two decades, Norplant is not setting any popularity records, a study 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The implant device, which features tiny hormone-containing rods that are 
surgically inserted into the upper arm, was found in a September, 1992, survey 
to be offered in just four of 10 family planning clinics nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings appear in the new issue of Family Planning Perspectives, 
published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is the culprit, according to health experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who obtain Norplant from a private physician probably initially pay more 
than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 And family planning clinics are extremely limited in how widely they can offer 
Norplant because of high upfront costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Women on Medicaid, however, were much more likely to receive the implant, 
raising the criticism that the method might be targeted to very poor, often 
minority women, with the potential danger of these women being pressured to use 
this specific method. 
</P>
<P>
 While the study ended in September, 1992, it is unlikely Norplant usage rates 
have increased much because the high-cost problems remain, officials said.

A WORLD OF HURT; WE'RE FEELING MORE PAIN THAN NECESSARY, EXPERTS SAY. LAWS TO 
PREVENT DRUG ABUSE HAVE DOCTORS WARY, AND PATIENTS DON'T KNOW TO ASK ABOUT 
MEDICATION OPTIONS. BUT RELIEF MAY BE IN SIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 It is one of medicine's great paradoxes: Pain, among the most treatable of 
conditions, is among the least treated. In a nation with the most sophisticated 
medical care in the world, many experts say they find it mind-boggling that the 
comfort of people in pain has been given such a low priority in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in three years, the federal Agency for Health Care Policy 
and Research has sharply criticized pain management practices in the United 
States -- once again raising concerns on how pain is handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone on the panel was very frustrated to know that in 1994 -- 
with this many advances that have occurred in other areas of treatment -- we 
still have such an enormous problem with pain," says Betty R. Ferrell, an 
associate research scientist at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte 
and a panel member. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, studies show that up to 50% of acute pain is under-treated. (As 
many as 2 million Californians needlessly suffer from acute or chronic pain.) 
As a result, the healing process is slowed, hospital stays are lengthened and 
the size of medical bills increased. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the panel's 1992 report -- which recommended several improvements in 
treating pain after surgery or trauma -- no one was spared criticism in the 
most recent report: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumers were faulted for being unaware that pain can and should be 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health professionals often receive little training in pain assessment and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laws to thwart drug abuse and drug trafficking prevent doctors from 
prescribing enough medication to help their patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the first time, Ferrell says, there is progress on all three fronts. 
The Law 
</P>
<P>
 The story goes like this: A New York state oncologist was prescribing a large 
supply of narcotics to a cancer patient in the course of a long, horrid 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But state regulators, who monitor the prescription of narcotics and other 
potent drugs, were suspicious of the doctor's heavy use of the prescription 
pad. The authorities called the doctor to a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physician showed why the patient needed these amounts of drugs, and the 
(authorities) still reprimanded the physician," says Ada Jacox, a pain expert 
at Johns Hopkins University who is familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of case, she says, has "a chilling effect. Doctors are then 
conservative about prescribing enough medication." 
</P>
<P>
 California is no exception to this predicament. But, recently, in a 
ground-breaking meeting, medical experts and state lawmakers met to try to 
resolve one of the thorniest issues in pain management: How to stop drug abuse 
and illegal trafficking but ensure that patients in pain get appropriate 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies show doctors tend to reduce the use of more potent drugs and go to 
less powerful drugs" when faced with prescription monitoring, Jacox says. "And 
you are dealing with a situation where patients are already under-medicated." 
</P>
<P>
 In California and a few other states, doctors are required to use triplicate 
prescription pads for narcotics; a copy is filed with the state Bureau of 
Narcotics Enforcement for monitoring purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that when triplicate laws are enacted, prescriptions for 
narcotics drop 50%. While doctors are still free to prescribe the drugs, many 
are uncomfortable that the state is looking over their shoulders, Ferrell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very significant problem," she says. "This is an example of how a very 
compassionate physician who wants to provide pain management faces a barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, discussion has turned to whether to rescind California's 
triplicate prescription law. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Shoquist, a representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration in 
Fresno, says physicians in California are rarely called on to justify their 
prescriptions. Even so, the triplicate system helps to deter the misuse of 
drugs for illicit purposes, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But a study by David Joranson of the University of Wisconsin found that "it's 
not very conclusive that states with triplicates do a better job on drug 
diversion." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "there is a great deal of hesitation" to give up triplicate 
prescription, an alternative that may benefit both patients and law enforcement 
agencies is within reach, says Bill Marcus, liaison counsel for the California 
Board of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative is a computer system connecting pharmacies to a state office 
where prescriptions could be monitored electronically. The system would be more 
convenient for doctors ordering narcotics by lessening the paperwork and might 
ease some of the stigma. Health Care Providers 
</P>
<P>
 He never imagined it would be this bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Russell was undergoing the first of 26 radiation treatments for throat 
cancer, and he was in unbearable pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt so bad that I almost lost my mind," recalls Russell, who was treated 
at the City of Hope. "The radiation melted my throat, melted the tissue 
together. The skin was gone from ear to ear, from my clavicle to my chin." 
</P>
<P>
 When his oncologist saw how miserable Russell was, he quickly called in the 
hospital's pain management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Having his pain brought under control was, Russell says, the most important 
part of his fight against throat cancer. Without the swift, effective treatment 
by the pain team, he could not have endured more treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their personal attention to my problem was constant and effective," says 
Russell, 62, of Visalia. "That allowed me to make a decision concerning my 
treatment. When you are in the degree of pain that I had, you can't walk in and 
say, 'Do that to me again.' I received (pain medication) sufficient to allow me 
to make a proper decision to go ahead with the treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 But the "pain team" that aided Russell is still a rarity in most hospitals. 
Moreover, even with electronic monitoring of prescriptions, many physicians 
would be reluctant to prescribe narcotics to help patients in intractable pain, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of medical board members across the United States found that 25% of 
the doctors regarded the use of opiods as "illegal and unacceptable," says 
Joranson, a survey author. Opiods, such as morphine and Demerol, are commonly 
needed to alleviate severe pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey shows that some doctors fear the medications even more than laws 
governing their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many physicians lack knowledge about pain medications, overturning the 
triplicate program won't solve all cases of under-treatment of pain, warns Dr. 
H. Westley Clark of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the attitude is that the physician should not prescribe narcotics, then 
any prescription for narcotics is going to be unacceptable. Doctors' attitudes 
and knowledge about pain must change," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pain has never been considered a health care problem in its own right," says 
Jane Cowles, author of the new book "Pain Relief." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has never been part of the standard medical school curriculum despite 
(doctors') moral, ethical and legal mandate to relieve pain." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of expertise is discouraging because it is possible to treat most 
pain, even the most severe pain, says the City of Hope's Ferrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a saying that the relief of cancer pain awaits no scientific 
breakthrough. We have the answer, and that is one of the things that makes (the 
failure to treat) most frustrating," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Health professionals are still affected by many myths and biases that 
interfere with effective pain management, Cowles says, such as the fear of 
addiction -- which studies show is unfounded -- and the doctor's preset notion 
about how much discomfort a procedure or disease should cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals and clinics are also being encouraged to develop specific plans for 
pain management and to appoint pain specialists in their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, which 
reviews hospitals for accreditation, has also begun to look at pain. The agency 
is surveying hospitals on their pain-management practices and may add a 
pain-management requirement to the accreditation criteria.  
</P>
<P>
 Medical and nursing schools are also coming under pressure to augment their 
teachings on pain. Nursing students receive an average of 3.9 hours of time on 
pain management, according to a study by Ferrell. Another study found that the 
average medical student has one hour of study on pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see this gap between what we are taught formerly in school and actual 
practice where every day you encounter patients in pain," Ferrell says. "If we 
don't start educating nursing and medical students, we can't make effective 
progress." The Patient 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers also need education on pain treatments, experts say. But, unlike 
some health professionals, patients seem eager to embrace a more activist role, 
says Jacox, co-chair of the recent cancer-pain guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research released its first report 
on pain management in 1992, it was deluged with requests from consumers for the 
document, Jacox says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrell, however, thinks consumers are still too timid to ask for the pain 
management they deserve, in part because they too have misconceptions about 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 barrier is educating patients and families so that they know to 
expect pain management," she says. "People expect pain and they don't 
understand that something can be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, patients unreasonably fear drug addiction or side effects from 
medication. Or they resist taking medication "too early" because they think it 
won't work later. And, in some cultures, not being able to withstand pain is a 
sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Opiods and other strong medications do carry the risk of side effects, such as 
sedation, constipation or even allergic reaction. The risk of becoming 
addicted, however, is extremely small -- about three-hundreds of 1%, according 
to one oft-cited study. 
</P>
<P>
 What needs to happen, Ferrell says, is the kind of movement in the 1970s and 
'80s that led women to demand control over their pain-relief options during 
childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think change is coming and patients are going to start seeing written 
materials on what they can do," she says. "It's a growing movement. Obviously, 
we have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers need to expect adequate pain relief in the same way they expect 
competent overall care, Cowles says.  
</P>
<P>
 "People need to be reassured that 90% of all pain can be alleviated," she 
says. "And if their doctor is not actively trying to do that, they are not 
getting the best care possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should be told of the many options to relieve pain, Cowles says, 
including exercise, support and relaxation as well as medications. 
</P>
<P>
 New tools have been developed to help people communicate about pain, such as 
numerical scales for patients to rate their pain, and diaries to keep track of 
the patterns of pain and what relief measures work best, Cowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now, patients will have to become activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to come from the top down," Cowles warns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the consumer who learns how to ask for it. When the consumer 
starts asking for the care they deserve, it will start happening." Information

MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS; COUPLES: TAX SEASON DRIVES OTHERWISE COMPATIBLE PARTNERS 
TO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE PERSONALITY SPECTRUM. THE RESULT? DISPUTES THAT CAN BE 
TAXING INDEED. 
</P>

<P>
 The window panes quiver. The door jambs shudder. The neighbors cover their 
ears and mutter, "Oh no, they're at it again." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to feel ashamed. You are merely in the midst of your annual tax fight 
-- an imbroglio waged by countless couples who see the 1040 form as a 
declaration of domestic war. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the prospect of assessing the year's financial adventures, "people 
revert to their oldest, most dysfunctional forms of behavior," said Washington, 
D.C., psychotherapist Olivia Mellan, author of "Money Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 Meaning that they act like children? 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly," Mellan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples bicker about record-keeping, said Richard Cassidy, a Brentwood 
accountant. They argue over who wants to stretch a particular deduction. They 
shout about profligacy, such as his Argentine fly-fishing expeditions or her 
passion for expensive shoes. They fume over financial priorities, and 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It's moment-of-truth time for some couples, when they find out how much -- or 
how little -- their partner earned in the past year. If taxes are owed, they 
may spar over where to get the funds. If a refund is due, they may tangle over 
what to do with the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Cassidy has observed, one spouse uses tax time as an opportunity to 
demonstrate his or her superior financial sophistication -- an occasion, in 
short, to make the other spouse feel stupid. Or, there is the hidden bank 
account explosion: the bomb that detonates when one partner finds out that the 
other has squirreled away a secret slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts agree that what all this fighting is really about is power. Tax 
time activates some primal struggle for many otherwise normal adults. Couples 
who appear perfectly peaceable the rest of the year turn into full-assault 
combatants. All it takes is one little document from Uncle Sam, and the 
monetary machine-guns come out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the taxes," said Cassidy, who thinks of himself at this time of 
the year as a full-time accountant and part-time marriage counselor. "There's 
no way anyone could get that heated up over taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell that to Jane, a Riverside office manager who said she recently 
stopped speaking to her husband because of a tax battle. Feverish doesn't even 
come close to describing the mood between Jane and Frank, who threatened bodily 
harm if their actual names were used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at war right now," said Jane, who went ballistic when she learned that 
Frank, an independent contractor, had somehow "forgotten" to pay his quarterly 
tax installments for the last half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been sheer misery," Jane raged. "Frank is a very good person, but 
he is not good when it comes to taxes." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Or there is Shelley, who would allow herself to be described only as working 
"in the nonprofit world" in New York City. Shelley has a doctorate from the 
University of Chicago, an attainment her husband, Bob, loves to taunt her with 
every year when he blasts her for her sloppy accounting habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fastidious record-keeper," Shelley said of Bob, a dentist. "I hardly 
balance my checkbook." She paused. "In fact, I don't balance my checkbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing swords over capital assets (or, for that matter, debits) is something 
of a national pastime, said Howard Markman, director of the University of 
Denver's Center for Marital and Family Studies.  
</P>
<P>
 "It does turn out in our research that money is the No. 1 issue that couples 
fight about," said Markman, who addresses tax tiffs in his book, "We Can Work 
It Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Money acts as a magnet, Markman said, drawing out all kinds of other issues 
that couples may have been avoiding. In particular, he said, "there's often a 
lot of anger buried under money." 
</P>
<P>
 At tax time, said Dr. Bonnie Maslin, a New York City psychologist who is the 
author of "The Angry Marriage," such enmity becomes even more pronounced. 
Clashes in personal management styles are often exaggerated where money and 
taxes are concerned, she said, citing the "NBD" -- for No Big Deal -- conflict 
as a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where you have one spouse who says taxes are not important -- 'it's no 
big deal to me,' " Maslin said. "Just today I talked to a woman whose husband 
was flipping out because if she had had certain papers, they could have saved 
$300 on their taxes. Meanwhile, she's shrugging and saying, 'Oh come on, it's 
only $300, it's no big deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Maslin said she has also encountered marriages where one spouse is a chronic 
risk-taker and the other is a confirmed risk-avoider. "I know someone who says 
'I'm not happy unless the IRS audits me,' " Maslin said. While this man is 
relishing the challenge of beating the government at its own penny-ante game, 
"the wife is terrified of an audit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tax time also brings out the worst in what Maslin calls the "Odd Couple" 
marriage, "where you have a procrastinator married to someone who is always on 
top of things." By postponing his or her portion of the tax preparation, "one 
spouse just passively drives the other one crazy," Maslin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing almost exclusively on money problems among couples, psychotherapist 
Mellan has come up with her own set of oppositional tax forces. Most common are 
hoarder versus spender marriages, she said, followed closely by worrier versus 
avoider, planner versus dreamer and money merger versus money separator. Any of 
those combinations makes for domestic pyrotechnics when tax time rolls around, 
Mellan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that any polarized behaviors you have already developed are 
exaggerated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in any trusted battle strategy, habit sets in, and when April 15 looms 
close, "A lot of the time, people just have the same fight again and again and 
again," Mellan said. 
</P>
<P>
 So common are these disagreements that Van Nuys accountant Michael Bernstein 
sometimes considers attaching a therapy fee to his standard charge for tax 
preparation. Fortunately, Bernstein said: "They usually have a fight after 
their appointment, when they find out what they owe -- not so often in my 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brentwood accountant Cassidy said he has witnessed a few near 
knock-down, drag-out tax fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially when one spouse completely disagrees with the other," he said. "Or 
when one of them doesn't keep the records and just expects the other one to 
solve all the problems." 
</P>

 Maybe so, but some spouses advocate tax abdication as the best tactic of all. 
Tracy Thomas, a graphic artist in Culver City, said that in the tax preparation 
department, he has "willingly acquiesced" to his wife and business partner, 
Pam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pam's the warrior on our personal taxes," Thomas said. "She's the one who 
organizes all that garbage. I lose patience, and my accounting system is 
basically to throw all the stuff into a drawer." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently transplanted from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., writers Heidi 
Yorkshire and Joe Anthony have managed to avoid tax conflagrations in their two 
years of marriage. Maybe that's because both are galled by one particular 
feature of Uncle Sam's idea of family values. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marriage penalty just drives us crazy," Yorkshire said. "We do consider 
getting divorced and not telling anybody, except the government."

COMMUNITIES DO WELL IN SCHOOL; POLL: RESIDENTS ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR KIDS' 
EDUCATION. BUT PUBLIC SUPPORT AND INVOLVEMENT ARE NO ACCIDENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Arroyo Vista Elementary School's production of "Jack and the Giant" isn't 
until May, but Principal Richard Campbell already predicts sold-out shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the children staged "Alice in Wonderland," and every one of the 
multipurpose room's 200-plus chairs was filled. Three shows running. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just parents," Campbell said. "We had a lot of people from the 
community, too, who don't have kids in the school. People are interested in 
what the kids are capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Walter Otto watched similar capacity crowds applaud evening and 
matinee performances of "Peter Pan" in Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate 
School's 300-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is, by definition, a community school," Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two schools exemplify the position neighborhood schools occupy in the new 
South County foothill communities of Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, Dove 
Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Young families have chosen to put down roots here largely because the area 
promised to provide their children with high-quality educations at high-tech 
facilities in safe surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of their children have endured long bus rides and overcrowded 
classrooms during the area's growing pains, most of the settlers speak 
enthusiastically about the schools as places where teachers are motivated and 
students are eager to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, faculty members talk about the interest, participation and 
cooperation they receive from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's really neat about this community is that everybody wants the 
schools to succeed and do really well," said Arroyo Vista Elementary's 
Campbell. "You get a real strong feeling of support from everybody. I don't 
have to go begging for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds (67%) of the communities' residents say they are very satisfied 
with their public schools, compared to 41% of those countywide, according to 
The Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Such support is often easier to find in affluent communities such as these, 
where parents tend to be more highly educated, school officials said. But 
putting schools as focal points in the communities was also done by design. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of local government in those communities, the schools were 
seen as the center of community involvement," said Mary Lou Smith, facilities 
planner for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, which is responsible 
for building and running roughly half the schools in the new growth area. 
</P>
<P>
 A prime example of that interaction between schools and the community, Smith 
said, is Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate School. Its 22-acre campus for 
seventh- and eighth-graders is next to the area's new regional park, and its 
auditorium, gymnasium, running track, tennis courts, play fields and other 
facilities are available for public use during non-school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "That school, all along, has been planned as the central part of Rancho Santa 
Margarita," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the planning, having schools available for the influx of families has 
challenged the two school districts that provide educational facilities and 
services for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the Saddleback district and the Capistrano Unified 
School District have opened four elementary schools, an intermediate school and 
a high school. They have plans to open three more elementary schools, a middle 
school and a high school over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts say they have been able to keep pace with the rapid development 
caused by changes in state law that they sought in the mid-'80s. Those changes 
required developers to pay higher fees or to establish areas called Mello-Roos 
districts, in which homeowners are assessed special taxes to pay for schools. 
The local funds raised are then matched by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we compare our stories to other districts that have had to sue 
developers to get the level of support they needed . . . I would say, overall, 
we have had an outstanding relationship with developers," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the schools haven't always been ready for families to move in, partly 
because the state requires school districts to fill existing classrooms before 
building new ones. Consequently, some of the earliest families to buy homes 
have seen their children bused up to 45 minutes to schools miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, portable buildings had to be brought in when permanent 
classrooms overflowed from a surge of new students. 
</P>
<P>
 For some parents these temporary fixes have been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, they're not planning for the growth well because we're bursting at the 
seams," said a mother whose two sons are in kindergarten and fourth grade at 
Arroyo Vista Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the school has 870 pupils, about 150 more than capacity, requiring 
temporary buildings to house them. Next year it will be worse, with up to 1,000 
children expected. But principal Campbell said the pressure should be eased in 
two years, when the Capistrano district builds another elementary school a few 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and Otto, both veteran school administrators, say a major difference 
they've seen in the new communities from other places they've worked is the 
involvement of developers with the schools. Both said they have regular 
meetings with representatives of the Fieldstone Co. or Rancho Santa Margarita 
Co. to discuss activities or plans for further integrating the schools into 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fieldstone Co., for example, has responded by forming "partnerships" with 
Arroyo Vista Elementary in the Capistrano district and Cielo Vista Elementary 
in the Saddleback district. The company makes annual donations to the schools, 
sponsors jog-a-thons and visiting artists, and its mascot, "Freddy Fieldstone," 
appears at school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts appear to be working for parents such as Shelley and Paul 
Wallace, who moved to the area from Lake Forest three years ago in search of a 
family-oriented neighborhood and a brand-new house. The Wallaces' children, 
Breane, 12, and Jeff, 9, attend Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate and Trabuco 
Mesa Elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Wallace, who is co-president of the school's Student-Teacher-Parent 
Organization, said the state-of-the-art intermediate school has changed her 
daughter from an uninspired to a motivated student. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are just so fortunate to have what they have," Shelley said.

TIPS TO MAKE TAX TIME LESS TAXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the possibilities for arguments may be endless, experts say that -- 
unlike death and taxes -- tax fights can be avoided. Some suggestions for 
quelling the tax volcano before it erupts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Start early.The best time to talk taxes is months in advance, before the air 
becomes charged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set up times to meet when you are not trying to solve anything and instead 
are just trying to get the issues on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at your tax behavior with some detachment. How would you counsel a 
friend who reacts the way you do? 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost everyone has a different interpretation of the value of money. Figure 
out in advance what money means to you and your partner. Does it mean power? 
Love? Criticism? Freedom? Control? Material opulence? 
</P>
<P>
 * Be utterly honest -- and highly specific -- when you share your side of a 
tax conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be brief. Nobody loves a monologue, especially when the subject is money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be polite. ELIZABETH MEHREN

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BENTON OIL FIRM EXPECTS $1.1-MILLION OPERATING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Gas Co. said it expects to report an operating loss for 1993 of 
about $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard energy concern also said it will cut its capital spending on its 
Siberian project because of a $5.50-per-barrel Russian export tax.Benton spent 
a total of $10.2 million to develop the Siberian oil field in 1993. This year, 
it plans to spend about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is discussing with the Russian government a possible 
lifting of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Benton said it will drill six exploratory wells in the Gulf Coast 
region of southern Louisiana. While highly speculative, Benton said, if 
successful the wells could double the company's current production of 5,500 
barrels of oil a day.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FORTUNE PETROLEUM TAKING $2.68-MILLION SPECIAL CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp. in Agoura Hills said it will take a onetime special 
charge of $2.68 million in the fourth quarter of 1993 to reflect lower oil 
prices -- $700,000 more than it had previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum, an independent oil and gas exploration production company, 
said it increased the amount after reviewing a new report on reserves from 
Fortune's independent engineering firm. Fortune Petroleum said that by taking 
this onetime charge, instead of spreading out the effect of lower oil prices in 
1993 over the next several years, its earnings will be higher in 1994 and in 
the future.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERCEPTRONICS PAYS OFF $4 MILLION IN DEBT, SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perceptronics Inc., a Woodland Hills maker of computer simulation software 
used for commercial and military training programs, said it has paid off $4 
million of debt and preferred shares convertible into about 2.5 million shares 
of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt and preferred shares were retired in exchange for about $414,000 and 
259,000 shares of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Perceptronics said the move eliminates $1.25 million in annual debt payments 
that were scheduled to begin in June and returns the company to a positive net 
worth, meaning that its assets now exceed its debts. It will also result in a 
$2-million onetime gain in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31.

LOCAL FIRMS SAY IF CHINA LOSES, THEY DO TOO; TARIFFS: MANUFACTURERS WARN OF 
'MAD DASH' OUT OF ASIAN NATION AND HEAVY TOLL ON BUSINESSES IF THE U.S. REVOKES 
CHINA'S MOST-FAVORED-NATION TRADE STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Solomon, fresh back from a trip to China, where he was checking on 
orders of Flintstone plush toys, has one word to describe what effect China's 
loss of the most-favored-nation trade status would have on his company: 
horrific . 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon is chairman of Dakin Inc., a Woodland Hills marketer of plush toys. At 
least half of Dakin's stuffed animals and other toys are manufactured in China. 
So if that country's MFN status were annulled, as the Clinton Administration 
has threatened because of China's human rights record, Solomon would have big 
cost increases because tariffs on the Chinese-made toys would go up by at least 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, China's MFN trading status allows it to export products to the 
United States under normal, low tariffs. But China's MFN status must be renewed 
annually, and President Clinton has told the Chinese that MFN, which expires in 
June, will not be continued unless Beijing makes substantial progress in human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Without favored-nation trading status, duties on Chinese-made goods would 
increase from an average of 8% to about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 "If MFN were revoked, I would not be out of business," Solomon said. But he 
said he would have to pull out of China, where he contracts with a dozen 
factories that were built by Hong Kong investors, and shift production to other 
Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be chaotic because we wouldn't be the only ones doing it," said 
Solomon, whose private company grossed about $75 million in sales last year. 
"There would be a mad dash out of China" by everyone in the toy industry 
looking for other low-cost manufacturing sites in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dakin is one of many toy, shoe and apparel companies based in the region and 
across the country that expect to be hit hard if China's MFN status is 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S.-China trade last year totaled $39 billion, with China buying $9 billion 
in U. S. products, mostly aircraft and telecommunications equipment, and the 
United States taking in almost $30 billion in Chinese exports, much of them 
toys, shoes and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 While considered unlikely, the possibility that favored-nation status could be 
withdrawn this summer has fueled plenty of concern and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very, very strong personal opinion on it," said Steven Nichols, the 
soft-spoken chairman of K-Swiss Inc., a Chatsworth marketer of sneakers. "If 
you really want to attack communism, you do it with free enterprise, and that 
means free trade," he said, his voice rising. "I don't want to defend China, 
but we're out of our mind not to do business with them every day." 
</P>
<P>
 K-Swiss gets about 1 million pairs of shoes, or about 15% of its annual total, 
from a 75,000-square-foot factory in the countryside along China's southeast 
coast. U. S. tariffs on those shoes average about 10%, but Nichols said they 
would jump to 20% or more if China lost its MFN status. Workers in Chinese shoe 
factories generally make about $60 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Without MFN, "we could not operate there and send shoes to the U. S.," Nichols 
said. "It's difficult enough to compete with Reebok," he said, adding that 
giant U. S. shoe companies such as Reebok and Nike have a greater share of 
their products made in China than K-Swiss, and are very likely to lead an 
exodus out of China if its MFN is not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 K-Swiss, which does about $150 million in annual sales, also buys shoes in 
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. "There is more capacity there," 
Nichols said. "But if China closed down, they would know they could get a 
premium. . . . In the short term, there might be less shoes available and the 
price would go up" for retailers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other U. S. footwear companies, K-Swiss has relied more on China in 
recent years because of wage increases in countries such as Korea. Besides 
lower wages, China's shoe factories, which are owned largely by Taiwanese 
businessmen, have a reputation for high productivity and quality, said Peter 
Mangione, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a 
trade group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anxious about it," Mangione said of U. S.-China trade relations, adding 
that "there are some wild cards in the deck," most notably how China reacts to 
the precarious situation in the Korean peninsula. "Politics is an inexact 
science; we don't know what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mangione's 70 members concerned is Cherokee Shoe of Thousand Oaks, 
which makes one-third of its athletic and casual footwear in China. Cherokee 
Shoe, a unit of the Sunland-based apparel firm Cherokee Inc., does about $30 
million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what human rights has to do with controlling one's economy," 
said John Lovely, executive vice president of Cherokee Shoe, which has been 
struggling enough with the recession. "We're assuming this is not going to 
happen," he said of China's possible change in status. But if it does, "it will 
be costly to us." 
</P>
<P>
 William Mow, founder and chairman of the apparel firm Bugle Boy, in Simi 
Valley, said he has not taken steps to prepare for China's loss of MFN status. 
Mow considers it unlikely to happen because of the importance of the rapidly 
growing Chinese market to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Mow relies on China for 22% of his company's production, which 
translates into 10 million shirts and pants made in China. Mow, whose family 
fled communist China when he was 13, contracts with factories in 26 Chinese 
cities, including Shanghai. Mow says he has to have production spread 
throughout China because there are U. S. quota limits for goods made in China, 
which in turn allocates that quota on a city-by-city basis. 
</P>
<P>
 If China loses its MFN, some of the duties will be 100%, Mow said in an 
interview. "We would definitely have to terminate our business there," said 
Mow, who owns 90% of Bugle Boy, which last year had sales of about $440 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mow says Bugle Boy produces clothes in a dozen other countries. But those 
countries also have U. S. quota limits, and some of them are running at 
capacity. "It would take us two years to allocate the Chinese production." 
</P>
<P>
 Mow worries that revoking China's favored-nation trading status could cost the 
United States its share of the potentially biggest market in the world. "I hope 
we all come to our sanity," he said. "We should be courting them rather than 
dictating to them. We Americans cannot afford to dictate."

COVER STORY; BRILLIANT DEDUCTIONS ARE THEIR SPECIALTY; TAX PREPARATION: TRIPLE 
CHECK INCOME TAX SERVICE MAY BE THE AVIS OF THE INDUSTRY. BUT ITS EMPHASIS ON 
TAILORING RETURNS HAS PROVED LUCRATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David W. Lieberman, president of Triple Check Income Tax Service, has made no 
secret of his desire to steal away some of the "zillions" of taxpayers who 
patronize industry leader H & R Block Inc. every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Triple Check officials joke about stealing customers away from Kansas 
City-based Block, they also know that at best Triple Check can only claim to be 
the Avis of the tax-preparation business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Triple Check, which has actually been in business longer than Block, is 
doing very nicely. The privately held company expects to generate $5 million 
this year in franchise fees and royalties from 325 Triple Check offices in 42 
states, the Virgin Islands and London. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Block reported $729 million in revenues for 1993, said Harry 
Buckley, president of H & R Block Services Inc. Block, which began doing 
business in 1955, has 8,043 tax offices throughout the United States, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have room for growth," deadpanned Triple Check Marketing Director 
Richard Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on which figures are used, Triple Check is either the second- or 
third-largest tax-preparation company behind Block. Jackson Hewitt Inc., based 
in Virginia Beach, Va., has 882 offices and took in about $11 million in 
revenues in 1993, mostly from franchise fees, said founder and Chairman John T. 
Hewitt. "Business is great. We expect to have about 1,000 franchises by 1995," 
Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all of Triple Check's offices, which are mostly franchises, reported 
a combined $27 million in sales in 1993, while Jackson Hewitt offices, which 
are a combination of company-owned and franchise outlets, reported $26 million 
in sales for the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman, former tax counsel for MCA Inc., and a small group of investors 
purchased Triple Check in 1969 for $500,000. The company, which was founded in 
1941 with a single office in Bellflower, consisted of six offices in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties when Lieberman and his group acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the corporate headquarters, the company only owns two offices in Hemet 
and Sun City, near Riverside. The rest are franchises. Block has a large number 
of company-owned offices in addition to franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview at Triple Check's modest corporate offices in Burbank, 
Lieberman explained the company's marketing strategy. "It's simple. We don't 
try to out-Block Block," he said, meaning they chase after a narrower customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Industry officials expect about 110 million individual tax returns to be filed 
this year. Traditionally, individual taxpayers prepare about 50% of the returns 
filed each year, said IRS spokesman Keith Kimball in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley expects H & R Block to prepare more than 20% of the 55 million or so 
tax returns prepared by professionals this year. In 1993, Block prepared about 
13 million returns, Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Triple Check's Tyler said there has not been much growth for his company 
during the past two years because in a recession more people try to save money 
by doing their own taxes. As for the Northridge earthquake, Tyler said the only 
impact on Triple Check has been that more customers have postponed filing their 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said he expects Triple Check offices to prepare about 130,000 
returns this year. Hewitt said his company, founded in 1982, prepared about 
394,000 returns in 1993 and predicted that Jackson Hewitt offices will prepare 
about 550,000 returns this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go by the number of returns, it's no contest" between Block and Triple 
Check, Lieberman said. "But if you talk about the specialized service we offer 
our clients, there's no comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to attract customers from across the board like Block, 
Triple Check has managed to carve out a niche among taxpayers who earn between 
$40,000 and $80,000 annually. Industry officials said Block's traditional 
client base is among middle- to low-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lieberman, Triple Check's tax-preparation fee averages $160, 
while Block's average fee is $56, Buckley said. In addition, he explained, a 
large number of tax returns prepared by Block offices are the 1040 short form 
that does not require taxpayers to itemize deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tax returns prepared by Triple Check offices are more complex 
itemized returns, reflecting the higher fees charged by Triple Check. Each 
return is prepared from itemized work sheets drawn for specific occupations, 
literally from rocket scientist to clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work sheets are geared to ask every possible question in the language of 
that person's occupation. We try to find every legal deduction for our clients. 
When you come to Triple Check, you will bare your soul to me and tell me 
everything about the past 12 months," Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody resists answering our questions, because everyone wants to pay less 
taxes," he added. "They tell us everything about deaths, births, divorces and 
mistresses. Some people get to deduct their mistresses." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Block, which has advertisements running almost nonstop on television 
from January to April, Triple Check does very little advertising. Instead, it 
relies heavily on client referrals and the company's high client-retention 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lieberman, some Triple Check offices have retention rates as high 
as 95%. Overall, the industry's retention rate is about 80%, said Tyler, Triple 
Check's marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Client loyalty is the amazing thing about this business, but the hardest part 
about it is that 50% of Americans prepare their own returns. The remaining 50% 
are a very tough breed to convert if they aren't already your clients," 
Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Triple Check has so far refused to offer its customers is electronic 
filing, as Block and other tax-preparation firms do. Lieberman thinks that the 
extra fees for electronic filing are not worth the slight speedup in getting a 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Triple Check is not just a tax-prep business. The company also 
provides accounting and financial consulting to individuals and small 
businesses. For a monthly fee of between $100 and $200, Triple Check provides 
monthly bookkeeping services along with financial statements to show how 
revenues are being disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has a hot line for use by Triple Check offices to research 
tax laws and regulations for franchisees.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: IMAGE PARES LONG-TERM DEBT BY $2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Image Entertainment Inc., a Chatsworth laser disc distributor, said it has 
voluntarily reduced its long-term debt by $2 million as part of its 
debt-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth time in Image's fiscal year ending March 31, 1993, that the 
company has pared down its long-term debt. Since restructuring last March, 
Image has reduced its long-term debt by $6.5 million, which has cut its annual 
interest payments by $220,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Image also said it was hoping to refinance its remaining $13.5 million in 
long-term debt at lower interest rates.

REORGANIZED DAK INDUSTRIES WILL BE SHADOW OF FORMER SELF; MAIL ORDER: CONSUMER 
ELECTRONICS CATALOGUE FIRM HOPES TO SUBMIT PLAN IN JUNE TO EMERGE FROM 
BANKRUPTCY. NEGOTIATIONS WITH CREDITORS CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DAK Industries Inc. hopes to submit a reorganization plan in June, allowing it 
to emerge from bankruptcy two years after the mail-order firm filed Chapter 11 
to protect itself from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Canoga Park company, one of the nation's largest consumer electronics 
catalogue marketers, will only be a shadow of its former self. Once a thriving 
firm with a loyal following of customers blithely referred to as "Dakonians," 
DAK's sales soared to $236 million in the 12 months ended in June, 1991, just 
one year prior to its June, 1992, bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's popularity derived in part from its low prices and wide offering 
of electronics gear including computers, compact-disc players, bread makers and 
radar detectors. DAK sells the products for low prices by cutting deals with 
manufacturers who want to unload excess inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, however, sales had fallen to between $60 million and $70 million, 
said DAK President Drew Kaplan. The firm now has about 150 workers, down from 
400 before entering bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described gadget freak who started DAK in 1964 out of his UCLA 
dormitory room, Kaplan remains characteristically upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things are going fairly well," he said. "We've paid the bank down 
significantly. We have a new catalogue. We are working very hard to be a new 
company based on a much more limited credit line." 
</P>
<P>
 When DAK filed the bankruptcy petition in Los Angeles federal court, it cited 
a lack of financing and the sluggish economy as reasons for its financial 
problems. At the time, it showed $50 million in assets against $48 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Its biggest creditor, Tokai Bank of Japan, was owed $18.5 million at the time 
of the bankruptcy filing in 1992. DAK has since cut that debt by more than 
half, to $8.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite DAK's optimism that it would quickly climb out of bankruptcy, the 
firm apparently has still failed to come to terms with Tokai. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents filed earlier this month, DAK said it was "unable to 
propose a plan of reorganization thus far that is both feasible and acceptable" 
to Tokai and the committee for DAK's unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomsen Young, an attorney representing DAK's unsecured creditors committee, 
said, "We're substantially in agreement on most terms," although he added that 
the unsecured creditors "certainly won't get 100 cents on the dollar" of the 
money they are owed. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, DAK has said that its "fundamental dispute" with Tokai 
Bank is Tokai's insistence that DAK's collateral for its loan is worth far less 
than DAK's valuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven N. Bloom, an attorney for Tokai, said DAK and Tokai are continuing to 
negotiate, but that DAK's earlier reorganization proposals weren't acceptable 
to Tokai because the bank doubted DAK's ability to meet certain financial 
projections -- and thus, repay its loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, DAK's negotiations with Tokai have centered on an agreement for DAK to 
continue using its cash to run the business through May 31, instead of paying 
off debt. It was the fifth time that Tokai has agreed to such a request from 
DAK. 
</P>
<P>
 When the current agreement ends, DAK said in court documents, it would make a 
debt payment to Tokai of all of its cash on hand, estimated at more than $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say there's anything that's a holdup to the process" of DAK 
emerging from bankruptcy, Bloom said. DAK is trying to fashion a plan that will 
"give the company the ability to operate after the bankruptcy is concluded." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said one problem is that he must continue to slash prices so he can 
liquidate older inventory to keep the business running. "I generate cash, which 
generates new products in the catalogue, which keeps the customers happy," he 
said. "But liquidating inventory is not necessarily profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, the sole owner of the company, personally tests the products, and 
writes long, chatty reports on every item for the mail-order catalogues. He 
also nicknames the products -- a paper shredder advertised in a recent 
catalogue was dubbed a "snooper stomper." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent catalogue advertising products sold at DAK's outlet store next to 
its corporate office, Kaplan wrote "I NEED CASH RIGHT NOW!!!" in big red 
letters. The company was overloaded with merchandise returned after Christmas, 
he explained. Plus, he said, operations were halted for about a week after the 
Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kaplan slashed prices and pleaded with customers to help reduce his 
inventory. "That way I can get the cash I need to launch my next big 
catalogue," he wrote.

TAX CODE'S A RIDDLE, EVEN FOR THE EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Accounting: Money magazine surveys of professional preparers show a lack of 
both uniformity and accuracy of results. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are among the one in two Americans who prepare their own income tax 
return each year and are having trouble understanding the new tax laws for 
1994, you are not alone. In fact, you are not even unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Kimball, Internal Revenue Service spokesman in Los Angeles, said the 
current two-volume tax code is four inches thick. The code lists the new tax 
laws passed by Congress last summer. And that's just the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
 The binders containing the tax regulations -- which explain, clarify and 
contain examples of what the laws in the tax code mean -- are nine inches 
thick, Kimball said. He has no idea how thick the first tax code was when it 
began in 1913, "but it was obviously a lot smaller," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who gripe about the Byzantine IRS rules figure that since 1913 the 
equivalent of a Rube Goldberg has been at work, making the process ever more 
complicated so that today virtually no one truly understands how much people 
actually owe each year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Making sense of the tax code and regulations can be a daunting task even for 
people who advertise themselves as professional tax preparers. In December, 
Money magazine quizzed 50 tax preparers picked at random from the Yellow Pages 
of Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, San Diego and Seattle about the new tax 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The preparers, which included representatives of H & R Block, Triple Check and 
Jackson Hewitt Inc., were asked 10 questions about the new tax laws. None of 
the 50 preparers answered all 10 questions correctly and only 34 got five or 
more right. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the magazine did another survey. It presented information about a 
fictional family of four and got 41 professional tax preparers (none from 
Triple Check) to prepare that family's federal tax return. The correct amount 
of federal tax that the family owed was $35,643. Surprise: Not one of the 41 
tax preparers came up with the correct tax owed. In fact, every one of the 41 
pros came up with a different amount the family owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, only two of the 41 got within $40 of the correct amount owed and a 
third preparer came within about $500. The rest were about as accurate as an 
unguided missile: 85% of the tax preparers said the family owed more than they 
really did. One pro would have made the family overpay their taxes by nearly 
$39,000, while another preparer would have had the family underpay their taxes 
by about $3,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fees for coming up with these wrong tax returns, Money said, 
would have ranged from $375 to $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you can always prepare your own return and may feel more 
comfortable turning to the IRS for help in interpreting the tax laws as they 
apply to you. But be warned: There is no guarantee that the information 
dispensed by IRS "experts" is correct, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things get so complex, but it comes down to what is eventually 
correct," said the IRS' Kimball. "In a situation where penalties are assessed 
because of faulty information given by one of our employees, we will abate 
those penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 However, you still have to prove that the IRS gave you the wrong information 
and that you didn't screw it up yourself. H. G. REZA

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 2 CO-FOUNDERS OF CLAMSHELL BUILDINGS INC. STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief executive of Clamshell Buildings Inc., a Ventura company whose 
movable structures were widely used by U. S. forces during Operation Desert 
Storm, has stepped down and been replaced by an official who was brought in 
when a venture-capital concern invested in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland D. Hunt, a co-founder of Clamshell, retired as president and chief 
executive. He was succeeded by Sandford T. Waddell, who had been executive vice 
president since March, 1993, when the firm was recapitalized with an investment 
by Chicago-based Heller Equity Capital. Hunt was elected chairman and will also 
serve as a company consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Gardner, who co-founded the company along with Hunt, also stepped 
down, retiring as a company officer and director. He will become an independent 
company representative in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell, a former executive of Thrifty Corp., Pacific Enterprises and Fluor 
Corp., said that the shake-up was amicable, and that the two founders and other 
members of the management team continue to hold a majority of Clamshell's 
voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell declined to disclose current revenues for privately held Clamshell, 
but said deals are being negotiated to install the company's aluminum-supported 
fabric structures for several San Fernando Valley firms whose plants were badly 
damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Clamshell has reported revenues ranging between $10 million 
and $20 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, the company has received one major earthquake-related order, for a 
36,000-square-foot, two-building complex that will be used as a temporary site 
by the Broadway department store at Northridge Fashion Center. The complex is 
now being installed, Waddell reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the Broadway will move most of their mainstream merchandise into 
those buildings while their store is being repaired," he said. "The buildings 
will serve as a reduced-scale department store." 
</P>
<P>
 Clamshell received wide publicity in 1990 and 1991 when it supplied 144 
helicopter maintenance hangars for U. S. forces during Operation Desert Storm. 
The company also built warehouses used in Florida in the wake of Hurricane 
Andrew, and has erected large commercial, industrial and recreational 
structures in the United States and Europe.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CAMARILLO FIRM GETS U. S. DEFENSE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo research and development firm, Xsirius Inc., has received a 
Defense Department grant to work on a new type of detector for measuring 
radioactivity at various government installations. 
</P>
<P>
 A company official said the device will be used to search out plutonium 
contamination on Johnson Atoll in the South Pacific.The United States destroyed 
nerve gas chemical weapons on the atoll several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhardt Denmark, chairman and chief executive of Xsirius, declined to 
disclose the amount of the grant but said it could lead to a follow-on award of 
up to $250,000 later this year. The second order would be to develop 
demonstration units, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the project goes as expected, we'll receive production orders worth 
considerably more than that in 1995," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Denmark said Xsirius' gamma-ray detector provides improved performance and 
reduced costs compared with units now being used. The new device uses mercuric 
iodide, a semiconductor material. 
</P>
<P>
 Xsirius, founded in 1986, is now working on orders totaling more than $1 
million from clients that include the Defense Department, National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health and the Department of 
Energy.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SAFETY TRAINING PAYS OFF FOR VENTURA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gaviota Maintenance Services Inc., a Ventura oil-field service firm, has cut 
its workers' compensation premiums 50% since starting an intensive safety 
training program in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, having become safety experts in activities ranging from ladder-climbing 
to tank-cleaning, Gaviota's officials have decided to go into the 
safety-training business.For a fee, the company is offering to supply 
instructors to other firms, either on-site or in Gaviota's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were inspired by two factors," said Dan Lyon, who heads the new program. 
"People seem to have heard about our success in avoiding injuries, and a new 
state law requires all companies with 10 or more employees to set up formal 
safety programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, Gaviota's human resources director and son of company owner Ed Lyon, 
said he's already landed his first client. Next week, he's sending instructors 
to the Procter & Gamble Paper Products plant in Oxnard, where they'll provide 
hands-on training in such subjects as handling hazardous materials, avoiding 
back injuries, substance abuse and first aid.

CALSTART UNVEILS SENSING DEVICE TO PREVENT COLLISIONS, BOTTLENECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer looking on approvingly, Calstart -- the 
Burbank-based consortium dedicated to fostering an advanced transportation 
industry in the state -- Monday unveiled a radar-like device that could 
eventually help prevent collisions and smooth the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, sensors the size of computer chips may be built 
into car bodies within three years that will beep to alert motorists to objects 
-- such as people and other cars -- in close range. The device adapts 
technology developed by the defense-oriented Lawrence Livermore federal 
laboratory for laser experiments in nuclear fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're really celebrating today is defense-conversion success," Boxer, 
one of California's two Democratic senators, told a crowd of engineers and 
Calstart representatives during a news conference at Calstart headquarters. "It 
is very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 More than an instrument to help drivers avoid accidents while backing up or 
changing lanes, the device can trigger the inflation of an air bag and create 
an "intelligent" cruise-control system to keep cars ahead at fixed distances, 
easing the bottlenecks common on Los Angeles freeways. Motorists could even use 
the sensors while parallel parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The palm-sized prototype, to be eventually shrunk down to a silicon microchip, 
detects the presence of foreign objects by emitting 1 million low-frequency 
radio waves per second and monitoring echoes from as far as 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually projects an invisible bubble" around the car, said Thomas McEwan, 
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory engineer who pioneered the technique 
over the past four years. "You can't see it, so you don't believe it's there. 
But it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envision the cars of the future just bristling with these radars," said 
McEwan, who estimated that a car would need about 10 of the sensors to be 
covered from all angles. The signals put out by the devices are much less 
powerful than those of cellular telephones. "It's totally safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers can apply the method beyond cars to equipment ranging from 
home-security systems to search-and-rescue gear. The sensors may also aid in 
medical diagnoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it a breakthrough" in radar technology, McEwan said. "This is 
literally the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 The great advantage is that the instruments are inexpensive to make, costing 
only about $10 for all the components, much cheaper than current technology, 
according to Amerigon, the Calstart member company that has licensed the new 
device. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has already approached several automotive firms about using the 
new technology, which it hopes to have installed in cars by 1997, said Josh 
Newman, Amerigon vice president.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; ARTIST ADDS A NEW DIMENSION TO STOREFRONTS

<P>
 Keith Blum has spent the last seven years of his life earning a living doing 
what he got punished for as a child -- painting on walls. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two weeks, at Fashion Square Sherman Oaks mall, Blum has been 
decorating the plywood barricades placed in front of stores. Many of the mall's 
140 stores sustained water damage during the earthquake and are busy remodeling 
behind the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a three-dimensional painting technique known as trompe l'oeil, which 
means deceptive to the eye, Blum has been painting life-size flower pots and 
benches on the bare wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to replicate the images of real benches and flowers that decorate 
the mall. One day last week, Blum put the finishing touches on a bench, giving 
it a three-dimensional look by filling in shadows with off-white paint.  
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, he said, the artwork invites you to sit down. He leaned 
against a completed image nearby to illustrate his point, pretending he was 
actually sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do the barricade art because I thought the plywood was just too 
boring," said Sandy Stavig Turner, the mall's marketing director. "We wanted it 
to be more festive." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Blum's paintings, the storefronts would simply show the names of the 
still-closed shops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner spotted Blum painting a trompe l'oeil storefront on the back wall of a 
West Los Angeles clothing store and asked him to work his magic at Fashion 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Blum paints mostly in private homes, several businesses have called on 
him to create illusions. At Maria's Italian Kitchen in Northridge, Blum created 
an outdoor scene with a couple walking side-by-side under blue skies on one of 
the 25-foot dining room walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum expects to be finished at Fashion Square within three weeks. On April 23, 
his paintings will be accompanied by art created by San Fernando Valley 
schoolchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 Blum is preparing for the artworks by painting decorative vines to surround 
and complement them. TERESA ANN WILLIS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RED CROSS CHAPTER NEGOTIATING MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank chapter of the American Red Cross is negotiating a merger with the 
Los Angeles chapter, giving up local control to maintain services during 
difficult financial times. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors for the Burbank chapter voted 11 to 8 last week to 
merge with Los Angeles, but that vote was voided by the national Red Cross 
organization because of a provision that required the L. A. chapter to maintain 
staffing in Burbank at present levels. 
</P>
<P>
 A new vote has been scheduled for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared to death if this becomes part of Los Angeles, that we will have 
lost the opportunity to successfully serve our people," said Mark MacCarley, a 
local lawyer and a member of the chapter's board of directors who opposes the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Gay Weston said the chapter is expected to have a $7,500 
deficit for the 1993-94 fiscal year, which would be the third year in a row 
that the chapter reported financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has cut the amount that the Burbank chapter receives in 
donations from both the general public and United Way, Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter has promised to continue services in Burbank after the 
merger, Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not the end of an era," she said. "The Red Cross is still going 
to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 A major issue in the negotiations is what sort of operation would remain in 
Burbank after the dissolution of the local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commitment is to provide the same amount of services that are now in 
Burbank," said Ann Sobel, associate manager for the Los Angeles chapter. But 
MacCarley said he worried that once the merger was complete the Burbank chapter 
building would be closed and replaced with a smaller satellite office. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCarley and other members of the board who oppose the merger are trying to 
find ways to save the chapter through aggressive fund raising and tough 
scrutiny of the chapter's $285,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over," MacCarley said. "We're standing up to save the local 
chapter." 
</P>
<P>
 MacCarley said he did not want to see Burbank merge into Los Angeles and be 
lost in another organization, with only two Burbank representatives on a board 
of 35. 
</P>
<P>
 "This crisis can turn into a major victory if the people of Burbank are 
suddenly galvanized into supporting their chapter," MacCarley said. ED BOND

GETTING INVOLVED / MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY: GOING THE EXTRA MILE 
FOR MS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, when Janice Stewart rallies volunteers for the 5- and 15- 
kilometer MS Walks, the memories intrude. 
</P>
<P>
 The nagging thoughts remind Stewart of why she helps with the fund-raising 
event and make her thank God that she can. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning in November, 1986, Stewart woke up. But the left side of her body 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 She rose, dressed and went to work anyway, trying to ignore the paralysis, 
figuring it would work itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't. Twenty-eight days later she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 She would spend two years with painful, distressing symptoms that would 
appear, then disappear. She lost her sight for eight weeks. At different times, 
she lost the use of each hand, sometimes both. She learned the feel of a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't spell MS. I didn't know what it was," Stewart said. "I thought I 
was going to be one of Jerry's kids. I had absolutely no idea what I was 
confronting." 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant at first to admit her condition, Stewart called the MS society and 
said, "I'm calling for a friend who has MS." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman on the other end of the line encouraged her to have her "friend" 
call herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a crucial day in my life. I admitted I had MS," Stewart said. 
"Through the MS society, I learned the difference between having MS and 
learning to live with MS." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart still has symptom-burdened days. A finger will go numb, or a leg. 
Fatigue sometimes sets in. She keeps a walker and a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 She is out of the wheelchair, though she keeps photos to remind her. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to work at First Interstate Bank, where she is assistant vice 
president and financial services manager, in the fall of 1988, with her MS in 
remission. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, she has rallied participants and volunteers for the MS Walk, 
which last year raised $620,000 in Southern California. The fund-raiser started 
in 1989 in Pasadena. Now walks are also held in Long Beach, Redlands, 
Riverside, Santa Monica and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,000 walkers are expected to file into those six locales, with 1,000 at 
Woodland Hills, said Todd Vradenburg, development associate with the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money participants raise through pledges, 40% goes toward research 
programs, 10% covers expenses for the walk, and 50% goes to 100 service 
programs that aid MS victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to help with registration, set up food booths, greet and 
hand out food to the walkers and congratulate them at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk is not a race, Vradenburg stressed, and everyone is welcome to 
participate. About 80% of the walkers know someone who has MS, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "MS is such a helpless disease," he said. "For family members and friends it's 
a great way of showing their support by going out and walking." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a chance for people like Stewart to show her thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was given so much, I didn't know what I could do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart hopes that the walk will enlighten people about the chronic disease of 
the brain and spinal cord and that it will enable MS victims to reach out to 
the MS society as she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not alone. The MS society is always there," she said. "I can always pick 
up the phone and call. I've called late at night and there was always someone 
there to listen, to understand, to give support."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CANDIDATE REVISES BALLOT STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that both sides claimed as a victory, a candidate for Burbank 
Municipal Court judge has revised his ballot statement, removing some portions 
that his opponent claimed violated a state elections code, while retaining 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 During a court hearing in Los Angeles on Monday, Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne determined that certain passages in attorney Rand Rubin's ballot 
statement were inappropriate, but decided to let him rewrite the document 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision grew out of a dispute between Rubin and Burbank Municipal Court 
Judge Marion E. Gubler over the legality of Rubin's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubler, who is seeking reelection in the June primary, had accused Rubin of 
violating a California Elections Code section that limits what candidates in 
judicial races may include in statements that are printed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The law limits the statements to a "recitation of the candidate's own personal 
background and qualifications," and prohibits any references to other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's statement included comments such as the "Burbank court has been 
censured by the California Supreme Court for its mistreatment of our citizens," 
and "the Burbank courts are wasting taxpayer money." Gubler argued that the 
comments were veiled attacks on him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 the Commission on Judicial Performance publicly censured Gubler for 
his "zealous efforts to obtain payment from criminal defendants" to reimburse 
the county for services provided by the public defender's office. The judge was 
also censured for allowing the private sale of guns that had been confiscated 
from convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's new statement makes no reference to a censure but does include a 
promise to save taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the ruling," Rubin said. "I consider it a victory. We're 
still getting these issues in front of the voters."  
</P>
<P>
 Gubler said he was satisfied with the outcome of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won it so I ought to be happy," Gubler said. "That statement didn't belong 
in there in the first place." JOCELYN Y. STEWART

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COLLEGE WORKSHOP TO OFFER ARTFUL EDIBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michelangelo of Melons and the Rodin of Radishes are planning to give 
lessons on works of art good enough to eat for San Fernando Valley chefs at 
Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's Community Extension Program will hold a workshop April 13 on 
"How to create dazzling table centerpieces from fruits and vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Incredible Edibles," the workshop will demonstrate how to hand-carve 
fruits and vegetables into delicate petals, graceful birds and unique seasonal 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, one of the things we try to do is to introduce ways to use fruits 
and vegetables as part of the meal presentation," chef Eloise Cantrell said. 
"We create garde-mange r." 
</P>
<P>
 She said garde-manger is a French term for decorative, artful presentation of 
food for special events. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will teach how to create flower arrangement from vegetables, 
elaborate baskets and boats from watermelons, sculptures from turnips, roses 
from strawberries, and birds from summer squash -- all through special carving 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than spending money on something you will throw away, you can buy 
something for decoration, then eat it," Cantrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is scheduled from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. The enrollment fee is $19.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; OFFICIALS SEEK UTILITIES TAX TO MEET SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura Hills officials have for the first time formally proposed a tax on the 
use of utilities, in an attempt to alleviate the worst budget crunch in the 
city's 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 5% tax on the use of water, electricity, gas and telephone 
service would raise $1 million needed to wipe out the city's projected 
shortfall next fiscal year, said City Manager Terry Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has scheduled hearings on the proposed tax at its regular 
meetings May 11 and 25. Five less-formal public meetings on the budget have 
been scheduled in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of state cuts and tax losses, revenues are expected to fall $662,500 
short of the $5.9 million needed to run the city, and another $343,800 short of 
required insurance and reserve funds, in the fiscal year beginning July 1, Matz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most challenging budget year we've had to deal with," Matz said. 
"And some of the solutions we need to consider are difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for a utility tax has been brought up in Agoura Hills in the past, 
but never before reached the public hearing stage. After two hearings, the 
council may vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby cities of Los Angeles and Calabasas raise money for services by 
taxing residents for the use of utilities. Westlake Village does not. 
</P>
<P>
 If Agoura Hills fails to find a source of new funds, it will be forced to cut 
back city services, although no cuts have been discussed in detail, Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary budget is not due for another month at the earliest, after 
public meetings throughout Agoura Hills on April 6, 12, 14, 19 and 20. KURT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITY KIDS MILK DAIRY EXHIBIT FOR INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a cow and calf in tow, Denise Skidmore makes daily visits to schools 
throughout Los Angeles to show children something they may never have seen 
before: large farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tarzana Elementary School on Wednesday, youngsters petted a 2-month-old 
calf named Abby and watched as Skidmore milked Maggie, a 4-year-old Holstein 
cow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children loved it," said Kristi Thomas, the school's office manager. "For 
some of them, it's the first time they've seen a cow." 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile dairy classrooms, consisting of a truck and trailer, were started 
in the 1940s, following the trend toward urbanization, according to Skidmore, 
an instructor who operates one of four such classrooms for the Dairy Council of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which provides nutritional information to the public and is 
sponsored by the dairy industry, wanted to give youngsters the chance to see 
and touch farm animals so they would understand where milk comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the instructors see about 200,000 children a year, and Skidmore said 
she has a one-year waiting list of schools expecting visits. Her next San 
Fernando Valley trips will be Friday to Oxnard Street Elementary School in 
North Hollywood and April 11 to Emelita Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 During 45-minute lessons, Skidmore asks students to use their thumbs to 
imagine what it's like to milk a cow, and talks about the different breeds and 
body features of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The further removed we are from agriculture, the more we take our food for 
granted," she said. "When we make decisions on agriculture, we make them 
uninformed, like turning agriculture land into housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids, she said, remember her visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get fan mail," Skidmore said. "Most children in Southern California don't 
get to see an animal that large." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VIDEO SHOWS HOW TO BOLT DOWN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-minute video on do-it-yourself seismic strengthening is now available to 
homeowners interested in learning how to bolt a house to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many older homes in Southern California are not bolted down, leaving them 
particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. The video, jointly produced by various 
government agencies, including Los Angeles County, and construction industry 
trade groups and companies, helps homeowners determine whether their houses 
need seismic strengthening and how to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 The video costs $10.50, and may be purchased at local Home Depot stores or by 
calling the International Conference of Building Officials at (310) 692-4226.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LOCAL GROUPS TO GET $2.8 MILLION IN AID

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and a Clinton Administration representative announced 
Monday the release of $2.8 million in federal grants for local volunteer 
organizations to provide services and assistance to victims of the Northridge 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants will be distributed to 13 volunteer organizations to provide quake 
cleanup in low-income neighborhoods and parks, tutoring for students whose 
schools were closed and day-care services, among other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Hall news conference attended by Clinton Deputy Assistant Rick 
Allen, Riordan said the grants are "yet another example of the extraordinary 
response we have seen since the earthquake from the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant recipients include the California and Los Angeles Conservation Corps, 
whose volunteers are planning to use their share to repair damaged public 
facilities such as schools, colleges and parks, and to assist low-income 
residents with quake cleanup. Members of the corps will set up headquarters in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recipient, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) plans to organize 
after-school and weekend activities for children at Red Cross Centers. The 
National Senior Volunteer Corps will use its share of the grants to provide 
support programs for frail and traumatized senior citizens. HUGO MARTIN

<P>
 Charges have been filed against a Northridge man who was arrested driving 
through Encino with a loaded assault pistol and 12-gauge shotgun, the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The guns, including a 9-millimeter MAC-10 pistol with a 30-round magazine, 
were found on the front seat of a car driven by David Phillip Hersh, 25, City 
Atty.Kenneth J. Hahn said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was charged with two counts each of possessing a loaded gun, having a 
gun in a motor vehicle and giving false information to police, the release 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Hersh and another man were arrested after a brief chase on March 
21. Hersh later falsely identified himself to police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Douglas Edwards, 27, of Reseda was arrested with Hersh. He is on parole 
and will be charged with violating laws against possession of guns by parolees, 
the announcement said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

MAN TO BE TRIED IN ATTACKS ON PACOIMA CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A parolee charged with raping children and teen-agers in Pacoima and Inglewood 
was ordered Monday to stand trial on 20 felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding an often-delayed preliminary hearing that started Dec. 22, San 
Fernando Municipal Judge Roy M. Carstairs ruled that there is a "strong 
suspicion" that Robert Lee Donaldson terrorized children in a Pacoima 
neighborhood -- the same area where he raped a boy in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson, 34, is charged with rape, sodomy and lewd acts. The Pacoima attacks 
on two girls occurred Sept. 21 and 22 on Van Nuys Boulevard near Borden Avenue. 
Two other girls were assaulted in separate incidents only three blocks apart 
Oct. 11 and Oct. 18 in Inglewood, where police said Donaldson was stalking 
another child when he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey said Donaldson's attacks had a striking 
similarity: The victims were from ages 9 to 16, and they were all walking alone 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what you really call a fingerprint," said defense attorney Bobby 
R. Black, who successfully argued that four counts related to one male victim 
be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 After his conviction for raping a 15-year-old boy in May, 1982, Donaldson 
served more than 10 years in prison. He was paroled one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson, who is being held in lieu of $2-million bail, is scheduled to be 
arraigned in Superior Court on April 11.

PROSECUTOR CALLS FOR EXECUTION OF MAN WHO KILLED GUARD; COURTS: LAWYER TELLS 
JURY THE CONVICT DESERVES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR SLAYING THAT OCCURRED 25 DAYS 
AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM JAIL FOR ANOTHER KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Promising that the jury will be shocked by the long history of a convicted 
killer's crimes, a prosecutor argued Monday that the lifelong criminal should 
be executed for his latest murder. 
</P>
<P>
 After convicting Sean Darnell Slade two weeks ago of murdering an armored car 
guard during a robbery, the jury began hearing evidence to determine if the 
killer should be put to death or if he should spend the rest of his life behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he is sucking the air we breathe, he will be a menace to other 
human beings," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas told the jurors as he argued for 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, 27, shot guard Edwin Maldonado in the back of the head during a July 
29, 1992, robbery at a San Fernando Home Depot store. Maldonado, a 26-year-old 
employee of Sectran Armored Transportation and former Pasadena police officer, 
had just picked up $82,000 in receipts -- about half of which was in cash -- 
when Slade ran up behind him and fired without warning, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery-murder happened only 25 days after Slade was released from Soledad 
State Prison on parole after serving about four years for the 1987 killing of 
Howard Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Jonas said the Baker shooting was "a cold-blooded, 
premeditated, calculated murder of a friend over a canister of rock cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Baker was shot 2 1/2 months after Slade escaped from a 
California Youth Authority prison, where he was serving a term for an armed 
robbery at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in North Hollywood when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested, Slade "confessed with some pride as to his involvement" 
in the robbery that netted more than $10,000, Jonas said.  
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness in that robbery was threatened, according to the 
prosecutor, demonstrating "how far one person's tentacles can reach in society, 
even though he has been arrested and convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill did not address the jury Monday. He faces the task 
of convincing the panel that it should spare the life of a man who was 
convicted of murder after being incarcerated most of his adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade has been out of custody for only three months during the past 10 years, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Fernando Superior Court jury, which heard the bulk of the case in Van 
Nuys because of earthquake damage to the San Fernando courthouse, deliberated 
three days before convicting Slade of first-degree murder in Maldonado's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his trial, Slade maintained he was innocent and police had arrested 
the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
 During the penalty phase of the trial, which is expected to last about one 
week, the panel of seven men and five women will hear for the first time about 
the murder victim's life.

ROBERTI RECALL GROUPS RELEASE FISCAL REPORTS; CAMPAIGNS: THE DISCLOSURE COMES A 
WEEK AFTER A STATE AGENCY WAS ASKED TO PROSECUTE THE MOVEMENT FOR FAILURE TO 
FILE FINANCE STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two groups fighting to recall state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) released 
their delinquent campaign finance reports Monday showing they had raised 
$164,000 since July 1, 1993, much of it in individual donations under $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to hide," said attorney Kevin Washburn as he and other 
leaders of the anti-Roberti effort publicly released the campaign disclosure 
reports one week after a state agency had been asked to prosecute the recall 
movement for failing to file its reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti camp has charged that its foes have been withholding the reports 
because they would reveal that the recall is being financed by gun lobby 
interests. Roberti claims that the effort is the work of gun interests angry at 
him for his 1989 law banning assault weapons. He faces an April 12 recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washburn and others said the real reason the groups -- Californians 
Against Corruption and Coalition to Restore Government Integrity -- have 
released their reports late is because the groups are grass-roots organizations 
that rely on volunteer help to get their work done. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, disclosing financial contributions and expenditures, are required 
to be filed under penalty of perjury by the state Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance reports released Monday showed that the Californians Against 
Corruption raised $101,129 between July 1, 1993, and March 3, 1994. During the 
same period, the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, the group credited 
with organizing the recall, raised $63,588. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of gun interests was evident from the statements, with more than half 
a dozen of the largest contributors, who gave $1,000 each, being gun or 
ammunition makers. It was unclear from the reports if the hundreds of small 
contributors involved were members of gun rights groups or part of the firearms 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Washburn found himself contradicted Monday after he told 
reporters that the recall received $30,000 from a victims' rights group, the 
California Voters Alliance, and held up the alliance contribution as proof of 
the recall movement's diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jerry Allen, head of the alliance, later told reporters in a conference 
call set up by Washburn that his group was indeed closely tied to gun lobby 
interests. "We're an anti-crime group that thinks gun control is a phony 
solution to the problem (of crime)," said Allen, who also acknowledged that his 
group's primary contributors were gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the group's 1993 campaign statement showed that it bought lists of 
gun owners to identify potential contributors to the anti-Roberti fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Staci Walters, Roberti's press secretary, said "it is interesting 
to note that these groups -- who claim to be good government activists -- have 
only filed their campaign reports after being threatened with litigation." Last 
week, California Common Cause, a nonprofit political reform group, urged the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission to file charges against the recall 
movement for failing to file its reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters also noted that the reports released Monday failed to disclose, as 
required, the contributions of weapons made to Californians Against Corruption 
by several firearms makers. The manufacturers' gifts were the prizes offered in 
a raffle held by Californians Against Corruption to raise money for the 
anti-Roberti fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Howard, a leader of the group, said his group knew of the oversight and 
would file an amended report to reflect the gifts, including a semiautomatic 
rifle.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; LAWYER SEES THE POOR STRUGGLE AGAINST POVERTY'S VICIOUS CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lew Hollman is a senior attorney at San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services Inc. The nonprofit center in Pacoima provides legal assistance to 
low-income residents and advocates on their behalf in court. The center has 
been involved in civil suits against government agencies and private parties on 
matters that adversely affect the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 17 years that he has worked at the organization, Hollman has 
assisted many welfare recipients. He notes that the views expressed here are 
his own and not necessarily those of the center. He was interviewed by Times 
staff writer Jocelyn Y. Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What has been the trend over the last few years in terms of welfare 
assistance?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: In real value, welfare assistance has declined since the early 1970s. 
There was actually a period in the late 1970s when benefits were going up 
somewhat because California had an automatic cost of living increase. But 
assistance has dropped very dramatically, particularly in the last 10 to 15 
years. The actual benefit levels today in real terms are lower than they were 
20 years ago. When you adjust the real purchasing power of benefits, they 
haven't kept up with the cost of living. That's particularly heightened in 
California, especially in Los Angeles, because the housing costs here are 
higher than almost any other place in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In his proposed budget, Gov. Pete Wilson has included more cuts . How do 
families cope with less assistance?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's hard work to be poor. You have to be constantly looking for every 
piece of assistance you can get. You have to find out which churches you can go 
to to get a coat for your children when theirs are stolen or worn out. You have 
to know where you can get sandwiches toward the end of the month when you don't 
have enough food left. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are reduced to begging, which is something one saw rarely 15 or 20 
years ago. Routinely I see mothers with children at the Hughes Market in 
Mission Hills on Sepulveda. I see them at Alpha Beta where I shop in Sylmar. I 
see them in the parking lot at Pace. These are people who can't meet their very 
basic needs with the government benefits that they receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is the relationship between welfare benefits and homelessness?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That is why there is an incredible problem of homelessness in California. 
The benefit levels are simply not at a high enough level to enable people to 
get affordable housing, and you have a phenomenon that we've seen in the last 
10 or 15 years where housing becomes an optional expense for families. 
Sometimes families give up housing because they can't pay for housing and meet 
their other needs. They will periodically move in with relatives. Periodically 
they will sleep in the car. And periodically they will find themselves in 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 What I see as perhaps one of the hardest things about being poor is living in 
constant uncertainty and stress. You can never build a stable household when 
you don't know if you can pay your rent the next month, when you run out of 
food toward the end of every month and don't know how you're going to feed your 
children. This is the kind of tension people live with trying to make ends 
meet. It's incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Some have argued that because benefit levels are actually too low to solely 
support recipient families, many welfare recipients end up working or find 
other ways of getting money. Have you seen this in your clients?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There's a perception sometimes that a lot of people on welfare are working 
on the side. It's impossible to know exactly, but my own opinion is there are 
not a lot of people who are able to -- simply because there aren't jobs for 
most of the people who are on welfare. Any jobs that provide decent wages are 
legal and are reported and people know that the state cross-checks unemployment 
insurance tax and Franchise Tax Board information with the Welfare Department. 
If people work and don't report it, they get caught. People on welfare are 
required to report all earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about those people who might want to work but need some assistance?  
</P>
<P>
 A. There are disincentives toward people working their way off welfare because 
their costs go up and their income can go down. In other words, the costs of 
employment can negate any gains they get. What's really remarkable, though, is 
that people struggle very hard to get off welfare. Most people hate being 
dependent on welfare and would prefer employment. The problem is the employment 
isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is your opinion of President Clinton's proposed welfare reform that 
would require welfare recipients to work after two years of training?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't know anyone who works in the field of welfare that doesn't want to 
end welfare as we know it. The part that most of us like about the proposal is 
that after the end of those two years, if people can't find jobs, jobs will be 
found for them. 
</P>
<P>
 What is distressing about the plan is that, at the same time, the Clinton 
Administration says the overall costs of the plan won't go up. There's a 
contradiction between those two things. It costs money to create jobs, and that 
has been the major reason why programs that succeed in transitioning people off 
welfare have not been pursued. They cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run they would cost less. You could break the cycle of poverty if 
you gave them training and were supportive of their employment until they had 
the skills and the experience to continue or find a job in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of reform that is reform in name only is what Gov. Wilson has 
proposed. After six months on welfare, you cut the grants across the board if 
the people haven't found jobs. That's called welfare reform, but really that's 
just deficit reduction on the backs of poor people. Everyone knows the jobs 
aren't there for these people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If we're looking at a situation now where even people with college degrees 
and many years of experience are unemployed and unable to find jobs, how then 
can a program expect to, in two years, train a person to go out into that same 
job market and find a job?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That is indeed the challenge. I don't think there's a simple answer to it. 
I think that you are going to have to create economic opportunity. You're going 
to have to train people to do work that is necessary in the economy, and I 
think that can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists believe that what ended the Depression in the '30s was 
production gearing up for World War II. It seems to me that if production can 
be geared up for a totally socially destructive enterprise like war and 
generate jobs and stimulate the economy, we ought to be able to do it for more 
positive things. We ought to be able to do it to build houses, to build roads, 
to build schools, to build hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's fueling the current climate of welfare reform and reduction?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's the economy that has generated both the increases in welfare costs and 
the frustration of people about the existing welfare system. In the 20th 
Century, we have to recognize that in a modern, industrial society being 
unemployed and without funds doesn't mean you're immoral. But when people see 
budget deficits, when they see services declining, when they're worried about 
their own jobs, they get very frustrated about welfare payments, and it's very 
easy to translate that frustration into anger at the people who are on welfare. 
Some politicians are willing to feed into that frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There's also been some discussion about generational welfare. For example a 
woman who might have been on welfare with a child and that child, now a 
teen-ager or young adult, is now on welfare, creating a continuous cycle of 
poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 A. First of all I think a lot of that discussion, about the so-called 
underclass, is exaggerated. There are people who are skeptical of any 
sociological concept that sort of defines itself only in terms of a negative 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, you look at the small percentage of people on welfare who have 
been there for two or three generations, and you try to define them as a 
uniform group of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a story: Ernest Hemingway once was talking to F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald said, "Ernest, you know rich people are different than we are." And 
Hemingway said, "That's right. They have more money." 
</P>
<P>
 My own view is that poor people are different from us -- they have a lot less 
money. But the similarities are a lot greater than the differences. When people 
interview people on welfare, including families that have been on for a couple 
of generations, their aspirations and their goals for their children are just 
the same as most middle-class families. They would like their kids to get a 
job. They would like a home of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What will it take to help families that have been on welfare for a long 
time and others find jobs and become self-sufficient?  
</P>
<P>
 A. What it will take to get families that have been on welfare a long time off 
is education and economic opportunity. That's very simple it seems to me, and 
people want to make it more complicated like they have some character defect, 
and it's just not true.

EDUCATORS MOVE TO CURB VIOLENCE; SAFETY: SCHOOLS IN THOUSAND OAKS AND SIMI 
VALLEY TAKE THE STEPS IN THE WAKE OF RECENT ATTACKS, INCLUDING THE SLAYING OF A 
BOY, 14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to bolster campus security, officials in two east Ventura County 
school districts are taking steps to curb crime in the wake of recent violence 
involving students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, students returning from spring break next week will have an 
anonymous way to turn in peers who break the rules, while in Simi Valley, 
school officials plan to hire more adults to supervise campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs encouraging Thousand Oaks students to "Keep Our Schools Safe" have been 
posted at all Conejo Valley Unified School District campuses, directing 
students to call a national toll-free number with information on brewing 
fights, drug deals or other crimes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot line operators at the nonprofit WeTip program contact police, fire or 
school officials with the information, said Carole Klein, program manager of 
22-year-old WeTip, now used in hundreds of schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It prevents schools from seeing a lot of crime," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley Unified School District, officials Monday began 
interviewing unemployed adults who would be paid through a federal grant to 
supervise hallways and talk to students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be advantageous to have additional paid adults on campus 
helping students improve safety," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts by school officials come after fights involving students from both 
districts ended tragically. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, 14-year-old Chad Hubbard died Feb. 1 from a stabbing after 
school, allegedly by a Valley View Junior High classmate. In Thousand Oaks, a 
fight planned off-campus after school -- two days after the Simi Valley 
incident -- erupted in gunfire that left two Westlake High School students 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley school board member Bill Henry said other school districts have 
had success in intervening in conflict and crime on campus through the WeTip 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will do any harm and it may do some good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth relations assistants to be hired at Simi Valley schools would remain 
through Sept. 30 and have the summer off, Wolford said. The jobs were made 
available as part of a $2.2-million Department of Labor grant to the Ventura 
County Job Training Policy Council, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs will be offered primarily to those who lost employment because of the 
earthquake, said John Absmeier, director of the Simi Valley school district's 
classified personnel. The county agency approached the school district with the 
offer of paid employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope that one assistant at each elementary school, three at 
the junior highs and four at the high schools will help avert trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, these people can be the eyes and the ears for the principal, so if 
anything is brewing, they'll hear it and see it," Absmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because school ends in 11 weeks, Simi Valley officials said they are working 
to fill the jobs as quickly as possible.

OXNARD; JURY URGES GAS CHAMBER FOR KILLER OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Monday condemned a convicted Oxnard murderer to death for the fatal 
shooting of a 30-year-old mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher James Sattiewhite, 24, becomes the eighth Ventura County defendant 
to face death in the gas chamber since California reinstated capital punishment 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 After the proceeding, Sattiewhite remained glued to his chair as his attorneys 
tried to coax him to leave the courtroom. Lawyer Willard P. Wiksell later 
explained that his client, who was described in court as being childlike, was 
both astonished and frightened by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite shot Genoveva Gonzales in the head three times Jan. 26, 1992, and 
left her body in a drainage ditch along Arnold Road in Oxnard. Investigators 
said the murder occurred after Sattiewhite inadvertently called out the name of 
an accomplice who had kidnaped and raped Gonzales. The killing was necessary to 
prevent the woman from identifying her assailants, according to testimony.

MAN, 26, HELD IN DEATH OF CHILD AND THE BEATINGS OF 2 SIBLINGS; VIOLENCE: LAMAR 
KING, THE BOYFRIEND OF THE VICTIMS' MOTHER, IS CHARGED WITH MURDER DURING A 
'NIGHT OF TORTURE' AT THEIR INGLEWOOD HOME.

<P>
 Three young children were brutally beaten -- and one of them died -- during 
what police describe as a "night of torture" last week at an apartment in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother's boyfriend -- Lamar King, 26 -- was being held Monday at the Los 
Angeles County Jail on charges of murder and injuring children. Police said no 
charges have been filed against the mother, who on the night of the attack was 
at a hospital being treated for an illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs neighbors in the apartment building in the 3600 block of West 102nd 
Street said they heard banging and thumping above them for almost two hours on 
the night of March 22, but paid little attention because such sounds were 
common in the upstairs apartment, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Estella Navarrette Martinez called them after she was released 
from the hospital the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in that bedroom . . . it was terrible," Inglewood Police Sgt. 
William Thompson said Monday. "That someone that young could be put through 
something like that, it was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the severely bruised body of 2 1/2-year-old Martiniano Hernandez 
was found in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been struck in the face and the head with shoes, and perhaps with a 
broomstick," the sergeant said. "He was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy's 4-year-old brother and 1-year-old sister were covered 
with bruises. "The 4-year-old looked worse than the dead child," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving children were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center, where they were treated for their injuries before being placed in 
foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that many of their injuries had been inflicted some time ago," 
Thompson said. "It looks like they had been struck with shoes and broomsticks 
and fists. It had been going on for some time. He'd been putting these kids 
through some pretty significant torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said King, who had left the home before police arrived, turned up a 
short time later at the Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, where he 
was being treated for the effects of alcohol and codeine he had consumed during 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what prompted the attacks on the children, Thompson said: "He apparently 
didn't like them."

ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT SERVICE TO VAN NUYS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Antelope Valley commuters bound for the Van Nuys area will soon have another 
way of getting there, thanks to funding from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority on Monday will begin commuter bus 
service to the industrial area around Van Nuys Airport.Other stops on the route 
include the Van Nuys post office, Anheuser-Busch Inc. and the San Fernando 
Valley Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay 90% of the net cost of the 
service, said Tim Galbraith, grants manager. The state will pay three-fourths 
of the balance, leaving the transit agency with only a small tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other commuter lines, one to El Segundo and another to the Los Angeles 
International Airport area, may also begin Monday, he said, noting that the 
details of those services are being worked out. Those lines will also be funded 
by FEMA, with the state contributing as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal governments are expected to fund the new commuter 
services until the Antelope Valley/Golden State freeways interchange, downed by 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, is repaired, Galbraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two round-trip buses will serve each of the new lines, he said. If ridership 
on the lines is high enough to cover the cost of the services, they will 
continue after the federal funding is stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we run 14 commuter buses out of the Antelope Valley," he said. "On 
Monday, we'll be at 16. If we put together LAX and El Segundo, we could be as 
high as 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes for the Van Nuys line are available through June 30 at a 
reduced rate of $115. The regular fare as of July 1 will be $170 a month. 
Additional information about the new commuter service is available by calling 
805-945-9445.

JUDGE BLOCKS AN ALLEGED ANTELOPE VALLEY LAND-FRAUD SCHEME; COURTS: AUTHORITIES 
SAY MARSHALL REDMAN WAS STILL COLLECTING $50,000 A MONTH FROM UNWITTING LATINO 
INVESTORS AFTER BEING WARNED HIS BUSINESS IS ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Monday blocked a Westside businessman from running what prosecutors 
allege is a massive land-fraud scheme in the Antelope Valley, after authorities 
said he was continuing to take in $50,000 a month from unwitting Latino 
investors after being warned his business is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Redman and nine co-defendants already have been accused in a civil 
case of swindling at least $3 million from investors who responded to ads 
promising that they could own property in the desert areas of northern Los 
Angeles, Kern and San Bernardino counties, free of the crime and smog of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, prosecutors allege, Redman and his associates duped perhaps hundreds 
of investors into buying virtually worthless shares in 10-acre tracts of land 
that they couldn't build on because of zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a civil lawsuit filed Jan. 31, the Los Angeles city attorney's office 
is trying to recover at least $3.5 million in restitution and civil fines from 
Redman, and two businesses that he owns with his wife, son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman specifically "targeted a population that was vulnerable, people who 
don't speak English," by advertising only on Spanish-language TV stations, 
attracting mostly Latino victims, a deputy city attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, prosecutors alleged to a Los Angeles Superior Court judge that 
since that January filing, Redman has continued the scheme by pressuring at 
least 227 alleged victims into continuing to pay a total of $50,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors and letters obtained by The Times, Redman's companies 
have been reassuring investors that contrary to what authorities are saying, 
there is nothing wrong or illegal about the scheme, and that they must continue 
their payments or risk losing their entire investment. "We can assure you that 
the property you acquired from our company is safe and secure for the future," 
said one Feb. 16 letter that demands a monthly $245 payment immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman, through his lawyer, denied any intentional wrongdoing, and said he was 
trying to stay in business so he can make amends. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, City Atty. James K. Hahn described the business operation as 
a "classic Western land swindle." He said he sought the temporary restraining 
order Monday after learning that Redman's operation was continuing to collect 
money from alleged victims and that it may be trying to hide as much as $4 
million in profits so it doesn't have to return the money to the victims, as 
Hahn's office is trying to compel it to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after we put him (Redman) on notice, his company is still trying to make 
people keep up payments that they know are at least questionable," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is very disturbing. There's a lot of money involved here. What we are 
concerned about is that this money may disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said the matter has been referred to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office for possible criminal prosecution, and a joint investigation 
involving his office and Kern County authorities continues. Much of the land is 
located in parts of the Antelope Valley that are in Kern and San Bernardino 
counties, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they obtained the temporary restraining order Monday from Judge Robert 
O'Brien, authorities said they were looking into the possibility that others 
were victimized in the scheme, noting that the county Department of Consumer 
Affairs received 1,093 telephone calls and 334 written complaints about the 
land deals after the Jan. 31 civil suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order forbids Redman and his associates to collect or attempt to 
collect any money from the alleged victims until an April 6 hearing. The order 
also freezes the assets of Redman's companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the biggest real-estate fraud cases that we have 
investigated, and we have investigated these for many years," said Pastor 
Herrera Jr., director of the consumer affairs agency. "These people were 
unsophisticated; they were led to believe that there was a dream for them five 
to 10 years down the road," Herrera said. "And they discovered they had a real 
nightmare instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman's lawyer, Daniel Powell, acknowledged that since 1979, his client's 
companies have sold hundreds of customers property that they cannot build on, 
because it is not legally subdivided and zoned for residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But he insisted that Redman made honest mistakes based on bad legal advice 
given to him by an Encino law firm that Redman is now suing. He said Redman, 
65, of Beverly Hills, is now trying to make amends by refunding customers' 
money, paying to have their properties rezoned, or exchanging their property 
for something nearby where they could build. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a god-awful nightmare. They got screwed, no doubt about it," Powell 
said of the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Any demand-for-payment letters sent out, Powell said, were honest attempts by 
Redman to stay in business. "We acknowledge it is a mess," said Powell. But, 
"if he goes under, the customers will have no recourse at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Redman and his companies -- Redman Investment Co. and Del Sol 
Properties -- had enough experience in real estate to know better. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies advertised the scheme as a "fantastic opportunity" only on 
Spanish-language television stations in Southern California, and then bused 
potential customers out to the general area before giving them false and 
misleading statements about the land they were buying and what they could build 
on it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.5-acre parcels were offered for between $19,000 and $29,000, paid over a 
10-year period. But hundreds of alleged victims complained that after finishing 
their monthly installments, they found that they could not obtain county 
building permits. Among the reasons: The land had no legal access, the buyers 
were not legally registered as owners of the land, the parcels were not legally 
subdivided, or the land was zoned for something other than residential use. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is certainly a very sophisticated man who knows the system," Deputy City 
Atty. Ruth Kwan, head of the Consumer Protection Unit, said of Redman.

WATER AGENCY SUES CITY OVER ROAD, FLOOD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contending that they simply want to protect the region's ground-water supply, 
the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency filed a lawsuit Monday against the 
city of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit stems from the city's plans for a massive flood-control and 
road-widening project that would allow the development of thousands of homes, 
including the 7,200-home Ritter Ranch, in west Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no ulterior motive in this; we're not trying to stop the project," 
said Michael T. Riddell, a Riverside attorney representing AVEK. "Our sole 
concern is to ensure no adverse impact on ground-water recharge, which I'm sure 
the city of Palmdale is interested in protecting." 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials are concerned that, if not designed properly, the flood 
control portion of the project would hamper the natural percolation of the 
Amargosa Creek into the ground-water basin, which the lawsuit describes as "the 
principal source of water for the Antelope Valley." The agency sells water at 
wholesale to Antelope Valley water purveyors for domestic, industrial and 
agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that they (the city) haven't yet designed the flood control 
improvements and therefore it's very difficult to determine what those impacts 
are going to be on ground-water recharge," Riddell said. "We need to feel 
confident the improvements they do design will not have an adverse impact on 
ground-water recharge." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the agency and the city met several times over the past 
month to try to work out an agreement that would make the suit unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final effort, the Palmdale City Council last week unanimously approved a 
resolution vowing its "intent to protect the quantity and quality of recharge 
water from the Amargosa Creek. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Agency General Manager Wallace Spinarski said he is not sure that the 
resolution is enough to ensure that his agency's concerns are met as the city 
determines the final design of the flood control project. 
</P>
<P>
 By filing the lawsuit, the agency maintains its right to challenge the final 
plans for the project, Spinarski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to reach some settlement on the issues, but in a form that gives us 
sufficient guarantees against action by future City Councils," he said. "That 
probably hasn't happened in the form of a resolution."

CANON COMPUTER A LATECOMER TO PC MOVEMENT; INDUSTRY: COSTA MESA COMPANY RELYING 
ON BRAND NAME RECOGNITION, WITH AMBITIOUS GOAL OF $1 BILLION IN SALES BY 1997. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasuhiro Tsubota, president of Canon Computer Systems Inc., doesn't have a 
personal computer on his desk. His secretary prints his electronic mail for him 
every morning so he can read it and respond on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota has used PCs before, he says, so he isn't intimidated by them. His 
preference, though, is "to deal with people rather than computers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough, he will have a PC in his office as part of an internal electronic 
mail network at the company headquarters in Costa Mesa. "But I would use a 
computer as a driver uses a dashboard," he said, "to get a quick look at how 
our company is doing today." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota has to know where his company stands to take the division, a relative 
latecomer in the computer industry when it started in 1992, from annual sales 
of $300 million now to its ambitious goal of $1 billion by 1997. He is betting 
that Canon's reputation as a reliable brand name in the printer and copier 
business will win it PC customers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he expects sales for the company, a privately held subsidiary of 
Tokyo-based Canon Inc., to total $500 million. "We plan to be very aggressive," 
he said. "You have to do that in this industry or else." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota is venturing onto a field that has defeated some formidable 
competitors. Cypress-based Mitsubishi Electronics America, for example, left 
the PC systems market in 1990 after losing more than $65 million.  
</P>
<P>
 But Tsubota is betting that Canon's game plan -- a flexible management team 
that can respond quickly to fast-changing American tastes for computer 
products, a diverse line of low-priced PCs, the resurgence in brand loyalty and 
the technological superiority of its printers -- will guarantee his company a 
place among the industry's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese companies have done badly in the PC market in the last five years 
because the product cycles shortened and their centralized management 
operations reacted too slowly," said Philippe de Marcillac, PC analyst for 
Dataquest Inc., a market researcher in San Jose. "Canon is definitely late to 
the market. It has to move fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Canon could have suffered the same fate as Mitsubishi. It stumbled in the PC 
market in 1989, when the Japanese parent company introduced the Navigator, a 
computer that combined a PC, a printer, fax machine and telephone headset. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese designers of the product, unfamiliar with the U.S. market, didn't 
realize that the $2,449 computer lacked the speed and permanent memory to be 
competitive. It was discontinued in early 1992, said Ron Okamoto, director of 
PC product marketing for Canon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota explained that there have always been two schools of thought about 
PCs. "One said the multiple functions would be integrated on the PC, while 
others believe they would be like separate stereo components." 
</P>
<P>
 Navigator was introduced before its time, Canon officials say, and it taught 
them to create an autonomous U.S. subsidiary that could anticipate market 
trends better. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota, fresh from consulting for Steve Jobs' NeXT Computer Inc., was brought 
in to head the Canon computer unit in April, 1992. The parent company gave him 
$20 million to create the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 While other brand-name companies have been slashing their prices to wipe out 
competition from so-called clone makers, Canon has banked instead on using the 
success of its unique printer technology to expand its PC sales, which now 
account for roughly 20% of the parent company's overall revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called BubbleJet printer lays down tiny bubbles of quick-drying ink on 
paper with nearly the same print quality as a laser printer but at a lower 
cost. Canon has won 5,000 patents related to the technology since the 1970s. It 
exchanges licenses on the patents with market leader Hewlett-Packard Co. and 
makes the hardware, or engines, for HP's laser printers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the lower end of the market for so-called inkjet printers, Canon chose 
to compete with HP. Canon has seized 18% of the inkjet printer market from HP, 
which holds 51%, according to Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Canon launched a second generation of bubble-jet printers 
to appeal to small businesses that can't afford laser printers, which cost 
three times as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon has also introduced a color bubble-jet printer. That market is expected 
to grow from 1.2-million units sold in 1994 to 2.72 million by 1997, according 
to BIS Strategic Decisions in Norwell, Mass. Canon has about 5% of the market, 
while HP has 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 For Canon, "printing is their ticket for the future," said David Dukes, 
co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc., a computer distributor based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white printers are priced at about $399, low enough to be 
affordable for the small businesses that Canon has targeted for its computer 
sales. Analyst De Marcillac said that strategy seems wise, given that small 
businesses and home offices will soon be the largest part of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon's computers are sold in more than 5,000 stores now, up from about 3,800 
last fall. Tsubota is expanding the number to target larger corporations as 
well as the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also successfully revived the multi-function computer concept with 
a new model, the seven-pound NoteJet, which doubles as a portable computer and 
a bubble-jet printer. Okamoto considers it the company's flagship product, and 
he predicts more innovations to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The company faces challenges, one of the biggest being from HP. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shipped 5 million inkjet printers last year," said Richard Snyder, group 
general manager for HP's deskjet printer group in Vancouver, Wash. "That's 
means we ship more in a month than Canon does in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Canon isn't wavering from its goal of having $1 billion in revenue by 
1997, Tsubota said, and he envisions the company growing from 200 employees now 
to about 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent expansion has been outside Orange County, where Canon employs 130 at 
its headquarters. The company built a warehouse and computer assembly plant in 
Memphis, Tenn., and established a research unit in Portland, Ore., to develop 
computers that run software developed by NeXT, in which Canon owns a stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The company chose to build outside California, Tsubota said, not to escape the 
state's high business costs but to locate the warehouse near the assembly 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy at Canon, as at other Japan-based computer makers, is that a 
company should design and manufacture its products in the markets where they 
are sold, Tsubota said, so that management can stay flexible. "Our structure is 
set up so that we have more freedom here," he said. "Japan participates only in 
certain product lines." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Canon has already introduced 10 computer models, including a new 
printer line and color scanners. Tsubota's strategy so far has been to divide 
the company's resources among several categories of computers: portables, 
office models and multimedia computers, which have fancy video and sound 
capabilities for entertainment software.  
</P>
<P>
 Tsubota is also betting that the industry's new PowerPC computer chips, the 
first to challenge Intel Corp.'s hold on the market for the microprocessor, or

ROCKWELL'S RANK DIPS 2 SPOTS TO 45

<P>
 Rockwell, the highest-ranking Orange County company on the Fortune 500, had 
dropped again when the annual listing of the nation's biggest industrial 
companies was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, the giant technology conglomerate based in Seal Beach, dropped 
slightly to 45th place from 43rd, with $10.8 billion in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell makes products for the aerospace, automobile and telecommunications 
businesses. It was in 35th place two years ago with revenues of more than $12 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, AST Research in Irvine took another big jump -- from 367th 
place to 287th, with revenues of $1.4 billion. AST makes personal computers; it 
debuted on the list only two years ago, when it was in 431st place. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other local companies had revenues large enough to make the list: 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital in Irvine -- which makes computer products -- was in 318th 
place. That was up from 371st, with revenues of $1. 2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan, an Irvine maker of eye-care products, was in 384th place. That was 
down slightly from 381st. Allergan had $888 million in 1993 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman Instruments in Fullerton was in 389th place, down from 379th. The 
maker of medical instruments had revenues of $876 million last year. MICHAEL

CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST FORTUNE 500 FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, California edged out New York as home to more of the 
nation's 500 biggest industrial companies than any other state, Fortune 
magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
 California is home to 48 companies in the 1993 edition of the magazine's 
annual ranking of the top 500 corporations, with previous leader New York 
falling to third with 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the California-based companies joining the Fortune 500 are: Solectron, 
based in Milpitas; Synoptics Communications, Santa Clara; Cisco Systems, Menlo 
Park; and 3Com, Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest California-based company on the list is Chevron of San Francisco, 
which fell to 11th from 8th the previous year. It was followed by 
Hewlett-Packard of Palo Alto, which rose to 19th from 24th. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Southern California-based company was Atlantic Richfield of Los 
Angeles, unchanged at No. 22. It was followed by Lockheed of Calabasas, up to 
35th from 45th, and Rockwell of Seal Beach, down to 45th from 43rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, after losing money in 1992, the Fortune 500 as a group earned $62.6 
billion in 1993 while slashing thousands of jobs, Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit figure would be enough to wipe out the 1993 U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune attributed the improvement largely to "American industry's steady, 
relentless drive to raise productivity, improve quality and boost 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping were a decline in long-term interest rates that lowered the cost 
of borrowing, a broad pickup in the U.S. economy and the expensive Japanese 
yen, which made U.S.-built products ranging from cars to computers more 
affordable than comparable Japanese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement didn't benefit the U.S. job picture, however. Total employment 
among the 500 fell for the ninth straight year, to 11.5 million from 11.8 
million. The trend confirms a pattern of dwindling employment opportunities as 
businesses get more efficient with fewer workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune said the earnings improvement was especially significant because it 
was achieved despite stagnant growth in sales. In 1992, by comparison, the 500 
lost $196.2 million, the first time the roster as a whole has ever lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 1992 loss was due to a required accounting adjustment that changed 
the way companies report retiree health benefits, and that same adjustment also 
detracted from earnings in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When the effects of the accounting adjustment aren't included for both years, 
the Fortune 500 earned $81.7 billion in 1993 -- 15% more than the comparably 
adjusted $71 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings of the 500, based on annual sales, contained no significant 
surprises this year. But they did illustrate the rising strength of American 
auto making and a shrinkage of the American petroleum industry, which has been 
affected by lower oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. easily retained its position as the biggest company. But 
Ford Motor Co. bumped Exxon Corp. for the No. 2 spot, and Chrysler Corp. leaped 
from No. 11 to No. 8, bumping Chevron, DuPont Co. and Texaco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive cost-cutting kept the petroleum industry profitable: Exxon earned 
$5.3 billion, more than any other company.

AIRLINE TICKETING COMPANY IS BANKRUPT; LIQUIDATION: JUDGE ISSUES CHAPTER 7 
ORDER BECAUSE IRVINE FIRM OWES $2.2 MILLION TO CREDITORS AND EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Airline Computerized Ticketing in Irvine, which just months ago promoted the 
success of its electronic airline ticketing machines, was recently ordered into 
bankruptcy liquidation by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William R. Greendyke in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, JoAnne Stewart founded the company that specialized in electronic 
ticketing of flights after plans had been arranged by a travel agent.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the end of the world," said Stewart, who said Monday that she plans 
this week to petition the court to reorganize her company's debts under Chapter 
11 of the Bankruptcy Act. "We're picking up the pieces and moving on. I don't 
die easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Greendyke made the Chapter 7 order Wednesday against J.E. Marion Inc., the 
parent company of Airline Computerized Ticketing. Court filings estimated the 
company owed nearly $2 million to nearly 70 creditors, in addition to nearly 
$200,000 owed to eight employees, seven of whom worked in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just simply wanted to get paid," said Jeff Hoffman, former chief operating 
officer and company president from Houston, one of the creditors in the case. 
Hoffman said he was owed $51,000 in salary and vacation pay. He was not paid 
for three months because his paychecks either bounced or never arrived, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened. All the money and all the accounts were 
maintained in California," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Morello, an attorney with Pettit & Martin in Newport Beach, said the 
parent company was placed in Chapter 7 after former creditors and employees 
petitioned the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Southern District in Texas Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Morello represents several creditors and Debbie George, Airline Computerized 
Ticketing's former marketing manager, who said she is owed $12,000 in back 
salary and $12,000 in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are my clients going to get their money? We are very hopeful that they will," 
Morello said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Stewart allegedly let go a group of Houston employees and 
operations staff as part of a cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some disgruntled employees who did not want the company to 
continue on without them," Stewart, the company chairman, said Monday. "My 
company is not over, we're just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 3 written court response to the creditors claims, Airline 
Computerized Ticketing said the "petition has been brought in bad faith. The 
dispute involved disgruntled employees who resigned upon notice that they were 
to be terminated in December, 1993, as a result of a planned downsizing of" 
company operations. The company also admitted that it was "not paying its debts 
as they came due." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Airline Computerized Ticketing had installed ticket machines in 
downtown Los Angeles at 725 S. Figueroa St. and at 3 MGM Plaza in Santa Monica. 
Another was operating in New York's Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last September, Stewart said she started her business with $5 
million from her own savings and from friends and family. She predicted that 
300 ticket machines offering both discount and full-fare tickets would be 
placed nationwide by the end of 1993. She also predicted 5,000 machines would 
be in hotels, banks and shopping centers by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are trying to follow someone's dream, there comes a time when that 
dream has to become a reality," said Pam Stutes, a former customer service 
representative in Houston who said she is owed $884.55 in back salary. "But I 
think she (Stewart) thought she was losing control over her Houston staff. She 
didn't realize we were trying to make her company successful." Computerized

 An Alert Future: Between various California-bashing jokes, Aaron Goldberg, 
executive vice president of market researcher Computer Intelligence InfoCorp., 
gave his views on the computer industry's future last week to the UCI Chief 
Executive Roundtable, a monthly breakfast meeting of technology executives in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his predictions were the rise of "active systems," or software that 
alerts somebody to the changing status of a business so that a decision can be 
made before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, most software tells us what happened in the business, not what's 
going to happen," he said. "We need the kind of information that increases our 
knowledge of a company's internal ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said he expects the first prototypes of such systems to emerge in 
1994 through 1996 with widespread releases by 1998.

DELTA SAVINGS CLOSED; DEPOSITS TRANSFERRED TO EAST-WEST BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delta Savings Bank, seized 28 months ago amid claims of blackmail and racist 
treatment by federal regulators, has been closed and its $3.5 million in 
deposits transferred to East-West Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny thrift's lone office in Westminster was shuttered Friday.Customers 
were able to resume banking Saturday at a nearby branch of East-West, a thrift 
based in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides assuming all of Delta's 1,100 deposit accounts, East-West bought 
$700,000 worth of assets, mainly cash, out of $15.8 million in total assets. It 
paid $168 for the franchise. Delta's failure is expected to cost taxpayers $9.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's demise in November, 1991, would be a forgettable failure amid the 
debris of the industry were it not for the legal action regulators took to ban 
certain directors and officers from banking and to seek restitution. But in a 
rare court defeat, a judge ruled in September, 1992, that regulators had failed 
to prove their case against two directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also concluded that a federal examiner had blackmailed the thrift's 
executives into hiring her and then gave the thrift bad advice to follow. 
Evidence at the hearing also showed that federal examiners were racially biased 
against the Korean-born owners of Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Office of Thrift Supervision last year partially overruled 
the judge by ordering a lifetime ban against the directors but dropping its 
demand for damages. It was the first time the OTS ever overruled one of its 
judges.

DEALERSHIP TO AIM AT INDIVIDUAL TRUCK BUYERS; AUTOMOTIVE: TUTTLE-CLICK WILL 
LIMIT SALES TO PICKUPS, VANS AND SPORTS/UTILITY VEHICLES AT NEW IRVINE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Tuttle-Click Automotive Group, an Irvine-based chain of auto dealerships, 
said it will open what could be the nation's only Ford vehicle outlet solely 
focused on non-commercial trucks, vans and sports/utility vehicles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tuttle-Click Ford Truck and Van Center is expected to open Wednesday in 
the Irvine Auto Center. The 24,500-square-foot dealership at 14 Auto Center 
Drive will eventually provide jobs for 50 people, said Robert Tuttle, a 
managing partner with the Tuttle-Click group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some dealerships are selling more trucks than they are cars, and we're one of 
them," said Tuttle. "We wanted a dealership that dealt only with trucks and 
vans, which would really appeal to the public. We wanted something unique to 
increase our inventory and we wanted to have salespeople who are really 
knowledgeable about trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, who also is president of the Orange County Automotive Dealers Assn., 
said the dealership will have a room where potential buyers can watch videos 
about the trucks and will offer specialty products for vans and sport vehicles. 
He predicted the South County dealership near the El Toro "Y" will be a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine is a good location and auto centers are becoming more and more 
popular," agreed John Rettie, editor of the "California Report" for J.D. Power 
and Associates, an Agoura Hills-based automotive information company. "It 
sounds logical as Ford is doing much better in California in the truck business 
than they are doing in car sales." 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership expects to sell more than 250 trucks per month and will 
accommodate more than 400 used and new non-commercial Ford trucks, vans and 
sport utility vehicles. It will also have the largest truck body shop in Orange 
County, according to Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuttle Click Automotive Group currently has several dealerships in Orange 
County, including Tuttle-Click Dodge/Chrysler-Plymouth/Jeep-Eagle/Mitsubishi 
and Tuttle-Click Ford in the Irvine Auto Center, Tuttle-Click Nissan in Costa 
Mesa and the Tuttle-Click Dodge/Subaru dealership in the Tustin Auto Center. 
The company also has nine car dealerships in Arizona.

ART REVIEW; BETH B'S 'AMNESIA' BURNS INTO OUR MEMORY; THE NEW YORK-BASED 
ARTIST'S ONE-MINUTE VIDEO TAKES WORDS OF SOCIAL INTOLERANCE FROM HISTORY AND 
RENDERS IMPOSSIBLE THE PSYCHIC ACTION OF FORGETTING.

<P>
 Beth B's one-minute videotape "Amnesia" (1992) is among the more devastating 
bits of agitprop to have been produced in recent memory. A harshly lit sequence 
of individual talking heads emerges from total blackness to recite a stark 
litany of statements about an unidentified group of people. The rapid 
accumulation soon grows ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 They spread disease.  
</P>
<P>
 They smell bad.  
</P>
<P>
 They take our jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 They are sexually perverted.  
</P>
<P>
 They slaughter sheep secretly.  
</P>
<P>
 Exactly who "they" might be is never declared. But then, it doesn't have to 
be. The list of obvious candidates is long, and all answers are finally 
correct. "They" is anyone who is not "us." 
</P>
<P>
 The statements, rather than having been invented by the artist, were 
researched and compiled from a variety of historical episodes of social 
intolerance. At their conclusion a final, silent image blares the word AMNESIA 
in a capital-letter crescendo across the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 This visually arresting, conceptually concise videotape, which might even be 
described as perversely elegant in its calculated sense of chilly restraint, is 
a blunt attempt to create a work of art that will render impossible the psychic 
repression that allows forgetting. It works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amnesia" has been broadcast on MTV. If you missed it, it may currently be 
seen at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in a small but diverse exhibition of 
recent mixed-media works by the New York-based artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As currently installed, the tape loses a bit of its visceral punch: A video 
projector magnifies the image into a big picture on the end wall of a narrow 
gallery, with a concomitant loss of the crisp clarity and shocking intimacy 
that comes from seeing "Amnesia" inhabit the screen of an ordinary television 
set. Still, it remains convincing evidence of Beth B's unusual skill as an 
artist, especially in the mediums of film and video. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which was organized by the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, 
Ohio, also includes paintings, posters, photo-based works and a tabloid 
newspaper, modeled after the raunchy New York Post but ironically named Day of 
Hope. (The tabloid is filled with such "news" as an excerpt from the United 
Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.) Finally, an installation 
merging a sculptural environment with sound and a two-screen video projection 
dominates the main gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Lock and Key," as this last is titled, employs a direct talking-head 
format akin to that in "Amnesia." A video projector emits a visual soup of 
abstract imagery, which gives way to the sight of a handsome fellow on the 
left-hand screen. He makes random observations about human nature and then 
disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractive if vaguely disconcerting fellow on the left alternates with 
assorted, slightly annoying talking heads on the right, each of which tells a 
painful story of having been personally assaulted earlier in life. Finally, the 
text spoken by the actor at the left is identified as a transcript taken from 
interviews with the suave serial killer, Ted Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to this icy little theater of cruelty, which may be witnessed while 
seated on cold, hard, steel benches, a looming steel box invites viewers to 
open its heavy, lockable doors and enter one of four cramped chambers. Inside 
each is a steel bench affixed to the wall; an industrial light glows from the 
ceiling, an unpleasant drain is found in the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a voice. The recording (coolly spoken by actor Fred Ward) tells 
of the psychological effects of confinement. Taken from "In the Belly of the 
Beast," the memoir of convicted killer (and Norman Mailer's notorious protege) 
Jack Henry Abbott, it muses on the relationship between solitary confinement 
and death: "In death, the living thing ceases to experience." Stubbing out 
experience, of course, is what an isolation chamber means to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also what a history of violent assault can do to the mind. B's 
installation cleverly juxtaposes an interior meditation on isolation-as-death 
with external video stories of assault victims, whose confessional utterances 
to an assembled audience are meant to break the sense of isolation that 
typically shrouds such events. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the stunning "Amnesia," part of the success of "Under Lock and Key" 
will be found in its refusal to preach and, by extension, to divide. Neither 
work assumes a condescending position of knowledgeable correctness from which 
moral superiority might be inferred. Both trust the ambiguity of art, not the 
certainty of moral posturing, to function as the more powerful polemic tool. 
</P>
<P>
 B's paintings are less convincing. Appropriating racist and anti-Semitic 
images and words prominent in the fascist societies of 1930s Germany and 1940s 
Italy, she renders large caricatures of a black American soldier and a Jewish 
moneylender on unstretched canvas sewn into triptychs. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent seems to be to confront a usually hidden sanctification of evil, 
and thus defuse it, but the paintings are merely showy and vulgar. By contrast, 
Beth B's sureness with the spare means of a camera and dialogue is bracing.

 Walker to Leave Channel 2: Amid speculation that KCBS Channel 2 is about to 
lay out a fortune to steal anchor Ann Martin from KABC Channel 7, current KCBS 
anchor Bree Walker has announced that she is leaving the station and local news 
behind. Walker, who is on vacation this week and next, plans to quit the 
business when her contract -- which reportedly pays her around $800,000 a year 
to anchor the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news -- expires in September. She said she is 
forming her own TV production company to do reality-based programming, movies 
of the week and perhaps a daytime talk show. She also recently did a couple of 
small acting jobs in the movie "The Chase" and on the daytime soap "The Bold 
and the Beautiful." KCBS, which has languished in last place in the news 
ratings throughout Walker's 5 1/2-year tenure, has not formally announced the 
hiring of KABC's Martin, who will become a free agent in about two weeks. KCBS 
executives were not available for comment Monday.

 Wildmon Continues 'Blue' Campaign: The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon's American 
Family Assn. apparently has no plans to give up its campaign against ABC's 
"NYPD Blue," which it targeted as "soft-core pornography" even before the 
show's premiere. Ad Age magazine says the group will spend its entire 
$3-million annual media budget in the next few months on newspaper, radio and 
direct mail efforts to "dissuade" advertisers from backing the program next 
season. The show so far has more than stood up to Wildmon's tactics, becoming 
the season's top-rated new drama. POP/ROCK

 New Award Category: The Assn. of Independent Music Publishers, which last year 
was prompted by Whitney Houston's cover of Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love 
You" to start an annual award for "best film song from another source," has 
added a new category for its second annual AIMP Music Awards next month. In 
addition to the award for songs not eligible for Oscars, the group will pick a 
"best pop cover song," a category no longer eligible for the Grammys. Nominees, 
announced Monday, are 10,000 Maniacs' version of "Because the Night," UB-40's 
"Can't Help Falling in Love," Ugly Kid Joe's "Cat's in the Cradle," Rod 
Stewart's "Have I Told You Lately" and Michael Bolton's "To Love Somebody." In 
the film song category, nominees are "Dude Looks Like a Lady," seen in the 
films "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Wayne's World 2"; "In the Wee Small Hours of the 
Morning" and "When I Fall in Love," both from "Sleepless in Seattle"; "I Will 
Follow Him" from "Sister Act 2"; "That's Life" from "A Bronx Tale"; and "Walk

pictures taken with the classical pianist. The 59-year-old Cliburn seemed

MUSIC REVIEW; POLISHED SAMPLER FROM MASTER CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no gargantuan tasks before Paul Salamunovich and the Los Angeles 
Master Chorale Sunday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, but they did 
bring off their modestly challenging program with considerable skill and 
warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Working without an orchestra, Salamunovich had the Chorale singing in a 
polished and especially sensitive mode all evening and, what's more, in a sure 
and relaxed manner. The concert's joys, then, were many, though the 
musical-sampler agenda felt more like snacking than a complete and nourishing 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Harking back to a concept of Roger Wagner's, Salamunovich invited members of 
seven Southland college choirs to join the Chorale for nine brief pieces on the 
second half of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bach's "Gott ist unsre Zuversicht" (from Cantata No. 197) and Handel's 
"Music Spread Thy Voice Around" (from "Solomon"), the conductor kept his choirs 
singing lightly, clearly and rhythmically -- there were no muddled Baroque 
lines despite the large forces. Similarly, in the rolling phrases and rich 
textures of Vaughan Williams' "See the Chariot at Hand," he allowed its 
lushness while avoiding pomposity. 
</P>
<P>
 A cappella versions of "Shenandoah," Randall Thompson's once-popular (and 
still cherishable) "Alleluia" and Jester Hairston's spiritual "I Want Jesus" 
revealed the combined choirs in perfect balance and blend, sensitive to 
dynamics and phrasing with intelligent nuance. Indeed, it would be difficult to 
ask for more. 
</P>
<P>
 These same virtues surfaced when the Chorale by itself offered two 
seldom-heard works by 20th-Century masters. Bernstein's neo-medieval Missa 
Brevis, for a cappella chorus, percussion and countertenor, received a crisply 
executed and firmly directed reading from all involved, with John Klacka 
winding gracefully through the weird, high-flying countertenor solos. 
</P>
<P>
 A fine quartet of soloists -- including a remarkable boy soprano, Michael 
Waring -- took their turns in Britten's "Rejoice in the Lamb," a moving setting 
of a poem by the (literally) demented Christopher Smart. Salamunovich shaped a 
dramatically rising performance and his choir responded intensely. TIMOTHY

TV REVIEW; ELLEN DEGENERES JOINS THE SITCOM BRIGADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Seinfeld," David Letterman and even "Beavis and Butt-head" have mastered the 
art of being funny about nothing in the 1990s. The premiere of "These Friends 
of Mine" tries to do so but fails. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC comedy series from David Rosenthal and the once-high-achieving Carol 
Black and Neal Marlens ("The Wonder Years") plugs Ellen DeGeneres into a 
"Seinfeld"-like universe that wears its pseudo-hipness like a leisure suit. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres is bookstore/cafe manager Ellen Morgan. Holly Fulger is her friend, 
Holly. Arye Gross is Ellen's platonic roommate, Adam, and Maggie Wheeler is his 
friend, Anita. The front door is never locked, and everyone drops by. Then they 
plop down and fret about minutia. 
</P>
<P>
 Managing to trivialize even trivia, these habitual schmoozers appear to have 
hermetically sealed brains. Tonight's topics are Holly's new boyfriend and 
Ellen's new driver's license photo. 
</P>
<P>
 During sex, the boyfriend barks like a dog ("woof, woof"). You know this is 
hilarious because the studio audience finds it hilarious. Either that or 
someone has a heavy thumb on the sweetened laughter button. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen's bad photo becomes an epic crisis. Many will relate to being 
photographically disfigured on a driver's license, few to the intensity of her 
neurosis over it. 
</P>
<P>
 A cop stops her and she's embarrassed to show him her license? Get a life. 
More to the point, get a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres is the latest in a long line of stand-up comics to get sitcoms, some 
of which have turned out to be surprisingly good. Yet initially, at least, she 
fades into her own ensemble, lacking the quirky breeziness of a Jerry Seinfeld 
or Garry Shandling (HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show"), for example, or the 
distinctive presence of a Brett Butler in "Grace Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The Black/Marlens/Rosenthal script isn't much help. Among other trifles, you'd 
criticize the way it turns grunting, casual sex into a gag, but that wouldn't 
be hip. HOWARD ROSENBERG

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BLIND MELON SHOWS SWEET SIDE AT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its long psychedelic jams and good-vibes attitude, L.A.'s Blind Melon has 
been lumped in with such young Grateful Dead disciples as the Spin Doctors and 
Phish. Headlining the Hollywood Palladium on Sunday, though, the quintet set 
itself apart by adding an acid-rock edge with its heavy guitars and hard bass 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, though, was a winning personality. Leading the group in its 
biggest L.A. concert yet (it was relocated to the Palladium from the outdoor 
Castaic Lake after last week's storm), singer Shannon Hoon displayed a relaxed 
and occasionally clumsy stage presence that made him all the more likable and 
approachable. 
</P>
<P>
 He tripped over his mike stand more than once, and danced like an uninhibited 
little kid during the extended instrumentals. Hoon plucked petals off a bouquet 
of roses and threw them into the audience, passed a monitor speaker into the 
crowd ("Here, this has too much boom in it") and handed his mike into a sea of 
fans to sing the words to Blind Melon's hit "No Rain."  
</P>
<P>
 That song (the one with the video featuring the dancing bee-girl) is typical 
of Blind Melon's free-form mix of hooky, laid-back rock with a slightly 
high-strung edge. Hoon's vocals ranged from bird-like noises to falsetto cries 
to less anxious tones that conveyed a winning vulnerability.  
</P>
<P>
 It added up to a sweet, celebratory sound, and the packed-in crowd was dancing 
rather than moshing in what seemed more like a big, happy festival than a 
typical high-security Palladium show. When Hoon stepped back from the mike and 
shook the tambourine, his hair hanging over his face, it could have very well 
been a scene from some long-gone, '60s love-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sunny qualities have been considered a weakness by some critics, who 
dismiss the band as ineffectually sappy, but at the Palladium, that light, 
carefree appeal proved refreshing. Blind Melon may be called an alternative 
rock band, but it's really an alternative itself to the screaming Angst that 
dominates that genre. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act Dig, another L.A. quintet that's enjoying MTV success, 
unleashed a huge, all-consuming sound fueled by three guitarists. The layers of 
distortion and melody assumed an alluring, mantra-like quality, but the songs 
themselves never seemed to lift off. Singer Scott Hackwith added slight 
dynamics with his nervous, John Lydon tones, but with nothing more popping out 
of the dense set to grab you, the overall effect was more numbing than 
enticing.

TV REVIEW; A 'GAME' LOOK AT WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, sports fans: Name the Final Four teams in this weekend's NCAA basketball 
championship. The women's edition. 
</P>
<P>
 We're waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Time's up. (Answer: North Carolina, Purdue, Louisiana Tech and Alabama.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's not an answer on the lips of America, not like the men's game. 
The subliminal point of Becky Smith's "In the Game," a chronicle for 
"Frontline" of the Stanford women's 1989-90 basketball season, is that women's 
hoops is only just starting to get respect. While coach Tara VanDerveer's 
Stanford Cardinals were selling out their hall, the Oklahoma Sooners' women's 
program was axed, then reinstated. VanDerveer's team was drawing much bigger 
crowds than the men's games, but her $60,000 salary was half that of the men's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 VanDerveer's salary has now reached that goal of women's sports -- gender 
equity -- but it took the threat of a discrimination suit, and not just 
winning, to press her case. When she flashes "The Art of War" in front of her 
players, one gets the sense that it won't be useful just on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Game" alternates between being a suspenseful history of a dramatic 
Cardinals year (aided by Alfre Woodard's felt narration) and burrowing 
underneath the game itself, understanding that this is a life metaphor for 
young women who have no hope of parlaying their talents into a nonexistent pro 
career in the United States. This fact is especially bitter for the team's star 
point guard, Jennifer Azzi, who can drive Magic-style to the rim and shoot 
three-pointers with ease. Azzi's the go-to gal, an All-American cinch, but she 
must eventually move to Sweden to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing before "In the Game" has ever taken us into the locker rooms and 
viewing rooms and classrooms of women's college basketball, to show that, 
fundamentally, it's just like the guys' game. Just like the Fab Five's Chris 
Webber, Azzi calls a time-out with seconds left when there are no time-outs 
left. Just like the men, several Cardinals suffer serious knee injuries. Just 
like the Fab Five again, a team chemistry slowly struggles to form, and when it 
does, it's awesome. ROBERT KOEHLER

 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S. 
government is very concerned that the carjacking killings of Takuma Ito and Go 
Matsuura, both 19, will create "a very distorted and one-sided view of the 
United States abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton expressed condolences to Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa during a telephone conversation about Japan's new economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Gov. Pete Wilson called on the state Legislature to impose 
the death penalty on those who commit murder during a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 As headlines in the Japanese press decried America's fascination with guns, 
Japanese exchange students throughout the Southland were suddenly more cautious 
and fearful about this foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshimoto Hirakawa, 20, a business student at Chapman University in Orange, 
said he was lucky to have friends who told him about the dangers of crime when 
he arrived here from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came to the United States, my friends told me what to worry 
about," he said. "Now I share these things with newcomers, like never walk 
alone after midnight. Never drive alone into a bad neighborhood, especially at 
night. And, listen to the local guys about where you should and where you 
shouldn't go. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan, it's so safe you don't have to worry about anything," he continued. 
"That's why we take it easy when we come here. We just don't think it can 
happen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, a Japanese citizen, and Matsuura, who was born in the United States but 
grew up in Japan, were shot in the head late Friday night in a carjacking in 
the parking lot of a San Pedro supermarket. Police -- who remained 
close-mouthed on Monday about the case -- recovered their white 1994 Honda 
Civic on Sunday not far from the scene of the crime, but not before the two 
young men died after being taken off life-support at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiko Kagami, an English student at Cal State Fullerton, said she, for one, 
will not be going to her local supermarket after dark anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very scared," Kagami, 22, said. "This problem never happens in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Ako Kasahara, 34, who is studying English at UC Irvine, said she hopes the 
tragedy will not make people in Japan think America is a "terrible country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this country, I like California, the weather and the people," she 
said. "But you need to know you're not in Japan anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called a news conference in Los 
Angeles with the Japanese consul general, Seiichiro Noboru, hoping to assuage 
the alarm of tourism officials in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is not a place where this or any other type of violence should be 
tolerated," Riordan said, vowing not to rest as mayor "until Los Angeles is 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 And Noboru refrained from making generalizations about violence in the United 
States, promising instead that the incident "should not and will not have any 
effect upon the friendly relationship between this country and Japan (or) . . . 
change the love of the Japanese people toward sunny and warm Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 But those promises faced an uphill battle against a growing impression in 
Japan that the United States is a dangerous and violent society that, unlike 
Japan, has done little to control the use and ownership of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gun Society . . . Another Tragedy in Los Angeles," trumpeted one headline in 
the newspaper Sankei Sports. "For a Car?" Added an editorial in the Japan 
Times: "A beginning must be made to combat the American gun culture, which is 
getting out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Japanese students in Southern California reported that parents have 
been calling frantically from abroad, hoping to persuade their children to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Morikazu Sano, a communications student at Cal State Fullerton, said he also 
had a call from his worried family, who more than ever want him to come home to 
Japan once he graduates this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sano, 23, said he has been more aware of crime problems since his own car was 
burglarized two years ago in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shocked me so much," he said. "After that, I couldn't trust anyone. That 
woke me up. I don't go out alone at night. I don't even go to Ralph's or other 
supermarkets at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Takayuki Nishio, a 23-year-old exchange student studying English at Cal State 
Fullerton, said he believes colleges could do more to inform foreign students 
of crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal State Fullerton is pretty safe," he said. "But we cannot be too careful." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3 million Japanese tourists and students visit the United States 
each year, about one in six of them bound for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the damage the slayings could do to Los Angeles' international 
reputation, officials said, the deaths could cause financial repercussions. 
Some smaller colleges have become increasingly dependent on Japanese 
enrollment, and even before the killings, many students had trouble convincing 
their parents that the United States -- and Los Angeles in particular -- was a 
safe place to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns have helped dampen the flow of students from Japan to the United 
States in recent years, although the slumping Japanese economy and the 
increasing popularity of European destinations have also been factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Japanese students in the United States jumped from 17,000 in 
1983 to a peak of nearly 58,000 in 1990, aided by the strong yen, but slipped 
to about 40,000 last year, according to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles-area tourism officials expressed concerns about the 
impact the slayings will have on the flow of nearly 500,000 Japanese who visit 
Los Angeles County annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese tourist market is much more volatile and problematic than most," 
said Stanley Plog, a travel and tourism research specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no cancellations, but I think it will affect tourism, not 
dramatically or immediately, but gradually," said Shiro Monden, the Los Angeles 
general manager of Japan Travel Bureau International, a large Japanese tour 
operator that sends about 100,000 customers a year to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings in Los Angeles, which have sparked outrage locally and abroad and 
which have been widely covered by the Japanese news media, have fed a 
longstanding Japanese perception that the United States is a dangerous place. 
Shooting deaths of Japanese students in Baton Rouge, La., in 1992 and in 
Northern California in 1993 were covered by the Japanese press as continuing 
evidence of the ruthlessness of America's "gun society." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the (Baton Rouge) killing, of course we were worried sick to have a 
child go to the U.S.," said Rumiko Ito, mother of Takuma Ito, on a Japanese 
television broadcast. "We said: 'Why would you even think of going to that 
country?' But this was his dream, to go to college there." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Southland colleges and universities on Monday were planning special 
safety presentations to make international students more aware of crime 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only hope that from a tragedy of this magnitude, we can somehow find an 
opportunity in this to make everyone a little bit more aware," said Bob 
Ericksen, director of international education and exchange at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to know whether the incident will have any impact on 
enrollment of Japanese students at local colleges. Southern California is the 
most popular foreign destination in the world for Japanese students, according 
to Japanese education sources. A significant part of the 40,000 Japanese who 
come to study in the United States each year head for Los Angeles, attracted by 
its reputation for beaches, good weather and easygoing atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Masaru Yamada, president of ICS, a Japanese company that facilitates 
foreign study programs, said the impact of the slayings could be significant. 
The news, he noted, hit just as students are preparing their applications for 
summer study-abroad programs. He said he expects some students to change their 
destinations from Los Angeles to smaller towns in the United States or to 
Australia, Canada or Britain, which are perceived as safer.

O.C. RIDERS CLIMB ABOARD METROLINK'S 1ST TRIP TO L.A.; TRANSIT: BALLOONS AND 
BANDS GREET ABOUT 2,800 PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE 3 TRAINS. RIDES ARE FREE THROUGH 
THURSDAY.

 Three Metrolink trains traversed the rails of Orange County for the first time 
Monday, carrying about 2,800 commuters and joy riders into Los Angeles and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid all the hoopla that surrounded the train's debut, transportation 
officials acknowledged that they hadn't quite hit their target audience -- at 
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Train enthusiasts from as far away as Corona, students on spring break 
visiting friends in Los Angeles, and transportation officials were among the 
first to ride the flashy periwinkle-and-white, double-decker cars. They took 
advantage of free service offered through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new system's lifeblood -- business people hoping to avoid the freeway 
crunch between Orange County and Los Angeles -- seemed to be in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said the six-county rail agency hopes 
Monday's joy riders will tell their commuting friends about the easy ride into 
Los Angeles' Union Station, prompting more working folk to try out Metrolink as 
the week goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said 1,710 people rode the three morning trains into Los Angeles, and 
a total of 2,800 riders were expected throughout the day. Previously, the lone 
Amtrak commuter train from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles carried an 
average of 400 passengers a day. He said Metrolink hopes to turn about 25% of 
this week's free riders into regular Metrolink riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The group most likely to benefit from the introduction of Metrolink are those 
commuters who were already taking Amtrak occasionally into Los Angeles. There 
are more chances to catch the Metrolink than the Amtrak commuter train, since a 
Metrolink train stops three times each morning and evening in San Juan 
Capistrano, Irvine, Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Orange County commuters say, getting out of work on time isn't always a 
sure thing, so having three times -- 4:30, 5:37 and 6:25 p.m. -- to catch a 
train out of Los Angeles should prevent a lot of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains' debut in Metrolink's newly served Orange County cities were marked 
by bands, food and balloons, along with free cardboard trains for everyone who 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Anaheim, Mickey Mouse boarded the Metrolink for the seven-minute ride 
to Fullerton, where he was greeted by a bevy of tiny fans. But most of them 
left along with Mickey without hopping a ride themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kobayashi was grateful for the Metrolink's start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the Buena Park computer engineer started using public 
transportation to get to downtown Los Angeles, he missed the 7:14 a.m. Amtrak 
train from Fullerton because of an accident on the Riverside Freeway. He wasn't 
out of luck, though, as he caught the 8:11 Metrolink and settled in to read and 
relax on the 45-minute trip. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans each month to buy a 10-trip Amtrak ticket for the ride into 
Los Angeles and a 10-trip Metrolink ticket for the ride home, so he can still 
use the 7:14 a.m. Amtrak train and have flexible times for coming home in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people who tried out the Metrolink on Monday said they're not sure 
they'll convert to trains because the price is too steep. A monthly pass from 
San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles costs $208; from Irvine and Santa Ana, $176; 
and from Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton, $144. 
</P>
<P>
 "For $3.50 more a day (for the train), I might as well keep taking the bus," 
said Anaheim paralegal Laurie Schwartz, as she caught the 8:11 a.m. Metrolink. 
"The comfort level's about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County route is the fifth for Metrolink. It also runs commuter 
trains into and out of Los Angeles from Ventura, Santa Clarita, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties. Metrolink Fares

Angeles' Union Station: 05,21,09,12,10,14 Station One way Round trip 10 trips

KING RE-ENACTS BEATING AT TRIAL OF SUIT AGAINST CITY; COURTS: 'I COULD HEAR MY 
BONES CRUNCHING,' HE TELLS JURORS. HE SAYS HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE AS OFFICERS 
HIT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rodney G. King on Monday told a federal court jury in his lawsuit against the 
city of Los Angeles that he was stripped of his decency and still has physical 
and emotional scars from his beating at the hands of Los Angeles police 
officers three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 King, wearing an open-collared white shirt and gray slacks, answered a battery 
of questions from his lead attorney, Milton Grimes, recalling the night of the 
beating and his feelings at the time. At one point he re-enacted the incident, 
stepping down from the witness stand and lying on the floor to demonstrate his 
vulnerability on the night of March 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 During the beating, he recalled after returning to the stand, he could hear 
his bones breaking from the baton blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had lost half of my face. . . . I could hear my bones crunching 
every time the baton hit me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like throwing an egg and hearing the shell crack," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has admitted liability and jurors have been asked to set a damage 
figure. King is asking for $9.5 million in damages. The most the city has 
offered is $1.25 million plus attorneys fees. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who seemed confident as he answered questions, said he attempted to 
break free and run from the officers only when he felt his life was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to kill you, nigger. Run!" King quoted at least one of the 
officers as saying. He said the officers also chanted that racial epithet at 
him as they kicked him and struck him with their batons. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether officers used racial epithets during the beating has been 
in dispute. Shortly after his arrest in 1991, King said he did not believe the 
beating was racially motivated. It was not until later that he said the 
officers made racially derogatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 King's testimony Monday is consistent with comments he made during the federal 
civil rights case against the officers, but it does not conform with what he 
told a federal grand jury in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During the federal civil rights trial, King was asked several times when he 
had heard the racial remarks, and at one point said he wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I forget a lot of things," King responded at the time. "Sometimes I 
remember. Sometimes I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning Monday, King said the incident began while he was out 
celebrating with friends because he had been rehired by a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was proud of myself. I was very proud of myself for having got back with my 
company," said King, who had served time in prison for robbery before the 
confrontation with police that ended in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 King, admitting that he had drunk too much alcohol that night, said he 
panicked when a California Highway Patrol car began to follow his car. He said 
he was afraid he would be sent back to prison if he was caught driving under 
the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 King testified Monday that he tried to elude authorities for about 12 blocks 
before deciding that it made little sense to try to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 After he stopped his car, he offered no resistance and tried to comply with 
officers' commands, he testified. He said he did not strike or attack the 
officers who beat him and that his actions were intended only to protect 
himself while they were striking, stomping and kicking him. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he eventually lay down on the pavement as he was ordered, but that 
after he did, one of the officers struck him on the right side of the face with 
what he thought was a baton. "I felt like I lost half my face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked him what he said at that time. "I told him I felt fine," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he said that, King said: "I didn't want to give (them) the 
satisfaction (of knowing) that it really hurt. Because of the way I was raised, 
my dad told me to never show feeling. Don't show pain, don't let anyone see you 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 King said he did flinch when an officer pointed a gun at him. At that point, 
he said, another officer shot him with a Taser -- an electrical device designed 
to immobilize a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a cow that was waiting to be slaughtered, just like a piece of 
meat," King recalled after he had returned to the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 King said the officers' taunting and laughter made him think that police 
beatings were common practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling that this happens all the time," he said. "I just happened to 
run into the wrong pack of dogs, police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 King pointed to several scars on his face and body from wounds he received 
from the beating and from being dragged to an ambulance. He said he still has 
numbness on the right side of his face from metal baton blows and where surgery 
was needed to correct a sunken eye socket. He still walks with a limp and he 
said he suffers headaches, depression, anxiety and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of threats to his life, he said, he is seldom able to go out in public 
with his family. He said that when he does, he is reminded often of the 
humiliating event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel bad, it makes me feel horrible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that he feared for his life even before FBI agents disclosed a plot 
by young skinheads to assassinate him, and that he took such precautions as 
having surveillance cameras installed in his home. He said he has hired 
bodyguards and has a pit bull for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are expected to cross-examine King today, and the first 
phase of the trial is expected to end Thursday. In the second phase, jurors are 
to assign blame to individual defendants, including former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon 
and former officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. 
Briseno. Koon and Powell were convicted of violating King's civil rights in the 
federal trail and are serving 30-month sentences.

U.S. RUSHES TO REASSURE JAPAN AFTER CARJACKING

 As the weekend slayings of two Marymount College students sent shock waves 
through Japan and Japanese American communities, U.S. dignitaries rushed Monday 
to reassure frantic parents and to counter charges in the Japanese media that 
Southern California is a gun-infested danger zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S. 
government is very concerned that the carjacking killings of Takuma Ito and Go 
Matsuura, both 19, will create "a very distorted and one-sided view of the 
United States abroad."

</P>
<P>
 The Mainichi Shimbun headlined its story, "One More Nightmare in the Gun 
Society." The Asahi Shimbun commented on its front page: "Isn't it strange that 
in the country that leads the civilized world, you never know where or when 
somebody will be shot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, a Japanese citizen, and Matsuura, who was born in the United States but 
grew up in Japan, were shot in the head Friday night during a carjacking in the 
parking lot of a San Pedro supermarket. The two teen-agers died Sunday after 
being taken off life-support systems at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Police -- 
who remained close-mouthed about the case -- recovered the white 1994 Honda 
Civic on Sunday not far from the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Japanese students in Southern California reported that parents have 
been calling frantically from abroad, hoping to persuade their children to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3 million Japanese tourists and students visit the United States 
each year, about one in six of them bound for Los Angeles County. At Santa 
Monica College, there are 600 Japanese students -- more than any other foreign 
nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the damage the slayings could do to Los Angeles' international 
reputation, officials said, the deaths could cause financial repercussions. 
Some smaller colleges have become increasingly dependent on Japanese

</P>
<P>
 Nao Murakami, a 20-year-old student attending El Camino College, said that her 
mother called Sunday and talked for two hours, trying to persuade her to come 
back to Japan. Murakami said she is not sure what she will do, but "when I 
heard the news I wanted to go back to Japan. I'm very afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother asked that she not go out after 7 p.m., and Murakami agreed. That 
is a big change from life in Japan, where women are accustomed to walking the 
streets of Tokyo alone, even late at night, without fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Japanese students say that the incident has not changed their plans. One 
friend of the slain students said at the hospital Sunday that he had no plans 
to return to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew things like this could happen. If someone is killed, it's not so 
strange," said the student, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to know whether the incident will have any impact on 
enrollment of Japanese students at local colleges. Southern California is the 
most popular foreign destination for Japanese students, according to Japanese 
education sources. A significant part of the 40,000 Japanese who come to study 
in the United States each year head for Los Angeles, attracted by its 
reputation for beaches, good weather and easygoing atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Masaru Yamada, president of ICS, a Japanese company that facilitates 
foreign study programs, said the impact of the slayings could be significant. 
The news, he noted, hit just as students are preparing their applications for 
summer study-abroad programs. He said he expects some students to change their 
destinations from Los Angeles to smaller towns in the United States or to 
Australia, Canada or Britain, which are perceived as safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Study-abroad programs are big business in Japan, where students pay companies 
such as ICS $3,000 or more for help in getting into an American college -- on 
top of tuition and living fees. Yamada said his company held a board meeting to 
figure out a strategy to respond to what may be fewer applications. 
</P>
<P>
 If the image of Los Angeles as a dangerous place does cause a sharp drop in 
foreign admissions, it could have a financial impact on such institutions as 
Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the population from Asia, they are paying non-resident tuition, 
so certainly the loss of large numbers of students would reduce the income to 
the college," said Susan Moore, a counselor at the college. But she stressed 
that the most important impact would be a need for more counseling to help 
students cope with increased fears of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tourism front, officials of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors 
Bureau said Monday that they have contacted major Japanese tour wholesalers to 
head off any concerns. Michael Collins, the bureau's public affairs vice 
president, stressed that Los Angeles is a relatively safe destination compared 
to other major U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to emphasize that this is a horrible exception," Collins said. "But 
it's the exceptions that get the news."

20 DIE AS UNREST INVADES URBAN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fierce gun battles and other political violence raged in skyscraper-lined 
streets here Monday, turning the commercial heart of the country's most 
important city into an urban war zone a month before democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown shooting sprees, which left at least 20 people dead and scores 
wounded, erupted after thousands of spear-carrying Zulu nationalists marched 
and danced through the central business district to protest South Africa's 
first all-race elections and to demand a sovereign Zulu state. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's carnage was an ominous turning point in the bloodstained march from 
apartheid to democracy. The chaos marked the first time that the ethnic 
fighting and political terror that have ravaged impoverished black townships 
for years have spread into downtown Johannesburg and paralyzed the bustling 
center of Africa's strongest economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight Zulus were shot to death and nine were wounded in a narrow 
street beside the headquarters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
ANC spokesmen said security guards had fired into the crowd from ground level 
to stop them from storming the office. But witnesses said the protesters were 
only marching by when at least three ANC guards opened fire from a first-floor 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, police said, a wild 20-minute gun battle erupted in a small 
park in front of the main library, where thousands of Zulus had massed. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused police and numerous marchers fired pistols and assault rifles in all 
directions after shots seemed to come from a sniper in a high-rise tower, and 
the rattle and boom of warfare echoed down the glass and concrete canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other people were shot to death at the Carlton Center, an upscale 
shopping mall under a well-known luxury hotel. And one man's horrible death was 
grimly recorded for television when he was repeatedly hit in the head with a 
brick as a mob cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 The midday, mid-town violence clearly showed how explosive South Africa 
remains, despite four long years of preparations and negotiations for the April 
26-28 elections to finally end white minority rule and inaugurate a government 
elected by the long disfranchised black majority. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk and ANC spokesmen said they deplored the 
nightmarish scenes of violence but insisted that the election would not be 
delayed despite the demands of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which organized the 
march. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the political process for 
provocative and potentially violent actions, such as we have seen today," De 
Klerk said in a statement. "It not only endangers the elections and reform 
process, but the very fabric of society." 
</P>
<P>
 A European peace monitor who witnessed the shooting was even more pessimistic. 
"This is just the start," he said. "Now it gets very bloody." 
</P>
<P>
 ANC regional leader Tokyo Sexwale also warned that the day presaged further 
violence. "Our information is (that) a similar type of operation will take 
place shortly before the election so the voting can be declared null and void," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalries between ANC and Inkatha factions, fueled by ethnic tensions between 
Xhosas and Zulus, the two largest tribes, were blamed for 4,000 deaths last 
year. According to a recent judicial report, at least some of the Zulus were 
armed by police officials aiming to destabilize the country to prolong white 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting here mirrored an upsurge in violence in Natal province, the Zulu 
stronghold, where Inkatha and ANC-supporting Zulus have stepped up a low-level 
war. More than 150 people have been killed in the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Natal-based Zulus were bused into the black townships around 
Johannesburg over the weekend to attend the march and rally. More than a dozen 
people were reported killed and more than 200 wounded in the townships 
overnight and early today around the workers' barracks where the Zulus are 
concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses and reports here, marauding groups of Zulus abducted 
passengers from minivans used as taxis, fired on passing commuter trains, 
bombed an ANC office and burned homes, shops and vehicles in tense townships 
across Soweto and the East Rand. More violence was expected in response to the 
day's shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first groups of armed Zulus began parading in downtown Johannesburg by 
7:30 a.m., chasing pedestrians, tearing up ANC posters and menacing drivers. 
Marchers presented a fierce image: Most carried painted goatskin shields, waved 
spears or clubs and wore headgear made of leopard pelts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thabo Mbeki, ANC national chairman, told a news conference that senior police 
officials had agreed Sunday afternoon to set up roadblocks to keep armed 
protesters from approaching the ANC offices. "Clearly the roadblocks were not 
set up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mbeki said party leaders had repeated calls to police early Monday after shots 
were fired at people entering the ANC building. He said a squad of 10 officers 
arrived but fled and did not return when another group of protesters waving 
spears and clubs approached and ANC security men fired into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The group approached for a third time, led by a man carrying an AK-47 rifle, 
"with the obvious intent of storming the ANC head office," Mbeki said. At that 
point, he said, the ANC guards "fired into the advancing group." 
</P>
<P>
 He specifically denied witnesses' claims that several guards had fired down 
from a concrete balcony that overhangs the street. But bullet holes and fresh 
gouges in the balcony suggested that those in the crowd were firing upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Mbeki stopped short of accusing the police of supporting the protesters. "It 
is difficult to understand, given all these warnings, why nothing was done," he 
said. "It suggests a little bit more than incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
 But few police were on hand when several thousand Zulus gathered near an 
obelisk in the Library Gardens about noon. They marched up and down the street 
in no apparent order, beating their shields with small spears and leaping in 
the air. One man, wearing a clown's red wig, waved a long asagai (machete), 
while another in a Wayne's World cap pounded the pavement with an iron rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shops and office buildings were already closed, behind steel shutters. 
Nearby streets were deserted. "We want our country," they chanted in Zulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, at 12:20 p.m., gunfire seemed to come from the back of the City 
Hall. First one shot. Then another. Then a long, loud burst. As the crowd 
scattered or dived to the ground in panic, a fusillade of answering gunfire 
began to echo and roar on all sides. A policeman, shot in the chest, fell in 
the street. He and other wounded were soon carried to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows in at least two nearby office buildings were smashed by gunfire from 
the ground, but squads of police pointed and fired in several directions as the 
echoes made it impossible to determine the source of the shooting 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, they fired flash grenades into the park, presumably to force the 
crowd to flee the open ground and seek safety under nearby buildings. Scores 
ran, or scrambled like crabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were definitely people shooting from the buildings," said police Brig. 
Gen. Buks Meintjes, moments after the firing stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside him, a Zulu man lay dead. Meintjes said the police had killed him after 
they saw him firing an assault rifle into the upper windows of Custom House, a 
nearby office building. Other bodies lay in the street and beside a building. 
Hundreds of shoes littered the square, lost by members of the fleeing crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulus insisted that ANC security men had fired upon them, although they 
had not actually seen them. "We were just talking and they just started 
shooting into the crowd," said Moses Mzulu, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally arrived in force after the shooting, moving reinforcements into 
the city in rumbling convoys of armored vehicles. By nightfall, soldiers in 
combat gear patrolled the deserted streets.

RIGHTISTS WIN HISTORIC VOTE IN ITALY; EUROPE: MEDIA TYCOON SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS 
FRONT-RUNNER FOR PRIME MINISTER. HIS THREE-PARTY ALLIANCE LEADS IN BOTH HOUSES 
OF PARLIAMENT. CORRUPTION FUROR PROPELS SHIFT FROM CENTRIST RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after his debut as a politician, media billionaire Silvio 
Berlusconi led right-wing forces Monday to an unprecedented victory in Italian 
national elections, emerging as the front-runner to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In elections termed the most critical in more than four decades for a country 
convulsed by longstanding government corruption, Berlusconi's restive, 
three-party alliance trounced traditionally dominant centrist parties and 
outdistanced once-favored leftists running as a movement of Progressives. 
</P>
<P>
 For Italy, installation of a right-wing government would mean moves toward a 
streamlined bureaucracy, intensified free-market economics with attendant labor 
unrest and, perhaps, evolution toward a political landscape sharply divided 
between the left and right. The rightist government could be destabilized by 
internal squabbles, but Italy's democratic institutions are not at issue and 
neither are its commitments to NATO or the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Projections before dawn this morning gave the right substantial pluralities in 
both the Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Berlusconi's alliance had 
about 46% nationwide for the Chamber and 40% or so for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in both chambers were the leftists, led by the former Italian Communist 
Party, with 34% or so. Centrist parties, which have controlled all 52 Italian 
governments since World War II, were getting about 16% -- less than half their 
traditional vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Final returns later today will show the extent of Berlusconi's victory, which, 
one of his three nationwide television channels reported, may include an 
absolute majority in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, 57, not only headed the national campaign of his new Forza Italia 
(Go, Italy) movement but also ran as a candidate, easily winning a seat in the 
Chamber of Deputies from central Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 His allies also prospered in an election under new winner-take-all rules in 
which 80% of candidates were running for the first time. Among them, movie 
director Franco Zeffirelli won a Senate seat in Catania, Sicily. In Naples, 
Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of former dictator Benito Mussolini, was 
reelected to the lower house as candidate of a neo-fascist party allied with 
Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right has won," glumly reported the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, a 
bulwark of Berlusconi foes who argued that he had joined politics principally 
to advance business interests that include the country's largest advertising 
agency, a chain of supermarkets and Milan -- Italy's champion professional 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-made man who once worked as a singer on cruise ships, Berlusconi 
campaigned in Cold War terms, portraying himself as a crusader against 
communism. Early today, in what amounted to a victory speech, he told reporters 
from his TV networks that "a few months ago we started with great fear. There 
was a leftist team ready to take power. We were facing an uncertain future, 
moving toward a (totalitarian) regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi made clear that he expects President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to ask 
him to form a government. "We will know how to run a good government for all 
Italians, guaranteeing freedom for all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running with the neo-fascist National Alliance and the secessionist Northern 
League, Berlusconi promised Italians more jobs and lower taxes under a 
government wed to free-market economics, conservative Christian values, 
controlled immigration and law and order. 
</P>
<P>
 Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance, easily won election to 
Parliament on Monday, as did Umberto Bossi, founder of the League. Although 
both were aligned with Berlusconi for the election, Bossi insists that he will 
have nothing to do with the neo-fascists. Neither will he docilely follow 
Berlusconi's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlusconi thinks we are his. We're not," Bossi said early today. 
</P>
<P>
 For the left, Monday's returns were one more cruel blow in an 
always-a-bridesmaid search for power. Since World War II, Italian Communists -- 
now social democratic and renamed the Party of the Democratic Left -- had 
always finished second to the Christian Democrats. Monday, when the Christian 
Democrats slumped, the ex-Communists and allied parties running as Progressives 
finished second to Berlusconi's new right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Progressives are a force that came into the field for the first time. . . 
. We must stay there," said party leader Achille Occhetto, who acknowledged the 
rightist victory but wondered whether campaign unity could survive the strains 
of forming a government. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milan, the stock market rose almost 4% Monday, its strongest showing of the 
year on double the average volume of the past two weeks. Analysts said 
investors were betting on a Berlusconi victory and a stable, right government 
to follow. The lira also strengthened Monday against both the dollar and the 
German mark in the closing hours of the two-day vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Parliament had authorized the second day of voting to accommodate 
religiously observant members of Italy's small Jewish community. Polls remained 
open until 10 p.m. Monday to allow Jews to vote after Passover celebration 
ended at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, who lives in Milan but was a candidate for Parliament from central 
Rome, was among the late voters at a school in the former Jewish ghetto. Tanned 
and polished, he drew applause from some passersby and one objection: "Fascist, 
out of the ghetto!" shouted one man. 
</P>
<P>
 In a middle-class nation where 40% of voters have traditionally stuck to the 
center, Berlusconi essentially filled a vacuum left by centrist parties, 
scarred in the country's worst corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrist reformer Mario Segni was courted by both Berlusconi and Occhetto but 
decided to ally with the largest remnant of the Christian Democrats. Berlusconi 
wound up in alliance with the coarse Bossi and the polished Fini because the 
center wouldn't have him. 
</P>
<P>
 Occhetto, meantime, had patiently assembled the leftist alliance with bedmates 
as diverse as anti-Mafia reformers, environmentalists and unabashed Marxists 
who defiantly broke from his party to form Refounded Communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Occhetto, who took leadership of the West's largest Communist Party in 1988 
just as communism was dying, changed the name to Democratic Party of the Left 
(PDS) in 1991 and marched to social democracy, taking all but the most extreme 
15% of its members with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The PDS was relatively undamaged by the ongoing scandal known as Tangentopoli 
(Kickback City), in which most of the country's leading companies paid millions 
of dollars in bribes and payoffs in exchange for public contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the scandal, the outgoing Parliament, hundreds of whose members face 
corruption probes once they leave office, added finishing touches to an 
electoral reform mandated by referendum last year. Under the new rules, 
three-quarters of the the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 315-seat Senate 
were elected in winner-take-all votes. The rest were selected proportionately 
according to the overall votes of their parties.

2ND SUSPECT MAY HAVE AIDED IN COLOSIO KILLING; MEXICO: FEDERAL POLICE NOW 
BELIEVE GUARD CLEARED PATH FOR GUNMAN AND ARE HOLDING HIM FOR QUESTIONING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid increasing indications of a conspiracy, Mexican federal police said 
Monday that they now believe a security guard aided the gunman accused of 
assassinating presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were questioning Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, a retired police 
officer hired to provide crowd control, whom photos and videos of the incident 
show near Colosio and accused gunman Mario Aburto Martinez seconds before the 
fatal shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 A girlfriend of Aburto has told police that Aburto met with Sanchez in a 
Tijuana park a week before the March 23 assassination, according to Mexican 
federal officials, who suspect Sanchez of clearing a path through the crowd for 
the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aburto is considered the lone gunman, police are investigating "the 
probable participation of accomplices, co-participants or protectors of Aburto 
Martinez, as is the case of (Sanchez)," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Rene Gonzalez de 
la Vega in a statement. "His behavior and his attitudes near the candidate and 
Aburto Martinez lead us to presume that he participated directly with the 
accused killer." 
</P>
<P>
 These revelations provide the strongest support yet for what journalists, 
politicians and other Mexicans have been asserting for days: that Colosio, the 
leading candidate for Mexico's presidency, was the victim of a plot involving 
more than one person. And the focus of the probe appears to be the possible 
involvement of members of a security team provided by local officials of the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Mexican authorities had said that Aburto, 23, acted alone when he 
emerged from a crowd and shot Colosio twice at point-blank range after the 
candidate finished a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But security guard Sanchez was detained for questioning this weekend because 
his actions raised investigators' suspicions, U.S. and Mexican sources said. 
Videotapes and photographs of the assassination, which took place in the 
sloping dirt plaza of a shantytown, show Sanchez -- a tall man wearing a 
baseball cap -- in the crowd just behind Colosio. On the right, the gunman can 
be seen approaching and raising the gun to the candidate's head as Colosio 
shakes hands with well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect Sanchez aided Aburto by leading him through the crowd, 
according to sources in both nations. "They are reviewing the tapes to see if 
he's opening a path for Aburto to get closer," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the girlfriend's statement to authorities appears to establish a 
prior connection between Sanchez and Aburto, who in his confession said he 
practiced for the shooting with a .38-caliber revolver. He also hinted that 
others were involved, according to witnesses to the interrogation last week in 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supposed girlfriend of Mario Aburto Martinez said that he and Tranquilino 
Sanchez Venegas had a meeting a week before in Tijuana," said Hugo Morales, 
press secretary in the attorney general's office. The meeting was in a public 
park, Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is a retired officer of the commercial police, a municipal force that 
provides security for businesses, federal authorities said. He is described as 
being in his 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was hired on the morning of the assassination by Rodolfo Riva Palacio 
Tinajero, a leader of the PRI, for crowd control in Tijuana's impoverished 
Lomas Taurinas neighborhood, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release Monday, the attorney general's office emphasized that 
Sanchez had no connection to the commanding officer of Colosio's personal 
security force -- members of the Mexican equivalent of the Secret Service, who 
traveled with the candidate. Instead, Sanchez was one of about 45 local guards 
provided for crowd control, Mexican officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez's name, however, does not appear on a typewritten list of guards, 
American and Mexican sources said. His name was handwritten onto the list, 
apparently a late addition that has attracted the attention of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Tijuana-based security guards included former city and state 
police officers who belong to the PRI and were assembled by officials of the 
local party branch, PRI officials said in interviews Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards included Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, 47, a former deputy chief 
homicide investigator of the state judicial police. He was arrested in the 
melee immediately after the shooting but was later released after federal 
authorities said he was merely a witness who helped subdue the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new development involving Mayoral, the father of the accused assassin 
told The Times on Monday that Mayoral had befriended Aburto months before the 
shooting. Mayoral is thus the second member of the Colosio security entourage 
provided by the PRI to be linked to Aburto before the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the father, Mayoral sought out Aburto late last year and bragged 
to the young man about his trips overseas to Russia, among other destinations, 
and also of his former friendship with Lazaro Cardenas, the revered former 
president of Mexico, who died in 1970. Mayoral maintained the friendship in 
recent months, the father said, although Aburto didn't like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mayoral is the key to this," said the father, Ruben Aburto, 47, who 
resides in San Pedro, Los Angeles' harbor district, along with two of the 
suspect's brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members assert that Mexican officials are making Aburto the fall guy 
for a larger conspiracy to conceal the involvement of the government. Although 
they have no proof, relatives maintain that Aburto may have been forced to go 
to the scene, perhaps after alleged conspirators threatened to kill other 
family members in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Patrick J. McDonnell in San Pedro and Juanita Darling in 
Mexico City contributed to this report. 
</P>

 For nearly 30 years after World War II, the mountain children of eastern 
Kentucky were said to learn three lessons early in life: reading, writing and 
Route 25, the old road to the factory jobs in this Ohio River city. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers here no more, the urban Appalachians are set apart, even in the 
second and third generations. "Turns out that old highway could lead to a world 
of misery," country-music star Dwight Yoakam sings in a plaintive lyric 
dedicated to his Appalachian-born family. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighborhoods of shabby row houses and cramped bungalows, where preachers 
sermonize in storefronts and laundry dries on lines, tens of thousands of coal 
miners' descendants make up a lasting white underclass plagued by high 
unemployment, horrendous dropout rates, and drug and alcohol addiction. About 
44% of the area's residents of mountain stock are either poor or at serious 
risk of falling into poverty, sociologists have found; virtually all of them 
live within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 A major reason for the troubles, community activists believe, is lingering 
prejudice and ignorance of mountain culture. "Did you ever see the Beverly 
Hillbillies?" asked Pauletta Hansel, an assistant director of the Urban 
Appalachian Council here. "Snuffy Smith. The Dukes of Hazzard. That's the 
stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
 The caricatures can make the basics -- schooling, housing, jobs -- hard to 
come by or to keep. A twang in the voice, a quirky expression like "I reckon," 
a taste for banjo music, all passed on to children and grandchildren raised 
here, can lead to many other assumptions: This person is not smart, this person 
won't show up on time, this person's temper is likely to be quick. "Hillbilly" 
jokes and quips are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen months ago, Cincinnati responded by adopting the nation's only human 
rights ordinance banning discrimination against Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 20% to 30% of the city's residents of Appalachian stock, the 
mountain folk are the second-largest distinct group in town, behind the 40% of 
the population that is black. The city schools have designated May as 
"Appalachian Month," and a political action committee, AppalPAC, supports 
sympathetic candidates, albeit with a mixed record of success. An advocacy 
group, the Urban Appalachian Council, provides social services and works to 
instill pride. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems persist. "The fair housing department has not been oriented to 
helping Appalachians," said City Councilwoman Bobbie Sterne. "We had to fight 
for youth jobs. They said Appalachians weren't applying." She sighed. "I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Appalachian activists say similar troubles have surfaced in Columbus, Dayton 
and Akron, Ohio, in Indianapolis, and in other cities that lured more than 3 
million people from Appalachia over three decades. Many of them were forced to 
leave home as automation in the coal mines took away their work. During a 
second mountain emigration in the 1980s, 45,000 people headed mostly to boom 
towns in the Carolinas and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the numbers continue, those areas (in the Southeast) are going to face 
many of the same problems down the road that the Midwest cities face today," 
said Ronald D. Eller, director of the University of Kentucky's Appalachian 
Center. His own memories as a child of Appalachian parents in Akron -- the 
"capital of West Virginia" was its nickname at the time -- are more than tinged 
with bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 The diaspora has resulted in mountain people becoming "an invisible minority," 
in their new homes, said Phillip J. Obermiller, a sociologist who has written 
extensively about them. On paper, they couldn't be more mainstream: white, 
English-speaking, Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some blacks also live in the Appalachians, the majority of the 
residents trace their lineage to settlers from England, Ireland and Scotland 
who rejected the coastal cities of America in favor of frontier freedoms, 
beginning in the late 1700s. If a man heard a rifle shot, the adage went, he 
packed up and left to escape overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, as farming and hunting gave way to coal mining, the isolated 
gaps and hollows nurtured a distinctive way of life, based on helping kin and 
neighbors while staying independent and wary of outsiders. The emphasis on clan 
traditions meant that the taking of sides during the Civil War could lead to 
feuds lasting well into this century. It also resulted in the custom of 
decorating family graveyards once a year while telling old tales, a practice 
that is still observed. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture has demonstrated remarkable staying power in the cities, in part 
because so many Appalachians moved together and in part because their old homes 
were so close by. The first generation of urban Appalachians could drive or 
take a bus back each weekend, carrying the children along. Now, that second 
generation brings the grandchildren back on special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, "it's hard to get ahead if you don't feel part of 
something," said Larry Redden, an organizer with the Urban Appalachian Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Cincinnati, it is clear that those who retain traces of the hills in 
their lives can be made to feel different, indeed. Others may make sport of 
dulcimer music, or of a popular custom of sending a funeral arrangement in the 
shape of a phone off the hook, with a sign declaring "Jesus Has Called." This 
is a city where some liberal middle-class whites recall that, during childhood, 
"hillbilly" was a term used at home, while racial epithets were strictly 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether such separateness deserves legal protection is a matter of local 
debate, especially among Cincinnati's African Americans, who tend to fare 
slightly worse than Appalachians, statistics show. "They have a lot of the same 
kinds of problems (as blacks)," said Sheila Adams, president of the city's 
chapter of the Urban League. "But do I think it's easier for them in the long 
run? Probably." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dwight Tillery, who is black, said he found it "interesting" when 
he noticed that Appalachians were included in the human rights ordinance. He 
voted for it, figuring, "What harm could it do?" The measure also banned bias 
on the basis of gender, age, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last month, Tillery held hearings on unemployment and poverty in 
Cincinnati. "I got an education from the Appalachian community," he said. "I 
can see very well the real possibility of other whites discriminating against 
them. They've been through a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 June Smith Tyler moved to the Cincinnati area from Harlan County, Ky., in 
1966. Now 51 and a partner at a prominent law firm, she tells of a job 
interview elsewhere in the city a decade ago, when she had just graduated from 
night school. Working days as a nurse, she had still managed to earn a place on 
the law review. After a pleasant lunch with several attorneys, a senior partner 
told her in the privacy of his office that he had to "be careful" about hiring 
anyone with a mountain accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, she winces at thoughtless one-liners tossed off by would-be wits. 
She lives south of the Ohio River, which is the Kentucky boundary, and has lost 
count of the times she's been asked if she kicks off her shoes as soon as she 
crosses the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Amy Morgan, 22 and Cincinnati-born, is frequently asked where she's 
from. The question is based on the soft twang acquired from her mother, aunt 
and grandparents. "I just tell them, Kentucky,' " she said, and shrugged. "I 
was brought up like I was in Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, if she and her siblings weren't home by dark, "we'd be getting a 
switching," said Morgan, now separated from her husband and the mother of two 
toddlers. She is taking a high school refresher class and hopes to study to 
become a veterinarian technician. Her cousins, high school seniors, still have 
to be in bed by 9 on school nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan cherishes her family, but she did get teased. Once, a high school 
classmate had a thing or two to say about Morgan living next door to her aunt. 
Her zoology teacher overheard, and asked: "Your family lived all together in a 
holler, didn't they?" It was true, actually; they had. Why was his tone so 
condescending? 
</P>
<P>
 Such tales of slights at school are not unusual. Mike Overbey, 39, who works 
for the Urban Appalachian Council, remembers getting suspended when he was 17 
for slapping a teacher who'd called him a "backward hillbilly." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, another teacher read a list of Appalachian jokes to a class of 
young teen-agers. He included this description of a "hillbilly seven-course 
dinner": A six-pack and a bag of potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Just weeks ago, at a prestigious magnet school for the performing arts, 
10th-graders discussed the play "Antigone." 
</P>
<P>
 A student described the incest in the drama as "confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not if you're from Kentucky," teacher Matthew Rabold answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Rabold, 30, called the remark "thoughtless." Puzzling over why the 
offending words slipped out, he finally decided: "It's just the perceptions 
I've gotten from the popular media, even cartoons: the shoeless, toothless 
backwoodsman. I've never seen a positive portrayal." A five-year veteran of 
public school faculties, he could not remember any special activities for 
"Appalachian Month." 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal slaps help explain why 17% of Appalachians and their descendants 
over age 18 in Greater Cincinnati never finished high school, said Michael 
Maloney, who runs mountain culture workshops for teachers and social workers 
around the Midwest. Dropout rates in several city neighborhoods run closer to 
80%, he said -- worse than in eastern Kentucky itself, where the figures are in 
the 40% to 50% range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dignity and respect are more important than education," said Maloney, who 
grew up in Lee County, Ky. "Parents will yank their kids out of school" because 
of insults. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument, however, fails to persuade everyone. "It's a cop-out," said Don 
Bearghman, principal of a grade school in Lower Price Hill, a part of town 
where virtually everyone has Appalachian roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The student body at Bearghman's Oyler Elementary School is almost evenly 
divided between bused-in blacks and the white children and grandchildren of 
Kentucky emigrants. "An Appalachian being called a hillbilly is like a black 
child being called the 'n-word,' " the principal said. "It's no reason to drop 
out of school. I don't buy that." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly other factors are involved. Money, for one. Obermiller, who surveyed 
Appalachians in Greater Cincinnati in 1980 and 1989, said that many families 
achieve working-class status by making everyone, including teens, get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a job at a turkey farm near Cincinnati that pulled Danny Courtney from 
school when he was 17. But economics can also be an effective argument in favor 
of education. Now 32, Courtney and his wife are on welfare while they attend 
classes to prepare for the General Equivalency Diploma test. They need, he 
says, to boost their earning power for the sake of their 4-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to studies, though, is far from easy and the vast majority of 
dropouts never do. "It would help if they know there are good things in their 
culture, things to be valued," said Larry Holcomb, coordinator of the Northside 
Community School, a continuing education center with an Appalachian clientele. 
"Then they could envision themselves going to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Rabold, repentant, wants to do his part. He met with members of the 
Urban Appalachian Council following complaints about the "Antigone" incident 
and ever since, he has been searching out mountain writers for his students to 
read. He hopes that a local poet, Brenda Saylor, will speak to his class. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been touched by her words about "my people," the ones she describes as 
"the men, tall stiffbacked; the women with their long hair/and unpainted 
smiles." She writes of self-denial and of embracing the past: 
</P>
<P>
 "Their kids will laugh at their dreams  
</P>
<P>
 and shy from their songs  
</P>
<P>
 but when the fiddle plays  
</P>
<P>
 the young will pick up their feet,  
</P>
<P>
 move to an ancient rhythm  
</P>
<P>
 and ask for the stories  
</P>
<P>
 of their grandmothers.  
</P>
<P>
 Faraway, a mountain will sigh, knowing it has not been forgotten." Mountain 
Exodus 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati, has prohibited bias against Appalachian people as part of its 
human rights ordinance. Appalachian activists say bias has also surfaced in 
Columbus, Dayton and Akron, Ohio and Indianapolis.

JOBLESS AID FAILS TO KEEP UP WITH EMPLOYMENT CHANGES; SOCIETY: EXCEPT FOR A FEW 
SHINING EXAMPLES, THE AGING SYSTEM ISN'T PROVIDING THE HELP DISPLACED WORKERS 
NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruth LaHue tells the sort of success story government policy planners dream 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid off in early February from her secretary's job, the 47-year-old mother of 
three visited an innovative unemployment benefits office here and spoke with a 
job counselor familiar with state and federal programs for displaced workers. 
The counselor took her to another office for a skills test and a review of 
possible career goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now LaHue has made plans to return to college to fulfill a long-held dream of 
becoming a special education teacher -- honing talents learned through caring 
for a 15-year-old son who is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really devastated when I lost my job," she says, "but that doesn't 
mean something really good couldn't come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, however, it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite isolated examples such as the employment center that helped LaHue, the 
nation's unemployment system -- a 59-year-old patchwork of programs established 
by the New Deal as a key part of the nation's social safety net -- is badly out 
of date and failing to provide the help displaced workers need. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: The nature of unemployment in America has changed but the 
unemployment system has remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa's setup, where state officials have consolidated in one building a range 
of programs to aid displaced workers, is the exception. In many parts of the 
country the local unemployment office, where people apply for benefits, and the 
employment service, which is supposed to help people find new jobs, are not 
even located in the same part of town. Existing federal programs are widely 
scattered and often poorly coordinated with state and local efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal programs to aid dislocated workers manage to provide some level of 
assistance to roughly half a million people a year, but under widely varying 
and often bewildering rules and regulations. One program aids workers who have 
lost jobs because of import competition, another exists to help workers whose 
jobs have suffered because of clean air rules, still another benefits the small 
number of workers displaced by Redwood National Park in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Pennsylvania plant that made paper goods closed recently, workers who 
had made paper napkins there were deemed eligible for federal aid on the 
grounds of import competition. Those who had made paper cups were out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of the unemployment system seemed more critical a year ago, when 
many economists believed that the country faced a "jobless recovery" in which 
even economic growth would not bring back robust employment figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Today that fear has faded. Nationally, the unemployment rate has dropped 
steadily and, even in hard-hit Southern California, employment is beginning to 
show some signs of recovery. By 1997, the majority of government and private 
economists forecast, the United States will once again have reached the "full 
employment" level -- the term economists use to designate the lowest level that 
unemployment can reach without sparking inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at the full-employment level, more than 6.5 million Americans will 
remain looking for work and millions more will be stuck in part-time or 
temporary jobs when they would prefer full-time work. 
</P>
<P>
 With those figures in mind, President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert B. 
Reich have made fixing the shortcomings of the U.S. unemployment system a 
priority. Earlier this month, Clinton unveiled legislation to improve the 
system -- an initiative that has been Reich's top priority for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the recession over and unemployment rates dropping, Reich says, what 
he calls a "re-employment" system would address an important public concern. 
"Many people are scratching their heads and saying, 'Wait a minute. The economy 
is getting better, jobs are coming back, so why do I feel so insecure?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer, Reich argues, is the belief many workers share that if 
they lose their job, they will have neither the skills to find new work nor any 
government program capable of helping. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a democratic society, there really are only two alternatives," he says. 
"Either people hold on to what they have -- they seek regulations, they seek 
protectionist barriers to imports, they don't want to allow immigrants into the 
country, they sort of hunker down -- or they find easy passageways to new jobs 
and better alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 If the country wants to keep the open and flexible labor markets that have 
been a major contributor to U.S. prosperity -- and a major reason that the 
United States has avoided the economic problems now plaguing Western Europe -- 
then "we all have a stake in making sure people can move to new and better jobs 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Research on experimental state programs scattered across the country over the 
last decade indicates that well-designed government programs can significantly 
ease the transition from one job to the next. But so far no one is trying to 
expand those scattered initiatives into a national system. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of most of the successful programs is to reduce what economists refer 
to as "frictions" in the labor market. Workers who lose their jobs have little 
sense of what employment alternatives exist and what skills they need to find a 
new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment insurance, the chief government program to help those out of 
work, is a largely passive system designed to keep workers from falling into 
poverty during layoffs. But in most parts of the country, the system does 
little to provide the sort of information unemployed workers need to find a new 
job or to help them improve their job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposed solution would require all states to screen 
workers as soon as they apply for unemployment benefits in order to identify 
quickly those at risk of long-term unemployment. Those workers would then 
automatically receive specific help in finding a job -- computer listings of 
job openings, for example -- when they receive their unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In tests in states such as New Jersey, unemployed workers who were given help 
with job searches found jobs faster than those left on their own. The state 
saved more money in unemployment benefits for the assisted workers than the 
assistance cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to job search assistance, many dislocated workers under the 
Administration's proposal would receive counseling and skills testing, much as 
LaHue did, and a smaller number would receive federally supported job training. 
The new training program, although sharply limited to conserve scarce federal 
dollars, would still roughly double the number of workers eligible for help 
from about 250,000 a year now to some 500,000 by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems the Administration hopes to address have been increasingly 
obvious for two decades. Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, an 
explosive mixture of forces combined to vastly expand the supply of workers 
while hurting demand for them, particularly for low-skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the forces were the influx of the baby boom generation and large numbers 
of women into the job market, the increase in international trade, changes in 
technology and the declining power of unions. The results were a sharp increase 
in unemployment levels, reduced job prospects for people who lost their work 
and declining wages for those with few job skills to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 1950s and 1960s, national unemployment rates would rise in 
recessions to roughly 6% then fall back in good times to less than 4%. 
Beginning with the early 1970s, unemployment rates have never dropped below 5% 
even in good times and have often risen well above 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 More notably, the percentage of the unemployed who are out of a job for more 
than six months has risen from roughly 11% during the 1960s and 1970s to more 
than 15% during the 1980s and so far in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased, as well, is the percentage of people who lose their jobs 
permanently as opposed to those for whom unemployment means only a temporary 
layoff. The Labor Department calculates that in the last recession, only 14% of 
the unemployed were on temporary layoff, as opposed to an average of 44% during 
the previous four recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the Congressional Budget Office last year calculated that each year 
through the 1980s, whether the economy was growing or not, nearly 2 million 
Americans were permanently displaced from their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 While most eventually found new jobs, many were unemployed for months, and 
nearly one-third eventually had to take jobs earning 20% or more below what 
they had been earning. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the continued pace of corporate layoffs and defense cutbacks, both the 
CBO and the Administration estimate that the number of displaced workers will 
continue in the range of 2 million a year for the rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A system that helps workers find new jobs more quickly and provides training 
to those most badly in need of new skills could make a small but significant 
dent in those numbers, argues Administration economist Alan Blinder, a member 
of the Council of Economic Advisers whom Clinton plans to appoint to the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "One wants to make modest claims for these things," Blinder says, but each of 
the Administration's "human resources" programs -- improvements in education, 
school-to-work programs to help non-college-bound graduates get their first 
job, welfare-to-work programs and programs for unemployed workers "all push in 
the same direction" of improving the skills of the labor force and easing 
transitions from one job to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 No one element of the program will completely reverse the long-term increase 
in the non-inflationary unemployment rate, Blinder said. But, he noted, even a 
0.1% drop in the unemployment rate means another 125,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A realist would say there are limits to what government can do," Blinder 
said. "A pragmatist will say the government should do what it can."

MEDICARE OK FOUND LESS OFTEN HERE; HEALTH: STUDY SHOWS SERVICE IS DENIED AT FAR 
HIGHER RATES IN SOUTHLAND THAN IN NORTHERN PART OF STATE. O.C. DOCTOR SAYS 
DISCREPANCY HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO MEDICAL COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Medicare claims for services ranging from ambulance rides to mammograms are 
denied at far higher rates in Southern California than in the northern part of 
the state, according to an investigation by the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Medicare beneficiaries or their doctors in seven counties -- 
Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Imperial and San 
Diego -- are required to pay higher out-of-pocket expenses than their northern 
neighbors because Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance rejects claims more 
frequently than Blue Shield, which handles Medicare bills for the rest of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medicare is supposed to be a federal program under which seniors receive 
uniform benefits, but it is in fact a crazy quilt of separate and dramatically 
different programs run by 34 private insurance companies," Rep. Ron Wyden 
(D-Ore.), who requested the GAO study, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a situation where people are covered based more on where they live 
than on their medical needs," said Wyden, who will conduct hearings on the 
issue today. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert McCauley, an internist in Anaheim whose practice consists of about 
30% Medicare patients, said the discrepancy of Medicare reimbursement depending 
on geography has long been known to the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be surprising to me if you said Medicare reimbursement was uniform 
across the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the GAO report found wide discrepancies in coverage nationwide, the 
largest occurred in California. The report offered no explanation for the 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the GAO findings "shocking," Wyden said that the variation in benefits 
raises doubts about the ability of the government to deliver a national package 
of health benefits as proposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you legislate a national standard benefit doesn't mean all 
Americans will get the same kind of coverage," said Wyden, who has been a 
strong proponent of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Transamerica Occidental defended the company's practices, 
saying that guidelines for screening claims were prepared "within the policies 
set by the Health Care Financing Administration, to prevent the 
over-utilization of certain diagnostic services." 
</P>
<P>
 Transamerica Occidental said that it has developed a superior system for 
screening out tests and procedures not covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Debra Newton said that the company could not comment specifically 
on the wide variation between its payments and Blue Shield's because it did not 
know the other company's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 If a claim is rejected by Medicare, a doctor is financially responsible and 
will not be reimbursed for his or her services. If a patient has signed a 
statement in advance recognizing that a treatment might not be covered, the 
patient must pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more doctors are asking their patients to sign the statements before 
they perform expensive procedures, such as treadmill tests to detect heart 
problems. "If you get turned down again and again, you learn to protect 
yourself," said a Los Angeles cardiologist, who asked not to be identified by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly concerned about the significant variation between insurance 
carriers -- there should be national standards," said Geraldine Dallek, 
executive director of the Center for Health Care Rights, a Los Angeles advocacy 
group for Medicare recipients. She expressed particular concern about the 
handling of claims for mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said that Transamerica Occidental rejected 54 requests per 1,000 in 
Southern California, compared with a rejection rate of less than one per 1,000 
in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection rate for routine electrocardiograms was 1 per 1,000 in the north 
and 8 for each 1,000 in the south, according to the GAO report, which will be 
released today. For ambulance service with basic life support, the rejection 
rate was less than 1 per 1,000 in the north and 20 per 1,000 in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said that the variations were far greater than could be explained by a 
statistical quirk. The study covered a sampling of claims under Medicare's Part 
B, which pays for doctors' services, and analyzed those denied strictly on the 
grounds of medical necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare "is a national program under which beneficiaries should not receive 
different benefits solely because their place of residence differs," according 
to testimony scheduled for delivery at today's congressional hearing by 
Assistant Comptroller General Eleanor Chelimsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical profession also expressed surprise at the GAO findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any theories off the top of my head to explain the large 
discrepancies" between Northern and Southern California, said Bob Holt, 
director of professional relations for the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. "I 
just don't know. I wish I had a good answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Medicare is a program of federal benefits for 32 million persons over 
65 and 3 million disabled Americans of all ages, the bookkeeping is performed 
by private insurance companies. They handle the claims and reimbursements as 
contractors. In fiscal 1992, the government paid $52.8 million for the 
processing of Part B claims in Northern California and $54.6 million for the 
seven southern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said that Transamerica Occidental and Southern California 
doctors should review the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the Medicare contractors to analyze the local data to see where 
there are problems with billing and to work with the local medical community to 
see if there are areas that need addressing," said Carol Walton, director of 
Medicare operations for the Health Care Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, when you have 700 million claims, we do not have the resources 
to look at each one," Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Variations can be caused by differences in such factors as medical practice, 
the local population of patients, fraud and differences in billing practices, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she could offer no specific explanation for the range of differences 
between two insurance companies covering a single state. On the mammogram 
issue, she said, it is possible that Southern California doctors had been using 
incorrect code numbers in submitting their bills to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield and Transamerica Occidental each handled about 25 million claims 
in fiscal 1992, the period covered by the GAO study. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO study of Part B claims included physician services, ambulances, 
diagnostic laboratory tests, home health services and equipment, as well as 
charges for outpatient care at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO looked at denial rates for the 71 most common services processed by 
six insurance carriers in five states: California, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Illinois and Wisconsin. Government investigators found "sizable 
differences" in denial rates, according to the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall rejection rate for payment, covering all 71 services, was highest 
in Southern California, 23.1 per 1,000 claims, compared with 4.4 in Northern 
California, 4 in North Carolina, 1.4 in South Carolina, 14.1 in Illinois and 12 
in Wisconsin.

BILLS WOULD TIGHTEN LAW ON OPEN MEETINGS; LEGISLATION: THE GOVERNOR IS EXPECTED 
TO SIGN FINAL MEASURE OF A FOUR-PART PACKAGE AIMED AT KEEPING ELECTED OFFICIALS 
FROM STRIKING DEALS WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT. ADDITIONS TO BROWN ACT WOULD APPLY 
ONLY TO LOCAL AGENCIES.

<P>
 The Legislature has sent Gov. Pete Wilson the last of several bills requiring 
local elected officials to conduct their business more openly -- not, for 
example, at out-of-town "retreats" or in small, private gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to sign the so-called sunshine legislation quickly so that 
it will become law by Friday, the effective date of a three-bill package passed 
by the Legislature and signed by the governor last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Together the four bills represent one of the few substantial tightenings of 
the 40-year-old Ralph M. Brown Act anti-secrecy law, which requires local 
elected officials of public agencies and school boards to meet and make 
decisions in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Final legislative approval came Thursday when the Senate sent the last bill, 
by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), to Wilson on a 37-0 vote. Earlier, the 
Assembly approved it 56-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new restrictions: Local elected officials would no longer be allowed 
to meet in private just by ensuring that the group did not constitute a quorum. 
They also could not travel to a secluded spot out of their area, far from 
public view, to hold meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Such abuses, which critics maintain violated the spirit if not the letter of 
the Brown Act, fueled a two-year effort by newspaper publishers, broadcasters 
and other journalists to toughen the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints also have come from within public bodies. Two Pasadena City Council 
members said in August that four of their colleagues -- a majority on the seven 
member council -- met in an anteroom during a council break to hash out a 
compromise on an anti-smoking ordinance. The city attorney later ruled that the 
gathering was not a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina said she was present 
repeatedly, over her objections, at closed-door sessions of the board that she 
believes violated the law. On one occasion, she said the board went into closed 
session to hear a county department chief lobby them on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Molina did not object when she and her four colleagues, in a session that 
almost certainly would be illegal under the new law, met with Wilson in 
Sacramento last spring to discuss Wilson's proposal to shift property tax 
revenues from counties to schools. The county's top lawyer said the 
get-together was not a meeting under the law, only a discussion with five 
individuals and the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to give city council members, county supervisors, school board 
trustees, other officials and their attorneys extra time to digest the changes, 
the new sunshine statutes were targeted to become law April 1 -- three months 
later than most 1994 laws. 
</P>
<P>
 For local officials who make reasonable efforts to keep the public informed of 
their activities, the new law is not expected to have a major impact, said 
Terry Franke, whose First Amendment Coalition helped push the overhaul through 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The styles that will be cramped will be those who have been secretive, 
jealous of information and who control the routing and access to information," 
Franke said. "Those folks are going to need to change their act." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bill package by Kopp, a former San Francisco supervisor, Assemblyman 
John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) and Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) applies 
only to local governmental agencies and not to state entities or the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a former mayor of San Diego, vetoed a similar proposal in 1992 on the 
grounds that it would have increased costs. Last year, he signed a compromise 
version after it was rewritten to meet his objections. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest Brown Act changes were achieved during lengthy negotiations between 
representatives of the First Amendment Coalition and advocates for cities, 
counties, special districts and school boards. Key features include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Removing obstacles to prosecuting a Brown Act violation, a misdemeanor. 
Under the old law, prosecutors had the problem of proving that officials knew 
they were attending a meeting banned under the act. Under the new laws, 
ignorance of open meeting requirements no longer would be the "perfect defense" 
of accused officials, supporters of the bill said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citizens would be given additional time to detect an alleged violation 
before formally demanding that a local governing board take action to correct 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local government entities would have to hold meetings within their own 
jurisdictions, with limited exceptions. The restriction is intended to prohibit 
elected officials from traveling to distant "retreats" where, critics charge, 
public business can be discussed out of public view. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meetings of standing committees of less than a quorum of a legislative body 
such as a city council would be open and public. Critics have argued that some 
governing boards structure the membership of their policy-making committees to 
avoid open meeting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 * No longer could a citizen be ordered silenced for voicing criticism of the 
governing body he or she is addressing. Proponents of the new law cited 
instances of some school boards stifling public comment by declaring an issue 
to be an off-limits "personnel matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * Citizens would be specifically empowered to make audio- and videotapes, 
still photographs, or movies of local government agency meetings, provided the 
activity is not disruptive. Likewise, recordings of sessions taped by the 
agency would be made available to the public for at least 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newly elected members of a local governing board who have not yet taken the 
oath of office would be covered by the Brown Act. In part, this is in intended 
to prohibit these officials from privately making decisions before they are 
sworn in and later ratifying them without participation by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * Governing boards of local agencies would be required to disclose in public 
sessions any final actions taken in closed meetings. Closed sessions are 
permitted for discussion and action on certain subjects, including personnel 
matters and pending litigation, but critics say sessions are often closed when 
there is only a vague connection to private matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Franke said citizens often have found after the fact that a school 
superintendent, city manager or other executive got a salary increase during a 
closed meeting, "but they are never told what the proposed raise will be." 
</P>
<P>
 "In many agencies, the largest single expenditure all year long will be the 
salary of the top manager, (who) may be the best-compensated person in town," 
Franke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this report. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, local elected bodies -- such as county boards of supervisors, 
city councils and school boards -- are required to meet and make their 
decisions in public. With a few exceptions, the Ralph M. Brown Act prohibits 
elected officials from meeting or taking action in private. But in recent 
years, news media and public access groups have complained that elected 
officials have violated or skirted the Brown Act with increasing frequency. 
Critics further note that officials seldom, if ever, are prosecuted under 
misdemeanor provisions of the act. Recently the Legislature tightened the law 
and Gov. Pete Wilson is considering whether to sign the changes into law.

SEEING RED OVER PARKING; HOMEOWNERS ARE SUED OVER PAINTING CURBS NEAR PARK IN 
LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disputed territory is only a few feet from some of the most expensive real 
estate in Southern California. The homes along Isle Vista Drive are valued 
between $1 million and $3 million. And the views are nothing short of 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, homeowners say, is that outsiders feel increasingly entitled to 
share the breathtaking sunsets and glimpses of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina 
Island by parking on their exclusive street and walking to a popular park to 
take in the majestic scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Isle Vista Drive is private, as are the Gatsby-like estates of the 161-member 
Monarch Point Homeowners Assn. that claim it as an address. But Badlands Park 
-- one of the highest, most scenic points in Orange County -- is public. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the homeowners took the liberty of declaring their street off limits. 
They put up no parking signs and painted the curbs red to emphasize that most 
of Isle Vista Drive -- the only access to the park -- is private. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Orange County officials saw it, painting curbs and erecting signs went 
too far. So, they filed a lawsuit this month, seeking a permanent injunction 
against the association, as well as a $30,000 fine and payment of all legal 
costs. The homeowners' paint job and signs violate the California Coastal Act, 
the lawsuit alleges, and could be subject to fines of $10,000 a day for each 
day they violate the act. 
</P>
<P>
 The act seeks to protect access to publicly owned coastal areas such as 
Badlands Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that we had to press the point to litigation," said John 
Sibley, deputy director of the Orange County Environmental Management Agency, 
which made repeated demands to the homeowners to remove the no parking 
designations. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's attorney, William P. Hickey, counters that his clients 
obtained no permission for the red-painting from any governmental agency for 
the simple reason that "they just don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the county acts reasonably, but at this point, it's hard for us to 
tell why they're doing what they're doing," Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners maintain that plenty of parking exists along the northern end 
of Isle Vista Drive and that declaring the curbed area near Badlands a no 
parking zone was based solely on safety -- for park visitors and property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The private street is the only access to the recreational facility, which has 
no parking lots. Residents say they are worried that public parking near the 
entrance could block emergency vehicles from reaching their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a school bus pickup area," Hickey said. "When cars are parked there, the 
cars of homeowners can't get through. Fire access is also an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But public access to Badlands can reasonably be made only from Isle Vista 
Drive, the lawsuit maintains. Installation of the red paint and no parking 
signs "effectively denied the public access over Isle Vista Drive," the lawsuit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs and red curbs became an issue once before, in 1988, when the homes 
were about to be built. In anticipation, the developer put up signs and painted 
the curbs red. But as a condition of obtaining a coastal development permit, 
the developer agreed to remove the signs and paint, according to Edward N. 
Duran, deputy county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 But by June, 1992, county officials discovered that the paint and no parking 
signs had reappeared, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of repeated demands by the county, the homeowners association has 
"refused to remove these obstructions," the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the neighborhood agrees that parking on Isle Vista Drive is an 
evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents who asked not to be quoted by name -- for fear they would offend 
their neighbors -- said they welcomed the park's daily visitors who use the 
Badlands trails to walk their dogs and that they did not perceive a safety 
problem with parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joseph Potocki, a marketing consultant who lives on one of the 
estates, called the park an asset in every way except one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a hazard to anybody coming out of the guarded-gate area if cars 
are allowed to park right there. There just isn't enough space," he said. "I 
find it difficult to believe that the county would favor that from a safety 
standpoint. It's too narrow a space. I don't think it's doable." 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawsuit seeks to eliminate the entire red-zoned area imposed by the 
residents, even near the entrance to the guarded gate, which is barely wide 
enough for a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The association is eager to do the right thing," said Hickey, the homeowners' 
attorney. "We don't feel we're denying access to a public park and that we're 
complying with their request under the law and under the Coastal Act. Even now, 
visitors to the park have to walk maybe 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is the county so concerned about walking such a short distance in order 
to get to a hiking trail? Isn't walking the point here, anyway?"

METROLINK DEBUTS IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH 2,000 RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Metrolink trains traversed the rails of Orange County for the first time 
Monday, carrying more than 2,000 commuters and joy riders into Los Angeles and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid all the hoopla that surrounded the train's debut, transportation 
officials acknowledged that they had not quite hit their target audience -- at 
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County's commuter service expanded from one train to three, train 
enthusiasts from as far away as Corona, students on spring break visiting 
friends in Los Angeles and transportation officials were among the first to 
ride the flashy periwinkle-and-white, double-decker cars. They took advantage 
of free service that is being offered through this Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new system's lifeblood -- business people hoping to avoid the freeway 
crunch between Orange County and Los Angeles -- seemed to be in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said the six-county rail agency hopes 
Monday's joy riders will tell their commuting friends about the easy ride into 
Los Angeles' Union Station, prompting more working folks to try out Metrolink 
as the week goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said 1,710 people rode the three morning trains into Los Angeles; a 
total of 2,900 riders were expected throughout the day. Previously, the lone 
Amtrak commuter train from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles carried an 
average of 400 passengers a day. He said Metrolink hopes to turn about 25% of 
this week's free riders into regular Metrolink riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The group most likely to benefit from the introduction of Metrolink are 
commuters who were already taking Amtrak occasionally into Los Angeles. There 
are more chances to catch the Metrolink than the Amtrak commuter train, since a 
Metrolink train stops three times each morning and evening in San Juan 
Capistrano, Irvine, Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Orange County commuters say, getting out of work on time is not always a 
sure thing, so having three times -- 4:30, 5:37 and 6:25 p.m. -- to catch a 
train out of Los Angeles should prevent a lot of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who tried out Metrolink Monday said they are not sure they will convert 
to trains because the price is too steep for them. A monthly pass from San Juan 
Capistrano to Los Angeles costs $208, from Irvine and Santa Ana, $176, and from 
Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton, $144. 
</P>
<P>
 "For $3.50 more a day (for the train), I might as well keep taking the bus," 
said Anaheim paralegal Laurie Schwartz, as she caught the 8:11 a.m. Metrolink. 
"The comfort level's about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County route is the fifth for Metrolink. It also runs commuter 
trains into and out of Los Angeles from the city of Santa Clarita and from 
Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

CENTRAL BOSNIANS SAVOR A VICTORY; BALKANS: MAGLAJ WITHSTOOD A TWO-YEAR SERBIAN 
BOMBARDMENT. ITS RESIDENTS FEEL THEY HELPED TURN THE TIDE OF THE WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sniper shots from Serbian positions only 100 yards uphill reverberate through 
the apartment courtyard where Remzo Hodzic tinkers with the bent frame of a 
bicycle he is salvaging for his grandson. But the smack of bullets puncturing 
brick and concrete no longer sends Hodzic diving for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Inured to the dangers of war by two years of full-scale bombardment that 
ceased only a week ago, Maglaj residents are almost oblivious to these last 
gasps of a failed offensive. The bedraggled people here feel they have scored a 
symbolic victory over the nationalist rebels who relentlessly attacked this 
paper mill town but were never able to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopped in the tracks of their deadly land grab by the recent reconciliation 
of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, the overextended, demoralized Serbs have been 
pushed back from the approaches to Maglaj and forced from the high-water mark 
of their territorial conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted Maglaj so they could link up their territories, but they couldn't 
defeat us," Hodzic said of the Serbs, who pounded Maglaj with hundreds of 
artillery rounds on most days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian drive to take Maglaj, aided for nine months by Croatian 
nationalist rebels, may go down in the history of this Balkan conflict as 
Greater Serbia's Waterloo. Exhausted and forced to rely on elderly reservists 
conscripted from refugee camps, the soldiers of the Serbian expansion drive 
have had to beat a disgruntled retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 The timely rapprochement between Croats and Muslims and U.N. officials' 
increasing irritation with being used for target practice by the Serbs have 
converged to halt the rebels. They also have turned international attention 
toward pushing the Serbs farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic conquered 70% 
of Bosnia with their arsenal of tanks, aircraft and howitzers bequeathed by the 
Yugoslav army. But weapons alone proved insufficient as the rebel ranks were 
stretched over so much territory and confronted by poorly armed but determined 
Bosnian government troops fighting to protect their own homes and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodzic, who along with 11 other family members was expelled from a nearby 
village by the rebels, lost one son in the defense of Maglaj and saw another 
crippled by shrapnel. "I have five other sons at the front, and they will stay 
there as long as they are needed," the 65-year-old patriarch vowed, drawing 
approving nods from his neighbors. "We want peace, but they will have to 
continue fighting if we do not get our land back." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations mediated by the United States and Russia aim to compel Karadzic 
to relinquish at least one-third of the Bosnian territory his gunmen have 
conquered in exchange for de facto Western assent to his keeping the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks are expected to progress slowly, and Serbian withdrawals, if they 
occur at all, will probably move at a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But by preventing the rebels from overrunning Maglaj and adding its 100,000 
residents and refugees to the 2 million Bosnian displaced, the population here 
feel they have helped turn the tide of the war; officials of the U.N. 
Protection Force agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's gunmen deployed north of Maglaj had been attacking the region for a 
year when Croatian nationalists eager to take territory for their own 
separatist state also turned on the Muslim Slavs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Serbs had better firepower and both rebel factions wanted to 
divide the Muslims' land, Bosnian Croat troops opened a corridor through 
Croat-held territory to allow Serbian artillery east, west and south of Maglaj. 
</P>
<P>
 That cut off the Muslims and subjected the enclave to a nine-month effort to 
starve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Muslim and Croatian militias were compelled to reconcile by a March 1 
agreement signed by their leaders in Washington, the Serbian rebels withdrew 
from Croat-controlled territory in fear of retaliation by the reunited forces.

CONVICTED SLAYER'S FREEDOM HINGES ON TIMING OF MIRANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 11 p.m. on Sept. 29, 1982, a Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide 
investigator and three Baldwin Park police officers arrived at a mobile home 
park in Pomona looking for a tall, red-bearded man who drove an ice cream 
truck. His name was Robert E. Stansbury. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, a 10-year-old girl had disappeared from her Baldwin Park 
neighborhood, and her body had been found after midnight near Pasadena. She was 
last seen talking with an ice cream truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers asked Stansbury to come to the Pomona police station for 
questioning. He agreed and was taken to a locked interview room in the 
jailhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 minutes, Stansbury answered questions. He mentioned he had borrowed a 
friend's old turquoise Ford the previous night. At that point, the 
interrogation stopped. The police had been told that the girl's body had been 
thrown from an old turquoise auto. Stansbury was arrested -- and, finally, was 
read his Miranda rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansbury was convicted of murder in part based on his comments about the 
turquoise car. But his attorneys appealed, arguing that police violated the 
Miranda rules by not warning him of his rights before the questioning -- and 
before he implicated himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly three decades after the landmark Miranda ruling, the Supreme Court 
will consider the case of Stansbury vs. California, 93-5770, to clarify when 
police must warn a suspect of his right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether police must warn all suspects before they question them, 
or only after they have enough information to charge them with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court rejected Stansbury's Miranda claim on the grounds 
he was not in custody during the initial interrogation. The police had 
"solicited his voluntary cooperation . . . as a potential witness," the state 
justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Before the mid-1960s, confessions were judged to be legal if they 
were voluntary. But it was often hard for judges to know whether a confession 
was voluntary when defendants and police disagreed sharply about the 
circumstances of the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 To remedy that problem, the high court issued a dramatic rule for "custodial 
interrogation" in the 1966 case of Miranda vs. Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to 
remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against 
him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney," wrote Chief 
Justice Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 "By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement 
officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of 
his freedom of action in any significant way," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 In follow-up rulings, the justices made clear that Miranda did not apply to 
all police questioning. If a person comes to a police station and offers to 
talk, the officers need not warn him. The person must be "in custody," when "a 
reasonable man" would think he is not free to leave, the court has said. 
</P>
<P>
 ARGUMENTS: Defense lawyers say Miranda can be rendered meaningless if police 
are permitted to question first and warn later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miranda has been so watered down, and the police know it," said Anthony 
Robusto, a Glendora attorney who represented Stansbury. In his appeal, 
Stansbury argues that his answers should not be used against him because he was 
questioned in a "police-dominated atmosphere." A reasonable man in Stansbury's 
place would think he was in custody, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But police and prosecutors say the law should not handcuff them from quickly 
questioning possible witnesses to a crime, as long as they are not compelled to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles prosecutor Richard D. Burns said police originally thought another 
ice cream driver, not Stansbury, was the prime suspect. Officers asked to speak 
with Stansbury because they thought he might have seen the missing girl with 
the other driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police talk to people all day long -- crime victims, witnesses and others -- 
seeking information. Should they have to warn everyone?" Burns asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the high court conclude his Miranda rights were violated, Stansbury 
could be entitled to a new trial, and prosecutors would have to rely on old, 
circumstantial evidence to retry him. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments in the case will be heard Wednesday, and a decision rendered by 
July.

EXXON VALDEZ STAYS AS SYMBOL OF TANKER RISKS; ITS NAME HAS CHANGED BUT IT STILL 
CARRIES OIL IN A FRAGILE SINGLE HULL. LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE, CRITICS SAY, TO 
IMPLEMENT LANDMARK 1990 PROTECTION LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a 987-foot tanker once known as the Exxon Valdez slipped into a harbor in 
the Bahamas a month ago, it was sporting a rebuilt hull, a new coat of paint 
and a new name -- the SeaRiver Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Much about the ship had changed since it struck Bligh Reef five years ago and 
spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. But 
to the Greenpeace activists who met the ship with noisy protest in the Bahamas, 
little was different. It was the same old single-hulled ship carrying the same 
old cargo of oil, bearing the same old risks of environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the nation's worst oil spill, environmental and maritime 
experts said the repainted Exxon tanker is emblematic of U.S. policy toward oil 
spills: In some ways, much has changed. And in some ways, little is different. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed, primarily, are state and federal laws governing the design 
and operations of all ships operating in U.S. waters. The most significant law, 
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, was passed a year after the Exxon spill to 
create a sea change in oil-spill prevention and response. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is carrying out the Oil Pollution Act and contends that the 
changes are well under way. But critics in the environmental community accuse 
the Coast Guard and its masters at the Transportation Department of 
foot-dragging and charge that the changes called for by law are stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oil Pollution Act called for significant new capabilities in fighting 
spills at ports around the United States. It required that ports and ship 
owners operating in U.S. waters put together plans for responding to spills. 
</P>
<P>
 It stiffened liability laws, increasing eight-fold the costs for which the 
owner of a tanker could be held liable and, in some cases, providing for 
unlimited liability. It established a 5-cents-a-barrel tax on crude oil to 
build a $1-billion cleanup trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
 And it set forth a timetable, running from 1995 to 2015, for requiring new, 
safer double hulls on large new cargo carriers operating in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Coast Guard has created three new oil pollution strike teams and a 
National Strike Force Coordination Center in Elizabeth City, N.J. The Coast 
Guard has identified 19 ports where oil-spill equipment should be based and has 
virtually finished putting that equipment in place. In a spill of diesel fuel 
off Puerto Rico in January, several of those sites provided the necessary 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The provisions of the 1990 law that increase potential liability also appear 
to have brought improvements in tanker safety. Ship owners and operators facing 
the prospect of greater liability concede they have paid more attention to the 
conditions of their equipment and the safety of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say the liability was another piece to crystallize our 
thoughts," about spill prevention, said Art Stephen, external affairs adviser 
for SeaRiver Maritime Inc., a wholly owned affiliate of Exxon Corp. and owner 
of the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on all sides of the debate agree. And because little oil is ever 
recovered from spills, even in the most favorable circumstances, prevention is 
a critical element of efforts to reduce the environmental impact of oil 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Exxon Valdez disaster had a powerful impact on coastal 
communities potentially affected by tanker traffic, galvanizing citizen 
watchdog groups. In the communities fouled by the Exxon Valdez, the Prince 
William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council -- with a full-time staff paid 
with funds furnished by Exxon and other oil companies -- has become a powerful, 
independent voice in ensuring safe operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, much today remains the same since the Exxon Valdez lurched onto Bligh 
Reef on March 24, 1989. Today, 95% of the vessels hauling oil in U.S. waters 
have a single hull, which can be easily breached in a grounding or collision. 
And a required plan to increase the safety of operating those ships, at least 
two years overdue already, is not expected to be complete for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Coast Guard unveiled a plan to make single-hulled ships 
safer, but it was quickly withdrawn after an engineering firm determined that 
the plan actually could worsen a spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very concerned about the Coast Guard's lack of competence and 
diligence in doing this," said Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney at the Natural 
Resources Defense Council in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Watchdogs like NRDC also worry that four years after the passage of the Oil 
Pollution Act, the Coast Guard has yet to identify environmentally sensitive 
shipping routes that should be free of oil tankers, as the law required.

RISING LEVIES TAX RUSSIANS' PATIENCE; ECONOMY: ASSESSMENTS CLIMB DAILY AND 
WITHOUT WARNING. GOVERNMENT AIMS TO OFFSET DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Russian businessman goes to Latvia for what he thinks is a good buy -- a 
1991 BMW for $7,000. But before he can drive it back to Russia, the government 
raises import taxes, adding $6,000 to the price. "They robbed me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The same surprise tax increase strands 200 Mercedes-Benz limousines in Germany 
because the city of Moscow, which ordered them for its beleaguered ambulance 
service, cannot fork over the extra duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling in Moscow, an American oil executive is shocked to learn of a new 63% 
tax on overseas household shipments. To retrieve his belongings, he must change 
$11,000 into rubles and empty his bulging pockets at the customs office. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes here seem to rise daily, without warning, as the Russian government 
slashes away at a $36-billion budget deficit. Reluctant to cut deeper into 
subsidies for money-losing enterprises and face the anger of unemployed masses, 
authorities have instead provoked the ire of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over who gets taxed and who gets subsidized is moving to center 
stage in Russia -- and intensifying. Under an agreement last week with the 
International Monetary Fund, President Boris N. Yeltsin's government has until 
April 15 -- a deadline familiar to American taxpayers -- to design new levies 
that will reduce the budget deficit by half. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown weighed in on the matter Monday, 
calling recent increases of import duties "an impediment to economic growth in 
Russia" and trade with America. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving here with 28 American executives on a weeklong trade mission, Brown 
also urged the Russians to reconsider a $5-a-barrel tax on exported oil that 
has soured many a deal with foreign prospectors. "I think it is unrealistic to 
expect people to come and do business if tax regimes change frequently," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting pressures over taxes will determine not only how much free 
trade and foreign investment Russia gets but also whether it collects a 
promised $1.5-billion IMF loan that would unlock new aid from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Since launching Western-style economic reforms in 1992, Russia has laid a 
growing tax burden on its people. The value-added sales tax is 23%. The tax on 
personal income is 30% of anything earned over $2,850 a year. Employers pay the 
Treasury an additional 39% of their total payroll. If a company manages a 
profit, the government can take up to 38% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Duties on most imports have doubled in recent weeks. There is now a 15% tax on 
all imported food, most of which had been exempt, and a 20% tax on imported 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes a host of local taxes, levied as Russia's cities and regions gain 
more autonomy. In Moscow, property taxes have tripled this year and businesses 
are subject to 50 other taxes, including one for every stock exchange 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "In such a system," Yeltsin admitted last month, "any enterprise or 
entrepreneur can honestly only die." But he added, "To gather everything that 
belongs to the state is also impossible." Last year, the Russians collected 
only about two-thirds of the budget revenues they should have. 
</P>
<P>
 Lashed by a storm of protest over import duties as he vacationed by the Black 
Sea, Yeltsin returned to Moscow on Sunday promising to review them. 
</P>
<P>
 One looming fight is over imported food. The 15% tax was imposed to protect 
Russia's unreformed agro-industrial complex and has been resisted by big-city 
mayors who fear it will cut food supplies and drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 As the government's draft 1994 budget undergoes parliamentary hearings, a 
parallel struggle is under way over spending. Officials responsible for 
defense, farming, science, education, culture and the environment have 
predicted ruin for their respective domains if such a tight budget passes. 
</P>
<P>
 In talks with the IMF last week, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin agreed 
to hold spending to the equivalent of $107 billion -- as laid out in his 
proposed budget -- and to limit deficit financing to the IMF target of 5% of 
gross domestic product, or about $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised to make up the rest of the expected deficit -- another $18 billion 
-- with more new taxes and better tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a daunting task. Even while accepting the Russian plan, IMF Managing 
Director Michel Camdessus noted that the efficiency of Russia's State Taxation 
Service "is declining rapidly." Indeed, tax collection is not what it was here 
600 years ago when the Mongol Golden Horde ruled by pillage, or two centuries 
ago when Peter the Great taxed everything from beards to kitchen chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax evasion is on the rise, and so is organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our premises are bombed, our personnel sustain serious bodily injuries and 
their property is destroyed," Vladimir V. Gusev, head of the Taxation Service, 
told reporters recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has created a Tax Police force to give tax collectors muscle. 
Last year, the Tax Police helped disclose 32,000 violations, charged 617 
taxpayers with crimes and convicted 59; that, however, yielded less than 2% of 
the total tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 While Economy Minister Alexander N. Shokhin defends new import duties as "a 
difficult compromise between consumers' and producers' interests," critics here 
and abroad say the duties will kill incentives for Russian businesses to 
modernize and compete in the world market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxation yoke has reached its limit, and I don't imagine it can be 
tightened any further without dangerous and unpredictable consequences," said 
Russian economist Gennady S. Lisichkin.

<P>
 Russia agreed Monday to lease the Baikonur space launch site in Kazakhstan for 
20 years, settling a longstanding dispute, Russian news services said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was one of 23 signed at the Kremlin by Russian President Boris 
N. Yeltsin and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev on political, military 
and economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached Monday, Russia will pay Kazakhstan $115 million 
annually for 20 years, with an option to lease the cosmodrome for an additional 
10 years. Kazakhstan had been holding out for $150 million a year, the Interfax 
news agency said.

VOTE UNDERLINES ETHNIC SPLIT IN UKRAINE; INITIATIVES: IN THE EAST AND CRIMEA, 
PRO-RUSSIANS FAVOR GREATER AUTONOMY AND TIES WITH MOSCOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Disillusioned by this nation's economic tailspin, pro-Russian residents of 
eastern Ukraine and Crimea have voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy from 
Kiev, according to preliminary results released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local ballot initiatives making Russian as well as Ukrainian an official 
language passed easily Sunday in two regions of Russophone eastern Ukraine. 
Also, a huge majority of voters in depressed industrial Donetsk and Lugansk 
favored closer economic ties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports indicated that Communist and socialist candidates for the 
Ukrainian Parliament were running strongly in the east, while democrats and 
nationalists fared better in the pro-European western regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of Sunday's balloting, while not unexpected, confirmed fears that 
Ukraine's first post-Communist parliamentary elections could lead to 
polarization and even disintegration of this still-nuclear nation of 52 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kiev moves forward on economic reform, they can stem the tide of 
separatism in Crimea and the movement for greater regional autonomy in the 
Donbas," the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine, said Myron Wasylyk, a 
parliamentary adviser. "But considering who they are returning to Parliament, 
I'm not sure how interested they really are in economic reform, because every 
second person in the runoffs is a Communist." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 75% of Ukraine's 38 million voters turned out Sunday, belying 
predictions that political apathy would triumph over frustration with Ukraine's 
disastrous economy, which contracted by one-quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But an arcane law requires the winning candidate to receive at least 25% of 
the ballots of all registered voters. With 5,833 candidates running, some 
ballots had up to 30 names, making it impossible for all but the best-known 
politicians to win on the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 450 seats in the new Parliament, only 47 were filled Sunday. The rest will 
be decided in an April 10 runoff between the top two vote-getters in each 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The big winner was ousted Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who won a landslide 
90% of the vote in Cherihiv. Kuchma is expected to challenge President Leonid 
Kravchuk in the next presidential elections, which could be held as early as 
June; Kuchma is running well ahead of Kravchuk in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk's acting prime minster, Yefim Zviagilsky, was forced into a runoff in 
Donetsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 47 winners, 14 are democrats, two are members of the hard-right 
Ukrainian National Assembly, 11 are Communists and socialists and 27 are 
independents whose political leanings were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 A large contingent of Communist and socialist candidates seems likely to 
compete in the April 10 runoff. Official results in some races are expected to 
be announced today.

POST-PACT EUPHORIA HAS LEFT JERICHO; MIDEAST: SIX MONTHS AFTER PEACE ACCORD, 
RESIDENTS' OPTIMISM IS DIMMED BY MOSQUE MASSACRE AND THE KILLINGS OF SIX MORE 
PALESTINIANS. 
</P>

<P>
 Abdel Karim Sidr is a hard man to find these days. 
</P>
<P>
 It's better that way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidr is the spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization in Jericho, 
the sleepy border town on the edge of the West Bank that exploded in euphoria 
last September when the PLO signed a historic peace declaration with Israel 
making Jericho the headquarters of a future, autonomous Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, a day when at least six more Palestinians were shot and killed 
by Israeli authorities in the occupied Gaza Strip, the PLO spokesman in Jericho 
did not have much good to say about his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain men were members of the Fatah Hawks, the military wing of PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shootout erupted in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of Gaza City, the 
six were distributing leaflets criticizing the PLO for attempting to return to 
talks on implementing Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the single deadliest incident since a Jewish settler massacred about 30 
Palestinians at prayer in a Hebron mosque last month, and it cast further doubt 
on the struggling Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new massacre," Arafat said in Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO is 
headquartered. ". . . We are now facing a secret organization from within the 
Israeli army and the (Jewish) settlers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, Sidr said the euphoria over the possibility of peace is forgotten. 
His once-bustling PLO office downtown is closed -- padlocked in protest after 
the massacre at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Sidr said, even he has given up trying to defend his own leaders, 
even on the eve of what Israeli and PLO negotiators predicted could be a 
breakthrough in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Palestinians agreed with Sidr that there were few signs on the ground in 
lands occupied for a quarter of a century to justify the official optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, we stopped fighting; we stopped the intifada (the Palestinian uprising 
against Israel). We recognized Israel. And we have gotten nothing," Sidr told 
two Western journalists who finally tracked him down at the Jericho Chamber of 
Commerce office, where he had just finished sharing his pessimism with a 
visiting delegation from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in the streets ask us: 'What is the benefit of this agreement? 
What have we gotten? What will we receive in the future?' I just run away. I 
escape. I have no answers for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and PLO negotiators had hoped to agree in talks scheduled today in 
Cairo on a compromise that will restart negotiations on implementing the 
long-delayed autonomy agreement for the first time since the mosque massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 After the killings in Jabaliya, Arafat would not say if the PLO would boycott 
the talks. But he said he was calling an emergency meeting of PLO leaders this 
morning to decide on a PLO response. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among PLO stalwarts, it was clear that popular support for Arafat and his 
peace efforts was all but dead for the moment, along with the scores of 
Palestinians who have been killed in the territories since the original peace 
agreement was signed half a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in Jericho were about 85% supporting that agreement in September," Sidr 
concluded. "That percentage now is around zero -- maybe below zero." 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian opinion poll released Sunday was a bit more generous. The survey 
by the Nablus-based Center for Palestinian Research Studies found that the 
overwhelming majority of the 2 million Palestinians in the territories -- 
86.1%, in fact -- have reservations about how the PLO has handled its talks 
with Israel since the Brooklyn, N.Y.-born settler, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, opened 
fire on unarmed worshipers in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 1,978 Palestinians surveyed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip said 
they were flatly opposed to the PLO decision to continue negotiating with 
Israel without immediately resolving the issue of Jewish settlements in Hebron 
and throughout the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO chairman did insist on just that, when, amid an outpouring of fury 
across the territories the day of the massacre, Arafat broke off all talks with 
Israel. The PLO leader insisted he would not return to the bargaining table 
unless Israel agreed to discuss the future of the settlements along with a host 
of unresolved logistics disputes concerning implementation of the overall 
autonomy plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, after Israel's refusal to negotiate the issue of the 140,000 
Jewish settlers living in the occupied territories -- at least until the 
"Gaza-Jericho first" agreement is in place -- the settlers issue no longer 
appeared to be a top priority on the PLO's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The major outstanding dispute on the table if the Cairo talks take place today 
seems to be the size, makeup and authority of a lightly armed force of 
Palestinian police and international observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have agreed it will be posted in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Its aim will be to quell the violence between Hebron's more than 120,000 
Palestinians and the 415 Jewish settlers who live in the heart of town. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, PLO officials were far from optimistic that an agreement will be 
reached quickly. Progress over the weekend in telephone and fax contacts was 
slow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be in a position to ask if they accept (the PLO demands). Otherwise, 
we're wasting time," said Said Kamel, PLO ambassador to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come tomorrow and say, 'We accept the paper you presented,' then 
there's a chance. Otherwise there's nothing to talk about."

ARAB LEAGUE PUTS OFF CONSIDERATION OF ISRAEL BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Arab League finds itself increasingly divided over whether to consider 
Israel a friend or foe, the massacre of about 30 Palestinians by a Jewish 
settler in Hebron has set back the timetable for a possible lifting of the Arab 
boycott against the Israelis, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of the Arab world, still fractured by the wounds left by 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, found themselves at their 101st regular session 
unable even to agree on who represents a common enemy of the Arabs -- though 
Israel got barely a mention among possible threats to Arab security. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion of two days of meetings with no new resolutions adopted on the 
Arab boycott, Arab security or even the issue of a proposed Arab court of 
justice reflects the extent to which the Arab world remains unsettled by the 
Gulf War and uncertain about how to deal with prospects of a general peace with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relations with Israel have really changed substantially, and we cannot speak 
about Israel using the same language we used to use in the past," said Nagui 
Ghatrify, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Egypt, which has urged its Arab 
neighbors to move toward peaceful relations with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Syria and Lebanon prevailed in maintaining a hard-line stance toward 
Israel on resolutions pertaining to the Middle East conflict, against a growing 
sentiment among the Arab Gulf states and North African countries, like Tunisia 
and Morocco, that a moderate tone toward Jerusalem must be adopted in the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf states and North Africa proposed taking steps toward dealing with 
Israel as a recognized state and a member of the Middle East community with 
which there should be contacts "in a sense of partnership," said a source 
familiar with the closed talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening address to the league, Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid 
called for complete disarming of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories; 
dismantling of all Jewish settlements in the territories, and speeding up 
creation of an effective international observer force in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong lobbying by the United States, no move was taken to lift the 
secondary economic boycott of Israel, under which companies that do business 
with the Jewish state are banned from doing business in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bloody and tragic events in Hebron really did not make it possible or 
convenient to discuss the question of the boycott," Ghatrify said. "It would 
have been a very nice gesture to Israel, (but) there remains a lot of 
bitterness, sadness and agony." 
</P>
<P>
 Adnan Omran, the league's assistant secretary general, said the group is 
unlikely to act on the boycott until there is movement on the peace process 
between Israel and its neighboring Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
 Farouk Shareh, Syria's foreign minister, said the boycott "is a legitimate act 
. . . as a result of Israel's occupation of Arab land, and it should remain so 
until the occupation ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the league adopted resolutions on the peace process; the Golan 
Heights; the intifada (the Palestinian uprising against Israel); Jerusalem; 
south Lebanon, and Palestinian refugees. They were very similar to previous, 
hard-line resolutions -- in part because Syria and Lebanon refused all 
overtures toward moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under league rules, resolutions must be adopted unanimously; there is not even 
agreement on amending the charter to allow for divided opinion.

STRUGGLE TO REPLACE COLOSIO REVEALS PRI RIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON and JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One by one, party chiefs, government ministers and potential candidates 
paraded in and out of the presidential mansion, stoic and mute. Throngs of 
reporters staked out nearby jostled for a sliver of information, a name. But, 
as the ritual of consultations continued Monday, the veil of secrecy did not 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the assassination of Mexico's probable next president, the 
ruling party was struggling to name a replacement. The delay in choosing a new 
candidate has exposed serious rifts in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, and highlights once again its autocratic, increasingly 
criticized way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the choice he makes, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is faced 
with a virtual mutiny among party members, from either old-guard hard-liners or 
reform-minded progressives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salinas is a man in a straitjacket right now," a senior PRI official said. 
"His choices are very limited, and he has very little room to maneuver. The 
longer it takes, the more poisoned the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination last week of Luis Donaldo Colosio shook Mexico's ruling 
party to the core and has incited a bitter power struggle that seems certain to 
leave the PRI bruised and fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, who was Colosio's campaign manager, is rumored to be the 
front-runner because he is close to Salinas and could be counted on to continue 
Salinas' free-market economic policies. But he is regarded as a cold technocrat 
who has little following in the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Party Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana appears to have the backing of many 
traditional party stalwarts who have been waging a campaign to boost him and to 
block Zedillo. These hard-liners have felt their power erode under Salinas and 
oppose a Salinas protege such as Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 A likely candidate would have been Manuel Camacho Solis, the admired former 
mayor of Mexico City who was appointed as the government envoy to Indian 
peasants who rebelled in Chiapas state earlier this year. But Camacho Solis 
appears to have committed political suicide by flirting with an independent 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend and on Monday, a string of party elite, Cabinet members 
and other advisers arrived at Los Pinos, Salinas' residence and office, for 
consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting Salinas' choices is a constitutional clause that bars a presidential 
candidate from having served in a government post six months before the 
election. With voting scheduled for Aug. 21, the clause eliminates Salinas' 
entire Cabinet and all sitting governors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, where the PRI has held on to power for 65 years -- sometimes 
through fraud -- the presidential candidate is chosen personally by the 
outgoing president, rather than by a convention. Consequently, there is no 
mechanism for replacing a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 As time passes without a candidate, PRI militants are becoming increasingly 
restive and vocal in their criticisms. Despite frantic efforts by the party 
hierarchy to keep all in line, the strain is showing. Party dissidents have 
renewed calls for democratic reform in the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of a candidate was further complicated Monday by growing 
conviction among Mexicans that Colosio's murder was part of a conspiracy.

 China again frustrated hopes that it would take a strong line on North Korea's 
nuclear program, telling visiting South Korean President Kim Young Sam that the 
crisis must be resolved through dialogue and that it opposes U.S. plans to send 
Patriot missiles to Seoul. President Jiang Zemin told Kim that China wants a 
nuclear-free Korean Peninsula to maintain peace and stability there. China, one 
of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, has said it opposes 
as counterproductive any moves by the council to pressure North Korea.

FUGITIVE JUDGE IS FOUND DEAD IN VEGAS HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former judge committed suicide in a Las Vegas hotel room, ending a four-year 
flight from justice after he was charged with stealing $1.8 million entrusted 
to him in his private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Fairbanks, 70, of New Hampshire was found with a plastic bag over his 
head in his hotel room, where he left a note taped to a mirror, Metro Police 
Sgt. Bill Keeton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks disappeared Dec. 28, 1989, a day after he was indicted. An extensive 
investigation yielded few clues, despite the help of national TV crime 
programs, such as "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks checked into the MGM Grand Hotel on Thursday under another name and 
overstayed the two nights he paid for, Keeton said. On Sunday, hotel employees 
broke into the room, which was locked from the inside with a deadbolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left a note that can be interpreted as a suicide note," Keeton said. 
Coroner Ron Flud said an autopsy determined that Fairbanks died of 
asphyxiation. He ruled the death a suicide.

CAN CLINTON BE A HOG AND NOT BE A HOG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is discovering that indulging his passion for the University 
of Arkansas basketball team requires some of the same delicacy as international 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has proclaimed his desire to see his beloved Razorbacks in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Final Four tournament that wraps up Monday 
with a game in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appearance of a President with his Air Force One entourage and huge 
security detail has the potential to delay, inconvenience or even displace a 
lot of other basketball fans -- and possibly sour some of the positive 
publicity that his ardent interest in his alma mater's Hogs has been winning 
for him lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appearance at the Arkansas-Michigan game in Dallas last Saturday 
excited a lot of fans but caused some grumbling from those who had to stand in 
line as the Secret Service checked them for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the White House has been doing everything it can to see that the 
First Fan does not intrude any more than necessary when he heads for the 
tournament Saturday after his weeklong sojourn in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After his appearance at the Arkansas-Michigan game, Clinton decided to call 
off a postgame trip to the two teams' locker rooms to avoid a massive traffic 
tie-up at an arena that exits from only one driveway. Instead, he walked out on 
the court after the game to congratulate the teams and coaches, then left ahead 
of most of the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides inquired in advance about tickets for the Charlotte event to 
make sure that giving the Clinton party seats would not deprive someone else of 
the chance to see the game. They were told that the tickets had already been 
set aside on the chance that Clinton might want to come. 
</P>
<P>
 And aides said that the President is planning to leave Charlotte for 
Washington immediately after Saturday's game so that the presidential party 
will not need hotel rooms in a city that is booked to capacity. Some fans are 
driving to the arena from hotels 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA officials, delighted with the publicity Clinton's interest is generating, 
praised his cooperativeness. But they said they are worried that he might 
decide to stay on Saturday or after the Monday finals, forcing them to displace 
some fans with reserved hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could create significant problems for us," said David Cawood, an NCAA 
assistant executive director. "There's not a hotel room left in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Final Four fans, of course, are likely to be unhappy in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service's screening held up some people for as much as 45 minutes 
Saturday. Some fans may believe that the 30 seats set aside for Clinton in 
Dallas and the 35 the party will get in Charlotte could have gone to 
less-privileged fans. 
</P>
<P>
 And, even if the presidential party does not stay overnight, there is the cost 
of running the presidential party down to Charlotte on an aircraft that, 
according to a congressional panel, costs $40,243 an hour to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides are talking about pairing his Monday trip with an event to promote 
health care reform, which would help justify the Southern swing. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, the biggest public relations problem is posed by the chance that 
the presidential party would decide to stay overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cawood, considering that possibility, mused: "There aren't any big world 
crises going to happen on Tuesday, are there?"

 The death toll from violent thunderstorms and tornadoes that ripped across the 
Southeast on Palm Sunday rose to 43 Monday as special teams in Alabama and 
Georgia combed through devastated communities to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The governors of those two states are expected to call on the federal 
government for economic assistance because many residents who lost their homes 
are poor and have no insurance.More than 450 homes were reported destroyed in 
Georgia alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty of the victims were fatally injured when the roof collapsed during 
services at the Goshen Methodist Church near Piedmont, Ala. The 4-year-old 
daughter of the church pastor was among six children killed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the Carolinas remained under a tornado watch Monday evening, and 
rain continued to fall across the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews in north Georgia replaced torn roofs and used chain saws to cut through 
trees that were blocking roads. The region was littered with cars, roofs, 
uprooted trees and about 1.5 million dead chickens.

HIGH COURT PUTS INSANITY DEFENSE IN PERIL; LAW: JUSTICES DECLINE TO REVIEW 
ASSAULT CONVICTION OF SCHIZOPHRENIC MONTANA MAN. THIS GIVES STATES A GREEN 
LIGHT TO END THE LONG-USED PROTECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday gave states a green light to abolish the 
traditional insanity defense by declining to review the assault conviction of a 
schizophrenic Montana man. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment or dissent, the high court refused to hear the man's claim 
that the Constitution forbids convicting an insane person of a criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the court's action does not carry the weight of an actual ruling, it 
strongly suggests that the justices do not believe the Constitution requires 
states to permit defendants to employ the insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout American history, state courts have accepted the view that a 
mentally deranged person cannot be held legally responsible for a crime. But 
the tide began to turn in recent decades as some lawmakers disputed whether a 
defendant's claim of insanity was reason enough to free him from a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Montana became the first state to abolish the insanity defense from 
its criminal code and Idaho and Utah followed suit. After John W. Hinckley Jr. 
was acquitted by reason of insanity for the attempted assassination of 
then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, Congress in 1984 tightened the 
requirements for an insanity plea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has said little through the years about the insanity 
defense, although some justices agreed with the critics who said that it is not 
a necessary element of criminal law. For example, then-Justice William H. 
Rehnquist in 1985 said it is "highly doubtful that (the Constitution) requires 
a state to make available an insanity defense to a criminal defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came before the court in the case of a deranged Montana man who 
viciously attacked a forest ranger with a tree-planting tool and then stood 
quietly nearby until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists testified that the defendant, Joe Junior Cowan, suffered from 
paranoia and hallucinations. The police reported that he had a habit of 
breaking into cabins, eating the food and watching television. When discovered, 
he would react violently to what he viewed as an invasion of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of April 24, 1990, Forest Service employee Maggie Doherty 
returned to her cabin in a remote area near Missoula, Mont., to find food 
missing and her television set on. When she saw a suspicious-looking man 
standing outside, she locked the doors and phoned for help. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cowan, enraged, broke down the door and attacked her with a large metal 
tool. She suffered broken bones and other injuries but survived. When deputies 
arrived, they found Cowan standing a few feet away. He did not flee or resist. 
</P>
<P>
 At his trial, his defense lawyers said that Cowan suffered from "paranoid 
schizophrenia." Under Montana law, however, prosecutors had to prove only that 
he "knowingly" and "purposely" committed the assault. Because his delusional 
behavior seemed to wax and wane, a judge agreed Cowan knew right from wrong and 
had knowingly and deliberately assaulted the Forest Service employee. He was 
convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Montana Supreme Court upheld his criminal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal to the high court, his lawyers said that the case presented "an 
ideal vehicle for settling the question" of whether the Constitution requires 
that truly insane defendants have a right to be acquitted of criminal 
wrongdoing. His appeal said that it violates "due process of law" and is "cruel 
and unusual punishment" to convict a deranged person. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one disagreed that he is suffering from a mental disease, but under 
Montana law, he is being punished as a criminal rather than being treated as an 
ill person," said Margaret Borg, a lawyer who represented Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the high court refused to hear the appeal in the case (Cowan vs. 
Montana, 93-1264). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the court also let stand the conviction of two white Illinois men, 
who were charged with arson and federal civil rights violations in a 
cross-burning case. The men, who lived in the small all-white town of 
Keeneyville, west of Chicago, set the cross aflame near the home of a neighbor 
who had entertained black visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal outcome appears to conflict with a 1992 high court ruling that 
struck down an anti-cross burning law from St. Paul, Minn. on free-speech 
grounds. But the lower courts said that this case (Hayward vs. U.S., 93-1063) 
differs because the Illinois men were charged with arson and civil rights 
violations, not with offensive expressions.

JUSTICES REBUFF ARGUMENTS AGAINST STATE UNITARY TAX; JUDICIARY: U.S. SUPREME 
COURT MEMBERS' RESPONSES INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA MAY NOT HAVE TO REFUND $4 
BILLION TO MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a session that bodes well for California's treasury, Supreme Court justices 
Monday rebuffed arguments that they should restrain the state's use of the 
unitary tax on multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the justices, in comments from the bench, said that Congress -- not 
the courts -- has the authority to impose limits on taxing policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the final arbiter of this. The Constitution gave Congress the 
power to regulate commerce," said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "I don't know 
any other country that would put this kind of question to a court." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg's remarks were in reply to arguments by an attorney for British-owned 
Barclays Bank of San Francisco, who urged the court to declare the state's 
unitary tax unconstitutional. If the justices were to follow that advice, the 
state would be forced to repay $4 billion in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that possibility appeared remote, given the response to Monday's 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, California has ruffled the feathers of foreign firms 
by taxing part of their worldwide income. In contrast, most other states treat 
foreign firms as distinct businesses within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign firms have complained that the California approach allows the 
state to tax profits earned outside California. During the 1980s, officials of 
the Ronald Reagan Administration sided with the foreign firms, saying that the 
state's taxing method interfered with U.S. trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing those comments, lawyers for the multinational firms built a legal 
challenge to California's tax and demanded refunds dating to the late 1970s. 
They argued that the Constitution requires all states, as well as the U.S. 
Treasury, to "speak with one voice" in their dealings with foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But three recent developments have undercut their case. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Congress stopped short of passing legislation outlawing a state's use 
of the unitary tax. As the justices repeatedly noted during Monday's arguments, 
the Constitution says that "Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate 
commerce with foreign nations." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, California lawmakers last year essentially repealed future use of the 
unitary method. Thus, critics no longer can claim that the state's taxing 
approach is a continuing thorn in the nation's trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
 And third, the Clinton Administration, breaking with its predecessors, took 
the state's side in final stages of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip-toeing around the controversy, U.S. Solicitor Gen. Drew Days told the 
justices Monday that the executive branch prefers that states treat 
multinational businesses within their borders as separate entities for taxing 
purposes but has no firm policy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute argument, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices 
David H. Souter, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined Ginsburg in 
disputing the assertion that the court should restrain California because 
neither Congress nor the Treasury Department has done so. 
</P>
<P>
 A written ruling in the Barclay's case and a parallel case (Barclay's Bank vs. 
Franchise Tax Board, 92-1384, and Colgate-Palmolive vs. Franchise Tax Board, 
92-1389) is due by July.

 Adding his voice to the outrage over the carjacking and murder of two teen-age 
college students from Japan, Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday urged the state 
Legislature to reconsider a law calling for the death penalty for those who 
commit murder during a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of two speeches in Orange County to push his anti-crime package, 
Wilson criticized the Legislature for failing last year to pass the death 
penalty law for carjackings and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning, I asked the Legislature, 'Don't let this crime, this latest 
crime, go unavenged. To the extent that you do not respond, you encourage other 
thugs to do the same thing,' " Wilson told members of South Orange County 
chambers of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, following a private session with about 20 Orange County 
women who had been victims of rape or child molestation, Wilson again urged 
passage of a "one strike and you're out" bill that would put first-time rapists 
and child molesters in prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has effectively made repeat offenders of violent crimes the symbols of 
his anti-crime agenda that has recently highlighted his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming the object of scorn of Modoc County residents who protested the 
release of serial rapist Melvin Carter, Wilson has attempted to turn the 
episode to political advantage, using that case and others to demonstrate the 
need for tougher sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "one strike" bill, sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), has run into criticism from a variety of sources -- including some 
women political activists -- because of fear that its severity might make 
district attorneys more reluctant to prosecute rape cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem hasn't been (that) prosecutors have been unable to get 
convictions," Wilson said following the meeting with crime victims in the city 
of Orange. "The problem has been that once they got the convictions, you had 
someone who was an animal who was out on the streets again in less than five 
years. It's been the law that has been at fault and it's the law that has to be 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The "one strike" bill was applauded by the crime victims who met with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The women said in interviews following the governor's speech that while 
rapists can be paroled early because of good behavior under the current law, 
the victims must live with the memory of the attack for the rest of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "That never leaves you," said an Orange County woman, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year-old rape victim said she wished the "one strike" law had been in 
place before she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the (assailant's) third victim," she said. "If he would have been put 
away, I would have never happened, nor the girl before me." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the governor championed legislation requiring longer prison terms, 
he sidestepped questions about how to pay for construction of extra prison 
space that the mandatory life sentences would require. 
</P>
<P>
 He said simply that society would pay a higher price if life sentences were 
not mandated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me what price we should put -- what value we should put -- on 
preventing this kind of harm to the women I met with this morning," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech before the South County business and community leaders, 
Wilson also discussed other anti-crime measures he supports, including one that 
would require anyone over the age of 14 who commits a violent crime to be 
prosecuted as an adult. The current minimum age is 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also offered condolences to the parents of the students from Japan who 
were killed during the weekend carjacking in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the weekend, we were embarrassed as well as shocked that up in a 
pleasant seaside community -- San Pedro -- we witnessed another vicious crime . 
. . part of a brutal carjacking," Wilson said. "Today, our prayers and sympathy 
are with the parents of the two boys, whose dreams of an education in America 
have been shattered by some thugs who took their lives to steal their car." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We also have got to say that that is simply not acceptable. We have 
got to take a stand. We have got to say that a civilized society doesn't allow 
this kind of thing to happen. We have to enact laws that are tough enough to 
combat the sick and twisted minds who would commit that kind of an atrocity." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said no community in the state is safe from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to give brutal killers the death penalty that they deserve," he said.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; OUT OF THE ORDINARY; TIM HAWKINSON FINDS INCREDIBLE 
POTENTIAL IN EVERYDAY OBJECTS 
</P>

<P>
 "Ohhh!" breathed the young woman who stepped into Chapman University's 
Guggenheim Gallery the other day. "That's cool !" 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends agreed. So do I. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles artist Tim Hawkinson is on a roll, and it's great to see his work 
in Orange County again. (Earlier pieces were included in "Imperfect Order," an 
exhibition at the Irvine Fine Arts Center two years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkinson finds incredible potential in such ordinary things as steak knives, 
extension cords, dog chews, strapping tape and burnt matches. This stuff 
becomes raw material for funky experiments that have their own internal logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Like? Well, like the side table Hawkinson flipped on its side and stuffed with 
a plastic Thermos jar studded with a pattern of screws. Hooked up to a motor, 
the jar revolves. The screws keep bumping into a row of serrated metal pieces 
(the business ends of the steak knives), and the result is a continuous series 
of magical pinging sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is called "Music Box (if I could save time in a bottle)," suggesting 
the sweet conceit of music as time made audible and stashed in a bottle, like 
miniature ships or secret messages. By employing a decidedly 20th-Century 
domestic version of a bottle -- equipped with insulation to prolong the life of 
what's inside -- Hawkinson handily extends the metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of ships, Hawkinson's "Das Tannenboot" is a dead Christmas tree 
stripped of its needles and re-envisioned as an unlikely source of spars for a 
multitude of tiny, meticulously crafted ship masts and riggings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The title turns the German word for Christmas tree ( das Tannenbaum ) into the 
equivalent of "Christmas boat." The sailing ship imagery and the metaphorical 
quality of a lifeless holiday remnant suggest the fate of the German U-boat 
crew in the movie "Das Boot" (they get a taste of Christmas festivities before 
becoming casualties of war). 
</P>
<P>
 Other notions spinning around the piece might include the medieval image of 
earthly existence as a "ship of fools" and (in view of the vintage quality of 
the imagery) the colonists' bitter Christmas siege during the American 
Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most gratifying aspects of Hawkinson's work is that it is 
immediately inviting on a purely physical level. Part of the enjoyment has to 
do with the way the pieces telegraph their tinkering spirit, their sense of 
"let's put this with that and see what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of precedents for using everyday objects or castoff junk in 
art (a tactic first explored in the 1920s by Dada artists) as well as for 
making sculpture that moves (kinetic art had its heyday in the 1960s). But 
Hawkinson has a unique and specific approach that remains grounded in everyday 
actions even as it plays kiss-and-tell games with art history and language, and 
brokers outlandish marriages between form and function. 
</P>
<P>
 A lustrous object on the wall lures the eyeballs with a sensory whoosh: The 
large circular pattern of transparent, shiny material has a moire effect like a 
hologram. Pieced together with short lengths of strapping tape on flattened 
cardboard boxes, "Pearl Vision" suggests a double trance state: of the viewer 
blissed out by staring at the piece, and of the artist totally immersed in the 
soothing obsessiveness of tearing, placing and smoothing rolls of tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The most eye-catching piece in the show consists of three huge, air-filled 
latex protrusions, connected by silver foil-covered hoses, that huddle together 
on the wall and floor. There is something both placid and menacing about these 
pneumatic wonders, which Hawkinson calls "Rubber Balls and Liquor." I'm not 
sure why he does so, except that the title suggests a slapstick accident 
waiting to happen, or an unfortunate cause-and-effect relationship between 
alcohol and sexual organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a bored prisoner or a manic inventor, Hawkinson's mind seems so riveted 
on seemingly worthless or banal things that he uncovers potentials no one knew 
they had. What tricks can an extension cord do? Well, it can pretend to be a 
ball of yarn or a spider's filament, thereby extending ordinary ordinary 
notions of usefulness, craft and ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Connected to each other via a series of high-wires -- suggesting the 
nimbleness of a circus act -- an orange extension cord is "knitted" into a pair 
of orange shorts, and a "crocheted" blue doily hovers near the ceiling like an 
ersatz spider web. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Vessel," a tour de force of substitution and "connection," a cord 
imitating one craft (knitting) is pressed into service to imitate another 
(ceramics). Amusingly, the vessel has the sagging look of amateur ceramics, 
perhaps a metaphor for the makeshift effect inevitably accompanying the use of 
extension cords. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more great stuff, notably "Penitent," which looks like a cross between 
the Invisible Man and the skeletal images of memento mori art. It was assembled 
from bone-shaped dog chews, plastic tubing, a water bottle and a continuous 
whistling device that infuses the piece with a ghost-breath: at once eerie and 
cheery. 
</P>
<P>
 Poised like a philosophical riddle between life and death, the "Penitent" is a 
metaphor for the improvised state in which we live. As in all of Hawkinson's 
best work, the metaphorical part seems almost a throwaway, a subliminal whisper 
from an object so weirdly familiar and yet so weirdly different that it 
practically exerts a gravitational pull. 
</P>

A NEW STAGE IN HER CAREER; O'DONNELL'S MADE IT IN MOVIES, BUT BROADWAY WAS HER 
DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE PAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Bristol Lounge of the stately Four Seasons hotel, the tone is set by 
buttery oak walls and ceilings, gathered drapes, swirling carpets. A stone's 
throw from Boston Common and a few blocks from the city's theater district, the 
bar-restaurant is the kind of place one reasonably might expect to see opera 
singer Jessye Norman reclining on a plush fireside sofa while a classic winter 
blizzard rages outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the sort of joint you'd imagine that Betty Rubble would pick for 
dinner. And yet, isn't that her high-pitched, Stone Age cartoon laugh, spilling 
forth from a corner table? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahnnnn hnnn hnnn. Bamm-Bamm, put that down!"  
</P>
<P>
 Adorned in gray sweat pants, navy blue sweat shirt, black high-tops and zero 
makeup, Rosie O'Donnell has about as much respect for the sanctity of her posh 
surroundings as Dino had for Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 The stand-up comic-turned-actress is explaining how she won her role as Betty 
in the "Flintstones" movie, opening around Memorial Day. So without hesitation, 
apparently oblivious to the power-tie and Perrier crowd dining around her, 
laugh she does. Loudly.  
</P>
<P>
 That's O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the fastest rising personalities in the entertainment business 
-- movie offers by the fistful, a starring role in a revival of "Grease" headed 
for Broadway (May 11, after a stop in Orange County beginning today), best 
friend to Madonna -- but she has none of the newcomer-with-an-attitude 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 During this interview, at least, she is candid, nonchalant and altogether real 
-- even stopping mid-sentence at one point to ask her interviewer if that is 
Jessye Norman across the room, then excusing herself to go meet the diva, like 
some wide-eyed kid running into Roger Clemens outside Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 That accomplished, O'Donnell, 32, returns to chat about more immediate 
concerns. First: Why "Grease"? Why now? 
</P>
<P>
 Her movie career has been humming along since the success of her debut in "A 
League of Their Own" in 1992 -- last year, she did "Sleepless in Seattle" and 
"Another Stakeout" -- so this might not seem the best moment to take a 
nine-month hiatus. But O'Donnell thinks her timing is just about perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done with (the "Grease" tour and Broadway run) by the end of October, so 
I'll be back making movies by November," she says. "Besides that, if you do 
movie after movie, the public gets sick of you." 
</P>
<P>
 As to why "Grease" specifically: Well, because Tommy Tune cast her. The 
original musical, by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, debuted on Broadway in 1972; 
this revival is a Tune production, directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking for a 'name' to be one of the lead roles, and when I said I 
had wanted to do Rizzo, they thought that would probably work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell has wanted to do just about any role in just about any musical on 
Broadway since she was old enough to memorize every line and lyric to "Funny 
Girl" (a talent she retains, and -- in Streisand-esque comic voice -- uses 
periodically to punctuate interviews such as this one). 
</P>
<P>
 But she is under no delusions that she has Barbra Streisand's vocal chops. Or 
even Stockard Channing's, who played Rizzo in the movie version. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never really a singer, except for maybe in the shower or something like 
that. But I always wanted to do it because to me there is nothing like the 
thrill of going to a Broadway show when the lights go down and you have that 
orchestra in front of you. I always get goose bumps. It's the reason I went 
into show business in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she says, the reception has been warm and forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audiences have been great. Nobody is really expecting me to get up there 
and be Whitney Houston. They know who I am and what I do, and I think they do 
expect me to be funny, and hopefully I am funny. Then the rest . . . they 
think, 'You know, she is all right.' Even the critics have said, 'She's all 
right; she's not the best singer.' Which is fine. I can take that. It's the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, at least a few critics have equivocated a bit: 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kelly, Boston Globe: "She has the brazen delivery of Ethel Merman. She 
snaps one-liners like gum, she burps, she boogies. She has two songs . . . 
which she sings in an even tone but, often, with the wrong emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Sommers, Washington Post: "The part of Rizzo . . . is no stretch for 
the pasty-faced, tough-talking O'Donnell, but the less said about her off-key, 
blaring singing, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, O'Donnell finds herself treated well by the entertainment media, 
remaining philosophic about the negatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get away unscathed," she says flatly. "They're going to print 
something. And I've been really lucky because the press has been really nice to 
me. And I'll stop wherever I am -- even if I look like crap -- I say, 'Go ahead 
and take the picture,' because they are trying to get the job done and it's 
part of the game, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The game for her began when she was 18 and left her home in Commack, N.Y., to 
hit the stand-up comedy circuit. Her mother died of cancer when Rosie was 10 
and, even with a sister and three brothers around, there wasn't much levity on 
the home front as she remembers it ("very Irish Catholic sort of repressed 
family"). 
</P>
<P>
 She had walked into a local club and delivered a killer routine lifted -- 
verbatim -- from an up-and-coming young comic named Jerry Seinfeld. After the 
other comics on the bill nearly had her dismembered for the infraction, she met 
with a far scarier realization: This comedy thing was going to require her to 
create her own jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was like 'How am I going to write material? I'm not a writer.' I was so 
mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she stuck with it. In 1984, she won several episodes of "Star Search" 
(though not the coveted grand prize), moved to Los Angeles and two years later 
found herself on the NBC series "Gimme a Break." Then came emcee duties on 
VH-1's "Stand-Up Spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Her show-biz stature increased when she was cast as best friend and teammate 
to Madonna's character in "A League of Their Own." The friendship ultimately 
extended into real life and, both confirm, it continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a mega-star's pal has shown her something of the price of fame. "Coming 
to know (Madonna) and love her as a human being brought me to a different 
awareness of what that kind of media image does to someone," O'Donnell says. 
Superstardom is now far from something she aspires to, though she admires her 
friend's attempts to live somewhat normally in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is recognized, but she does go places," O'Donnell insists. "I mean, we go 
the mall; we go to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Madonna have to say about her pal? 
</P>
<P>
 "My friendship with Rosie has nothing to do with image," the pop diva 
commented recently. "I cannot explain the mystery of what happens when you 
become best friends with someone. I can only say that we are tortured by the 
same things, we laugh at the same things, and I love her madly!" 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for O'Donnell is the release of "The Flintstones," a Steven Spielberg 
production that O'Donnell hopes has blockbuster written all over it. But even 
if it bombs at the box office, she's already realized a dream as a result of 
the project: 
</P>
<P>
 She is a Happy Meal figurine. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it's actually Betty Rubble's likeness that is poised to become a prize in 
McDonald's fast-food version of the Cracker Jacks box. But O'Donnell, who long 
has been a collector of Happy Meal toys herself ("I have like hundreds"), is 
thrilled to be even this close to immortalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Following "The Flintstones," O'Donnell's screen image will take a dramatic 
turn. In the Garry Marshall-directed "Exit to Eden," based on the Anne Rice 
novel, she plays an undercover cop who goes to an adult-themed fantasy island 
to solve a drug-smuggling caper. The role, reportedly turned down by Sharon 
Stone, includes a semi-nude scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nearly nude," O'Donnell reports. "Nude enough to scare people. 
</P>

WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING?; MOVIES: AFTER NAVIGATING HIS WAY AROUND SCRIPTS AND 
MOGULS, DAVID KOEPP IS ON THE A-LIST WITH 'PAPER,' 'CARLITO'S' AND 'JURASSIC.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Koepp, co-author of Ron Howard's "The Paper," is an industry anomaly: a 
happy screenwriter. In a town that routinely relegates scripts to development 
hell, seven of those he has written or co-written have surfaced on the big 
screen in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm incredibly spoiled," admits the Wisconsinite, whose squeaky-clean look 
and self-deprecating air set him apart from many Hollywood hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real challenge will be the next five years when none of my scripts get 
made. Though I work hard, I've been lucky. My movies have been done by 
filmmakers with a lot of clout -- guys who could say, 'I've got a piece of 
origami I'd like to turn into a film' and the project would get a 'go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Paper," a newspaper comedy/drama starring Michael Keaton and Glenn Close, 
which opened in Los Angeles last Friday, follows on the heels of "Carlito's 
Way," which Koepp adapted for Brian De Palma. Before that, Koepp had a shared 
credit on Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" -- which surpassed "E.T." to 
become the highest-grossing film of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with Universal preparing for a July release of "The Shadow," his 
big-screen portrayal of the mysterious vigilante, the 30-year-old Koepp is 
perched at the top of Hollywood's A-list. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's not the hottest screenwriter in town, David is certainly up there," 
says Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group for whom Koepp also 
co-wrote "Death Becomes Her." 
</P>
<P>
 "Though he's no Ben Hecht or Herman Mankiewicz, he is smart and 
untemperamental. David has earned the respect of some top directors who are 
opinionated to a greater or lesser degree because he consistently delivers the 
goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp's success comes as little surprise to his brother, Stephen, 37, a Time 
magazine editor with whom he wrote "The Paper." As a child, he says, things 
came readily to David, whose easy way with people masks a fierce 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always have to find my way through a maze -- doing research, coming up 
with alternatives -- while David would leap right over it," Stephen says. "He 
doesn't bother with the extraneous. What's also unusual is that both sides of 
his brain work. David not only comes up with incredible turns of phrase and 
dialogue but also has a great mind for structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp grew up in Pewaukee, Wis. (pop. 3,000), the youngest of four children. 
Dad has a billboard company. Mom is a nurse-turned-family therapist. Grandpa 
was mayor of the town. After a year at college in Minnesota, Koepp transferred 
to the University of Wisconsin with the intent of becoming an actor. On the 
advice of a professor impressed with his screenwriting skills, he enrolled in 
UCLA Film School in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp's first cinematic outing was "Apartment Zero," an Argentinian drama 
co-written with his brother-in-law, Martin Donovan. Universal Pictures 
expressed interest in his follow-up effort, the 1990 yuppie thriller "Bad 
Influence" -- provided he rewrite it as a comedy. Koepp bucked the suggestion 
and turned to Trans World Entertainment instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was broke, so walking away from the one studio that wanted the movie wasn't 
easy," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed with his resolve, Universal signed Koepp to an exclusive multiyear 
deal that expired last July -- and he's been working overtime ever since. The 
1992 black comedy "Death Becomes Her," starring Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, 
transformed him, in the eyes of Hollywood, from a writer of quirky thrillers 
into, as he puts it, "a big movie guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall's "Carlito's Way" brought him together with producer Martin Bregman 
("Dog Day Afternoon"), who became a friend and mentor. And his adaptation of 
Michael Crichton's "Jurassic Park" without question changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more comfortable insisting on things than I did before and, though I 
haven't cut any deals since 'Jurassic' came out, I assume my quote will go up," 
says Koepp, who was reportedly in the $1-million-a-script league even before 
that movie's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp's mandate on "Jurassic" was to flesh out the book's characters -- a 
challenge he's not sure he met. "There are some nice moments, but I wish I'd 
done better," he says. "Providing a filmic structure was a major challenge. But 
it was the genius of Crichton's idea -- his ability to make it all believable 
-- that carries the story." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, that didn't stop Koepp from filing for sole 
screenwriting credit -- against the advice of Spielberg and Universal. Though 
dislodging Crichton, who'd written the initial drafts, was a no-win 
proposition, he took the matter to arbitration, which awarded a shared credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp is known as a full-service writer, willing to go back to the drawing 
board again and again. On "Carlito," he turned in 15 drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect a director to be slavishly faithful to my vision," Koepp says. 
"Screenwriting is not like writing a novel. If an idea really turns a 
director's crank, you'd be well-advised to follow it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a string of adaptations, "The Paper" gave Koepp a chance to tackle a 
theme of his own: the difficulty of finding a balance between life and work. 
It's an issue that concerns him more these days, since Rosario Varela -- his 
wife and creative sounding board -- just gave birth to their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a newspaper movie like 'Front Page,' but a workplace drama about 
the toll jobs take," he says. "I feel like I've been under water for two years. 
Still, this is a very 'uptown' problem. It would be awfully ugly to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp has not taken on any outside work for the past six months, preferring to 
concentrate on a spec script titled "The Trigger Effect." One precondition of 
the sale is the opportunity to direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ride in a car your whole life, you get curious about driving," he 
explains. "And working with all those pros . . . you couldn't ask for a better 
film school." 
</P>
<P>
 Koepp admits that he's more "Hollywood" these days -- that "in spite of 
yourself, you pick stuff up." Like a car phone, for instance, which he'd 
resisted for years. Quite a contrast to the days he drove a battered Toyota. Or 
to his first 18 months in this town when he actually relied on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing something as singular and amazing as 'Jurassic' puts you under a harsh 
spotlight," observes brother Stephen. "I'm seeing two Davids: One is still 
open, almost innocent, with family and friends. The other, who takes lunch with 
moguls, is justifiably more wary since he's dealing with people who are cunning 
and shrewd. 
</P>
<P>
 "David has proven to be very adaptable," his brother concludes. "Though I used 
to tease him mercilessly, I can't afford to anymore."

VOCALIST AND PIANIST BREAK THE ICE TO COMPATIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A successful marriage between a singer and his accompanist is nearly as rare 
as a couple that's made it to their 50th wedding anniversary. Still, the 
courting can make for a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the earth didn't exactly move Sunday at Spaghettini when vocalist 
Maurice Davis was joined by pianist Bill Cunliffe, at least there were some 
sparks. It was the first time the veteran saloon singer and the busy 
keyboardist had teamed, and their first set sometimes had the uncomfortable 
feel of a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that both men aren't expert in their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has been singing since the '60s, first in Portland, later in San 
Francisco, where he was the house vocalist at the Half-Note (the same club that 
spawned Al Jarreau) and most recently on the club and lounge circuit in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe, who won the first Thelonious Monk International Piano competition 
some six years ago, backs an array of Southern California-based singers, as 
well as leading his own electric and acoustic jazz bands. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting their styles to mesh took some time. Davis has a swinging, 
straight-ahead delivery that needs little embellishment. Cunliffe's approach is 
densely detailed. When the two finally found common ground, it made for a very 
cozy fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lack of familiarity with each other didn't, however, result in a display 
of excessive caution. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis opened by calling for "On a Clear Day," and Cunliffe responded with a 
dancing, boogie-woogie tinged backdrop. Then, before the tune was finished, the 
singer indicated a change, and the two moved into "More." Spontaneously 
creating a medley like this on the first number took some nerve. Or maybe Davis 
just wanted to put his accomplice through the paces. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the two songs fell together quite nicely. From there, the 
pair went on to Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Quiet Nights," a mid-tempo bossa nova 
that Davis' husky tones turned into an exercise in intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the program went on, it was apparent that the singer's greatest strength, 
like that other respected saloon crooner, Frank Sinatra, is his phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The words of a lyric fall just so in his delivery, which emphasizes rhythm and 
utilizes open space to build dynamic tension. His voice has a bit of deep, 
throaty purr reminiscent of Lou Rawls that's especially effective on ballads, 
and his ability to swing kept the program of standards sailing right along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe seemed unable to match the vocalist's relaxed lead, constructing 
detailed progressions rather than letting the song flow. He also seemed locked 
into a back-and-forth, stride style pacing, rather than the rhythmic swing that 
Davis tried to initiate with finger snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this may have been due to the off-key Spaghettini piano, whose 
pitch quirks gave his playing a honky-tonk feel (the management would be wise 
to invest in a piano tuner). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Cunliffe's improvisations were marvels, twisting here and 
there, constructed on surprising combinations of notes and suggestive blues 
touches. His solo during "Summertime" was especially invigorating, with all the 
steamy airs that the tune carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the two began to click. Cunliffe gave Davis the space to operate 
on the touching ballad "Why Did I Choose You?" which the singer dedicated to 
his wife. The two found a suitable cadence on the more upbeat "All Right With 
Me" and "I Won't Cry Anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they closed the set with "Teach Me Tonight," the two had learned a 
lot from each other. When they next work together, no doubt they can begin a 
serious relationship -- now that they're finished with the preliminaries.

JAZZ REVIEWS; OUT OF THE ROUGH AND INTO THE CLEAR; OUTDOOR LAGUNA MARKET AN 
IDYLLIC SETTING FOR GERARD HAGEN TO SHOW HE'S BECOME A SMOOTH IMPROVISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerard Hagen has been doing his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago when he was playing with sax man Dan St. Marseilles' quintet, 
the Lake Forest resident was a promising jazz pianist whose playing had some 
rough edges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, on the outdoor stage at Laguna Village Market, Hagen worked with a 
trio and showed that most of those edges have been sanded smooth. That means 
he's now a spiffier, more complete improviser, and a better musician in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting for Hagen's afternoon performance was idyllic. The market -- a 
rustic assemblage of shops and a restaurant nestled in a grove of protective 
eucalyptuses -- is situated 100 feet above the Pacific Ocean on Coast Highway, 
just east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's bandstand, a white, wooden hexagonal-shaped affair, is parked on 
a grassy plot, below the market's bricked patio. Add ocean breezes and a mostly 
cloudless sky and you have a delightful atmosphere in which to hear music. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen seemed to prosper here, despite playing a rather limited-sounding Roland 
U-20 portable synthesizer; it ranged from attractive bell-like tones to 
complaining, whiny notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader was solidly surrounded by upright bassist Chris Colangelo and 
drummer Dick Weller -- two very empathetic partners -- and together, for the 
final set, the threesome explored a program of jazz classics, pop standards and 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Shorter's prancing "Children of the Night," first recorded by Art 
Blakey's Jazz Messengers on the superb 1961 "Mosaic" album, was a challenging 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 A difficult tune that Hagen and company made appear easy, "Children" swayed 
between a tension-building section, underpinned by Colangelo's fat bass sound 
that offered a repetitive figure, and a "release," where the tune goes to 
surging swing time and the music flows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen, his gray locks wafting in the wind as he bent his head sideways over 
his instrument, soloed deftly, his lines moving gracefully in and out of the 
composition's subtle corners. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his phrases with punchy thoughts, expanded those initial ideas by 
rhythmically and melodically juxtaposing them -- turning them this way, then 
that to create an energized stream of sound. These statements were always 
concluded cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 The keyboardist's accompaniment was just so. Colangelo's pliant-toned lines 
formed a buttress to the Hagen's improvisation, and Weller provided light 
cymbal taps and effervescent drum accents, giving Hagen firm but very elastic 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Children," Colangelo offered one of several excellent solos. He worked in 
the upper range of his instrument, his perfectly picked notes coming in neat 
packages that were rhythmically on the money, and that used space as a primary 
element. 
</P>
<P>
 He favored small, chunky groupings -- three descending notes, a similar idea 
but starting a tone lower, perhaps followed by a five-note line that ascended 
in a rush. The bassist then tied these strands together into a greater fabric, 
and occasionally would unleash a long, serpentine-like fragment for contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a like precise-yet-exploratory mood to the trio's other numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadd Dameron's timeless ballad, "If You Could See Me Now," found Hagen 
delivering the melody, as Colangelo's bass and Weller's sandpapery strokes on 
brushes created a backdrop as comfy as an easy chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen's "Far Horizon" was a tasteful bossa nova, and here the composer offered 
soft chords along with lines that leaped, and Colangelo dropped in another 
first-rate improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful Love" was but one tune where Weller revealed his assured skills as 
a soloist, here trading eight-bar phrases with his colleagues. He approached 
the drum set musically, starting with whirring taps of the cymbals and 
gradually incorporating whaps and slaps at his drums which, pleasingly, had a 
singing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Sufficient employment seems to be the only thing Hagen's group is lacking. The 
band, which usually features ace young trumpeter Kye Palmer, returns to the 
same site on May 15.

MUSIC REVIEW; VIRTUOSE BALANCES DELICATE VOICES AND TECHNIQUE; THE DISCIPLINED, 
ELITE CHOIR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO GIRLS CHORUS DELIVERS LIGHT CLARITY AND HUSHED 
REFINEMENT IN LONG BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Delicate fluidity distinguished the concert presented by the elite choir of 
the San Francisco Girls Chorus -- called Virtuose -- Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Singing before a far-from-capacity audience in the 1,100-seat Carpenter 
Performing Arts Center at Cal State Long Beach, the 17-member group shone 
during quiet works by Monteverdi and Canadian composer Healey Willan, which 
require sustained, seamless phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps due to training intended to protect young voices, the girls -- who 
range in age from 16 to 20 -- mustered little power. Still, artistic director 
Sharon J. Paul exploited the strengths of her Virtuose in crisp, precisely 
synchronized rhythms -- as in Orazio Vecchi's "Fammi una Canzonetta 
Capricciosa" or Egil Hovland's "Laudate Dominum" -- and in neatly etched 
polyphony, as in Kodaly's gentle "Ave Maria." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of transparent textures was augmented in part by the group's thin, 
reedy tone quality, itself exacerbated by acoustics of the hall; depending on 
specific location, much of the sound missed the front few rows, though without 
sacrificing the unforced clarity that characterized the choir's style. A shift 
to more central seating further back corrected the added problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, the soprano of Elizabeth Wilson Rood exemplified the light 
clarity of the ensemble as a whole, while bringing sensitive grace to her solo 
during the spiritual "There Is a Balm in Gilead," arranged by William L. 
Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hushed refinement did not always suit the task at hand, however. Only 
accompanist Dwight Okamura -- who also arranged two of the selections on the 
program -- appeared to capture the freedom inherent in Kirby Shaw's adaptation 
of "Puttin' on the Ritz," by Irving Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, having established themselves as a disciplined chorus -- always 
performing by memory, hands held at their sides, foreign texts well-enunciated 
-- attempts at cute staging sometimes lent an unwelcome element of 
artificiality. Joseph Haas' "Kommt, lasst uns allesamt" offers enough joyful 
repartee in its score without the singers assembling around the piano to affect 
pseudo-informality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, appropriate staging, as for Irving Fine's two sparkling choruses 
on texts from "Alice in Wonderland" -- "The Lobster Quadrille" and "Father 
William" -- added to the effectiveness of the works.

L.A. NATIVE LEONARD SLATKIN TO LEAD NATIONAL SYMPHONY; MUSIC: THE MUSIC 
DIRECTOR OF THE ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY WILL SUCCEED MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH IN THE 
FALL OF 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the year he turns 50, says Leonard Slatkin, "so many things are changing." 
</P>
<P>
 As announced last month, the Los Angeles-born conductor, music director of the 
St. Louis Symphony since 1979, will leave that post at the end of the 1995-96 
season. Two months down the road, Slatkin reports, he and his third wife, 
Linda, are expecting his first child in May. 
</P>
<P>
 And Monday, as had been rumored, Slatkin was named music director-designate of 
the National Symphony in Washington, succeeding Mstislav Rostropovich, and only 
the fifth conductor to lead the ensemble in its 63-year history. His tenure 
begins in the fall of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor was quick to assert that there was no connection between his 
leaving St. Louis after a 26-year relationship with that orchestra -- where he 
began as an assistant conductor -- and his accepting the National Symphony 
post. In fact, as he said in remarks at a Kennedy Center press conference 
Monday, when he decided to leave the Missouri job, "I very seriously considered 
accepting no position for a few seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the die is cast. Slatkin will conduct a total of eight weeks of concerts 
in Washington in the next two seasons, as he winds down his St. Louis Symphony 
days, in the city where his father, violinist and conductor Felix Slatkin, grew 
up and was once assistant concertmaster of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin fils will continue to lead the Blossom Music Festival, summer home of 
the Cleveland Orchestra, and "probably" conduct one operatic production -- at 
the Metropolitan Opera or in Chicago or Europe -- per season. He takes with him 
to Washington his exclusive recording contract with BMG/RCA and confirmed, in a 
phone interview Monday afternoon, that RCA will indeed record the National 
Symphony under his direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin, 49, continues to champion the works of living, as well as past, 
American musicians. For instance, the St. Louis ensemble has, perhaps 
single-handedly, put the works of Joan Tower on the musical map. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there other U.S. composers he wants to bring to our attention? He 
mentions, among others, Michael Daugherty, whose works he will be conducting in 
the remainder of the present St. Louis season. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin grew up in Los Angeles, attended both Indiana University and the 
Juilliard School in New York, and became an assistant to his mentor, Walter 
Susskind, at the St. Louis Symphony in 1968. Through a succession of titles, he 
finally became, in 1979, music director. With this orchestra and others, 
Slatkin has been nominated for 50 Grammys and has won three.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'D2' SCORES IN ITS OPENING WEEKEND

 In autumn, 1992, Walt Disney Pictures scored a box-office surprise with its 
ice hockey comedy, "The Mighty Ducks," which seemed to come from nowhere and 
ended up grossing $50.7 million. The Disney people then spun off the name for 
an Orange County-based ice hockey team and have now whipped up "D2 The Mighty 
Ducks," again starring Emilio Estevez.The family film opened Friday and led the 
weekend box office just as schools began letting out for spring break. The 
beginning of spring vacations and some residual publicity heat off last week's 
Oscars kept the nation's box office active. Box-office grosses were 27% ahead 
of last year's post-Academy Awards weekend. The year to date is running 9% 
ahead of 1993. 04,28,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie (Studio)

APE'S MAIN SQUEEZE ENDURES; MOVIES: 61 YEARS LATER, FAY WRAY IS MOST REMEMBERED 
FOR 'KING KONG' ROLE. THE CLASSIC KICKED OFF AN AFI SALUTE TO HOLLYWOOD'S 
GOLDEN AGE IN WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RITA KEMPLEY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to see why King Kong fell for Fay Wray. Sixty-one years after the 
film's premiere, she's still a scrumptious, albeit slightly hard of hearing, 
little dumpling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her life's accomplishments include 77 feature films, three marriages, 
two kids, an autobiography and a couple of plays, she'll always be remembered 
as the lovesick gorilla's main squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she resent it? Not one bit: "There were 500 films coming out each year in 
the '30s, so to be in one of perennial interest is kind of lovable. I'm liking 
it better now than I did at the beginning, when it seemed to me that it was not 
Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 It was this most beloved of all monster movies that recently brought the 
pixilated 86-year-old to Washington, where the 1933 classic opened a monthlong 
salute to Hollywood's Golden Age at the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 5,528 entries in AFI's new "Catalog of Feature Films 1931-1940," "King 
Kong" gets three pages and seven columns of teeny type that offer not only a 
complete cast list, but the names of Wray's and co-star Jack Armstrong's stunt 
doubles; not just the running time, but how many feet of film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a jolly good catalogue," opines Wray, who reveals therein that she was 
paid $10,000 for her 10-week stint -- pretty good money for the Great 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about the decade was that it started out like an 
invalid," Wray says. "The (movie) business was in real trouble. 'King Kong' was 
such an immediate attraction that it really saved RKO, which was on the edge of 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wray was surprised by the public and critical reaction -- reviewers said she 
was brilliant. "I wanted to put my hands over my ears -- there was too much of 
me screaming. . . . I yelled every time they said, 'Yell.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before the film was edited, she also went into a sound studio, where she 
recorded a series of shrieks and moans that, as the AFI catalogue notes, were 
used in other RKO pictures into the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray "could scream beautifully," as film writer Anthony Ambrogio observed, 
"and the scream was a necessary ingredient of the emerging horror film." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was the screaming or the blond wig -- Wray remains a redhead in 
real life -- Kong went after her as if she were wearing banana perfume. Wray 
pooh-poohs the notion that she was the horror genre's first sex symbol: "I was 
not just a body, it seems to me. I had some more delicate thing about me. I was 
a proper little person. I think it made a difference to that film, I do." 
</P>
<P>
 She has clearly given this considerable thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just was attracted to a creature he had never seen before. Maybe he had 
never seen a blonde. She was like a flower, I felt, that he was fascinated 
with. I think that I had some quality that made this great animal think a 
little bit. When we see him on top of the Empire State Building, he becomes 
something more than a great ape. He becomes an individual of sensitivity. When 
it comes to the last scene, I still feel sorry for him. And that's kind of 
miraculous."

 Wray turns her attention to the menu. "I'm glued to the swordfish," she says, 
"because it comes with celery root." It is a favorite of hers, a fondness she 
shared with her late third husband, Sandy Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg was the brain surgeon of her late second husband, Robert Riskin, 
the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of "It Happened One Night," "Mr. Deeds 
Goes to Town" and "Lost Horizon." All three were directed by Frank Capra and 
are among the films featured in the AFI retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray credits her second husband with giving actresses something to say for a 
change. "I think women began to be interesting when Robert Riskin allowed them 
to have humor," she says. "He was just about the first one who did, because up 
to that point a man and a woman had romance but the comic relief came from 
another source. Then suddenly two people were saying amusing things. And that 
was his style." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also nostalgic for the days before women became empowered. In her era, 
she says, "they suffered better than they do today. Now they're trying not to 
suffer anymore. They tell people off and run the show. It's just not as 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wray lives in a Los Angeles high-rise on what was the 20th Century Fox back 
lot. It overlooks the spot where she made "Shanghai Madness" with Spencer 
Tracy, one of 11 films she made in 1933. But she has no formal ties to the film 
industry today -- her last theatrical release was "Dragstrip Riot" in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent her early years in Canada but made her way to California with her 
mother and became an extra in silent Westerns when she was only 14. "They were 
shorts, mostly two-reelers, but I got as high as a five-reeler once, with Hoot 
Gibson. He was almost like a somnambulist -- he just kind of floated through." 
</P>
<P>
 She had a similar reaction to Gary Cooper, her co-star in "Legion of the 
Condemned" in 1928. "Well, Gary -- hmmm, he slept a lot. It seemed to me every 
time he sat down in a chair he would just let himself flop. He didn't talk 
much, but he had that wonderful, wonderful face. The most photogenic face ever 
on a male, I think. He was really beautiful, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 But preferring awake to handsome, she became involved with the screenwriter, 
John Saunders. Her marriage to the paranoid and melancholy Saunders ended when 
she woke from a nap to find him withdrawing a hypodermic needle from her 
buttock. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In her autobiography, "On the Other Hand," she describes Saunders as "a 
shadowy figure between me and what I hoped would be the fullness of working and 
growing as an actress." Saunders committed suicide in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray made her stage-acting debut in her first husband's 1931 play, "Nikki on 
Broadway." "It had a wonderful leading man, and his name turned out to be Cary 
Grant. He had beautiful manners, great charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very compelling personality, and I was so pleased that when that 
show closed after six weeks, he too was going back to Hollywood. And when my 
friend Merian Cooper (the co-director of "King Kong") told me, 'You're going to 
have the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood,' I thought, 'Oh, it must be 
Cary Grant.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later she found out that she would be undressed, tickled and sniffed by a 
50-foot gorilla -- a behemoth who perishes in an effort to save his beloved 
from a phalanx of photographers armed only with flashbulbs.

 Death in Bophuthatswana -- The caption of two Page A1 photographs in editions 
of March 12 showing members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement before and 
after they were killed in Bophuthatswana wrongly described one of the men as 
begging for his life. The man was shown with his arms raised in surrender, but 
Times staff writer Bob Drogin, who was present, says the man did not beg. The 
erroneous information was provided along with the photograph by the Reuters 
news agency.
